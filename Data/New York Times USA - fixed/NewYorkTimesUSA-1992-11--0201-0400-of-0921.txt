 BODY:
This has been the week of "Beauty and the Beast" in video stores. Disney reports that seven million copies of the tape were sold in its first six days on the shelves. While distributors and dealers can't confirm that figure, many say "Beauty and the Beast" is the fastest-selling title ever.
Now comes another animated film on tape, also associated with Disney, that is distinctive for another reason. Next week Lightyear Entertainment will release "The Snow Queen," the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The 30-minute tape, which is narrated by Sigourney Weaver, is part of the "Stories to Remember" series of children's animated films. On Nov. 14 it will be shown on the Disney Channel. 
 "The Snow Queen" was animated at the Klassika studio in Moscow. Joshua Greene, the producer of "Stories to Remember," said it was the first children's video to be made in Russia for distribution in the United States. Mr. Greene said he chose Klassika because of a distinguished tradition of Soviet animation that dates to the 30's when Russian animators were trained by Disney. He also said he had gone to Moscow to make the film as economically as possible.
At first, Mr. Greene said, there was friction. Klassika's animators were just starting out on their own, he said. "They were desperate to start a studio and we were their only channel to a source of dollars. They didn't know whether we'd try to exploit that."
The Russians had virtually no equipment, so Mr. Greene and his American associates donated crates of materials, from pencils and paints to an animation camera. "It helped to show that we were willing to put something back," Mr. Greene said.
But interpretation of "The Snow Queen," the subject of a famous Soviet animated film of the 40's, presented philosophical problems. The story involves a boy abducted and held prisoner in an icy land and the girl who survives many perils to free him. In the American way of storytelling, everything works out.
"The Russian perspective is starker than what Americans are accustomed to," Mr. Greene said. "They have a bleaker view of fairy tales. It's more reality than fantasy. I'm not sure they were comfortable with everything coming out happy."
With the film to appear on the Disney Channel, softer characterizations were agreed upon. "The Russians like their children earthy, not as prosperous or as innocent," Mr. Greene said. Again the American view prevailed and the characters remain robust and their attitudes steadfastly upbeat.
On other matters, however, the Russian view won out. For instance, pursuing wolves were fiercer than fuzzier American versions.
With results acceptable to both parties, a second collaboration -- "The Wild Swans" -- is under way. "The Snow Queen" is $12.98. Information: (800) 229-7867.
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES
 
Sister Act
1992. Touchstone. $19.99. 1:40. CC. PG.
In a none-too-original turn of events, a lounge singer (Whoopi Goldberg) crosses a vengeful gangster (Harvey Keitel) and hides out in a convent disguised as a nun. There, she takes charge of the choir, a sort of ecclesiastical dirty dozen. There's the plump, perky nun, the shy nun, the gruff but nice nun. As the black nun, Ms. Goldberg warms to her chores and soon the group is singing so well they charm the Pope, get on some magazine covers and look solid for a string of performance gigs in a film that, Janet Maslin wrote in The Times, is full of "cute, synthetic uplift."
 
Uranus
1992. HBO. $89.99. 1:40. French with English subtitles. R.
In Claude Berri's film, a French village copes with its behavior during the Nazi occupation. A collaborator on the run (Gerard Desarthe) takes refuge in the house of Archambaud (Jean-Pierre Marielle Gaigneux), a philosophical fellow who regards his actions with tolerance. Mr. Berri ("Jean de Florette" and "Manon of the Spring") takes a neutral stance to ask whether collaborators are worthy of forgiveness and how guilty are passive observers who ignore or rationalize whatever they witnessed. Gerard Depardieu, as a bombastic barkeeper, and Philippe Noiret, as a boarder with recurring nightmares involving the planet Uranus, are but two of many characters in a "bleak examination of human nature, which survives any way it can" (Caryn James).
 
Prospero's Books
1991. Fox. $89.98. 2:09. R.
John Gielgud portrays the old duke exiled with his books in Shakespeare's elegiacal last play, "The Tempest." From there Peter Greenaway's film takes apart the original to examine the worlds and creatures in the duke's prized volumes. While rich and fascinating to a point, the sheer range of Mr. Greenaway's imagination and enthusiasms overwhelms the confines of the film and inundates the viewer with a wild and confusing tangle of images that becomes "too much for mortal eye and ear" (Vincent Canby).
 
The Donner Party
1992. Direct Cinema, (800) 933-7991. $39.95. 1:26. No rating.
Trapped for months by 22 feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada during the winter of 1846-47, a group of settlers resorted to cannibalism to survive. Ric Burns's film, which was broadcast on "The American Experience" on PBS last week, uses archival material in the same way he and his brother Ken did in their acclaimed documentary "The Civil War." With old photographs and the effective use of music and scenic stills setting a chilling tone, a famous American story unfolds in a measured, unsparing account, deepened by "eloquent and well-delivered passages from diaries and the thoughtful observations of historians" (Walter Goodman).

Do Early Birds Catch a Pink Slip?

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
Bob Quinn struck early last year and see where it got him -- unemployed.
Quinn, general manager of the Cincinnati Reds at the time, didn't wait for the annual winter meetings to make deals that he saw as critical in shoring up the weaknesses that wrecked the team's chances of successfully defending their 1990 World Series championship. 
 In the latter half of November, the Reds acquired Greg Swindell from Cleveland and Tim Belcher from Los Angeles, giving them a solid starting pitching rotation. The Reds, however, encountered problems this year and did not win their division championship. Marge Schott, the owner, designated Quinn as the scapegoat and fired him.
Quinn's downfall does not mean that Al Harazin and Gene Michael have jeopardized their jobs. Actually, with George Steinbrenner on the way back, Michael doesn't have to do anything to lose his job; Steinbrenner doesn't need a reason to fire his employees.
Michael is the Yankees' general manager, Harazin the Mets' general manager. Conversation about the exciting last game of the World Series had hardly died down when they each made a trade.
Harazin took advantage of the San Diego Padres' fire sale and plucked Tony Fernandez to be the Mets' shortstop. Michael knew the Yankees needed a left-handed power hitter and took advantage of the bad season Paul O'Neill had with the Reds to bring him to Yankee Stadium.
The Mets' trade raised questions among the usual skeptics about Fernandez's physical condition. Something had to be wrong with him for the Padres to give him away for Wally Whitehurst and D. J. Dozier. Skeptics, though, are too busy finding fault to see the obvious.
Joe McIlvaine, the Padres' general manager, is under orders to reduce the Padres' payroll. Shedding Fernandez's $2.3 million salary was the easiest first step, though a painful one considering the shortstop's talent. McIlvaine actually did his old team a favor by letting them have Fernandez. Considering that he knew he wouldn't get much in return, McIlvaine could just as easily have traded him elsewhere.
The Yankees' acquisition of O'Neill has raised questions, too. Why, the skeptics ask, would the Yankees trade Roberto Kelly for a player who batted .246, hit 14 home runs and drove in 66 runs? The point is, if O'Neill had hit 28 home runs and driven in 91 runs, as he did the year before, the Reds never would have considered trading him.
The Yankees are counting on a strong comeback from O'Neill, who in a bizarre twist could wind up feeling less harassed with the Yankees than he was with the Reds. This, of course, is before he encounters Steinbrenner for the first time.
According to a friend of O'Neill's, the outfielder felt intimidated by his manager, Lou Piniella, who often worked with him on his hitting. Piniella is a fanatic on hitting and always has been. When he played for the Yankees, he once stood at home plate minutes before opening-day ceremonies, holding an imaginary bat and swinging at imaginary pitches.
Piniella, who left the Reds after this season, is a great believer in the mechanics of hitting, and he believes that the more a player works on his mechanics, the more natural his weight shift and swing become.
But Piniella apparently did not connect with O'Neill, and at least some of O'Neill's drop-off could be attributed to the pressure the player felt from the manager. Sometimes, his friend said, when O'Neill returned to the dugout after making an out, he went to the opposite end from where Piniella was because he didn't want to listen to the manager tell him what he had done wrong.
O'Neill could hear plenty of that from Steinbrenner, but at least it won't be in the dugout.
The Yankees, meanwhile, would like the O'Neill trade to be an omen reminiscent of 1979. Just days after Michael became the club's general manager the first time, the Yankees made two trades on Nov. 1.
To replace Thurman Munson, who was killed when his plane crashed the previous August, they got Rick Cerone from Toronto in a six-player trade in which Chris Chambliss went to the Blue Jays. They also acquired Tom Underwood in the deal. The same day they obtained center fielder Ruppert Jones from Seattle in another six-player trade.
A week later, they signed Bob Watson and Rudy May as free agents.
In 1980, Watson led the Yankees in hitting with a .307 average and was third in runs batted in with 68. Cerone batted .277 and knocked in 85 runs, second to Reggie Jackson's 111 r.b.i. May compiled a 15-5 record, Underwood 13-9, giving the Yankees four pitchers with 13 or more victories.
They did not do as well with Jones, who was limited to 83 games because of physical ailments. But they won 103 games and the division championship, the last full-season division championship they won.
The Yankees aren't in position to make that much out of the trade for O'Neill, but maybe it's a start.

Backer Spielvogel's Heir Apparent

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin

 BODY:
After intense speculation, Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide made clear who is most likely to succeed Carl Spielvogel as chairman and chief executive. The agency yesterday named Michael Bungey president and to the new post of chief operating officer, effective Jan. 1.
Mr. Bungey, 52 years old, is currently chairman and chief executive of BSB Dorland and chairman of BSB Europe, based in London. He will succeed William M. Backer, 66, as president. Mr. Backer was named vice chairman and retains the position of worldwide executive creative director. Successors for both of Mr. Bungey's positions will be named by the end of the year. 
In an interview, Mr. Spielvogel put an end to the long guessing game. Mr. Bungey, he said, "is positioned in the line of succession," adding, "A final decision will be made in the latter part of 1993." Mr. Spielvogel, 63, said he would remain chairman and chief executive of the $5 billion agency until the end of 1993 and serve as chairman through 1994.
Mr. Bungey was one of three executives believed in the running to head the agency's 167 offices in 50 countries. The others were Kenneth R. Rogers, 46, chairman and chief executive of Backer Spielvogel Inc. and chairman of the Americas region based in New York, and Alex Hamill, 53, chairman and chief executive of George Patterson Pty., and chairman of the Asia-Pacific region, based in Sydney, Australia.
As has the the rest of the industry, Backer Spielvogel has been hit hard by the recession. Over the years the agency has lost $230 million from accounts like Dole, Fisher-Price and Miller Lite.

HEADLINE: As for All That Lore About Foolproof Predictors, '92 Made It Look Foolish

 BODY:
Like shamanism and advanced medicine, election lore and modern polling have been matching their predictive powers against each other for decades. On Tuesday night, the competition ended. It was a rout.
The infallible New Hampshire primary rule failed. The prophetic Weekly Reader survey yielded an incorrect prophecy. And the voters of Crook County, Ore., who had picked the winning Presidential candidate for the last 27 elections, this time chose the loser. 
 "It's over," the Crook County deputy clerk, Evelyn Adams, said, declaring the county's winning streak finished with a low chuckle.
So eager are Americans to find out who the next President is going to be that hardly anyone wants to wait any more to see how the actual vote comes out. Indeed, there is almost no limit to the auguries used to determine the outcome of the election before it takes place. There are astrology charts, economic indicators and bellwether counties. There is the Beaujoulais harvest rule, the World Series rule and the left-handed incumbent rule.
When, on the basis of the public opinion polls, political analysts called 1992 an unpredictable year, they didn't know the half of it, it seems.
 
Stars Go Blank for Dixon
 Jeane Dixon, the syndicated astrologer, once could boast a flawless record prophecizing the next President. Then, over the summer, she said that the stars pointed definitively to George Bush.
Joyce Jillson, another well-known astrologer, also got her planets crossed. Starting Oct. 11, the date of the first Presidential debate, the heavens, she said, "almost cinch it for President Bush."
Closer to earth, Ray C. Fair, a professor of economics at Yale University, developed a formula that uses the inflation rate, the per capita growth rate and an assortment of constants to predict the Presidency. Before Tuesday, it had come up with the winner in 16 out of the last 19 elections. The only times it had missed--1960, 1968 and 1976--were in extremely close races.
This year, Mr. Fair's model predicted that President-elect Bill Clinton would be defeated in a landslide.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Fair said that perhaps the model could be adjusted in a way that would preserve its utility. Or perhaps, he conceded, "You just have to dump it."
Ever since the current primary system came into being in 1952, no President has been elected who did not first win the New Hampshire primary. No President, that is, except Mr. Clinton, who came in second in New Hampshire, behind former Senator Paul E. Tsongas.
Similarly, until Tuesday, no Democratic candidate had ever won the Presidency without carrying Texas. Mr. Clinton lost the state to President Bush, 40 percent to 37 percent, with 22 percent of the vote going to Ross Perot.
 
Best Lesson Is Failure
 "The big lesson here," said Tom Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, "may be don't use the old lessons."
Two decades ago, there were half a dozen counties across the country that, through some uncanny link to the national political psyche, had perfect Presidential voting records. By 1988, there was only one such county left, Crook County, which chose the winner in every Presidential election since it was founded. Now there are none.
"This blew it right out of the water, Ms. Adams, the county's deputy clerk, said. The final tally for the county was: 2,702 votes for Mr. Bush, 2,509 for Mr. Clinton and 2,001 for Mr. Perot.
Maybe it used to be the case that out of the mouth of babes came correct predictions. But in 1992, even this is no longer true.
Ever since 1956, the Weekly Reader, a magazine for children, has correctly predicted the President by polling its young audience. This year, the magazine's readers chose Mr. Bush over Mr. Clinton, 58 percent to 36 percent.
At one time, the outcome of World Series series also was a reliable indicator of who would win the White House: if the American League won, the Republican candidate would become President. But those days are definitely over. The American League rule proved a dud in 1980, 1988 and now again, less than a month after the Toronto Blue Jays won the series, in 1992.
Perhaps most disappointing of all is the collapse of the old rule: in vino veritas.
Michael Lewis-Beck, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa, noted that one of the lesser known rules of Presidential predicting is a poor Beaujoulais harvest augurs a Republican administration. Recently Mr. Lewis-Beck called some vintners in France to see whether the rule would survive. The grapes were calling the election for President Bush.
 
Settling for Near-Miss
 So what's left for 1996? According to Mr. Lewis-Beck, who wrote a book on forecasting elections, not much.
For those who are willing to settle for the near-miss, he offered Mexico, which has voted for the winning candidate in ever election except 1976. It did so again on Tuesday, giving Mr. Clinton 46 percent of its vote, to Mr. Bush's 38 percent.
Similarly, Palo Alto County, Iowa voted for the victorious candidate in every election from 1896 to 1980; it missed in 1984, but voted correctly in 1988 and again on Tuesday.
Mr. Lewis-Beck noted that there is one rule that has managed to survive completely intact, and that is that no left-handed President wins a second term. The rule worked for President James Garfield, President Gerald Ford and now President Bush.
It does not bode particularly well for President-elect Clinton, a southpaw.

HEADLINE: Ten Reasons to Feel Good

 BODY:
Beyond all the political facts and figures -- what Adm. James Stockdale derides as "all of the little stinky numbers" -- Tuesday's election evoked a whole web of feelings, reasons for satisfaction, and not just for Democrats.
The Lines. All those people huddled under umbrellas outside Manhattan precincts gave a reliable clue to remarkable voter turnout everywhere. About 104 million people voted, 55 percent of those eligible. According to Curtis Gans, a voting scholar, that's the highest rate in 20 years. 
 The Tube. Bashing TV for sins real or imagined is traditional Election Night sport. This year the four networks deserve unstinting praise for threading a careful path between sensationalism and censorship. None pronounced a Clinton victory until nearly 11 P.M., even though the authoritative exit polls from Voter Research & Surveys had indicated a landslide for hours. Television thus demonstrated respect for Western voters whose polls were still open -- a respect the Senate denies them by failing to enact uniform poll closing hours.
The Language. What a joy it was early yesterday to listen to victory statements from two candidates who think and talk in complete sentences. At that hour, many viewers surely wished there had been fewer sentences; even so, Bill Clinton and Al Gore evince a respect for language often dramatically missing in the locutions of President Bush and Vice President Quayle.
The Bozos. Something odd happens to Mr. Bush when he vaults into "campaign mode." His good manners fall away and he stands revealed as Nastyman. In 1988, that brought harsh exploitation of race and crime fears. This time it went from Red-baiting to juvenile expostulations like, "My dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than these two bozos." The bozos responded with dignity, pushing the dialogue back to national issues and facilitating conciliation now.
 The Demographics. In his last two years, Mr. Bush played politics with racial resentment. He used his plan for school choice, giving money to private and parochial schools, as a way to divide Catholics and blacks. He pushed and pulled his otherwise laudable North American Free Trade Agreement like a saw between labor and Mexican-Americans. Crafty tactics maybe, but poisonous leadership by President Slice-and-Dice. Governor Clinton promises to become President Unifier, a consummately welcome outcome for all Americans who have been made to feel excluded.
The Cities. It seems like a century ago that anyone in the White House understood or cared about the poorhouse burdens borne by the nation's cities. But now, listen to some of Bill Clinton's first words as President-elect: "This election is a clarion call for our country to face . . . problems too long ignored -- from AIDS to the environment to the conversion of our economy from a defense to a domestic economic giant."
 Women. Did it make sense for Vice President Quayle to pick a fight with a TV character about to become a single parent? Tuesday's exit polls offer a decisive answer. Voters generally favored Mr. Clinton by about 5 points; single parents -- mostly women -- favored him by 20 points. For many women, this was also an inspiring election for a long list of other reasons, starting with the names of four new women Senators.
Gridlock. In his first term, President Reagan could work with a Republican Senate and a House whose conservative "boll weevil" Democrats would occasionally tip big votes his way. But since Democrats regained the Senate in 1986, Washington has experienced divided government, often paralyzing needed legislation. Congress should remain a check on the executive branch; ours is not a parliamentary system. Nevertheless, the prospect of a President and Congress of the same party offers hope for accountable leadership.
Politics. The voters showed they want responsive government. President Bush has often provided prudent management and personal geniality but appears to like politics about as much as broccoli. That makes it all the more satisfying that the winners are men who know politics, like politics and are, demonstrably, good at politics.
Sportsmanship. After the campaign nastiness, President Bush Tuesday praised his opponent with straightforward good grace. Ross Perot did likewise, urging his surprisingly large legion to "Forget the election. . . . We must all work together." The most gracious of all was Vice President Quayle. He gave all Americans reason to feel good with his salute to Mr. Clinton: "If he runs the country as well as he ran his campaign, we'll be all right."

Who Gets What Jobs

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
While the world waits to hear who will be Bill Clinton's Secretary of State, the President-elect is thinking more about strategy than names.
His strategy will flow from two premises: 
 * For the first time since the 1930's, the appointment of the Secretary of the Treasury will be more important than the appointment of the Secretary of State, possibly even for foreign policy. Mr. Clinton knows his Presidency will effectively collapse in two years unless he quickly stimulates the economy and creates jobs without increasing the budget deficit.
* The chances of reaching this goal will be nil if he has to squander his days dodging inevitable Republican foreign policy bullets. Three seconds after Mr. Clinton's inauguration, George Bush will be attacking him for not getting rid of Saddam Hussein. Americans generally and world leaders particularly are anxious about Mr. Clinton's foreign policy inexperience. So he has to wall off the White House from such anxieties and Republican attacks.
All this argues powerfully for a national security team of moderates and conservatives, including Republicans.
It also calls for the most experienced hands. President Bush will leave his successor a world filled with time bombs ready to explode in the ex-Soviet Union, ex-Yugoslavia, the Persian Gulf and China. Any such calamity will drag Mr. Clinton into an international quagmire unless he can rely on his top advisers in a crisis.
Finding the right Secretary of State will be a problem. Five hundred Democrats fantasize about being the chief diplomat and believe they are already overqualified for the job. But Mr. Clinton will soon realize that no Democrat has the stature to fill that position and instantly reassure the world. The party has been out of power too long for world-class reputations to develop.
Some obvious and able candidates, for example, are Representative Lee Hamilton, former Vice President Walter Mondale and Warren Christopher, the number two at State under Jimmy Carter. But they may be seen as too liberal to provide sufficient conservative cover for the White House.
If so, Mr. Clinton will look next at moderate Democrats like Senator Bill Bradley. His standing is good with conservatives.
Or the President-elect could think even more widely and craftily and focus on Republicans -- like Senator Richard Lugar.
Defense should be easy. Representative Les Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn both have the necessary expertise and conservative backing.
The C.I.A. would be a natural home for someone like retired Adm. William Crowe, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents Reagan and Bush. Admiral Crowe has an undeniable political claim to a top position. His campaign endorsement gave Mr. Clinton critical protection from the right. The two Daves, Representative McCurdy and Senator Boren, also fit the bill.
The post of national security adviser should go to a skilled, moderate pragmatist. The leading candidate continues to be Tony Lake. He ran the foreign policy side of the campaign with Samuel (Sandy) Berger, a Washington attorney, and was head of State Department policy planning for Cyrus Vance. The Lake-Berger duo engineered the Clinton campaign strategy of reaching out to Reagan Democrats and neoconservatives. If it's not Tony Lake, the field will be wide open.
Selecting such a moderate-conservative team raises the question of what to do with loyal liberals. Mr. Clinton's answer should be obvious: Give them the "new agenda" issues like environment, energy, drugs, refugees, foreign aid and development. And center these activities in a new Economic Security Council and staff -- paralleling the N.S.C. staff -- which he recently proposed to mesh foreign and domestic economics.
Liberals would be in no position to cry foul. These are the very issues they have rightly been fighting to place at the core of world politics for the last 15 years.
Mr. Clinton has little direct familiarity with national security personalities. He will therefore rely heavily on Al Gore, who knows them all, and well. By record and instinct, the Vice President-elect will reinforce the push for a moderate-conservative team.
May the force be with these two young knights of bright countenance on their journey. With anxieties high, the honeymoon is almost over.

Losers, Not Weepers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With reporters on campaign beats covering the reception of returns in Houston and Little Rock; and with The New York Times's Washington editors up in New York putting together the election issue -- on Election Night the Times bureau here was like a morgue.
Seeking human political contact at a historic moment, I walked one block east to watch the returns in the office of Lane Kirkland of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. We differ on economics, agree on foreign affairs, but in this election we were curiously aligned: Lane was a Democrat supporting Clinton, I was a Republican opposing Bush. 
Labor's leader is an understanding soul. As the returns came in, neither he nor his other guests gave loud hoots of happiness at the Clinton victory. He tolerated my small whoop at the victories of Senators Al D'Amato and Arlen Specter. As one who had known 12 long years in the Presidential wilderness, he respected the feelings of a Republican watching his side lose -- and even more troubling, who had voted against his side.
I imagine a great many people on the right feel as I do today; not triumphant by any means, but not sorry to see the Bush people go. Twelve years is a long time for any group to be in power, and this bunch was beginning to turn Republicanism sour.
We do not buy the Democratic line about years of greed and jingoism; by and large, the 80's were years of prosperity and global success. But not lately.
The first term, with Reagan in charge, found greatness in stopping inflation and, yes, "winning the cold war." But the second Reagan-Bush term, with its dreamy morning-in-America theme, lost its fervor; the third term, with Bush presiding, lost its sense of direction.
We're not happy about the Clinton plurality (though Bob Dole, the new Republican top dog in Washington, must be secretly delighted). Instead, we have a sense that the White House had become occupied by occupants. They were not "exhausted volcanoes," in Disraeli's phrase about Gladstone, because they were never true volcanoes -- but they are exhausted.
The excuse for single-termhood is that the economy didn't recover in time. But that's just part of it.
Strategically, the Bush entourage missed history's boat in the Soviet Union and China, was engulfed by error in the gulf, and not until the last minute tried to make the case for a coherent conservative domestic policy.
Tactically, in the campaign, the tardy James Baker botched the convention by romancing the hard right. Then he blew the debate negotiations, preferring to appease Ross Perot and use him as a buffer -- rather than freeze the billionaire out and deal directly with the President's Democratic challenger.
That's why some of us crossed over and why the Reagan Democrats went home or waltzed off to gold-plated protest. And it explains the curious lack of a letdown in watching the President concede; our letdown had come months or years before.
With both the White House and Congress in the hands of the Democrats, what now for the ideological homeless? Conservatives have to do more than oppose, grumble, view with alarm and drag a foot.
We will lie down and bleed awhile. We will retreat to the think-tank mountains and op-ed marshes to cook up a new-old philosophy that exalts individual freedom and national strength and public rectitude. With the advantage of being in opposition, we will build a new movement that can stick together without the glue of anti-Communism.
If the Clintonians advance prosperity at home and human rights abroad, we'll learn from them; if they fall out over the spoils of office or revert to budget-busting, redistributive type, we'll hold them accountable.
But wait: Each new administration is entitled to a honeymoon period -- a time to plan a transition, appoint the new team, present detailed legislation, persuade the people to support their different approach. The Clinton Administration deserves no less.
(Pause.)
O.K., that's it -- the honeymoon is over. The Clinton and Gore "victory" speeches were long-winded and inappropriately contentious, and revealed a pair of stump-loving politicians unwilling or unable to shift from campaigning to governing.
If these bozos (good, irreverent figure of speech!) cannot get it together soon, the revivified right will be back before you know it.

HEADLINE: With Help, New York High Tech Could Rival Silicon Valley

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "New York a Hard Town for High-Tech" (Business Day, Oct. 12), you describe the challenges faced by Willow Peripherals, a gutsy company that started its computer business in the South Bronx. Willow's struggle in attracting employees to one of New York's most notorious neighborhoods should not be surprising. 
 But it is misleading to engage in yet another criticism of New York's economic potential. New York has the elements to be a high-tech center.
(1) We have a huge pool of talent, educated in New York's world-class universities. The city's financial community, I.B.M. to our north and Long Island's military contractors have trained an army of engineers.
(2) The New York region is a huge market for high-tech, particularly computer software for financial services, brokers and lawyers.
(3) While not everyone would choose to pioneer in the South Bronx, there are innumerable lofts and older office buildings in the city that can provide new ventures a first home.
I have counseled software entre preneurs who have become millionaires from high-tech ventures started in this city. These entrepreneurs were tough, street smart and adept at managing the personalities attracted to computer technology. They wanted to be in New York.
Engineers and software designers want to be near other entrepreneurs. A single subsidized loft in downtown Brooklyn or one abandoned plant in Queens could serve the needs of a dozen start-up ventures.
Entrepreneurs are chronically short of capital, even while working in the financial center of the world. If New York's government can stimulate a modest flow of seed capital, it would reap long-term rewards.
New ventures require accounting, advertising and legal services, most of which serve New York's large banks and corporations. The city could coordinate a volunteer or reduced-fee program to help high-tech entrepreneurs get started.
If New York City's government, universities and business community joined in a common goal, the canyons of Manhattan would rival Silicon Valley.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 ELECTIONS: REACTION -- VOICES;
The Subject Is Politics, and the Voices Are as Diverse as the Country

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
Wherever Americans gathered yesterday, the subject was politics in general and Bill Clinton in particular. The young and the old, suburbanites and ghetto residents, political junkies and even the avowedly apathetic paused to contemplate the election results and what a Clinton Administration might be like. 
 Following are snapshots of an assortment of voters who shared their thoughts one day after the election.
 
Colorado
Coming Home, To the Suburbs
 ARVADA, Colo., Nov. 4 (Special to The New York Times) -- A huge number of suburban voters came back to the Democratic Party on Tuesday. Voters here say that is because the Democratic Party came back to the suburbs.
Here in the conservative Denver suburbs of Jefferson County, where minivans fill the parking lots of shopping malls, Bill Clinton ran neck-and-neck with President Bush. For a Democrat, that is success.
Voters here said they did not necessarily believe everything Mr. Clinton had to say. But they believed one important thing.
"He's not a liberal," said Geraldine Asay, a 52-year-old housewife, who voted for Ronald Reagan twice, then Mr. Bush, and now Mr. Clinton. "For a long time, the Democrats have been all for welfare. But Clinton's not like that. He wants to put people to work."
Like almost every other Clinton supporter interviewed here this morning, she cited one other motivation for her vote: "We need change."
Ray Williamson, a 47-year-old trucker, came back to the Democratic fold, too. As the economy faltered, he said he simply lost faith in President Bush. "All he could do was complain about Clinton," Mr. Williamson said.
Not everyone was celebrating on the streets of Arvada this morning. Republicans like Pat McMullin, a 49-year-old cosmetologist, said she expects higher taxes from the President-elect. "How else is he going to pay for his programs?" she asked.
Her husband, Perry, a former Marine who works as a photographer, said he could not vote for Mr. Clinton, a man who opposed the Vietnam war. "What if we have another situation like Kuwait?" he asked.
But Larry Teeple, a retired owner of a baking company, said the new Presidency offers hope. "I wasn't thrilled with any of the three," said Mr. Teeple, 70, who finally chose Mr. Clinton. "More than anything else, we needed a change. And Clinton's the only one with a chance of giving it to us."

The Subject Is Politics, and the Voices Are as Diverse as the Country

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
Wherever Americans gathered yesterday, the subject was politics in general and Bill Clinton in particular. The young and the old, suburbanites and ghetto residents, political junkies and even the avowedly apathetic paused to contemplate the election results and what a Clinton Administration might be like. 
 Following are snapshots of an assortment of voters who shared their thoughts one day after the election.
 
Florida
In Autumn of Life, A Wish for Change
 PEMBROKE PINES, Fla., Nov. 4 (Special to The New York Times) -- During the campaign, they listened attentively when Marilyn Quayle came to visit them, and Ross Perot's fusillades kept them constantly entertained. But when it came time to go to the polls, most of the residents of the Century Village planned retirement community here, like other elderly voters around the country, turned to Bill Clinton.
"When I got up this morning, I was elated," said Esther Herman, 68, a retired medical technician originally from New Jersey, as she chatted with friends at the clubhouse of this complex southwest of Fort Lauderdale. "Bush had four years to do all the things he has been standing up there saying he wanted to do. This man is a young man with a lot of ideals, who stands for change, and I think he will do a lot better."
Century Village's residents, living on fixed incomes or investments, include many people who cast their first ballot for Franklin D. Roosevelt but turned to Ronald Reagan in the 1980's. Many went into this election, they said, convinced that a historical cycle was drawing to a close.
"Perot I thought of when he first came in, but when he talked to the blacks about 'you people,' that turned me off," Janet Brenner, 69, said. "As far as Bush was concerned, I didn't like the idea of him looking at his watch during the debate. I felt like he couldn't wait to get out of there."
Most retirees here said they paid little attention to campaign charges and countercharges that one party or another would tamper with Social Security or Medicare. What mattered most, they emphasized, was the same issue that concerned their children and grandchildren: the economy. "It just seems that our total system was eroding, and that the companies that were strong 20 years ago weren't here anymore," said Kitty Thibault, 58, a former audiologist.
Having promised much, Mr. Clinton is expected to act quickly. "I want him to get jobs for the young people, deal with this drug thing, and decrease the deficit," said David Montekio, 73, who voted for Mr. Perot.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 ELECTIONS: PRESIDENT-ELECT -- THE HOME STATE;
Emotional High for 'Lowly Arkansas'

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Nov. 4

 BODY:
"Highest of the High," ran the headline in the weekly Arkansas Times, and for Bill Clinton's home state the words were about right.
Playing off President Bush's description of Arkansas as "the lowest of the low" the headline reflected the extraordinary degree to which the Arkansas Governor's victory on Tuesday was seen as a triumph not just for him, but also for his often-derided home state. 
 "I want to thank the people of this wonderful small state," Mr. Clinton told admirers Tuesday night, once again paying off the Bush campaign's dismissal ofMr. Clinton as "the failed Governor of a small state."
Most Arkansans seemed to share the sentiment.
"Most of us don't consider Arkansas the bottom of the heap," said Bruce Schrader, an elementary school principal in Sheridan, Ark., who was part of a euphoric crowd that packed downtown Little Rock into the early morning hours today. "Maybe this will put the barefoot and backwards image to rest."
 
Fighting a Common Malady
 Arkansas isn't the only state that has battled an inferiority complex over the years. The maladay is common to many small states, particularly in the South.
But from its earliest days as forlorn frontier outpost to the Dogpatch image of Li'l Abner, Arkansas has always been a place that defined where it's not at. H.L. Mencken, who once derided the "miasmic jungles of Arkansas," said in his defense: "I didn't make Arkansas the butt of ridicule. God did."
Nor did it help that the state's only major moment on the national stage in recent decades was tghe bitter battle over the integration of Central High School Little Rick in in 1957.
Given all that, people here have had a stake in the Presidential race in a way residents of, say, Walter F. Mondale's Minnesota or Michael Dukakis's Massachusetts never did.
Many Arkansans believe the Clinton victory has put their state on the map in a positive sense, and in a way that has been unique in Arkansas history.
"Most people know how to spell 'potato', but they don't know where Arkansas is," said Roby Robertson of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. "Now they will."
Economists say Arkansas is small enough, with a population of 2.4 million, and geographically isolated enough that Mr. Clinton's Presidency might not have as much of an economic impact on this state as Jimmy Carter's election had on Georgie.
But few doubt that in terms of influence in Washington and international and national visibility Mr. Clinton's election has the potential to provide an enormous lift to Arkansas.
"We're not suddenly going to become the center of the world, but this can't help but be good for Arkansas," said Mike Gauldin, Gov. Clinton's press secretary, who spent most of the last two days videotaping the festivities.
The election has already set off a predicatable round of hackneyed imagery that centers on hogs, hillbillies and chickens. Arkansas chic may still seem like a contradiction in terms, but the souvenir dealers are already hawking "Honorary Arky" coffee mugs.
The real significance for Arkansas, however, is the degree to which the election reflects the extent to which this state and the South have left most of the old stereotypes behind.
After Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, spoke to a crowd at the Excelsior Hotel early today, themusic of James Brown's "Living in America" came throbbing out of the speakers. And in a state that has been associated for years with racial unrest at Central High, a giddy, interracial group waving Arkansas and American flags boogfied euphorically under a shower of confetti.
But then, because this is still Arkansas, when the music ended the celebrators raised thir arms and hollered the Razorback hog call before drifting out into the night.

To the Editor:
This is a word of appreciation for the Ageworks I.B.M. computer training program sponsored by the New York City Department for the Aging. 
 This program is geared toward unemployed New Yorkers 55 years and older, and trains them on I.B.M. computers, teaching the fundamentals of WordPerfect 5.1 and Lotus 1-2-3. The staff helps with resumes and job-search suggestions. Important also is the restoration of self-esteem, ambition and hope after a period of self-doubt due to difficulty finding a job.
Employers who have hired these mature, experienced and responsible workers have been very satisfied and consider them assets to their companies. Thanks also to Mayor David N. Dinkins for continued support for this program.

ALABAMA - BUSH
Alabama remained loyal to the Republicans, putting its nine electoral votes in Mr. Bush's column. As usual, Republicans branded the Democrat as too liberal, especially on social issues. At a rally last week in Birmingham, for instance, parents said their children would encounter homosexual scoutmasters if Mr. Clinton won the election. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby, a Democrat, easily won re-election over Richard Sellers, a businessman.
Running for the House in an open district, a Republican political novice, Terry Everett, a newspaper executive, defeated one of the state's most famous names, George Wallace Jr., the State Treasurer. Mr. Everett had attacked Mr. Wallace, son of the former Governor, has part of a politics-as-usual tradition.
Ben Erdreich, a five-term Democratic incumbent, became a victim of redistricting, losing to a Republican, Spencer Bachus, a former state party chairman, in a redrawn district. State Senator Earl F. Hilliard, a Democrat, became the first black Alabaman in Congress since Reconstruction.

ARKANSAS - CLINTON
Since Lincoln lost in Kentucky in 1864, every Presidential victor has won the state of his birth. The exception was 1988, when George Bush lost Massachusetts.
Mr. Clinton easily kept the tradition alive, becoming the first Democrat to win Arkansas's six electoral votes since 1976. Mr. Perot, who had mocked the state's chicken industry, drew only 11 percent.
Senator Dale Bumpers, the popular three-term incumbent, trounced his Republican challenger, Mike Huckabee, a 37-year-old minister and broadcast executive.
The House district in the state's northeast corner changed hands for only the third time in 53 years as Blanche Lambert, who had beat the incumbent, Bill Alexander, in the Democratic primary, won. The only Democratic incumbent running, Ray Thornton, also won easily.
But two other Democrats lost. John R. VanWinkle was defeated by State Representative Tim Hutchinson. Mr. Clinton's Secretary of State, Bill McCuen, lost to Jay Dickey, a businessman.
Voters also approved a measure limiting the terms of state and Federal officials.

 FLORIDA - BUSH
Mr. Bush won the state's 25 electoral votes, but only with extreme effort. After winning by a margin of nearly a million votes in 1988, this year the President had to keep returning to Florida until late October, draining time and money from other states.
The economy was his main enemy, with September unemployment at 8.9 percent in a state used to being a job-seeker's mecca.
The national Democratic Party ran a series of advertisements charging that the Republicans would make cuts in the Medicare program. The advertisements drew criticism from independent experts, but polls of voters leaving the polls showed the Democrats running strongest among the elderly.
Mr. Perot's strong showing may also have siphoned votes from conservatives disaffected with the President.
Senator Bob Graham, a Democrat, won re-election easily, but Republicans took some solace in House races. The state's delegation expanded by four seats, to 23, and Republicans captured 13 of them. They also drew even with the Democrats in the state Senate.
Florida elected three new black Representatives, all Democrats: Carrie Meek, Corrine Brown, and Alcee L. Hastings. Mr. Hastings, a former Federal district judge who now joins the House that impeached him in 1989 on charges of bribery.
A referendum imposing an eight-year term limit on members of Congress passed with 77 percent of the vote.

GEORGIA - CLINTON
 The Southern-grown Democratic ticket of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore held on for a narrow victory in Georgia, a state that four years ago gave Mr. Bush a landslide victory.
But an odd set of circumstances has Senator Wyche Fowler Jr., the incumbent Democrat, facing a runoff even though he ran ahead of Mr. Clinton.
Georgia law provides that a statewide candidate cannot claim victory without winning 51 percent of the vote. Mr. Fowler received only 49 percent; his Republican challenger, Paul Coverdell, received 48 percent, and the remaining three percent went to Jim Hudson, a Libertarian.
Mr. Coverdell had boasted of his association with President Bush, whom he once pronounced "one of the strongest Presidential personalities in history." As Mr. Bush's popularity plummeted, Mr. Coverdell mentioned him less frequently. Democrats tried hard to insure Mr. Fowler's re-election, seeing that he campaigned with Georgia's senior Senator, Sam Nunn, an enormously popular figure.
Representative Newt Gingrich, a slashing Republican fighter in the House, won re-election.

KENTUCKY - CLINTON
Emphasizing his ticket's Southern roots, Mr. Clinton succeeded in wooing conservative Democrats who had supported President Bush on social issues in 1988 but abandoned him this year because of the weak economy.
Mr. Bush, who visited the state twice in the campaign's final week, ran well in traditional Republican strongholds in rural southeastern corner and in the suburbs of Cincinnati. But his attacks on Mr. Clinton's economic and environmental policies failed to dent the Democrats' core constituency or to prevent Reagan Democrats from turning to Mr. Perot.
In the Senate race, the Democratic incumbent, Wendell H. Ford, the majority whip, easily defeated David Williams, a Republican State Senator.

LOUISIANA - CLINTON
Capitalizing on his status as a Southerner and Governor of a neighboring state, Mr. Clinton broke the Republicans' grip on Louisiana's white voters and brought the state into the Democratic column for the first time since 1976.
He had the strong backing of Senator John B. Breaux, the power in the state party and a longtime ally from the Democratic Leadership Council. Representative William J. Jefferson of New Orleans, another early Clinton supporter, worked hard to turn out the city's sizable black vote.
Republican efforts were fractured when Billy Nungesser, the state party chairman, backed Pat Buchanan in the primaries and Representative Richard H. Baker, Mr. Bush's choice as chairman, became consumed by a tough, though successful, battle against a fellow Republican, Representative Clyde C. Holloway. Mr. Bush, struggling to keep the state's nine electoral votes, made seven trips to Louisiana, including an election-eve visit to Baton Rouge.
In another race between incumbents, Representative Jim McCrery, a Republican, won handily over Jerry Huckaby, a Democrat.

 MISSISSIPPI - BUSH
Mr. Bush held on to this conservative bastion -- and its seven electoral votes -- even though Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore are both from neighboring states.
Mr. Bush won by 87,000 votes, less than half his margin four years ago. Even so, his 50 percent showing was better than he did in any other state this time.
Lisa Walker, state director for the Clinton campaign, said the result reflected a successful campaign by Christian fundamentalists to get out their vote.
Blacks make up 36 percent of the Mississippi electorate, but the Clinton campaign fell short of its target of increasing black turnout by more than 25 percent over 1988. Republicans barraged the state with advertising assailing Mr. Clinton's character and saying that he had done little for blacks in Arkansas.
Mississippi re-elected its five Democrats in Congress. Even Representative Jamie L. Whitten, 82 years old and in poor health, survived against the first opponent he has faced in the last 18 campaigns.

NORTH CAROLINA - BUSH
In North Carolina, the Democrats gained a governorship but lost a Senate seat. And Mr. Bush barely squeaked by Mr. Clinton, just as in the two biggest Southern states, Texas and Florida.
Both Mr. Bush and the Republican challenger for the Senate seat, Lauch Faircloth, succeeded by reminding the large number of voters who live on six military bases of their opponents' views on the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Faircloth, a former Democrat, upset Senator Terry Sanford by also making an issue of Mr. Sanford's age and recent heart operation. The operation hampered the 75-year-old Senator's campaigning.
Jim Hunt, the Democratic Governor from 1977 to 1985, was sent back to the governor's office for a third term, beating Jim Gardner, the Republican who had been Lieutenant Governor since 1989.
Two Democrats in House races, Eva Clayton and Mel Watt, won and became the first blacks to represent North Carolina in Washington since 1901. Democrats continued to control the House seats, by a margin of 8 to 4.

OKLAHOMA - BUSH
Mr. Bush won easily in Oklahoma, about as Republican as any state in Presidential politics. Democrats had hoped to make the race for the eight electoral votes closer, but much of the protest vote went to Mr. Perot, who won 23 percent. Though Mr. Gore visited several times, the real estate, banking and cattle industries have taken a turn for the better and Mr. Bush remained popular.
Steve Lewis, a Democrat and former Speaker of the State House, failed to do well against Senator Don Nickles, the Republican incumbent, in part because he was short of money. Mr. Lewis made an issue of Mr. Nickles's strong opposition to abortion rights, an approach that apparently failed in this Bible Belt state. Mr. Nickles had served as chairman of the Republican platform committee.
The Democrats held their 4-to-2 advantage in House seats. Representative James M. Inhofe, a Republican, once again beat off a tough challenge.

SOUTH CAROLINA - BUSH
South Carolinians split their votes, preferring a Republican for President and a Democrat for the Senate.
In taking the state's eight electoral votes, Mr. Bush had one of his strongest showings in the nation, largely unaffected by Mr. Perot, who had a particularly weak performance. Signs were that the religious right had stood firm with the Republican ticket, resisting the erosion to Mr. Perot that occurred elsewhere.
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the veteran Democrat, won a narrow victory over former Representative Thomas F. Hartnett. Mr. Hartnett tried to make an issue of Mr. Hollings's vote against partipation in the Persian Gulf war, but the Republican's campaign failed to muster enough money to challenge the incumbent effectively.
James E. Clyburn won easily to become the state's first black Representative. Bob Inglis, a Republican, eked out a surprise victory over Representative Liz J. Patterson, a three-term Democratic incumbent.

TENNESSEE - CLINTON
Governor Clinton's choice of Senator Gore as his running mate put this state into the Democratic column for the first time since Jimmy Carter won its 11 electoral votes.
Despite polls showing a predictable Democratic lead, Mr. Bush, Mr. Quayle and their surrogates, including Lamar Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee and now Education Secretary, all campaigned there in hopes of keeping the state Republican.
Mr. Quayle made Tennessee one of his last stops before Election Day. But Mr. Gore got the last word, returning to Tennessee on Tuesday for two rallies before casting his vote there.
The Democrats were also counting on Mr. Gore's coattails to draw votes for Democratic Representatives.
But the margin of the Gore-Clinton victory, 47 percent to 43 percent, with 10 percent for Mr. Perot, apparently was too small to have made much difference, and every one of the incumbents -- three Republicans and five Democrats -- was re-elected.
Most won by comfortable margins, although Marilyn Lloyd, of Chattanooga/Oak Ridge, squeaked by with a margin of a few thousand votes.

TEXAS - BUSH
With 32 electoral votes, Mr. Bush's adopted state of Texas was his biggest catch, although he won by a far smaller margin than the 12.7 percentage points of his 1988 victory.
It was a measure of the President's woes, as well as a reflection of Mr. Clinton's regional appeal, that Mr. Clinton came close to capturing the state even though he was outspent by the Republicans on direct media campaigns alone by more than $3 million.
Texas is also the home turf of Mr. Perot, who had a particularly strong showing in the state. Surveys of voters leaving the polls showed that his maverick campaign hurt Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton virtually equally.
Democrats continued to control the House seats by winning in 21 of the 30 Congressional districts. Two Democrats who wrote many overdrafts on their House bank accounts beat back stiff challenges, although a third member was less fortunate.
Representative Charles Wilson, a 20-year member from East Texas known for his flamboyant lifestyle, defeated Donna Peterson, a Republican. Ronald D. Coleman of El Paso, who wrote 673 overdrafts, beat Chip Taberski, a popular sportscaster.
Representative Albert G. Bustamante of Laredo, who had held a once-secure seat, was defeated by Henry Bonilla, a Republican television executive. Mr. Bustamante wrote 30 House bank overdrafts and was also under investigation by a Federal grand jury for helping a friend win a bingo contract on an Indian reservation.

VIRGINIA - BUSH
Virginia, which has voted Republican in Presidential races since 1968, gave President Bush a comfortable victory in his battle for the state's 13 electoral votes. Still, the race was tighter than some had expected, especially after one debate, in Richmond, gave Mr. Clinton momentum.
Although the state's Congressional districts had been extensively redrawn, all eight incumbent House members, five Democrats and three Republicans, were re-elected. One Democrat and one Republican were elected to open House seats.
The creation of a district with a 64 percent black population guaranteed that the winner of the Democratic primary, State Senator Robert C. Scott, would become the first black House member from the state in this century. He won easily.
In another new district, the 11th, in the suburbs of Washington, Leslie L. Byrne, a Democrat, became the first woman elected by Virginians to the House.

ALASKA - BUSH
 Alaska, where Mr. Bush won handily, has not given its three electoral votes to the Democrats since 1964. Mr. Clinton's chances were hurt by his opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which Alaskans overwhelmingly favor. 
 Senator Frank H. Murkowski, a Republican, turned a notable financial advantage into an easy victory over the Democrat, Tony Smith. The Republican Representative, Don Young, held off a challenge from John S. Devens, a Democrat.

ARIZONA - BUSH
Devastated by the savings-and-loan scandal and plummeting commercial and residential real-estate market, this solidly Republican state gave George Bush the jitters. The President only narrowly won the eight electoral votes in Arizona, which has voted Republican in every Presidential race since 1952.
Although Senator John McCain, a war hero and first-term Republican, was tarnished as one of the five Senators who intervened on behalf of Charles Keating, the jailed savings-and-loan operator, he handily defeated Claire Sargent, a Democrat who has been active in civic affairs.
Mr. McCain also beat former Gov. Evan Meacham, a Republican best known for his opposition to a state holiday celebrating the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Voters also approved the King holiday in a referendum on Tuesday.
In a break with tradition, Barry Goldwater, the founding father of modern Republican conservatism, backed Karan English, a Democrat, and she defeated Doug Wead, a Republican minister, in a House race.

CALIFORNIA - CLINTON
Mr. Clinton's victory in California had been a foregone conclusion, and as it turned out the Democrat could have gained office even without the state's 54 electoral votes.
California's most notable decision was its unprecedented election of two women to fill the state's two seats in the United States Senate.
Dianne Feinstein, a former Mayor of San Francisco, won comfortably over the Republican incumbent, John Seymour, who was appointed two years ago to the Senate seat vacated by Pete Wilson when he was elected Governor. She will face election again in two years.
The other female Senate candidate, Representative Barbara Boxer, also a Democrat, staved off a stiff challenge by Bruce Herschensohn, a conservative Republican and television commentator.
Californians overwhelmingly endorsed a proposition limiting the terms of its members of Congress, then returned almost all of the state's incumbents to the House of Representatives. Opponents of the ballot measure have warned that if it takes effect, it will cost the state a score of committee and subcommittee chairmanships.
Representative Frank Riggs, a one-term Republican, was ousted, but Vic Fazio, the head of the national Democratic Congressional fund-raising effort, hung on to his seat. So did Duncan Hunter, an outspoken conservative Republican who was a special target of the Democrats for helping to call attention to Mr. Clinton's foreign activities as a student.
In a newly drawn district, the 41st, which includes some of Orange County, Jay C. Kim, a Republican, became the first Korean-American immigrant elected to Congress.
The voters rejected a proposition that would have allowed doctors to assist in the deaths of terminally ill patients.

COLORADO - CLINTON
After vigorous campaigns by all three Presidential candidates, Colorado broke a six-election tradition by giving its eight electoral votes to Mr. Clinton. But the state made history in the Senate race by electing an American Indian. With a pony tail.
President Bush pushed hard in Colorado, visiting the state twice and dispatching Barbara Bush to Denver at the 11th hour. Even Mr. Perot made an appearance in Colorado in the final days. But, although Mr. Perot retained a high-profile campaign headquarters in Denver after withdrawing from the race, he barely regained the level of support he had before dropping out.
In the campaign to replace Senator Tim Wirth, a Democrat who is retiring, Representative Ben Nighthorse Campbell defeated State Senator Terry Considine, a Republican, to become the first American Indian to be senator. Mr. Campbell campaigned as a strong supporter of abortion rights.
Voters, as expected, approved a ballot measure that will erode civil rights protection for homosexuals.

HAWAII - CLINTON
 To no one's surprise, Hawaii's formidable Democratic machine not only delivered its four electoral votes to Mr. Clinton but produced an overwhelming victory for him in a state where he never campaigned.
Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the incumbent Democrat, easily won re-election. An advertisement that claimed he had molested his hairdresser 17 years ago backfired on his opponent, State Senator Rick Reed.

IDAHO - BUSH
President Bush swept to an easy victory after a bumpy start in his campaign for Idaho's four electoral votes.
The conservative oratory of the Republican convention initially soured many voters and opened the way for Mr. Clinton to make inroads in this bedrock Republican state. But the Democrat quickly faded, in part because of the re-entry into the race by Mr. Perot, who came in less than 10,000 votes behind the Arkansas Governor.
In the race for the seat left by retiring Senator Steve Symms, Mayor Dirk Kempthorne of Boise had a surprisingly easy time defeating Representative Richard Stallings, a conservative Democrat.
Michael D. Carpo, a Republican who is President of the State Senate, easily won the House seat that Mr. Stallings is leaving.

MONTANA - CLINTON
Mr. Clinton narrowly became the first Democrat in 28 years to win Montana's three electoral votes, while Mr. Perot enjoyed a strong third-place showing.
Montana Republicans also lost a popular Congressman, Ron Marlenee. Redistricting this year cost the state one of its two Congressional seats; this created the most populous district in the nation and forcing a face-off between Mr. Marlenee and another popular incumbent, Pat Williams.
Mr. Williams, a Democrat, had represented the western part of the state for 14 years; Mr. Marlenee had represented the east for 16 years.
In the race for governor, the State Attorney General, Marc Racicot, a Republican, defeated Dorothy Bradley, a state Representative.
Montanans approved a measure to limit the terms of state and Federal legislators.

NEVADA - CLINTON
The shadows of Paul Laxalt and Ronald Reagan were scarcely perceptible on Tuesday, as President Bush garnered only 35 percent of the vote.
Some observers had predicted a Perot victory, perhaps because protest votes are easier to cast in a state with only four electoral votes. But Mr. Clinton, backed by a Democratic Governor, prevailed.
Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat, won handily. His opponent, Demar Dahl, refused to accept interest-group financing, only to run out of money a week before the vote. Two incumbent members of Congress, James Bilbray and Barbara F. Vucanovich, won comfortably. Miriam Shearing became the first woman elected to the State Supreme Court.

NEW MEXICO - CLINTON
 Governor Clinton won New Mexico's five lectoral votes, but his performance had little effect on House races in the state: two incumbent Republicans won handily, as did an incumbent Democrat.
Mr. Clinton, sensing support among Hispanic voters and workers in high-technology industries, campaigned in Albuquerque before dawn on Election Day.
Even top Democrats were somewhat surprised by Mr. Clinton's showing. But perhaps they should not have been. Except for 1976, the state has gone with the winner in every election since it gained statehood in 1912. With many new residents, it may reflect the views of the whole nation fairly accurately.

OREGON - CLINTON
Two unsurprising bottom lines in Oregon -- Mr. Clinton's victory for the seven electoral votes and the defeat of a measure that would have permitted discrimination against homosexuals -- hid some surprising results.
In the Presidential race, Mr. Perot bucked projections by racking up one in four votes, apparently drawing support from fiscally conservative voters.
A second surprise came from the initiative. Although the measure failed, it received more support -- 43 percent -- than state polls had estimated, apparently because some backers were embarrassed to tell poll takers.
In the fierce Senate race, the Republican incumbent, Bob Packwood, managed to hang on for a fifth term, defeating Representative Les AuCoin, a nine-term Congressman. Mr. Packwood blasted Mr. AuCoin for leaving his influential House position to run for the Senate and being too solicitous of the spotted owl.
Voters also endorsed term limits for state and Federal officials.

UTAH - BUSH
Given a third option, Utah voters demonstrated that they are as suspicious of Democrats as they are loyal to Republicans. Not only did Mr. Bush win the five electoral votes, but Mr. Perot beat Mr. Clinton in the state, and an independent candidate for governor ran ahead of the Democratic contender.
In the race to replace Senator Jake Garn, a Republican who is retiring, Robert F. Bennett, a Republican management consultant, defeated Representative Wayne Owens, a Democrat whom Mr. Bennett accused of being the most liberal of the Utah delegation.
In the Governor's race, Mike Leavitt, a Republican insurance executive, beat the Democrat, Stewart Hanson, a former state trial judge, and Merrill Cook, of the Independent Party.

WASHINGTON - CLINTON
Patty Murray, the self-described "mom in tennis shoes," used luck and pluck to beat a five-term Congressman for a Senate seat, helped along by Mr. Clinton's victory.
Mr. Perot attracted nearly a quarter of the voters in this state of independent voters troubled by the economy and by conflicts over natural resources.
Ms. Murray, a first-term State Senator, had decided to take on Senator Brock Adams even before he announced his retirement after allegations of sexual misconduct. She beat Representative Rod Chandler, a Republican. In an upset, Mike Lowry, a Democratic former Congressman, beat out State Attorney General Ken Eikenberry, a Republican, to replace the retiring Governor, Booth Gardner, a Democrat.
Voters also approved term limits.

WYOMING - BUSH
Voter discontent with the President's handling of the economy and with his early support for stronger measures to protect the environment forced Mr. Bush to fight for Wyoming's three electoral votes, even though the state has voted Republican in every Presidential election since 1968.
And although the President won, Wyoming also yielded Mr. Perot one of his strongest showings, with 26 percent of the vote.
The state's lone member of the House, Craig Thomas, a Republican seeking his second full term, easily defeated John L. Herschler, an eye surgeon.
The voters overwhelmingly approved term limits for senators and House members.

 BODY:

ILLINOIS - CLINTON
In its votes for national offices, the Land of Lincoln repudiated the party of Lincoln. It gave its 22 electoral votes to Mr. Clinton and elected Carol Moseley Braun, who will be the first black woman in the United States Senate. 
 Ms. Braun invoked Lincoln in her victory speech. "Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, that we dare to do our duty as we understand it," she told her jubilant supporters.
Ms. Braun, the 45-year-old Cook County Recorder of Deeds, won 55 percent of the vote to beat Rich Williamson, the 43-year-old lawyer offered up by state Republicans when they thought they had little chance of defeating Senator Alan J. Dixon, whom Ms. Braun later defeated in the primary.
Ms. Braun, who barely won among men and lost among whites, carried 95 percent of the black vote.
Democrats will hold a 12-to-8 edge in the state's new Congressional delegation, which will include a former Black Panther and the first Hispanic member of the House from Illinois.

INDIANA - BUSH
The voters of Indiana were generous to incumbents of both parties this year, with one exception: Representative Jim Jontz, a Democrat first elected in 1986, lost to Steve Buyer, a veteran of the Persian Gulf war who criticized Mr. Jontz for opposing the war and accused him of harboring environmental views that were too liberal for his rural district.
Mr. Bush walked away with the state's 12 electoral votes, although the margin of victory was slimmer than Republican officials had hoped. In this conservative state, which has voted for the Republican in every election but one since 1932, Mr. Perot pulled in about one in five votes, apparently from voters who were concerned about the economy but not comfortable with Mr. Clinton.
Senator Daniel R. Coats, a Republican, fended off a challenge from the Democratic Secretary of State, Joe Hogsett. Mr. Hogsett never recovered from a damaging radio advertising volley from Mr. Coats that portrayed him as a career politician.
Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat who at 36 is the nation's youngest governor, easily defeated his challenger, Linley E. Pearson, the Republican State Attorney General.

IOWA - CLINTON
Mr. Clinton won Iowa's seven electoral votes by a comfortable margin, but otherwise Democrats had little to cheer about, notwithstanding their numerical superiority. Neither, in this "Year of the Woman," did women.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, a folksy and plain-spoken Republican, crushed his Democratic challenger, State Senator Jean Lloyd-Jones. In southern Iowa, Jim Ross Lightfoot, a Republican member of the House Appropriations Committee tarnished by 105 overdrafts at the House bank, defeated Elaine Baxter, the Iowa Secretary of State. And a resolution to add an equal rights amendment to the state constitution suffered a narrow defeat.
In a race between two incumbents, Jim Nussle, a Republican who gained notice by wearing a bag over his head on the floor of the House to symbolize his disgust over the banking furor, defeated Dave Nagle. That leaves only one Democrat, Neal Smith, in the state's Congressional delegation.

KANSAS - BUSH
Mr. Bush carried Kansas, as has every Republican Presidential candidate since Richard M. Nixon in 1968.
Yet he still ran way behind Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader in the Senate and the man Mr. Bush beat for the Republican nomination four years ago. Mr. Dole defeated Gloria O'Dell, a state treasury official, and won re-election with 64 percent of the vote.
Kansas, with six electoral votes, was one of those states that expressed its dissatisfaction with both major-party Presidential candidates by giving Mr. Perot a strong showing, 27 percent of the vote.
Representative Dan Glickman, a Democrat, was re-elected despite intense opposition from the local cable system, which opposed his vote to re-regulate cable television.

MICHIGAN - CLINTON
Michigan was considered a swing state vital to Mr. Bush's re-election prospects. But the travails of the automobile industry hurt Mr. Bush and helped Mr. Clinton to win the state's 18 electoral votes.
Ross Perot, a former member of the General Motors board who barely campaigned, received a healthy 21 percent of the vote. Polls indicated that Mr. Perot drew more votes from Mr. Clinton than from Mr. Bush, and voters said they were most concerned about the economy and health care.
Reagan Democrats, blue-collar workers whose disenchantment with their party led them to support Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush, apparently proved the key to Mr. Clinton's victory. Many who lost their jobs making cars in recent years returned to the Democratic fold, with 68 percent voting for Clinton and 18 percent for Mr. Perot.
Representative David E. Bonior, the Democratic whip who is his party's third-highest official in the House, won re-election despite his 76 overdrafts on the House bank, which were an issue in his campaign against State Senator Doug Carl, a Republican. Representative William D. Ford, a 14-term Democrat who is chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, handily won re-election.
Michigan voters also handily approved a referendum to limit House members to three terms in any 12-year period and senators to two terms in 24 years.

MINNESOTA - CLINTON
With Tuesday's vote, Minnesota is now the only state to have voted Democratic in the last five Presidential elections, giving its 10 electoral votes to Mr. Clinton.
Ethical problems finally caught up with Gerry Sikorski, the five-term Democratic Congressman from the northern suburbs of Minneapolis. Mr. Sikorski, who ranked among the top 10 Congressmen both in bank overdrafts and the use of franking privileges, was trounced by the Republican, Rod Grams.
Democrats did retain a 6-to-2 advantage in the House with the apparent victory of David Minge over Cal R. Ludeman, a former candidate for governor, for the seat being vacated by Representative Vin Weber. The race, for which there may be a recount, indicated the limited length of Mr. Clinton's coattails.
Alan Page will become the first black -- and the first former star for the Minnesota Vikings -- on the State Supreme Court.

MISSOURI - CLINTON
Although Mr. Bush made a point of visiting Missouri often, Mr. Clinton, Governor of neighboring Arkansas, easily won the state's 11 electoral votes.
Senator Christopher S. Bond, the Republican incumbent, did little to disguise the fact that he was running away from Mr. Bush, and wondered publicly whether the President's unpopularity would sink his re-election chances. But he prevailed easily over his Democratic opponent, Geri Rothman-Serot, a member of the St. Louis County Council who emphasized her support of abortion rights, a view that Mr. Bond does not share.
The contest for the Governor's mansion became a kind of referendum on abortion, with a different outcome: The Democratic contender, Lieut. Gov. Mel Carnahan, emphasized abortion rights and overwhelmed his opponent, William L. Webster, the state attorney general, who had argued the case for restricting abortion rights that led to the 1989 Supreme Court ruling Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. Mr. Webster seemed eager during the campaign to avoid the issue.

NEBRASKA - BUSH
Nebraska defied the electoral landslide to give Mr. Bush an easy victory in the contest for its five electoral votes. Like other Great Plains states, Nebraska also gave Mr. Perot impressive backing. But, as in many states, he seemed to draw as much from Mr. Clinton as from Mr. Bush. The state has not embraced a Democrat since Lyndon B. Johnson.
With no races for the Senate or the governorship, the hottest contest was for the House in the Second District, anchored in Omaha. Peter Hoagland, a two-term Democrat, barely survived a spirited challenge from a flamboyant restaurant owner, Ron Staskiewicz. Trying to ride the anti-incumbent wave, Mr. Staskiewicz played the outsider by campaigning in a bus decorated like a Pullman car. Mr. Staskiewicz threw the book at his opponent: "House Rules," a volume by Robert Cwiklik painting Mr. Hoagland as the consummate insider and an opportunist to boot.

NORTH DAKOTA - BUSH
North Dakota gave its three electoral votes to President Bush, despite a late surge by Mr. Perot among farmers that hurt both parties. The barely contested campaign was waged largely over the airwaves; none of the candidates visted the state, which last voted for a Democrat in 1964.
In the race to succeed retiring Gov. George Sinner, Ed Schafer, a Republican businessman, defeated Nicholas Spaeth, a Democrat who is the State Attorney General. In the Senate race, Representative Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat, defeated Steve Sydness, a Republican member of the Fargo City Council.
North Dakota also approved an initiative to limit Federal lawmakers to 12 years in office.

OHIO - CLINTON
Bill Clinton, the first Democrat to win Ohio since Jimmy Carter in 1976, achieved victory by fewer than 100,000 votes.
Mr. Bush fought hard for Ohio's 21 electoral votes with an exuberant tour in the final week of the campaign, and was scathing in his attacks on Mr. Clinton's character and environmental positions. Polling of voters indicates that Mr. Clinton won wide support among blue-collar and union workers, suggesting he attracted back many Reagan Democrats.
Mr. Perot, who won a respectable 21 percent, may have meant the difference in the race. Twenty percent of his voters told poll takers that Mr. Bush was their second choice, while only 16 percent said they would have otherwise voted for Mr. Clinton.
The late Bush surge helped Lieut. Gov. Michael DeWine's run at Senator John Glenn, the three-term Senator who had never experienced a difficult race for re-election. But Mr. Glenn still won 55 percent of the vote, though his reputation as a squeaky clean astronaut was tarnished by slashing advertisements linking him to the Keating Five savings-and-loan scandal.
House races featured a mud-slinging match in Cleveland involving Representative Mary Rose Oakar, an eight-term Democratic incumbent weakened by her association with the House bank and post office scandals. The Republican, Martin R. Hoke, a lawyer and political newcomer, won by a landslide.
As in 13 other states, a term-limits referendum covering state and Federal officeholders passed easily.

SOUTH DAKOTA - BUSH
President Bush won South Dakota's three electoral votes after making the state a symbolic battleground for the nation's farm vote.
On a September visit, Mr. Bush announced a $1 billion subsidy program for wheat exports, after having criticized similar subsidies by European governments. On his one visit, Mr. Clinton offered his own programs for rural health care, ethanol production and farm development. Mr. Perot seemed to draw equally from both parties.
Senator Tom Daschle, a Democrat seeking his second term, defeated Charlene Haar, the only Republican woman running for the Senate.
South Dakotans also approved a measure to limit the terms of state and Federal legislators.

WISCONSIN - CLINTON
Although steady dairy prices have helped Wisconsin weather the recession, the state still gave Mr. Clinton a comfortable victory. Republicans had predicted that Wisconsin and its 11 electoral votes would be the only state lost by Mr. Bush in 1988 that he might win this year.
But in the end the Republicans could not resist a heavy Democratic turnout in Milwaukee and Madison. Mr. Perot took 22 percent of the vote, reflecting the efforts of his strong local organization.
The Presidential race was nearly overshadowed by the defeat of a two-term Senator, Bob Kasten, one of the few incumbents to lose, by State Senator Russ Feingold. Mr. Kasten, who in his two previous Senate campaigns had not received more than 51 percent of the vote, attempted to paint Mr. Feingold as a radical liberal. For his part, the 39-year-old Mr. Feingold staunchly opposed such popular measures as a balanced-budget amendment, term limits and a middle-class tax cut. In the end Mr. Kasten's promotion of supply-side economics was seen as too conservative.
Representative Les Aspin, head of the Armed Services Committee, won a surprisingly easy victory over Mark Neumann, a Republican businessman who had made a spirited challenge.
Representative Scott L. Klug, a Republican, easily defeated Ada E. Deer, who sought to be the first American Indian woman to serve in Congress.

 BODY:

CONNECTICUT - CLINTON
 As in many other states, the anemic economy defeated President Bush in Connecticut. Gov. Bill Clinton was the first Democratic Presidential candidate to carry the state since 1968. 
 In this once-booming state now staggering from the loss of thousands of manufacturing and white-collar jobs, Ross Perot managed to attract more than a fifth of the voters looking for change.
In the race for the Senate, the two-term Democratic incumbent, Christopher J. Dodd, resoundingly beat back a challenge from a millionaire businessman, Brook Johnson.
With polls last year showing Mr. Dodd's popularity eroding, Mr. Johnson tried to paint him as a free-spending politician beholden to special interests. But Mr. Dodd spent millions on advertising to show his opponent as a political novice and tried to turn the debate back to the prime issue on most voters' minds: the economy.
He made no apology for his political career, asserting that his experience helped save the Seawolf submarine contract for Electric Boat, eastern Connecticut's largest employer. Surveys of voters leaving the polls showed most voters here bought his message, saying they believed Government experience was more important than business experience in this election.

DELAWARE - CLINTON
Despite a vigorous campaign by President Bush and a stronger-than-expected showing by Mr. Perot, Governor Clinton won Delaware's three electoral votes, the first Democrat to do so since 1976.
The state's governor and sole House member traded jobs. For Congress, Gov. Michael N. Castle, a Republican taking mandatory retirement after two terms, defeated former Lieut. Gov. S. B. Woo. And Representative Thomas R. Carper, a Democrat, defeated B. Gary Scott, a retired real-estate executive, for governor.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA - CLINTON
As predicted, Mr. Clinton crushed his opponents. But the Presidential race in the nation's capital was overshadowed by a referendum on whether to adopt a tough death-penalty law. Voters defeated the measure by more than 2 to 1, not only because they opposed the death penalty but also because it was Congress that put it on the ballot.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, won again as the city's non-voting House delegate, and former Mayor Marion Barry returned to politics, winning a seat on the City Council.

MAINE - CLINTON
As Kennebunkport went, so went neither Maine nor the nation.
It proved to be one of the few bright spots for the Republicans, with Mr. Bush carrying the town by a comfortable margin. But even here, Mr. Bush's problems were evident: four years ago, he won by nearly 3 to 1.
Turnout in the town was among the lowest in the county, suggesting that if they could not comfortably vote for Mr. Bush, his neighbors simply stayed home. His margin there helped spare him the ignominy of a third-place finish in the state, where Mr. Perot ran very close with 30 percent, the highest proportion he received in any state.
In two House races, Representative Olympia J. Snowe defeated the Democrat, Patrick K. McGowan, and Thomas H. Andrews, a Democrat, crushed Linda Bean, a Republican and heiress to the L. L. Bean fortune. She spent over $900,000 of her own money on the race.

MARYLAND - CLINTON
The defection of Maryland's maverick Democratic Governor, William Donald Schaefer, to the ranks of President Bush's supporters made no difference. Both parties had long counted the state's 10 electoral votes in Mr. Clinton's column, and he cruised to an easy victory in a state where registered Democrats are a 2-to-1 majority.
Voters also reaffirmed a law that guarantees abortion rights, by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent. The law was enacted last year, but an anti-abortion group collected enough signatures to keep it from taking effect until put to a popular vote.
Senator Barbara A. Mikulski shared in the Democrats' victory with a decisive defeat of Alan L. Keyes, a Republican and former diplomat.
In a face-off between two incumbents, freshman Representative Wayne T. Gil chrest, a Republican, defeated three-term incumbent Tom McMillen, a Democrat. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, chairman of the Democratic Caucus, held off an aggressive campaign from Lawrence J. Hogan, Jr.

MASSACHUSETTS - CLINTON
Massachusetts went to Mr. Clinton, who had failed to win a single delegate in the state's Democratic primary last spring, when he ran third to Paul E. Tsongas, a native son, and Edmund G. Brown Jr.
In this Democratic stronghold, anti-Bush feeling was so strong that the state that had twice supported Ronald Reagan before voting for Michael S. Dukakis, another native son, gave Mr. Clinton its 12 electoral votes. Nearly one in four voters chose Mr. Perot.
Neither the governorship nor a Senate seat was at stake, but reapportionment helped defeat two Congressional veterans who had severe political problems.
Representative Joseph D. Early, a nine-term Democrat who had written 140 overdrafts on his House bank account, was defeated by State Senator Peter I. Blute, a Repoublican, in a district in which half the voters were new. Representative Nicholas Mavroules, a seven-term Democrat indicted on charges of racketeering, bribery and tax evasion, was defeated by the Republican, State Representative Peter G. Torkildsen.

NEW HAMPSHIRE - CLINTON
 Rejecting a sitting Republican President for the first time in 80 years, New Hampshire gave Mr. Clinton its four electoral votes, but only by the slimmest of margins. As a mark of how hard it was for voters in this recession-mired state to support a Democrat, Mr. Perot won almost a quarter of the vote.
But New Hampshire showed its Republican roots by choosing Gov. Judd Gregg, a Republican, over John Rauh, a Democratic businessman, to replace Senator Warren B. Rudman, who is retiring.
For governor, a former state Attorney General, Steve Merrill, a protege of the former White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, defeated the Democrat, Deborah Arnie Arnesen, who defied tight-fisted tradition by proposing a state income tax.
The state's two House members, Bill Zeliff, a Republican, and Dick Swett, a Democrat, fought off strong challenges to keep their seats, as expected.

NEW JERSEY - CLINTON
In the end, it was as close in New Jersey as the candidates expected. Mr. Clinton beat Mr. Bush there by two percentage points, with Mr. Perot a distant, faded third. And though redistricting and the retirement of four incumbents led to a number of ferocious House races, the Democrats clung to a majority of the delegation's seats.
With 15 electoral votes and more independent voters than Democrats or Republicans, New Jersey was considered crucial for the Republicans, who sought to link Mr. Clinton to Gov. James J. Florio, a Democrat badly wounded by tax increases. Mr. Clinton visited the state six times after his party's convention and touted the low tax burden in Arkansas. He and Senator Gore repeatedly claimed that 218,000 residents of New Jersey had been thrown out of work under President Bush.
Support for Mr. Perot, which topped 20 percent in state polls after he re-entered the race, declined after his allegations of Republican dirty tricks.
Although it seemed possible that Republicans could outnumber Democrats in the House delegation for the first time since 1964, the Democrats held on to a seven-to-six majority. The retirement of Representative Robert A. Roe, the delegation's 12-term dean, led to a nasty race in Northern New Jersey. Herbert C. Klein, a former Democratic state legislator, defeated Joseph L. Bubba, a Republican State Senator.
In a district drawn to increase Hispanic representation, New Jersey elected its first Hispanic Congressman, Robert Menendez, a Cuban-American who is a Democratic State Senator and Mayor of Union City.

NEW YORK - CLINTON
Despite a victory of landslide proportions at the top of the ticket, the Democrats suffered a stunning defeat for the Senate. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato defeated state Attorney General Robert Abrams by a little more than 100,000 votes to win a third term. His victory left New York Democrats too shocked to savor Mr. Clinton's showing.
With the Presidential outcome never in doubt, the contest between Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Abrams became the main show in the state. Mr. Abrams had won a primary that left the Democrats bitterly divided. He was never able to gain a sure footing against Mr. D'Amato in a blistering campaign that may have been the nation's nastiest.
Mr. Abrams's lack of appeal was clear: Mr. D'Amato fought him to a draw among women even though Mr. Abrams had emphasized his support for abortion rights and other women's issues. And Senator D'Amato received nearly 40 percent of the Jewish vote, a remarkably high figure for any Republican. The Senator won a majority of voters of other major religious faiths.
In the House races, two multi-term incumbents were turned out of office. Representative Bill Green, a Republican who represents what is left of Manhattan's Silk Stocking District, was beaten by Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democratic City Councilwoman who was aided by the Clinton landslide.
On Long Island, Thomas J. Downey, a Democrat, was defeated by Rick Lazio, a Suffolk County legislator who made an issue of the fact that the incumbent had several overdrafts at the House bank.
Nydia M. Velasquez, a Democrat from a new district covering parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, became the first woman of Puerto Rican heritage in Congress.

PENNSYLVANIA - CLINTON
Mr. Clinton won Pennsylvania's 23 electoral votes as the coalition of blue-collar Democrats and middle-class suburbanites that had voted for President Bush in 1988 splintered because of concern about the economy.
The President had sought to win rural votes by painting the Democrats as overzealous on gun control and the environment.
Mr. Clinton ran surprisingly well in the Philadelphia suburbs, echoing the 1991 campaign themes of Senator Harris Wofford, whose surprise victory last year over former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had been orchestrated by James Carville, Mr. Clinton's chief strategist. Mr. Perot drew support from coal miners and steel workers in western Pennsylvania, but he may have hurt the President more than Mr. Clinton.
In a closely watched Senate race, Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican considered vulnerable after his questioning of Anita Hill at the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings last year, narrowly defeated Lynn Yeakel, the Democrat. Using an expensive, sharp-edged advertising campaing, Ms. Yeakel tried to link Mr. Specter to the President's economic policies and repeatedly attacked Mr. Specter for humiliating Ms. Hill.
Mr. Specter responded with advertisements calling Ms. Yeakel a one-issue candidate, emphasizing his support for women's issues and attacking her for having failed to pay her Philadelphia income tax until a day before announcing her candidacy.

RHODE ISLAND - CLINTON
As expected, Mr. Clinton did slightly better in Rhode Island than in the rest of the nation, Mr. Bush a bit worse. Mr. Perot attracted the same strong support that he did in other Northeastern states.
Gov. Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat, managed to beat back an anti-incumbency mood and handily defeat his challenger, Elizabeth Ann Leonard, a Republican car dealer, who had been called the "perfect outsider" by the Republican Governors Association.
Representative Ronald K. Machtley, a Republican who unseated a 28-year Democratic Congressman in 1988, overcame a tough re-election challenge from State Senator David R. Carlin Jr. Representative John F. Reed, a Democrat, handily beat his Republican challenger, James W. Bell, a building contractor.

VERMONT - CLINTON
Mr. Clinton became the first Democrat to take Vermont's three electoral votes since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Mr. Perot also did well, as he did throughout New England.
The Democratic Governor, Howard Dean, handily won re-election over State Senator John McClaughry, a Republican, who depicted Mr. Dean as a tax-and-spend liberal. But Mr. Dean's supporters, including prominent Republicans, said he had followed a conservative fiscal plan.
Voters also re-elected Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat, over Secretary of State Jim Douglas, a Republican, and Representative Bernard Sanders, an independent.

WEST VIRGINIA - CLINTON
 A Democratic stronghold where the party controls the Statehouse and enjoys a monopoly in the Congressional delegation, West Virginia, to no one's surprise, handed Mr. Clinton its five electoral votes. Having suffered severe economic problems for the last decade, the state viewed the recession as the rest of the nation simply catching up with the downturn.
Gov. Gaston Caperton, a Democrat, won re-election. He got the job four years ago by campaigning against new taxes, but once in office, he shepherded a $400 million tax bill through the Legislature, alienating many voters, but they apparently forgave him.
His Republican opponent was Cleve Benedict, the state's Agriculture Commissioner. Charlotte Pritt, a Democrat, waged a write-in campaign.
Democrats retained their monopoly on the Congressional delegation, as Representative Nick J. Rahall 2d won his eighth term. He defeated Ben Waldman, a Republican who had worked in the White House for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush.

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 4

 BODY:
The Hollywood stars were streaming into the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles on the warm night of June 2 to see and be seen with Bill Clinton, who had just wrapped up the Democratic nomination for President. The Clinton California primary victory party was the hottest ticket in town.
But upstairs in the Governor's suite, Mr. Clinton was frustrated, his advisers depressed. The Wednesday morning headlines would proclaim him the winner, but a fatally wounded one. In a politically debilitating turn of events, polls showed Mr. Clinton running a distant third behind the shiny, new independent candidacy of Ross Perot. It looked as if the party might be over before it had properly begun. 
 "We had hit the worst of all possible junctures," recalled Paul Begala, a Clinton strategist who went out for a rare stiff drink that night with his partner, James Carville. "Voters knew all the bad and none of the good."
The campaign's success in changing the course of this year's tumultuous campaign resulted from stern discipline, a measure of dumb luck and a nearly naive sense of purpose that fueled Mr. Clinton's pursuit of the Presidency.
Mr. Clinton overcame extraordinary political adversity by plotting his objectives far in advance and presenting the electorate with a threatening vision of the consequences of re-electing President Bush -- for the economy, for domestic tranquillity and for Washington gridlock.
"The very future of the American dream is at stake," he warned last spring. He was determined not to repeat the mistakes Senator Al Gore, another Southerner, had made when seeking the Presidency in 1988 by failing to plan beyond a sweep of Southern states in the Super Tuesday primaries. Mr. Clinton assembled a circle of victory-hungry strategists and advisers who were determined to establish the Arkansas Governor as a viable candidate nationwide.
The Clinton forces also set themselves the task of overcoming the stigma of the Democratic Party as the home of losers and liberals. What some viewed as a repudiation of traditional party principles were defined instead as an effort to broaden the party.
And when the campaign began to flounder, as on that night in California, Clinton strategists, including his media adviser, Mandy Grunwald, pushed forward on another front: linking Mr. Clinton to pop culture through appearances on the Arsenio Hall show, MTV and the Nashville Network.
In the end, the candidate and his staff hammered out a strategy that looked stubbornly ahead, even during their bleakest moments.
 
Two Miscalculations: Vietnam and Hillary
 In retrospect, Clinton campaign aides now say, it became clear shortly after the Republican Convention that the prize was in their grasp. It was the spectacle in Houston that, in their view, flattened Mr. Bush. Long on conservative rhetoric, the convention was also short on the sort of specifics the Democrats had decided voters wanted to hear.
The mistakes are easy to chronicle.
One of the biggest was Mr. Clinton's failure to appreciate the danger posed by his incomplete explanations of how he had avoided military service during the Vietnam War. Campaign staff members said they gravely miscalculated the damage the draft issue could do to Mr. Clinton's credibility.
During a campaign strategy session in December 1991, Mr. Clinton and his aide, Betsey Wright, asserted that questions about the candidate's draft status had been resolved previously in state campaigns and would be no problem in 1992. Mr. Clinton was adamant that no further research be conducted on the matter, the staff members said.
But for all the problems that the draft issue caused Mr. Clinton, it never became the weapon the Republicans hoped it would be.
Still, there were other perilous miscalculations. For example, Hillary Clinton, who had originally been considered an unqualified benefit to the ticket, faltered when she defended her career with a disparaging aside about women who stay home to "bake cookies and have teas."
"That was a self-inflicted wound," Mrs. Clinton said in an interview this week. "It just was something I had to learn about. That was a learning process for me."
Yet is instructive to note that when Mr. Clinton's closest advisers are asked to name the lowest moments of the Democrat's campaign this year, they do not immediately mention the embarrassments and notoriety over rumors of marital infidelity, the Vietnam-era draft or Mr. Clinton's marijuana, each of which at times threatened to engulf the campaign.
Instead, they talk about the success and failures of their message and how they chose to deliver it. In the end, when they stuck to their message, they overcame their mistakes.
 
Long-Term Strategy: Fix What Is Broken
 One of the most frustrating moments for Mr. Clinton during this year's campaign had nothing to do with the character questions that President Bush would later use against him. It occurred when he found himself battling his competitors for the hearts of the middle class.
Paul Tsongas, Jerry Brown and Ross Perot all proved to be threats. And as each of these slightly offbeat candidates took his turn as prime challenger, the campaign's internal polling showed that Mr. Clinton's negative ratings among voters began to rise correspondingly.
In rapid succession, Mr. Clinton appropriated their messages, railing against Washington and making his prescription for change more somber. But to hear Mr. Clinton talk about it at the time, it would have been easy to believe that each small calibration was his own idea.
"One of the things I've learned in this business is make your own strategy, try to stick to it, hope for the best, assume the worst, and go on," Mr. Clinton said in an interview in March.
He had barely finished elbowing his way to a second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary in February before he started taking aim at Georgia and South Carolina. And by the time the letdown of the California primary victory had passed, the campaign's top advisers had already retreated to Little Rock to begin planning the general election.
"There had been a lot of discussions in May about what we would do in June," Hillary Clinton said. "We assumed we would win the nomination. And we remembered what Bush did to Dukakis in June."
By anticipating the worst of the attacks, the Clinton campaign's vaunted quick-response team deflected nearly everything the Republicans threw at them. "We killed their attacks before they went national, and by the time they went into their convention, their biggest attack was Hillary," George Stephanopoulos, the campaign's communications director, said. "Bingo."
The Democrats also quickly realized they had to repair their candidate's image.
Hillary Clinton said she was "stunned' when internal polls showed that most people thought she and her husband were childless. Instantly, 12-year-old Chelsea appeared with her parents on the cover of People magazine.
The same polls showed no one knew much of anything about Mr. Clinton except for the soap operas of the primaries, which had become fodder for late-night comedians. On Arsenio Hall, they learned he played the saxophone. On MTV, they learned he could sometimes laugh about himself. On morning talk shows and in televised town meetings in targeted states, they heard about health care, educational opportunity and life after the cold war.
Some of Mr. Clinton's advisers thought the whole thing not very Presidential, but using the pop-culture approach was also a purposeful -- and ultimately successful -- attempt to circumvent mainstream press coverage, which the Clintons and their advisers were convinced would endlessly rehash debilitating controversies.
Not all the surprises were bad. Even Mr. Clinton's most forward-thinking strategists had not predicted the galvanizing effect Mr. Gore and his picture-perfect family would have on the ticket.
Although Mr. Gore was limited as a Presidential candidate in 1988 and sometimes long-winded as a Vice-Presidential candidate this year, his presence on the ticket was an unalloyed benefit.
The pictures that emerged from their joint bus trips were effective television images, and Tipper Gore's friendliness on the stump blunted Hillary Clinton's sharp edges as the two giggled together like old cheerleader buddies.
Al From, the executive director of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, said that in choosing another Southerner as his running mate rather than reaching for geographical balance, Mr. Clinton signaled that he meant it when he said he was an unconventional Democrat.
 
Waiting for Attacks Or Signs of Strategy
 Clinton advisers seemed in a state of perpetual surprise over the Republican Party's failure to mount an effective and consistent counterattack.
"They did not a thing, to our great delight," said Ms. Grunwald.
David Wilhelm, the architect of Mr. Clinton's state-by-state strategy, said the campaign targeted 32 states with 376 electoral votes, calculating each state's historical performance in Presidential elections -- something they called the "Southernness factor" -- to gauge Mr. Clinton's regional appeal, to plan where to travel, and more important, to decide where to spend advertising money.
The top tier of states the Democrats aimed for and won were Delaware. Maryland, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Shunning network television advertising in favor of state purchases, gave them "gubernatorial level" campaigns at each crucial state, Ms. Grunwald said.
A discordant Republican convention and a listless performance by the President during the debates, particularly his groping response to a question about how the recession had affected him personally, infused the Clinton strategists with confidence.
"When Bush couldn't answer that question, the whole campaign exhaled," said Mr. Stephanopoulos.
 
Assembling Victory From Puzzle Pieces
 Mr. Clinton's victory is a paradox, a hard-won political victory that contradicted the year's conventional wisdom: Voters despised politics but elected a man who had been steeped in political ambition ever since he shook President Kennedy's hand.
This was supposed to be the year that questions of character were to determine the campaign's outcome. But voters elected a man who was forced to answer questions about marital infidelity on national television, who avoided the military draft and who shaded the truth about whether he used had drugs as a student.
All of this turned out to be largely beside the point on Election Day because, as it turned out, Mr. Clinton's timing was impeccable.
Like Ronald Reagan, he sought the Presidency in a year when the country was struggling with a weakened economy and when the incumbent President was perceived as ineffectual on the matters that counted most.
Also like Mr. Reagan, he ran as a can-do governor who promised to move his own party in a different direction. For a Democrat who had worked for George McGovern in 1972, Mr. Clinton did a remarkable job of transforming himself into a moderate who rejected the overtly liberal orthodoxy that had cost his party every Presidential election, save one, since 1964.
"I remind you again tonight, my fellow Americans, that this victory was more than a victory of party," Mr. Clinton told his jubilant supporters late Tuesday night as they shivered in the cold outside the pristine Old State House here. "It was a victory for the people who work hard and play by the rules, a victory for the people who feel left out and left behind and want to do better, a victory for the people who are ready to compete and win in the global economy but who need a government that offers a hand, not a hand-out."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 ELECTIONS: THE REGION -- THE JOBS BOND ACT;
Jobs Delayed After Failure Of Bond Act

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Local officials throughout New York State yesterday were placing some public works projects on hold and making plans to scale down or stretch out others after voters' rejection of Proposal One.
A pillar of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's strategy for stimulating the New York economy, the proposal called for issuing $800 million in state bonds. The money would have been used to help finance projects like sewage and water systems, roads, sidewalks, ports and waterfront projects, business parks and parking garages. 
 For Mr. Cuomo, it was the second time in two years that a bond proposal he pushed was defeated. Voters rejected a $1.98 billion environmental bond act in 1990. Proposal One was rejected on Tuesday by 56 percent of the voters, with 96 percent of the precincts counted.
On WAMC-FM radio yesterday in Albany Mr. Cuomo said, "It's not good for New York that the bond act was defeated."
"We needed those thousands of jobs," he said, as well as the taxes that "that economic activity would have generated."
 
'Don't Borrow, Period'
 In an interview later, he said he believed a main reason for the defeat was a general public attitude against government borrowing and spending. "What I think it comes down to," the Governor said, "is people saying, 'These are hard times, we've just seen Perot and this discussion about the deficit and spending. We don't trust the government to spend and borrow. So don't borrow, period.' "
Mr. Cuomo also bitterly accused State Comptroller Edward V. Regan of generating "terrible confusion" among voters by tying the bond issue to his fight for changing the way the state borrows.
The bond issue money was intended to pay only part of cost of each project. Without it, however, some of them -- like a bio-science park in the Bronx and repairs and improvements of piers at the South Street Seaport and the Brooklyn Army Terminal -- will be put on hold. Others, like a parking garage and a development in Mount Vernon and improvements for the Harlem River rail yard, will be reduced in scope or built more slowly.
Some projects will go forward with other financing, like road improvements for a new mall in White Plains and the reconstruction of the Staten Island ferry terminal in Manhattan.
Mr. Cuomo's economic development experts predicted that the spending would have created nearly 35,000 temporary construction-related jobs and, over the long term, would have resulted in more than 122,000 permanent private-sector jobs by enticing more business to the state.
By several measures, New York's tax-supported debt of $24.29 billion is one of the highest in the nation. Voters apparently did not believe Mr. Cuomo's assertion that the bond issue would not end up costing them because it would more than pay for itself by generating economic activity that would produce $2 in taxes for every $1 borrowed and invested.
In assessing the vote, Mr. Cuomo said there was a lot of opposition upstate and guessed it stemmed from traditional resentment against spending programs that heavily benefit the downstate area.
Of the $558 million that had been designated for specific projects, nearly $234 million would have gone to New York City; $85.1 million to Nassau and Suffolk counties; $26.3 million to Westchester County, and $7.6 million to Rockland County.
In interviews, some voters said they were worried that the money would go to pork-barrel projects.
"Certainly it might have been more helpful if we had more detail out there earlier," said James L. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association, a business and civic organization. He was a leader of the movement to win voter approval. The list of some 390 projects was not released until Oct. 23.
Opponents of the proposal included conservative organizations that advocated a smaller more efficient government, rural groups generally opposed to state borrowing, environmentalists who argued the projects would harm wetlands and would increase road travel and Mr. Regan.
Mr. Regan said yesterday that he had accomplished his goal. "Reform of the way the state borrows is on the agenda," he said. "I'd like to see it in the next legislative session."
He wants to increase the right of voters to authorize state borrowing, to subject borrowing legislation to greater public scrutiny and to stop using government authorities to borrow money for things that have nothing to do with them.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 ELECTIONS: PRESIDENT-ELECT -- THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton, Savoring Victory, Starts Sizing Up Job Ahead

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
After an election whose results rang with a cry for change but offered no specific mandate, President-elect Bill Clinton set to work shaping his new Administration yesterday, huddling with his transition team, issuing a scarcely veiled warning to Iraq and promising that over the next six months, he would "focus like a laser beam on this economy."
The 46-year-old Mr. Clinton committed his Administration not only to ending the lingering recession, but also to lifting the nation to a higher level of economic productivity for years to come. 
 "My immediate job is, yes, to get us us out of this recession, but to do it with a long-term strategy that will lead to real income growth, so that you won't have people in 10 years working longer work weeks for lower wages than they made 10 years ago," he said in an interview with ABC News.
Earlier in the day in Little Rock, Mr. Clinton briefly turned his attention to foreign policy. Amid word that supporters of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq were rejoicing over his victory, he told reporters: "The greatest gesture of good will any nation can make to me during this period is to continue full cooperation with our President, George Bush."
Aides said that Mr. Clinton had worried for some time that Mr. Hussein might be tempted into some new adventure by a changeover in Washington, and that today's declaration was a signal to the Iraqi leader and others not to try. [Page B10.]
Mr. Bush, only the fourth elected President in this century to seek a second term and lose, flew from his hometown, Houston, back to Washington to begin winding down a dozen years of Republican rule in the White House. He told a flag-waving crowd, "Let's finish this job with style."
With almost all the popular votes counted, the Arkansas Governor had 43 percent, the President had 38 percent and Ross Perot had 19 percent -- the best showing by an independent or third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt polled 27 percent on the Bull Moose ticket in 1912. It was a broad-based, decisive victory, if not a crushing one, for Mr. Clinton.
Sweeping the New England states, the three on the Pacific coast and the big industrial states in the Middle Atlantic region and the Middle West, Mr. Clinton also cut sharply into the Republican bastions of recent years in the South and the Rocky Mountains. That gave him 370 electoral votes to 168 for Mr. Bush, who took Texas and Florida by narrow margins, and none for Mr. Perot.
It was Mr. Perot's powerful run that confused the message of the election. A large majority rejected Mr. Bush and thus backed change, but it was divided on who was the better agent of change.Surveys of voters leaving the polls showed that many people had serious doubts about all three candidates, including the winner.
 
Third Party Considered
 Orson G. Swindle 3d, the head of the national Perot supporters' group, suggested that he and others might consider forming a third party to press their candidate's program, especially quick reduction of the deficit.
The big turnout on Tuesday, which was expected to reach about 55 percent of those eligible, reflected the widespread interest generated by a campaign that was waged on television talk shows and radio call-in programs as well as more conventional information media. In 1988, barely 50 percent voted.
Mr. Clinton made no appointments to his nascent Administration today, but aides said he would do so soon. He must also establish a sense of direction. Will he offer gestures to a variety of groups that supported him, as has been his past pattern, for example, or will he heed the famous maxim of the one-time French Prime Minister, Pierre Mendes-France, that "to govern is to choose"?
 
Economic Stimulus
 Among the items that he placed at the top of his agenda during the long campaign are an economic stimulus package, including large-scale public construction projects, a comprehensive health-care program, a family leave law, educational initiatives and campaign-finance reform.
It is far from clear, however, how Mr. Clinton will pay for all that while also beginning to reduce the mushrooming Federal deficit.
The President-elect's party will control both houses of the new Congress, though anti-incumbent sentiment proved less virulent than expected. Threatened Senators from John Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, to Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican, managed somehow to survive. Roughly 93 percent of all the House incumbents who sought re-election achieved it.
The Democrats scored a net gain of one Senate seat, if Senator Wyche Fowler Jr., a Democrat, holds his seat in a runoff in Georgia on Nov. 24, and lost fewer than 10 in the House.
But there will still be significant change on Capitol Hill. The Congress that assembles next year will have 39 black members, compared with 25 now, and it will include Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first black woman ever elected to the Senate. It will also include 17 Hispanic lawmakers, compared with 10, and the first American Indian elected to the Senate in more than 60 years, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Democrat.
Women did very well indeed in the Year of the Woman. There will be 47 female House members next year, compared with 28 at present, and six female Senators, by far the largest number in history.
Mr. Bush's plans for the 77 days left in his Presidency are not clear. Yesterday he vetoed a bill that would have given tax breaks to businesses willing to invest in poor neighborhoods, complaining about tax increases included in the same legislation. A vacation trip next week, to a destination not yet decided, was said to be a possibility, but a planned trip to Moscow has been scrubbed, White House officials said.
"I can think of nothing other to say then let's finish this job with style," the President told the loyalists who gathered on the White House lawn to welcome him and his wife, Barbara, back to Washington. "Let's get the job done, cooperate fully with the new Administration. The Government goes on, as well it should."
Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader, who was described by an aide yesterday as "the most powerful Republican in Washington now," served notice that there would be no rubber-stamping of Mr. Clinton's legislative proposals.
"He didn't get a majority," Mr. Dole said in an interview. "The country obviously didn't want Bush, but they weren't ready for Perot and they had plenty of doubts about Clinton. They want change. Well, we want to be responsible and deliver change, whatever that means, but we're skeptical, so we'll wait and see."
Mr. Clinton was in a reassuring mood when he and the Vice President-elect, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, met with a small group of reporters. Mr. Clinton read a relatively brief prepared statement and answered no questions.
For the benefit of Mr. Hussein and anyone else who might need reminding, the Arkansas Democrat, whose lack of foreign-policy experience was a campaign issue, said that "the greatest mistake any adversary could make would be to doubt America's resolve in this period of transition."
 
Soothing Financial Markets
 For businessmen and the financial markets, Mr. Clinton said, "We understand the need to pursue stability even as we pursue growth," and added, "the changes I seek will strengthen America's market systems, not weaken them."
Mr. Clinton has about 8,500 Federal jobs to fill with political appointees, including 16 cabinet posts.
Mickey Kantor, a Los Angeles lawyer who served as campaign chairman and who has been mentioned as a possible White House chief of staff, said key Administration appointments would be announced later this week. But other aides emphasized Mr. Clinton's deliberate work habits, as exemplified in his choice of a running mate last summer.
Either Mr. Kantor or Eli Siegel, who also played a major part in the campaign, is expected to head be chosen as transition chief of staff.
 
Pausing to Look Back
 In addition to looking forward -- Mr. Bush said he planned to "get very active in the grandchild business" -- the Democrats and the Republicans also paused for a moment to look back.
James Carville, one of Mr. Clinton's principal strategists, said at a briefing for reporters that Mr. Bush's criticisms of the Democrat had hurt, but that toward the end, "his attacks didn't have the same pop." Like a boxer's, he said, the President's "hands got heavy."
On the Republican side, Vice President Dan Quayle, whose chances of winning his party's 1996 Presidential nomination were sharply curtailed by Tuesday's results, blamed the state of the economy and the quality of the Republican campaign for the loss.
"Bill Clinton ran a much better campaign and the economy wasn't good," the Vice President said.
 An explanation with the table misstated the pattern of votes by sex since 1980. Women have given the Democrats more Presidential votes than men have.
A list of the new United States Senate on Thursday misstated the political affiliation of Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming in some copies. He is a Republican.
A map showing Congressional results around the country misstated some political affiliations in some copies. Republicans, not Democrats, won the Eighth Congressional District in Chicago, the Fifth and Sixth Congressional Districts of Louisiana and the Seventh Congressional District in Michigan; a Democrat, not a Republican, won the Seventh District in Wisconsin.
The map also referred erroneously to control of the 26th Congressional District in New York; it was gained by the Democrats in this election.
Because of a transmission error, a table of returns for the New York State Senate and Assembly omitted votes for Mary B. Goodhue, a State Senate candidate from District 37 in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties. She received 15,471 votes and came in third. The table also misstated the winner for Assembly District 57 in Brooklyn. He was Roger Green.

 CORRECTION:
A table on Thursday headed "Portrait of the Electorate," based on a survey of voters leaving polling places around the country, misstated the support for President Bush among female college graduates in some copies. The poll showed it at 35 percent, not 3 percent.
The table also misstated the vote among black women for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. It was 90 percent, not 9 percent.

Table: "Portrait of the Electorate"
 This portrait of Americans at the polls shows how different groups have voted in the last five presidential elections, measuring the ebbs and flows of political alliances that have elected, and defeated, Presidents. The vast size of each sample makes it possible to study the preferences of some groups, such as Jews, Asians, and Hispanic voters, whose small numbers make them almost invisible in typical national telephone polls.
 
Sex and Age
As they have ever since 1980, women gave the Democratic candidate more votes than the Republican. In particular, Clinton did best with black women, getting 86 percent of their votes. And while he did no better with women of a either political particular party than with men of that same party, he got more support from independent women than from independent men.
The Democratic candidate captured more young voters than either of his opponents, for the first time since 1976. Beginning with Ronald Reagan, Republicans had made inroads among younger voters that led them to hope that a political realignment was under way in the nation. Clinton also led among the oldest voters, which Democrats failed to do in 1976, 1980, 1984 or 1988.
 
Coalitions
 In many ways, the components of Clinton's plurality coalition resembled the old New Deal coalition. He did best among the poor, among Jews, blacks and Catholics, among union members and liberals. But Clinton also did well among independents, and moderates, and middle income groups that Democratic Presidential candidates have had difficulty attracting during the past 12 years. But since Democrats remain the biggest political grouping in the electorate, it may have been even more important that he commanded as much loyalty from Democrats as President Bush did from Republicans. Previous Democratic presidential candidates -- Jimmy Carter in 1976 or 1980, Walter Mondale in 1984 and Michael Dukakis in 1988 -- failed to do as well in their party as their Republican opponents did in theirs.
President Bush held the backing of conservatives, and was strong among the affluent, and among white Protestants, all traditional elements of the Republican coalition.
Ross Perot got about one fifth of the votes cast Tuesday, and was strongest among independents of both sexes, where he got almost as much support as Mr. Bush and did not lag far behind Mr. Clinton. Perot did well among young men and groups in the middle ranges of income and education. He got very little support from blacks.
 
The Pocketbook
 Presidential elections are often about the economy, and recessions are the most frequent cause of defeats for incumbents. In 1984, Ronald Reagan won as the economy boomed, getting the votes of 86 percent of people who thought their financial situation was improving. This time, Mr. Bush got the votes of 62 percent of such people, but they amounted to only a quarter of the electorate, a much smaller share than in 1984. Among the third of voters who said they were worse off in 1992, Mr. Clinton got 61 percent, and the two candidates split the votes of people who thought their situations had not changed.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 ELECTIONS: THE STATES -- THE GOVERNORS;
Democrats Gain, but With Little Pattern

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
Democrats won eight of the 12 gubernatorial races Tuesday, picking up two additional seats to give them a total of 30.
 But on a day when another Democrat swept to victory as President, the races for governor were decided less by Bill Clinton's strength than by local issues and personalities and traditional voting habits. In several states, voters elected a governor of one party while favoring a president of another. 
Thad Beyle, a professor political science at the University of North Carolina, said the very lack of a pattern in the outcome of the governors' races may reflect the changes forced on the states in the Reagan and Bush Administrations as the Federal Government reduced its aid to the states while making them assume more of the burden for social programs.
 "So many problems are now ending up on governors' desks that to a certain extent what hapens at the national level is very separate," Professor Beyle, a specialist on governors, said.
 
Incumbents Triumph
 Democrats won all four of the governors' races where they were incumbents, including Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana, Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, Gov. Bruce Sundlun of Rhode Island and Gov. Gaston Caperton of West Virginia.
 Mr. Bayh, at 36 years old the nation's youngest Governor, won by a record margin of 63 percent to 37 percent in a state that President Bush carried. And Mr. Dean took 75 percent of the vote to 23 percent for John McClaughry, a state legislator.
 Democrats also wrested control of the governor's mansion from Republicans in Delaware, Missouri and North Carolina.
 The North Carolina result was a personal trimuph for Jim Hunt, a two-term Governor who had lost a bitter campaign to unseat Senator Jesse Helms in 1984. While returning Mr. Hunt to the Governor's Mansion, voters backed President Bush and also ousted the state's Democratic Senator.
 
Gain by Republicans
 Republicans regained a state house in North Dakota, where Ed Schafer, a 46 year-old businessman, campaigned as a leader who could create jobs in a state with a shrinking economy.
 Ideologically, there were few surprises on Tuesday. For example, Utah, one of the most conservative states, gave a victory to Mike Leavitt, a 41-year-old Republican.
In New Hampshire, the most reliably Republican state in the northeast, Steve Merrill, a Republican and a former state Attorney General, defeated Deborah Arnesen, a state legislator, even though Mr. Clinton narrowly carried the state. Ms. Arnesen took the daring but fatal step of proposing a state income tax to reform New Hampshire's archaic tax structure.
 New Hampshire is one of only two states with neither a state income tax or sales tax, and candidates for years have taken what is known as "the pledge" not to propose a statewide tax. Mr. Merrill took the pledge, and won 56 percent of the vote.
 On the opposite side of the country, in more liberal Washington, a former Democrat Mike Lowry, was elected governor despite saying that higher taxes might be needed gto balance the state budget. His opponent, State Attorney General Kenneth Eikenberry, opposed any tax increase.
 
Bot Sides Claim Success
 All three women running for governor lost, a contrast to Tuesday's national trend of more victories by female candidates. The losers were Ms. Arnesen, Dorothy Bradley, a Montana Democrat, and Elizabeth Leonard, a Rhode Island Republican.
 Nationally, Republican and Democratic party officials both claimed victory from the contests for governor.
 "Our odds were uphill from the beginning," said Chris Henick, the executive director of the Republican Governors Association. Mr. Henick noted that for the first time since 1900 there were no incumbent Republican Governors seeking re-election, either because they decided to retire or because they had reached the end of their term limits. By contrast, there were four Democratic incumbents, who all won.
 In Mr. Henick's view, Republican victories in four of the eight races without incumbents, while Mr. Clinton piled up a large victory nationally, represented success. "I'll punch that dance card anytime," he said.
 But Katherine Whelan, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, said Tuesday's results were "a vote of confidence in the Democratic Party."
 "The message is, Democrats do a great job governing," Ms. Whelan said.

Statehood and Puerto Rico
 SAN JUAN, P.R. (AP) -- As a result of elections on Tuesday, supporters of making Puerto Rico the 51st state are in their strongest position ever, with a new Governor and control of the island's legislature.
 Gov.-elect Pedro Rossello, who defeated the pro-commonwealth ruling party's candidate, has promised to hold a plebiscite within a year on statehood.
 Surveys indicate Puerto Ricans are split between those who want statehood and those who favor maintaining the 40-year-old commonwealth status. About 5 percent back full independence. The plebiscite would include all three options.

HEADLINE: Review/Music;
A Young Group Explores the New World

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
For all its financial and demographic problems, the American orchestra is still an object of envy elsewhere in the world. Technically superior, quick to learn, flexible in its response to different styles and relatively unencumbered by bureaucratic intrigue, this home-grown urban institution has done as much as any European one to uphold a European tradition.
Now to find American symphonic music worthy of its time. The New World Symphony under Michael Tilson Thomas attempted something of the kind at Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday afternoon. Two of the pieces were by Argentines, but both demonstrated the long arm of North American culture and the powerful African influences that all of the Americas share. 
 It was a program suited to this young group from Miami. Now five years old, the New World Symphony is a kind of postgraduate school with practical applications. It nurtures new conservatory graduates and creates full seasons of professional concerts, tours and recordings.
The four dances from Ginastera's ballet "Estancia" shared with Broadway and the American marching band a love of brass-heavy loudness, a nasty brilliance that mixes optimism with the sarcastic. Also held in common was the use of melody and accompaniment in their most innocent forms. The rhythmic basis was Latin, not black American, but the legitimization, indeed the celebration of vulgarity were qualities with which both ends of this continent could feel at home.
The tone of Astor Piazzolla's "Tangazo" was familiar to anyone who frequents American movies. Here the tango is subjected to dark Wagnerian brooding and then picked apart with cute orchestral flourishes. Unfortunately, there is not enough music in "Tangazo" to support all the inflations and manipulations.
Gershwin's Second Rhapsody would have added a decided American weight to this concert had it not labored so industriously in behalf of European models. There are bright and wonderful moments in it but also a troubling amount of self-conscious gesturing in the direction of Grieg and Rachmaninoff. Mr. Thomas played the difficult piano part himself. He is a talented Sunday pianist, guilty of a few cloudy episodes and a generally thin tone but quite capable of getting through everything else.
The afternoon was really about the Ives Fourth Symphony, a triumph both for what it had to say and for the way it was played. With his celestial (first balcony) harps and strings, the free-for-all competitions within the orchestra and the sophisticated fugue of the third movement, Ives asks questions about the meaning of life that incorporate the naivete of an old-fashioned grange tableau, belly-laugh humor and a deep and worldly sense of regret.
The New World players and the collaborating Penn State Concert Choir have grown up mastering a European style but they have also had rock music, in all its preciseness of movement, sounding around them. With Mr. Thomas's help, they made Ives's hopeless entanglements into clear-cut battles. Having sections of players rise and play standing at key moments reinforced the admirable clarity of this performance.

HEADLINE: The Art Market;
Auction Houses Await The Upturn

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
IT has been a tense few months at Christie's and Sotheby's. With the art market struggling to inch its way out of a two-year recession, putting together the fall sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art hasn't been easy. Many sellers are still holding back, hoping that the market will show signs of a recovery, so it is estate property that the auction houses count on most. Until just weeks ago, when the catalogues had to go to press, the two companies were vying for what little hot property was available.
While the pickings seem slim, the quality is not. Indeed, the 1,260 works up for sale in the next two weeks include some of the strongest paintings, drawings and sculptures to come on the market since 1990. The works go on public view this weekend at Sotheby's and Christie's in Manhattan, beginning tomorrow at 10 A.M. 
 But in this delicate economy, it is hard to predict how the art, conservatively estimated to be worth about $220 million, will fare when the bidding starts on Tuesday night. Most experts are reluctant to speculate whether these sales will signal an upturn in the market.
"It's going to be a slow road back," said Diana D. Brooks, president and chief executive of Sotheby's in North and South America. "Since we are not expecting much dealer participation, the key to the success of these sales will be the private buyers. And until the night of the sale, it's hard to know whether or not they will actually be putting their hands in the air and bidding."
Lucy Mitchell-Innes, who heads Sotheby's contemporary-art division, said the initial response from collectors had encouraged her to hope that "the stage fright of the last two years has worn off."
Many experts say they have not seen a big change in the market since the last round of major auctions six months ago. "There is still a fair amount of estate property that is reasonably estimated and fresh to the market," said Christopher Burge, president and chief executive of Christie's in New York. Experts at both houses reluctantly concede that a certain number of "retreads," or works that have been up for sale recently, are inevitable in the current economic climate.
Surprisingly, while the auction houses have tried to keep estimates down, there are far more works valued over $1 million this fall than there have been since 1990. While this expensive property is mostly from estates, the question is whether collectors who have made bargain hunting a serious sport for the last two years are willing to spend many millions on one work of art. In May, when prices began to climb into seven figures, bidding tended to stop dead.
"Clearly the waters will be tested for the $2 million-plus paintings," said Michael Findlay, who heads Christie's department of Impressionist and modern art.
In addition to pricier pictures, there is a definite change in the complexion of both auctions, the Impressionist and modern sales and the contemporary. In May, the catalogues of Impressionist and modern works were heavily tipped toward modern art. This season, there are a significant number of Impressionist paintings, works by artists like Monet, Degas, Renoir and Pissaro, whose dollar values have fallen further in the last two years than those of their modern counterparts. "Clearly, we will see what the new level of the Impressionist market will be," Mr. Findlay said.
But he added that the increase in Impressionist works coming on the block was a happy accident. "In a buyer's market, which this one is, often the very best works come up for sale not by design, but by chance -- largely through estates," he said.
Monet's "Waterlily Basin," from 1919, a star of Christie's Impressionist and modern sale, for example, is from the estate of Ralph Friedman, a Manhattan philanthropist and a former director of Bank Leumi Le Israel's North American operations. Christie's issued a separate catalogue to show off the painting, but, playing it safe, won't say what the work may fetch. The catalogue entry reads "estimate on request," and officials at the auction house tell collectors they think the painting should bring about $7 million or $8 million when it goes on the block on Tuesday.
"There hasn't been a waterlilies on the market like this in over 15 years," Mr. Findlay said. "It's one of the few such works that Monet signed and dated when he sold it to his dealers in 1919." And unlike the oversize paintings of waterlilies that one sees at museums, this is 39 1/2 by 79 inches, and so comfortably fits into a home.
The contemporary offerings have changed, too. "It's a more balanced selection, covering four decades across the board," said Diane Upright, who heads the contemporary-art department at Christie's. "This is the first time in 18 months we have seen the Abstract Expressionists up for sale."
Works by artists like Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still and Mark Rothko are finding their way to auction again. Ms. Upright said that one Pollock, "No. 6, 1948: Blue, Red, Yellow," with an estimate of $2.5 million to $3.5 million, "comes from a private source, has never been on the market before and, most importantly, is of superb quality."
"Last year," she added, "it would have been impossible to have convinced anyone to sell a work of this caliber."
At Sotheby's, Ms. Mitchell-Innes suggested that these significant works were finding their way to auction now because the market had loosened up. "Collectors have lived with the headache of the recession for long enough," she said. "They have become accustomed to the lower prices and want to change their collections." These sellers are also often people who bought the works so long ago they can't help but make a profit.
Many sellers in the contemporary-art market are familiar figures in business. Rothko's "Untitled," from 1957, which is on the cover of Christie's catalogue, is being sold by Marshall Cogan, the New York financier. The work, which carries an estimate of $1.2 million to $1.6 million, is in flawless condition, but art-world experts say it has been offered for sale privately for more than a year. Another highlight of the Christie's sale is Robert Rauschenberg's "Studio Painting," from 1960-61, which is expected to bring more than $3 million. The work belongs to Asher Edelman, a Swiss-based businessman.
At Sotheby's, the seller with the biggest name is easily its chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, who is selling three works from his personal collection: Still's "1947-K," expected to bring $1.5 million to $2 million; Franz Kline's "Elizabeth," from 1958, expected to bring $1.75 million to $2 million, and "Eta," painted by Morris Louis in 1961 and expected to bring $250,000 to $300,000. It is thought that Mr. Taubman is trying to raise money because of today's real-estate market.
Another seller at Sotheby's is Raymond J. Learsy, a New York businessman and collector, who is changing his collection from paintings to drawings. He is offering 11 works by artists including Gerhard Richter, Chuck Close and Julian Schnabel, worth $1.7 million to $2.3 million. And the London-based advertising magnate Charles Saatchi is once again the staple of Sotheby's sale, as he has been for the last year. This year Mr. Saatchi is selling art by such artists as Malcolm Morley, Mr. Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol and Cy Twombly.
Of all the Saatchi property, Warhol's "Marilyn X 100," from 1962, is considered so important by Sotheby's that it has its own catalogue. "Of all the subjects that Warhol painted, I think that the Marilyn is the one that commands the most attention and has the most appeal," Ms. Mitchell-Innes said. "The only other one of this scale is in the Tate Gallery in London."
While Sotheby's is reluctant to put a value on the work, Ms. Mitchell-Innes said she hoped it would set a record at the auction on Nov. 17, exceeding the more than $4 million that a single "Red Shot Marilyn" fetched at Christie's in 1989.
In this season, it should come as no surprise that the one artist hogging the limelight at both auction houses is Matisse. It has been years since a great Matisse has found its way to auction, but now a total of 28 paintings, sketches and sculptures by the artist are up for sale. Collectors as well as a museum are hoping to cash in on the success of the Matisse retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. Purely by coincidence, two estates also feature important Matisses.
Three paintings are coming down from the walls of the Modern's show just in time for the viewing this weekend and the auctions on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then will be returned to the exhibition until its end on Jan. 12.
Sotheby's and Christie's are each featuring a star Matisse. At Christie's, "Harmony in Yellow," from 1927-28, is expected to bring $5 million to $7 million. The work belongs to Dr. Philip Sandbloom, a Swedish collector. At Sotheby's, "L'Asie," from 1911-12, is being sold by the estate of the fashion designer Mollie Parnis Livingston. It is expected to bring $7 million to $8 million.
To snag the Parnis estate, which also includes paintings by Picasso, Josef Albers and Marsden Hartley, Sotheby's offered Mrs. Livingston an advance, contingent on her promise to consign the property to Sotheby's after her death. She died last summer.
Christie's has also offered advances to sellers. Officials there declined to discuss the subject, but the word in the art world is that the auction house has promised an advance to the heirs of the composer Richard Rodgers and his wife, Dorothy. The property, which also has an important Matisse, is being sold at the Christie's Impressionist and modern art sale.
As the viewing begins, it is the private American collector who appears to be the most likely buyer. "I see many of the people who felt squeezed out of the market by the high prices in 1989 back and interested again," said Mr. Findlay at Christie's. And for bargain hunters, this is one of the last chances to bid before Sotheby's raises its buyer's premium, the commission it charges buyers, to 15 percent from 10 percent on Jan. 1.
"I believe this season will be one of the great buying opportunities for people with courage," said Mr. Nash from Sotheby's. "Bad times like this only last a short while."

HEADLINE: Clinton Gets A Letter From Dinkins

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Now that he has "a friend in the White House," Mayor David N. Dinkins is wasting no time trying to capitalize on that friendship, writing President-elect Bill Clinton to tout some of New York City's programs as national models and urging him to spend billions more on urban centers.
Most of Mr. Dinkins's 24-page letter, written less than a day after the polls closed, amounted to a plea for more Federal financing for housing, bridges, roads, health care, schools, job training, police officers and drug treatment. He also asked for the passage of legislation he supports that has been mired in Congress, including a Federal ban on machine guns, bigger tax credits for the poor and a broad-based energy tax. 
 The Mayor urged Mr. Clinton to use several of the city's fledgling programs as models for national initiatives. Specifically, he suggested Mr. Clinton examine the New York police force's "community policing" program, the city's plan to build 20 new neighborhood health clinics that will provide primary care to the poor and its special schools that function as community centers after hours.
Tim Wright, the Clinton campaign's director for domestic policy, said Mr. Clinton had received the letter and that it appeared to include many ideas the President-elect had already said he supported.
Mr. Wright said it was too early to tell what, if any, of the city's programs might be adopted as models by Mr. Clinton's transition team for urban policy. But he said any programs with a proven track records are "going to be important information for us."
But some of the programs Mr. Dinkins cited are still being set up and thus do not have track records, city officials acknowledged. For instance, in the health center program, which the Mayor is urging Mr. Clinton to adopt as a model and finance similar efforts in other cities, 9 of the 20 clinics have been built and the oldest has operated a mere three months.
And in making a pitch for more federally subsidized housing, city officials acknowledged that the Mayor exaggerated the city's efforts to build low-income housing, asserting that "New York City has spent billions of dollars in local resources to rehabilitate hundreds of thousands of housing units." The officials said the city has spent about $2 billion to rehabilitate 115,277 apartments since 1987, but the majority of those jobs involved minor repairs. The city has constructed 9,978 new apartments and done major renovations to 33,321.
Regardless of how many ideas Mr. Dinkins can persuade Mr. Clinton to accept, it is clear that the Arkansas Governor's ascension to the White House is perceived at City Hall as spelling an end to what it perceived as the neglect of cities during 12 years of Republican administrations.

HEADLINE: Times Plans to Build a Plant in Queens

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The New York Times, which had considered moving all of its printing operations out of New York City, has decided instead to build a $280 million printing plant on city-owned land in College Point, Queens, company executives said yesterday.
Under an agreement announced yesterday at a City Hall news conference with Mayor David N. Dinkins, The Times will lease 31 acres in a city-owned industrial park just west of the Whitestone Expressway. The city and state will grant tax incentives, low-cost energy and other benefits worth a total of $29 million over the course of a 35-year lease.
The Times currently employs about 1,000 people in press and delivery operations for the daily newspaper at its corporate headquarters, at 229 West 43d Street in Manhattan. When the new plant is completed -- which company officials said would probably not be until late in the decade, at the earliest -- the printing and distribution operations now in Manhattan will be shifted entirely to College Point. Company officials said they did not know exactly how many people would work at the new plant, which they said was needed to accommodate high-speed color presses.
 
Another Plant in New Jersey
 The business and news operations of The Times, which employ about 2,000 people, will remain on 43d Street, just west of Times Square.
The Times recently completed a $450 million printing plant in Edison, N.J., where advance sections of the Sunday paper are now printed. When that plant is in full operation early next year, the newspaper will begin shutting down an older plant in Carlstadt, N.J. The Sunday sections and some copies of the daily paper have been printed in Carlstadt.
The incentives offered by the city and state to The Times are larger, in proportion to the number of jobs involved, than comparable incentive packages offered recently to other major New York corporations.
But city officials contended that the expense was reasonable because of the large capital investment that The Times will make in the new plant and because manufacturing jobs are particularly hard to attract and keep. The incentives also cover a much longer period than other agreements.
The Times searched for more than 10 years for a large site in the city for a new printing plant for the daily paper, said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The Times. Company officials said they had also considered sites in Westchester County and had contemplated rebuilding the Carlstadt plant and equipping it with high-speed color presses.
 
'Host of Reasons'
 That option, which Mr. Sulzberger said would have been less expensive than relocating within New York City, even with the financial incentives, was ultimately dropped in favor of the Queens site.
"For a host of reasons, among them better distribution and a fundamental commitment to this great city, we believe this decision is in the best long-term interest of The Times," Mr. Sulzberger said in a letter to the staff yesterday.
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman and chief executive of The New York Times Company, described the land in College Point -- now the site of a Police Department automobile pound -- as "the perfect size and shape" for a modern printing print.
"We had long hoped to keep some manufacturing operations in New York City," he said at the news conference. Initially, he said, it appeared that retaining the printing operation of the daily paper in New York would be far more expensive than shifting all production and distribution to New Jersey. The incentives helped close the gap, he said.
"The New York Times and the city go back a long way -- to 1851, in fact," he said. "So it's extra fun to stand here and talk about a project that will take us well into the next century. As you must see, we have faith in the city's future and its long-term vitality."
 
'Take Great Pride'
 The Mayor noted that The Times's announcement followed decisions in recent months by other major corporations, including the Morgan Stanley Group, Prudential Securities and four of the five commodities exchanges, to remain in New York.
"We take great pride in serving as the world's communications capital," Mr. Dinkins said. "Today I am especially proud to reaffirm that status in announcing that all the news that's fit to print in The New York Times is going to be fitted and printed in the borough of Queens."
Of the $29 million in incentives, slightly less than $9 million is incentives that the city would offer automatically to any business that would lease the site, said Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
The remaining $20 million in incentives are discretionary. About $11.3 million will come from the state, in the form of low-cost electricity from a state-owned nuclear power plant and exemptions from state sales taxes on construction materials, Mr. Weisbrod said.
 
Poor Soil Conditions
 The city will provide an additional $8.7 million in incentives, including a $4.7 million grant to help build a foundation for the building. Soil conditions on the marshy site are very poor, Mr. Weisbrod said. The city will also provide relief from some city sales taxes and payments in lieu of taxes, he said.
The cost of the agreement to the city and state is relatively high, compared with incentives to other corporations. Morgan Stanley agreed last month to a $39.6 million package of incentives to keep 4,100 jobs in Manhattan for 10 years -- or slightly less than $10,000 per job. Prudential Securities is to receive $106 million in tax incentives and energy savings over 20 years to retain 5,000 jobs, or about $21,000 per job. The incentives offered to The Times would come to about $29,000 per job over 35 years if all 1,000 production and distribution jobs now at 43d Street were transferred to Queens.
But Mr. Weisbrod contended that retaining manufacturing jobs was much harder in New York City than retaining white-collar jobs at financial-services companies like Morgan Stanley and Prudential Securities. He also said he could not recall a similarly large investment in a manufacturing plant in the city. "These jobs are awfully important to keep in the city," he said. "They are hard to keep in the city."

HEADLINE: Judge Rules Against Visa In Sears Suit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company won a battle yesterday in its efforts to expand its credit card business by issuing Visa cards, when a Federal court jury in Salt Lake City ruled that Visa U.S.A. was violating antitrust laws by excluding Sears.
The lawsuit charging antitrust violations was filed by Dean Witter Financial Services, a unit of Sears that issues the Discover Card but wants to issue Visa cards as well. 
 Because the Discover card is accepted at only 1.5 million merchants, while Visa cards are accepted by 10 million, Sears in 1990 bought Mountain West Financial, a failed Utah savings and loan association that was a Visa member. But Visa blocked Dean Witter's plan to issue cards through Mountain West.
 
Visa May Appeal Verdict
 Visa officials said yesterday that they planned to ask the court to overturn the jury's verdict, and if that failed, to appeal the decision. They contend that forcing Visa to share its name and expertise in the card business with a direct competitor would lead to reduced competition between the card systems.
"That would be like forcing Dean Witter to share its resource and trade secrets with Merrill Lynch," said H. Robert Heller, president of Visa.
B. J. Martin, an executive at Dean Witter in charge of its proposed new Visa card, said the jury verdict would increase competition by giving consumers more choice about the kind of card they use.
Dean Witter plans to issue a Visa card with no annual fee, and at a variety of interest rates depending on the elapsed time before the consumer pays the bill.
Mr. Martin said that the Discover card and the new Visa card would be two separate businesses with different prices and customer standards, but that they would share some computer centers for processing transactions and maintaining customer records.
Visa officials learned of Sears's plans when they received an unexpected order for 1.5 million new cards from tiny Mountain West. They quickly invoked a rule in Visa's bylaws that says that the corporations owning American Express and Discover may not belong to Visa because those cards are direct competitors. Visa, like Mastercard, is owned by the approximately 6,000 banks and savings institutions that issue the cards.
Dean Witter's efforts to expand in the increasingly competitive credit card business coincide with a recent announcement by Sears that it planned to sell 20 percent of Dean Witter to investors and distribute the remainder to Sears's shareholders.
Last month the Discover card, which earned nearly $200 million in the first nine months of this year and has 39 million cards outstanding, announced plans to reduce its 19.8 percent interest rate for some customers, with the size of the reduction depending on how much the card is used.

HEADLINE: In Possible Sign on Jobs, Subway Ridership Is Up

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
After declining for 32 months in a row, the number of people riding the subway has finally begun to pick up, climbing modestly for three consecutive months, transit officials said yesterday.
The increase, economists and transit officials said, may be an early signal that New York City's long-suffering economy is turning around: above all other reasons, passengers board the subway when they have a job to go to and stay home when they do not. 
 "There isn't any question that the subway is very sensitive to employment," said Alan F. Kiepper, president of the Transit Authority. "While we have no firm figures yet to show employment going up, we suspect that's been happening."
Subway ridership grew 1.3 percent in July, nine-tenths of 1 percent in August and 1.8 percent in September compared with the same months in 1991, according to figures to be formally released at a Transit Authority committee meeting next week. September's daily average of 3.2 million passengers, however, is still more than 7 percent below the subway's peak in 1989, when ridership reached 3.45 million passengers each day. Figures for October have not yet been tallied, transit officials said.
The rise in ridership on the subways has not been matched on the buses. Ridership there has continued a slow decline, falling every month since July 1989. Buses are not used by as many commuters as are subways and have faced growing competition from gypsy vans.
Economists say the subway system is often an early gauge of job growth, available several months before employment figures account for that growth. In the New York City area, they are encouraged by similar ridership increases in other commuter networks.
Ridership grew 1 percent on the Metro-North commuter railroad from July through September, after dropping slightly for seven consecutive quarters. The Port Authority recorded a slightly more than 1 percent growth in the number of vehicles crossing the Hudson River in July, August and September.
"It's an encouraging sign," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "We find that travel data tend to be a good economic indicator, and over the course of the past 15 years it has tracked very well."
Other economists, however, warned that the current economic situation in New York City is still bleak. Unemployment in New York City hit 11.4 percent in September, up sharply from 7.7 percent a year earlier, but down from the recent peak of 12.1 percent in July, according to the State Department of Labor. Retail sales are also down.
"We haven't hit bottom yet from any numbers we're looking at," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
According to Transit Authority figures, ridership on the subways was relatively stable during the early 1980's, when employment in New York City remained almost constant. A significant growth in ridership came from 1985 to 1989, years when employment in New York City grew most sharply, and also years when the subway system saw improvement in service and conditions.
Since July, transit officials warned, other factors apart from employment could also have influenced subway-ridership figures, measured by token revenue and adjusted for discounted riders such as senior citizens and disabled people. They do not include fare evaders or students who ride for free.
For example, July revenue may have been inflated by the Democratic National Convention and Fourth of July tall ships celebration. And, the August improvement may actually be a reflection of a drop in ridership during 1991, when disruptions followed a derailment at 14th Street that killed five people and injured 200 others.
But Mr. Kiepper said there were no obvious reasons why ridership was up in September, although he noted that the authority had been trying to crack down on fare evasion, which might have had some impact.
Joseph G. Rappaport, coordinator of the Straphangers Campaign, suggested another possible cause of the increase in ridership: Some riders stop using the subway immediately after a fare increase but gradually resume riding as they get used to the higher fare.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS - ADVERTISING;
D.M.B.& B. Promotes 2 Executives to Shore Up Basics

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
D'ARCY MASIUS BENTON & BOWLES is promoting two top executives to newly created positions with worldwide responsibilities, in a move to strengthen the giant agency's capabilities in fundamental areas like landing new business and improving creative output.
Richard V. Hopple, 45 years old, who rejoined D.M.B.& B. in April, is being named vice chairman of corporate strategic development. And John Nieman, 43, who has been vice chairman and chief creative officer at the agency's North American division, is being named vice chairman and worldwide creative director. 
 Both executives, who are members of the agency's board and worldwide management group, will report to Roy J. Bostock, chairman and chief executive.
The two appointments typify efforts by larger agencies to try focusing on longer-range goals at a time when shorter-term problems seem to be consuming most of their energies. D.M.B.& B., with billings of $4.5 billion, is the world's 10th-largest agency organization, according to the 1991 rankings by Advertising Age. Among its huge clients are Anheuser-Busch, Burger King, the Pontiac and Cadillac divisions of General Motors, Kraft General Foods and Procter & Gamble.
"One of the real needs in this industry is to plan longer term," Mr. Bostock said in an interview yesterday at the agency's office in midtown Manhattan, where he was joined by Mr. Hopple and Mr. Nieman.
"It's very easy to get caught up in the crisis of the day," he added, "when you've got a weak economy or a slow recovery or whatever you want to call it, which puts pressure on clients and on yourselves."
The appointments follow a regional realignment of the agency in April. Three regional presidents -- Clayton E. Wilhite, North America; George J. Simko, Europe, and John Ferries, Asia/Pacific and Latin America -- continue to report to Mr. Bostock. He described them as "the line operators of the existing businesses, devoting virtually all their time to current clients," compared with Mr. Hopple and Mr. Nieman, who are becoming "the key staff executives."
Mr. Hopple was expected to be named to a senior position at the agency; he had been operating sans title since he returned to D.M.B.& B. after five years at Wells Rich Greene BDDP in New York, where he served as president and head of its marketing communications division.
"I've been sort of the chief 'wanderer arounder' here," Mr. Hopple said.
"When you don't have a title," he added, "you understand how unimportant they are." Still, he has now acquired one, and a nifty one it is, too.
Mr. Hopple had been concentrating on overseeing several Kraft General Foods brands, duties he will continue in his new position. He said the ferment on the agency's Kraft General Foods accounts has ended after the loss last month of the estimated $14 million Louis Rich turkey-products account to Foote, Cone & Belding in Chicago. There has been widespread speculation that its hold on other Kraft General Foods accounts, like Crystal Light soft-drink mixes and Entenmann's baked goods, remains tenuous.
Mr. Nieman, who joined the agency in May 1989 after stints at McCann-Erickson New York and Young & Rubicam, proudly played a videotape of what he termed the agency's more innovative work around the world for clients like Anheuser-Busch, Philips and Qantas.
"We're better creatively than we're generally given credit for," he asserted. Indeed, the agency is known for producing predominantly prosaic campaigns for stalwart packaged goods like Charmin bathroom tissue, Good Seasons salad dressings and Pampers diapers.
Mr. Nieman was particularly pleased with a new American Burger King campaign, which features Dan Cortese, a young MTV host, in a fast-paced series of spots called BK TeeVee -- as in Burger King Television -- that carry the theme "I love this place!" That campaign is believed to be a make-or-break one for the agency on its $130 million portion of the Burger King account, which it shares with Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York; Advertising Age reported that Burger King has been talking informally with J. Walter Thompson U.S.A., which created the infamous "Herb the Nerd" campaign for the fast feeder.
"Part of my job is to increase the hit ratio," Mr. Nieman said, "and make sure we create more visible work across the board."
Or to have clients exuberantly proclaiming "I love this shop!," to paraphrase Mr. Cortese, rather than pigeonholing the agency as a home to Herbs.

HEADLINE: October Sales Give Retailers a Brighter Holiday Outlook

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The nation's big chain stores reported further sales gains in October, continuing a trend that began in August and raising hopes among analysts that for the first time in four years retailers will not have a cold Christmas.
Still, doubts about the future remain, largely because most of the October sales came in the first half of the month. 
"We are seeing some improvement in the tone of retail sales that dates back to August," said Robert F. Buchanan, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore. "I don't want to make too much of the weakness recorded at the end of the month, but we will keep an eye on what happens in November."
Wayne Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities, said some of the slippage in the final week of October was weather-related.
According to an index of sales at 50 chain stores compiled by Prudential Securities, sales rose by 6.5 percent last month, compared with a rise of 5.9 percent in September.
Meanwhile, an index of sales at 15 leading retailers compiled by Salomon Brothers rose by 7.5 percent, compared with a 7.3 percent increase in September.
Sales gains were particularly impressive at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer. But some fashion retailers continued to struggle; sales at Gap Inc. were disappointing.
Wal-Mart, which benefited from two extra shopping days last month compared with October 1991, reported a 16 percent gain in sales at stores open at least a year. But even without those two extra days, analysts said Wal-Mart's sales were up about 12 percent.
Among other large retailers, the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the nation's fourth largest, said sales rose by 7.4 percent, a gain that was smaller than anticipated.
Stephen E. Watson, president of Dayton Hudson, said in a statement that sales at the company's Target and Mervyn's stores were softer than expected, in large part because of weakness in California.
Wall Street did not like the numbers, and the price of Dayton Hudson's shares slid by $1.50 on the Big Board yesterday, to $74.50.
At Gap, heavy promotions did not bolster sales, which rose a meager 2 percent last month. And the Kmart Corporation said same-store sales rose just 3.2 percent.
At Sears, Roebuck & Company, same-store sales rose by 3.9 percent in October. The company said sales increased in almost all merchandise categories, including big-ticket items like major appliances. But Sears's automotive business, which has been hurt by fraud charges, continued to fare poorly.
Kim Walin, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers, said that despite the continued slow improvement, "department and discount stores still have a better tone than specialty stores."
Analysts acknowledged that significant impediments to a surge in consumer spending, like persistently high unemployment and continued layoff announcements, remain in place.
 
Sign of Hope
 But many said they expected consumer confidence levels to improve in the wake of the Presidential election and lift the Christmas shopping season, which this year is two days longer than it was in 1991.
"There are mixed signals out there, but we believe the environment this Christmas will be favorable, particularly from a profit standpoint," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst at Salomon Brothers. Aside from the advantage of being open two more days this year than last, "inventories and expenses will be very tightly controlled" in the coming Christmas season, he said.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Drop to a 2-Year Low

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
New unemployment claims in late October fell to 360,000, the lowest in more than two years, the Government said today.
The Labor Department report, considered a sign of hope amid other more dismal economic news, said jobless claims fell by 16,000, from 376,000 the week before. 
 Economists had been looking for an increase of 5,000 to 10,000. It was the lowest number of weekly claims since the week ending Aug. 4, 1990, near the start of the recession, when 354,000 Americans filed for jobless benefits.
 
Productivity Gains
 In another report, the department said the productivity of American workers increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6 percent during the July-September quarter, the best showing in six months.
The Labor Department also reported that labor costs, a measure of inflationary pressures, rose slightly but remained at the lowest level in a year.
A moving four-week average of unemployment claims, considered a more reliable indicator of labor market trends than the usually volatile weekly numbers, also hit a new low. The average was 371,500, the lowest since the four-week period ending Aug. 25, 1990, when the average was 371,000.
Economists cautioned that the number might look more favorable than actual labor market conditions. Since the start of August, some unemployed people have been eligible for benefits under a special emergency program passed by Congress last summer.
Had those claimants been included, the latest weekly number would have been 22,456 higher. The moving four-week average would have been 22,745 higher.
 
Positive Trend
 But even factoring in the emergency claims, the trend is still positive and it could presage an improvement in the nation's unemployment rate in October, which the department is scheduled to report on Friday.
The rate in September was 7.5 percent, down from an eight-year high of 7.8 percent in June.
But economists cautioned that improvement in the job situation would be gradual. Many employers appear to have stopped laying off workers, but companies, turned cautious by the long period of economic stagnation, have been slow to start rehiring.

HEADLINE: Phone and Tobacco Stocks Lead Market Up

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Wall Street stocks ended with healthy gains yesterday, buoyed by strong advances in telephone and tobacco company shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 20.80 points, to 3,243.84, and volume rose to 219.7 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 194.4 million on Wednesday. Advancing issues outpaced decliners, 975 to 812. 
 The Dow transportation index rose 19.94 points, to 1,380.31 and the Nasdaq index shot up 8.56, to 614.08.
"There's a little better tone," said Richard Meyer of Ladenburg Thalmann. "Stocks are reacting to different stories."
American Telephone and Telegraph was up 1 5/8, to 44 3/8, on its plan to buy one-third of McCaw CellularCommunications, which jumped 5 1/4, to 32.
Philip Morris gained 3 1/4, to 78 5/8, after the tobacco company announced that the plaintiff's attorney in a closely watched smoking liability case had withdrawn the lawsuit. The other major gainers among tobacco stocks were RJR Nabisco up 1/8, to 8 7/8; American Brands up 1 1/4, to 43, and Loews 3 5/8 higher at 115 1/2.
Technology and transportation stocks were also strong.
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper Securities said he had raised his stock asset allocation, now that the uncertainty surrounding the Presidential race had lifted.
He allocated 60 percent of his investment portfolio to stocks, up from 50 percent, and lowered bond holdings to 35 percent from 40 percent and pared cash to 5 percent from 10 percent.
"Basically, we're pleased with the way things are developing after the election," he said. "Plenty of stocks which were oversold are coming back to life, especially in the technology area."
Among technology gainers, Novell rose 1 3/4, to 32; Intel added 2 3/8, to 70; Microsoft rose 3 3/8, to 91 7/8, and Apple Computer was up 2 1/2, to 55.
Mexican stocks surged after the Mexican President's office said the United States President-elect, Bill Clinton, had pledged his total support for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"Today, there's a combination of transport and Nasdaq strength, which are bringing blue chips up," said Robert Walberg, an analyst at MMS International. "You're also seeing transports doing well again. Some of the airlines are doing well, with the assumption the economy is likely to pick up."
But Mr. Walberg noted that the pivotal October jobs report due today "could be the first challenge Clinton faces." Economists expect payrolls to expand by 25,000 and the jobless rate to hold steady at 7.5 percent.
In the transports, UAL rose 3 3/4, to 125 1/4; Delta Air Lines gained 2 1/2, to 58 3/4, and AMR was up 2 1/8, to 65 5/8.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 1.23 points, to 418.34. The American Stock Exchange index was up 0.75, to 382.69.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.58, to 230.37. The average share gained 9 cents.

Treasury Official to Join First Boston

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
In one of the first post-election retirements of a high Bush Administration official, David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, announced today that he would be joining CS First Boston Inc. in New York.
Mr. Mulford, known for his Savile Row suits, bright suspenders, detachable collars and gold cuff links, will become vice chairman of the First Boston Corporation and deputy chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston, two CS First Boston units. 
 Mr. Mulford, who became an international affairs specialist at the Treasury -- and its most colorful official -- in 1984, said he was joining CS First Boston because he considered it "the most international of all the major investment banks."
 
A Number of Roles
 He was Washington's coordinator for the meetings of the Group of Seven finance ministers and played a pivotal role in putting together the $24 billion Western aid package for Russia. He also worked closely with the former Treasury Secretary, James A. Baker 3d, in developing the 1985 Plaza Accord, which helped bring down the value of the dollar.
At First Boston, Mr. Mulford will work on developing business on a worldwide basis. He will work closely on Latin America, where he has worked extensively on debt restructuring deals as a Government official.
As the Treasury official in charge of international economic policy making, the 55-year-old native of Rockford, Ill., would sometimes mysteriously appear in the same weekend in Washington, Paris and Moscow as part of behind-the-scenes work on a debt restructuring or as a sort of sherpa for the Group of Seven.
Mr. Mulford said in an interview that he decided a year ago that he was going to leave, but added that he stayed on this year to work on debt reduction programs for Argentina and Brazil and on an aid package for Moscow.
He gives Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, high marks for the changes he has made since taking power a year ago. "It's amazing they have accomplished as much as they have in the short time they have been in power."
 
Adviser to Saudis
 Before joining the Treasury, Mr. Mulford spent eight years as senior investment adviser at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. Mr. Mulford graduated from Lawrence Uhiversity in Appleton, Wis., in 1959, and received a master's degree in politicial science from Boston University in 1962. Three years later, he received a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University, where he concentrated on African issues.
Mr. Mulford will also be associated with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington as a distinguished scholar.
Looking back at his years in the Treasury under Presidents Bush and Reagan, he said: "It's been a period of enormous change in the world economy. We have seen the globalization of our economy, the growth of world capital markets, the deregulation of markets, and the freer and faster flow of capital movements and the need to coordinate policy."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Quiet Trading; Data on Economy Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday in a quiet day of trading, while gold prices fell.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $336.20 an ounce, off 90 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $336.60, off 70 cents an ounce. 
 Marc Chandler, a market strategist with the financial consulting firm Idea, said dollar trading was confined to narrow trading ranges with little customer demand.
"We need to wait for payroll data," he said, referring to the monthly unemployment report the Labor Department will issue this morning. The Federal Reserve will also release its consumer credit report today.
In London, the pound fell to $1.5355, from $1.5510 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.5365 to buy a pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.5435.

HEADLINE: Profit Up 82% At News Corp.

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation said today that its earnings jumped 82 percent in the latest quarter, with most of its operations posting gains.
 But analysts said the results were helped more by lower interest rates and currency gains from a weaker Australian dollar than by improvements in business. 
 The company said it earned $193.7 million (Australian), or $134.8 million (United States), in its first quarter ended in September, up from $106.5 million.
The company said that in the United States, earnings rose sharply at its Fox television network because of higher advertising revenue, while TV Guide magazine and the free-standing insert division had improved profits.

HEADLINE: On Trade Ties to Hanoi, Japanese Jump the Gun

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Jumping ahead of American policy in Asia, the Japanese Government announced today that it was resuming broad economic ties with Vietnam, including the offer of a major loan package, senior Japanese officials said.
The move comes in response to heavy pressure from Japanese business groups, which have urged the governing Liberal Democratic Party to pave the way for a variety of long-planned investments in Vietnam by Japanese companies. Tokyo is expected to announce a $375 million package on Friday, and that may be followed by loans from its Export-Import Bank. 
 Some government officials and business executives familiar with the internal debate over the issue said the Government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa had postponed its announcement until after the American elections. It feared that acting earlier would open Japan to criticism during the Presidential campaign that it was catering to the Japanese business interests while questions remain unresolved about the fate of American soldiers missing since the Vietnam War.
With the recent announcement by Hanoi that it would open its records on American P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s, Washington is expected to move fairly quickly to lift the American embargo on trade with Vietnam and to begin to normalize relations.
Japanese officials said they had informed the United States of their actions, but they declined to characterize the American response. They also said Japan had urged the Vietnamese to provide more information about the missing Americans.
Unlike the United States, Japan never broke relations with Hanoi after the American pullout from Vietnam. But in 1979, after Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia, it halted virtually all aid to the Communist Government. Vietnam, in return, refused to pay back Japanese loans amounting to nearly $200 million, and since then economic relations have been stalled.
A senior Japanese official involved in the decision over Vietnam said recently that "we are looking at this as a symbol," and that Japan has told the United States that "we want U.S. relations with Vietnam normalized."
American officials have said little publicly about Japan's impending action, though the Bush Administration was apparently informed of it several months ago. Last week Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the acting Secretary of State, said during a visit to Tokyo that "whatever the Japanese Government decides to do, we have our own view of how to proceed."
"We will not be affected by what the Japanese Government decides," he added.
For Japan, the decision appears to edge away from foreign policy positions that were largely defined by the United States. In recent months Japan has been stepping up its warming of relations with China, capped by a tour of the country last month by Emperor Akihito. Tokyo has also kept up a dialogue with the repressive Government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, where Japanese diplomats insist that quiet persuasion -- and continued relief aid -- has begun to soften the regime.
For the Vietnamese, courting Japan has been a major priority. Not only is Tokyo the largest contributor of aid, it is also the likeliest source of capital to rebuild the country's decrepit infrastructure. Some here say the expanded relationship with Japan may place subtle pressure on the United States to restore diplomatic relations and end its trade embargo, though Japanese officials deny that this is their goal.
Among Japanese companies, Vietnam is considered one of Asia's last frontiers: a cheap and well-educated work force, in a country with enough population density to become a prime market, over time, for the lowest-tech Japanese goods.
Already Ho Chi Minh City's hotels are brimming over with Japanese businessmen, looking for everything from oil contracts to good sites for low-technology factories. Japanese-made products, especially electronics, are already widely sold. Executives say they want to lay the groundwork for the day when Thailand and Malaysia, two other countries that have received enormous Japanese capital investment in recent years, become too expensive for further expansion.
 
Business Dealings Grow
 Over the last two years, several of Japan's giant trading houses have opened small offices for representatives in Vietnam. Recently five Japanese companies joined to open a shipping and distribution company that could send manufacturing plants and equipment to Vietnam. Mitsubishi Oil Company recently signed a contract for rights to conduct test borings for oil off Vietnam's southern coast.
Before they expanded further, however, the Japanese companies wanted to see Japanese aid pouring into the country, partly as insurance that their bills would be paid. "We knew that we had to get past the burden of the unpaid old loans," said an official of Mitsui, one of the trading houses with a growing presence in Vietnam. "But they have oil and cheap labor, and because the infrastructure is so limited, we can expect some business to build it."
Japanese officials, in announcing the package this morning, said that they had received "support" from the United States for the resumption of aid. Under the package announced today, the $375 million loan must be repaid within 30 years, but Japan will charge no interest for the first 10 years and only 1 percent interest thereafter.
Vietnam will pay off its outstanding loans with cash received under the new program. That is expected to leave more than $200 million for projects to rebuild the country's shattered roads, and to build new factories and housing.

U.S. Re-examining Policy
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (Special to The New York Times) -- Buoyed by a Vietnamese decision to turn over archival material on missing Americans, the Bush Administration is re-examining its policy on recognition of Vietnam and the lifting of a trade and aid embargo, officials say.
American companies have been pressing President Bush to allow trade and investment in Vietnam, where, in addition to the Japanese, businesses from Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand have been very active.
Under a road map to recognition given to the Vietnamese a year ago, "substantial" progress on explaining the fate of missing Americans could lead to the lifting of the embargo and the opening of an American liaison office in Hanoi and a Vietnamese office in Washington.
Full diplomatic recognition, according to the Bush Administration's plan, would await a democratic election in Cambodia, tentatively scheduled for next spring. President-elect Bill Clinton has given no indication that this timetable would change.

HEADLINE: U.S. RECALLS ENVOY TO BURKINA FASO

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Concerned that a civil war in Liberia may be developing into a wider regional crisis, the Bush Administration recalled its Ambassador from Burkina Faso today, asserting that the country is supplying weapons to the Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor.
The State Department spokesman, saying covert military aid was undermining Liberian peace efforts, also said President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso had been asked to cancel plans for a new envoy to Washington. The Ambassador recalled by Washington is Edward P. Brynn. 
 Libya was the source of at least some of the arms reaching Liberia through Burkina Faso, The Associated Press reported, quoting unnamed United States officials.
Mr. Taylor and the National Patriotic Front are being held responsible for the killing of five American nuns last month in a suburb of Monrovia, the Liberian capital. Mr. Taylor, whose army is challenging a West African peacekeeping force for control of the city, has denied responsibility.
 
Search for Slain Nuns
 Today Momulo V. Sackor Sirleaf, foreign minister in Mr. Taylor's shadow government, said at a news conference here that the accusations were part of a campaign against the rebel leader. But he did not deny the nuns had been killed.
The State Department insisted again that Mr. Taylor was responsible.
"None of us would be happier to see the five nuns alive than the people that have been working on this," the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said today. "Unfortunately the information that we have is that they are dead, and that they died in territory controlled" by the Taylor forces.
He said that American officials were still searching for the bodies. The five nuns, in their 50's and 60's, were members of the Adorers of the Blood of Christ order, in Illinois.
 
Marine Force Delayed
 The Pentagon said today that a Marine amphibious task force was holding exercises near the Canary Islands, off the west coast of Africa. The force, which was on its way to the Mediterranean to relieve a similar unit there, has been delayed by rescue operations after the loss of a helicopter, a Defense Department spokesman said.
In a long criticism of Burkina Faso, formerly Upper Volta, Mr. Boucher said the Administration had warning its Government against giving support to Mr. Taylor, "only to be confronted time and time again, with evidence of continued Burkinabic military aid.
"The situation in Liberia has deteriorated rapidly since Oct. 15, and Burkina Faso has helped exacerbate the situation." Reports from Monrovia say several thousand people have died in recent fighting.
There were reports today that Senegal, concerned about the worsening situation in Liberia, was preparing to withdraw its peacekeeping forces. Without disclosing details, State Department officials confirmed that there had been cable exchanges on the Senegalese position.
Liberia, founded by freed American slaves, traditionally has had close ties with the United States, where Mr. Taylor was educated. Another rebel leader, Prince Johnson, has surrendered to the seven-nation peacekeeping force, installed two years ago by the Economic Community of West African States.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: THE INDEPENDENT;
Why Perot Thrived in Fertile Kansas

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOPEKA, Kan., Nov. 5

 BODY:
One of the original Kansas populists, an orator named Mary Elizabeth Lease, reportedly urged farmers in the 1890's to "raise less corn and more hell." That's exactly what Kansans did on Election Day, when they turned out in record numbers and gave Ross Perot 27 percent of their vote, one of the highest percentages for him in any state.
While not the only factor contributing to Mr. Perot's success here, the Kansas tradition of prairie populism clearly made the state a fertile field for the seeds that he broadcast. At least partly because of Mr. Perot's influence, President Bush won the state by only 5 percentage points over Gov. Bill Clinton, less than half of the 13-point margin of victory enjoyed here by Republicans in the last two Presidential elections. 
 If there is a common thread running through Kansas and the eight other states where Mr. Perot won at least a quarter of the vote -- Alaska, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming -- it is a history of fiercely independent and often contrarian politics. People everywhere talk about not putting up with politics as usual, but in these states they seem to mean it.
And if there is anything that voters in Kansas and other Perot strongholds will not tolerate, it is politicians who do not talk straight.
"The people of Kansas are very fair," said Gov. Joan Finney, a Democrat and self-described populist who was elected in 1990. "They don't demand a lot. But one thing they do demand from their public officials is honesty. For so many years, business here was done just by a handshake. And so your word is important."
In interview after interview over the last two days, Perot voters in Kansas said they did not trust Mr. Bush because of his broken vow to hold the line on taxes. They said they also could not bring themselves to trust Mr. Clinton.
"Both Bush and Clinton tried to appeal to whatever group they were appearing before," said Terry Fink, a 40-year-old pharmacist from Overland Park, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City, Mo. "It was nice to have someone like Perot who said, 'This is what we need to do, and I don't care if it makes some people unhappy.' "
 
The Right Personality
 Experts on Kansas politics said Mr. Perot's personality had special appeal in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain states. "People saw Perot not getting respect, being denigrated, and they could identify with this guy," said Burdett A. Loomis, a professor of political science at the University of Kansas. "There's a sense in the Plains that we're the part of the country that people fly over. And here's a guy who says: 'Wait a minute. You've got to take us seriously.' "
More than one in four Kansas voters felt that way, and there is no way to tell how much better Mr. Perot would have done if he had not dropped out of the race for a time.
The state's populist streak is not the only factor that helped Mr. Perot in Kansas, where 43 percent of the voters are registered Republicans and 31 percent are Democrats. Kansas is home to what has become known as Bob Dole Republicanism, an amalgam of fiscal conservatism, moderation on social issues and a personal disdain for George Bush, all voiced by Mr. Perot.
Because the state's unemployment rate is 4 percent, compared with 7.6 percent nationwide, many here view the reduction of the Federal budget deficit as more important than job creation. Mr. Perot's relentless emphasis on eliminating the deficit found a receptive audience here.
Mr. Dole, who won his own re-election campaign on Tuesday, questioned whether Perot supporters in the state actually knew that Mr. Perot's deficit-reduction proposals included measures like cutting farm subsidies and Medicare benefits.
"Whether they read the fine print or they just liked what they saw, I don't know," the Senate minority leader said. "But people were blaming Bush for the economy, weren't sure about Clinton, and Perot was fresh and rich and had good sound bite material. He made it all sound easy -- easier than it is, of course."
 
Strained Relations
 Mr. Dole, whose relations with Mr. Bush have been strained since their 1988 rivalry for the Republican Presidential nomination, often had nice things to say about Mr. Perot. He suggested on national television 10 days ago that "there may be a place for Ross Perot in the next Bush Administration." Mr. Perot finished second in Mr. Dole's home county, falling only 87 votes short of defeating Mr. Bush out of 3,959 votes cast.
As in most of the states where Mr. Perot did well, Kansas was not a main target of either the Democrats or Republicans. That was probably because it has only 6 electoral votes and a long history of voting Republican in Presidential elections. In any event, the lack of attention by the major parties left the state wide open for Mr. Perot.
One of his strongest state organizations developed here, and it pioneered what came to be known as "the wave campaign," in which Perot supporters lined highways to shake banners and placards at passing motorists.
Orville Sweet, the director of the Perot organization in Kansas, said his group signed up about 2,000 volunteers, about 400 of whom stayed active in telephoning voters and canvassing. He said they operated for three months on a budget of less than $50,000. Most of the money came from the Perot headquarters in Dallas; the rest from the sale of what Mr. Sweet called "T 'n' T -- trinkets and trash."
Mr. Bush carried Kansas with 39 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent for Mr. Clinton. But Mr. Perot, aided by the remarkable 85 percent turnout that he helped inspire, won 27 percent. Only Maine, Utah and Idaho had higher Perot votes as the Texan picked up 19 percent nationwide, the best showing for an independent or third-party candidate in 80 years. The states where Mr. Perot excelled are rural, conservative and populated predominantly by whites. He did not fare well with minority voters.
In Kansas, which is 90 percent white, Mr. Perot did reasonably well in all parts of the state. He carried a scattering of small counties and won about a quarter of the vote in each of the largest counties -- 25 percent in the affluent and heavily Republican suburbs of Kansas City, Mo. (Johnson County); 26 percent in Wichita (Sedgwick County); 25 percent in the state capital of Topeka (Shawnee County), 22 percent in the Democratic stronghold of Kansas City, Kan. (Wyandotte County), and 23 percent in the university town of Lawrence (Douglas County).
Mr. Perot seemed to do slightly better in Republican areas than in Democratic ones. He received a total of 28 percent of the vote in the five counties with the highest proportion of Republican voters and 24 percent in the five counties with the highest proportion of Democratic voters.
"I'd say far more Republicans voted for Perot than Democrats, according to my polling," said Representative Dan Glickman, a Democrat. "Kansas Republicans have always been economic populists, and Bush couldn't be more anti-populist in image."

HEADLINE: A Hurricane's Long-Lasting Impact

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Two and a half months after Hurricane Andrew swept through South Florida, officials say the daily lives of virtually all of Dade County's two million residents have been altered in fundamental ways.
And while the cleanup is progressing, county and other officials predict it will be three to five years before residents begin to feel that their lives have returned to normal. 
 According to city and county reports, tens of thousands of people have been forced to change where they work, live or send their children to school, and many are enduring big increases in commuting time and in what they pay for rent, food and building materials.
 
Community to Disappear
 In one especially striking example, Naranja Lakes, a condominium community of more than 3,000 people near Homestead, where the storm's damage was most severe, is about to disappear.
Before Andrew struck, Naranja Lakes was much like any other suburban development here. Retirees, military personnel and young couples once flocked to the two- and three-bedroom units, built around four small lakes and close to shopping malls, golf courses and fishing.
But the storm's ferocious winds destroyed all that, and late last month residents of the development, just north of Homestead Air Force Base, met and decided not to rebuild. Instead, all but 241 of the complex's 1,568 units will be demolished, four of its condominium associations legally dissolved and apartment owners given a lump-sum payment to cover their losses.
"To tell the truth, a lot of the people who used to live here have already moved and started new lives," said Eric Carlo, a former air-freight handler who moved to Naranja Lakes after Eastern Air Lines went under and took his job with it. "They just don't want to have to think about this anymore."
Officials say that because of the extent of the damage and the upheavals in people's lives, it will take years to assess Andrew's permanent aftereffects, but some things are known.
The storm left 85,000 homes in Dade County severely damaged or beyond repair. As a result, disaster relief officials estimate, more than 10 percent of the county's residents have been forced to seek temporary living quarters, many of them in Broward County to the north.
In addition, a study by the Dade County finance and planning department estimates that 65,000 jobs have been lost at least temporarily. In addition, it projects that the local economy will lose $2.9 billion in the output of goods and services over the next year.
The county has said it will take in at least $50 million less than expected in revenue this fiscal year, mostly because of a decline in property tax collections. County officials have ordered every department to make further cuts in an already-austere budget.
 
Housing Shortage
 The lasting impact of the storm has been most immediately visible in the commercial and residential real estate markets, which had been a renter's and buyer's paradise because of excessive construction in the 1980's. With tens of thousands of homes classified as at least temporarily "uninhabitable," Dade County is experiencing a housing shortage that has driven rents skyward and threatens to put the most vulnerable groups, like lower-income families and retired people, out of the market.
A moratorium decreed in September by the city of Homestead on the installation of mobile homes, which were among the structures that fared the worst in Andrew's 145-mile-an-hour winds, has deprived such groups of cheaper alternatives to traditional housing. Many of those displaced from the 9,000 mobile homes destroyed by the storm have said they fear their insurance checks will be eaten up before they find housing they can afford.
The same kind of competition has occurred for prime commercial real estate in the adjoining counties. Large corporations that had their headquarters in the disaster zone, like Burger King and the American Bankers Insurance Group, are moving northward, saying they will return when their main offices can be rebuilt.
Even before Hurricane Andrew hit, Miami was faltering from the bankruptcies of Pan American and Eastern airlines, two major employers. Now, "Dade faces a double recovery, from the recession and from the storm," according to a report by the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida.
Homestead Air Force Base, another large employer before the storm, remains closed, with its future uncertain as a result of Congress's refusal to authorize a $473 million appropriation to rebuild. Cutler Ridge Mall, the largest shopping center in South Dade, is also shut, and businesses there have not been told when they may be able to reopen.
According to the Florida Department of Labor, unemployment in Dade County, which had been running at 11 percent in August, rose in September as a result of Hurricane Andrew to 11.5 percent, the highest rate in more than 12 years. In contrast, the overall unemployment rate in the state fell from 9.4 percent to 9.1 percent. The national average is 7.2 percent.
Faced with the resulting decline in its tax base, the county government has responded by looking for ways to cut spending, among other things ordering delays in $22 million in construction projects. It has also said the fire department and library system will have to absorb the bulk of any revenue shortages.
As Dade's troubles mount, officials say, businesses and residents are heading north in search of more normal conditions, and neighboring Broward County, with a population of 1.25 million people spreading outward from Fort Lauderdale, has been on the receiving end of much of the flow. An unexpected consequence has been increased traffic that has made South Florida look more like Southern California.
"Some days it takes me two and a half hours to get to work," said Rhoda Rosenzweig, a Naranja Lakes condominium association manager who moved with her 90-year-old mother from a mobile home here to an apartment in Pembroke Pines, just southwest of Fort Lauderdale. "Before, I could walk to work and go home for lunch to check on my mother."
Many parents are also making the long trek from their new, temporary homes to their children's old schools, hoping to maintain some degree of continuity in the lives of their children. But the future of many of the schools in the hardest-hit areas is now in doubt.
Local authorities say they hope that the exodus that followed Hurricane Andrew is only temporary and predict that people will return as soon as they are able. But there are signs that at least a part of the hurricane-induced shift of population may turn out to be permanent.
"I have no intention of coming back to South Dade," Ms. Rosenzweig said. "Andrew left a bad taste in my mouth, and I don't want to have to wait to see this place rebuild. I find that I like it in Broward."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: JOB HUNTING;
For Capital Job Hunters, the Spoils of Victory Are Limited

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
With a civilian work force of more than two million people, the Federal Government would seem to offer an inviting source of employment to supporters of President-elect Bill Clinton, many of them no doubt struggling in a weak economy.
But the spoils of victory are neither as numerous nor as easy to obtain as is widely assumed. Experienced capital hands caution that if Mr. Clinton does a proper job mastering his transition, he will decide on policy priorities before picking people to put the policies into effect. This could make going to work for the first one-party Government in 12 years an exercise in frustration. 
 "There's not as many jobs as people think there are," Mark Abramson, president of the bipartisan Council for Excellence in Government, said on Wednesday. "There's going to be a lot of disappointment."
The 1992 version of the "Plum Book" -- officially called United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions -- was sent to the printer by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday morning. It lists about 8,000 jobs outside the competitive Civil Service consisting of career Government employees.
But only about 3,000 of the jobs are doled out through political appointment by the new Administration. And of them the top 700 -- mostly Cabinet and sub-Cabinet jobs -- are subject to extensive background checks by Federal agents, two sets of financial disclosure and Senate confirmation.
 
800 Jobs for Career People
 About 800 others are reserved for the Senior Executive Service, consisting of career people, with the remaining 1,500 accounted for by senior aides or specialists, many of them not considered choice jobs.
Various other jobs, including commissionerships at independent agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, are filled by the President when the term of an appointee expires. Such agencies are generally under other strictures as well, like limits on the number of people coming from one political party.
As the first Clinton forces headed for their transition office on the top three floors of an office building a few blocks from the White House, veterans of the process warned that Mr. Clinton should not put personnel decisions ahead of policy decisions.
In addition, Mr. Clinton has obtained 25,000 square feet of office space in Little Rock, Ark., where work on the transition has already begun.
"Set your priorities in policy and then lock people into the policy," counseled Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. The reverse invites factionalism, particularly if those appointed to senior posts have a free hand in picking their subordinates, as Jimmy Carter allowed to happen when he became President.
More than 600 people will be working at the transition office for the next 11 weeks to set an agenda, select personnel and organize an administration. Congress has appropriated $3.5 million for the task.
"The main lesson in recent years is to get a start before the election but make it so low-key that it doesn't become an issue in itself," Mr. Hess said.
Evidence of their intentions to take a firm hold of matters is the fact that both Mr. Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore will have offices in the Washington quarters, as will their wives.
"The transition is governing," observed Stuart E. Eizenstat, who headed policy and planning for Mr. Carter's White House takeover in 1977. "I feel with enormous intensity that the transition is a seminal period."
 
Carter Transition Errors Cited
 Among what he counts as the Carter Administration's transition errors were failing to designate a White House chief of staff to serve as a traffic cop among competing interests, and introducing conflicts of loyalty by allowing top appointees almost complete freedom to pick their aides. He said the Carter Administration also "overloaded the legislative circuits" by not establishing two or three clear priorities.
Democratic Congresses, Mr. Eizenstat said, can prove quite balky even to Presidents who are Democrats, so Mr. Clinton is also well advised to avoid spending political capital -- or transition effort -- on Government reorganization that requires Congressional approval.

HEADLINE: Ruling by Court Backs Networks On Rerun Issue

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
A Federal appeals court dealt a major blow to the Hollywood studios today in their effort to keep the big television networks out of the $5 billion business of selling reruns of popular programs.
The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel rejected a rule adopted by a sharply divided Federal Communications Commission in 1991 that restricted the networks from owning and selling the rerun rights to their prime time programs. 
 The action by the court in Chicago could allow the networks to sell their reruns to local and cable stations without any restrictions. But the decision stopped short of handing the networks a complete victory. Indeed, it raised the question of whether, with the court's rejection of the new rule, the F.C.C. can now simply revert to the old, more restrictive rule.
 
Nasty Regulatory Battle
 The decision, written by Judge Richard A. Posner, orders the F.C.C. to reconsider its action in one of the nastiest and most divisive regulatory battles ever for the agency. The battle of the Hollywood studios and the television networks was immortalized by a commissioner as one between the "rich and the very wealthy."
The court's action also reopens the broader debate over the power of broadcast networks in the face of heavy competition for viewers from cable television, independent television stations and videocassette recorders.
At issue is what is known as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rule, which was first adopted by the F.C.C. in 1970 amid fears that ABC, NBC and CBS had the power to choke off competition in the production of television shows.
The rule prohibited the networks from owning a financial interest or resale rights in programs they broadcast. It was enacted to prevent a network from discriminating against independent producers or demanding that producers give them a financial stake in their programming in exchange for broadcasting them.
The networks argue that the rule is out of date and threatens the future of "free" television by making it difficult for networks to match the bids of cable systems and other rivals for the best new shows. The networks, along with the Bush Administration and many economic experts, argued that the rules only protected the major movie studios from competition.
Hollywood studios and producers, on the other hand, view the rule as the most important protection they have, and they spared nothing in their attempts to keep it intact.
 
Industry Reaction
 Network executives praised today's court decision.
"I think it's an excellent decision," said Richard Cotton, vice president and general counsel for NBC, a unit of the General Electric Company. "It's really a stinging indictment of the failure of the F.C.C. to justify any further restrictions on the networks."
Those views were echoed by Jamie Kellner, president of the Fox Broadcasting Company, which operates the new Fox television network. "Today's court decision reveals that the F.I.S.R. emperor has no clothes," he said in a statement, referring to the Financial Interest and Syndication Rule. "With a fourth network and scores of cable networks already in place, and even more competition and diversity on the horizon, the time is past due to set all networks free."
Hollywood lawyers denounced the verdict with equal force. "This action will have a profound and devastating impact on this country's entire television production community," said Michael Gardner, a lawyer for a coalition of producers. "It seems to remove, with one glib gesture, regulatory safeguards that have promoted the financial viability of the creative community."
 
Months of Feuding
 The rule rejected today was adopted in April 1991 after months of feuding between the commissioners and over the vehement objections of the F.C.C. chairman, Alfred C. Sikes. Enacted on a 3-to-2 vote, the rule was an attempt at a compromise between the two sides but it pleased neither.
The compromise rule prevented the networks from producing more than 40 percent of the programs for their prime time schedules. For the rest of the schedule, it prevented networks from negotiating financial interests or resale rights with independent producers until 30 days after a network had signed a deal to pay for a pilot and had committed to terms for buying further episodes.
The rule also barred the networks from investing in programs like "Jeopardy," "Hard Copy" and "Donahue" that are produced exclusively for sale to local stations.
Today's decision by Judge Posner, who was appointed during the Reagan Administration; William J. Bauer, named under President Ford, and Thomas E. Fairchild, nominated during the Johnson Administration, included a blistering indictment of the compromise. It called it illogical, unfounded and full of contradictions that are never resolved or explained.
"The impression created is of unprincipled compromises of Rube Goldberg complexity among contending interest groups viewed merely as clamoring supplicants," Judge Posner wrote.
Arguing that the commission "flunked" its requirement to show that the new rule was rational, the 22-page verdict declared bluntly that "key concepts are left unexplained, key evidence is overlooked" and "contradictions within and among commission decisions are passed over in silence."
The Federal court asked for opinions on whether the F.C.C. could revert to its old rules and gave both sides 15 days to submit arguments.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: PLANS AND POLICIES;
AIDES SAY CLINTON WILL SWIFTLY VOID G.O.P. INITIATIVES

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton aims to convey an impression of boldness and change during his first days in the Oval Office by issuing a whirlwind of executive orders on abortion rights, White House perquisites and government ethics, his aides predict.
They sketch an ambitious domestic agenda for his first weeks, during which Mr. Clinton has said he will "focus like a laser beam on this economy" and "foreign policy will come into play in part as it affects the economy." 
 Aides predict that the new President will quickly move on matters he can change with the stroke of a pen, like doing away with fancy dining room privileges for high officials and reversing Bush Administration bans on fetal-tissue research and abortion counseling at federally financed clinics.
 
Coming Back to Character
 But some of Mr. Clinton's campaign aides and friends, often sounding eerily like President Bush on the campaign trail, say the success of these plans rests a great deal on unanswered questions about Mr. Clinton's character:
*Can a man who is so eager to please say no to the demands of the power-starved interest groups that contributed to his election?
*Can a policy specialist with so many detailed proposals choose a few crucial initiatives and single-mindedly push them through, rather than try to do everything at once?
*Can a man so sharply identified with his generation select a cross section of advisers that balances Washington experience with a youthful urge for change and power?
 
List of Initiatives
 Mr. Clinton's agenda is still embryonic, and it is hard to tell which of the aides now describing it will be around after inauguration day on Jan. 20. And, inevitably, aides sometimes confuse their boss's priorities with their own.
Nevertheless, interviews with Clinton advisers, friends and campaign aides in the last weeks of the Presidential campaign suggest that his first 100 days will begin with several executive orders reversing Republican social policies. They say the list could include all or some of these:
*Ending the ban on homosexuals in the military and the ban on abortion in military hospitals overseas.
*Repealing bans on abortion counseling at federally financed clinics and research using fetal tissue.
*Allowing the importing from France of RU-486, the morning-after abortion pill.
*Establishing a family-leave policy for Federal employees who want time off to care for children or sick relatives.
*Revoking the Reagan-Bush policy of forbidding American aid to foreign organizations that provide abortion services, counseling or referrals.
*Trimming the White House staff and eliminating executive dining rooms and other subsidized perks for top officials.
*Requiring political appointees to sign a pledge barring lobbying of their Government agencies for five years after they leave office. The current legal limit is one year.
 
Legislation
Looking to Set Right Agenda
 The Clinton team says it wants Congress to pass within the first 100 days a combination of tax incentives and public-works spending measures to stimulate the economy, perhaps delaying at first Mr. Clinton's campaign pledge to cut the deficit.
As for his other major legislative aims, including health-care and welfare reform and job training, Clinton aides have given themselves a 100-day deadline to submit legislation in these areas. But they do not expect passage that early.
Mr. Clinton's aides say he talks about keeping his legislative agenda broad enough to take full advantage of his mandate for economic change but lean enough to avoid choking the House Ways and Means Committee, through which all tax legislation passes, with so many bills that nothing is passed.
Nevertheless, a friend recalls asking Mr. Clinton in June which transition model he would follow: Ronald Reagan, who in his first 100 days focused on one issue and got tax and budget changes through Congress, or Jimmy Carter, who pressed 15 equal proposals so complex and controversial that virtually none were approved.
Mr. Clinton replied that he would follow the Reagan model, but then ticked off a list of initiatives he would propose.
"Sounds to me more like Jimmy Carter," his friend told him.
 
Personnel
Fierce Competition For Choice Jobs
 Mr. Clinton's first task will be to choose the leading members of his domestic-economic team: chief of staff, director of the Office of Management and Budget, chief of his Council of Economic Advisers, Secretary of the Treasury and White House liaison with Congress, which will be a crucial job in his Administration.
Already, rivalries are building. In the last two weeks of the Presidential campaign, staff members at the Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters in Arkansas were playing a game that could best be called "Did you see who just walked by with his resume?" The words were usually said in disgust, because as Mr. Clinton's victory became more certain the young staff members became more resentful of the job seekers who haunted Little Rock like apparitions from the Democratic past.
For the first time since the cold war began, the fight for 16 Cabinet posts and 8,500 other political appointments is being fought more along generational lines than ideological ones. Officials who served in the middle ranks of the Carter, Johnson and even Kennedy Administrations -- bursting with ambition after 12 years in the wilderness -- are already clamoring for high-level jobs.
But there is a new generation of Democrats, men and women in their 30's and 40's, who think it is their turn and resent having to compete with the party elders.
And there are "Friends of Bill," an informal group of people dubbed F.O.B.'s who have known Mr. Clinton for years and share many of his goals and instincts. It includes Robert Reich, an economics professor at Harvard University; Roger Altman, a New York investment banker and former Treasury official; Ira Magaziner, a Providence, R.I., consultant on domestic policy; Eli J. Segal, a Boston businessman and the campaign chief of staff, and Susan Thomases, a New York lawyer and a leading campaign adviser.
Mr. Clinton's problem is, as one adviser put it, that while he is clearly committed to bringing in new blood, "you also don't want people who don't know where the bathroom is, because there is so much to be done so quickly."
 
Structure
Revamping Office For a New Politics
 Whomever Mr. Clinton chooses, the appointments will almost certainly have to be accompanied by bureaucratic restructuring to reflect the new President's appreciation for the link between politics and governing.
Mr. Bush tended to view politics as something reserved for election seasons, not as an instrument for governing, a task he preferred to pursue behind closed doors with fellow power-brokers.
By contrast, Mr. Clinton and his aides say he will conduct a permanent campaign for his agenda, with regular bus tours and town meetings to build and maintain a public constituency for his legislation. The Clinton team has clearly learned during the Presidential campaign that this direct contact with voters is also a way to get around the filter of the media.
This objective has led to a kind of detailed organizational planning that many Presidents might scorn as bureaucratic tinkering but that members of the Clinton team consider crucial. They think it is important, for example, to combine the White House communications office with the White House Congressional liaison office to reinforce the White House's lobbying of Congress with its broader messages to the public.
As put by one Clinton adviser, who like most others refused to be identified for fear that it might complicate his or her efforts to be chosen to serve in Washington: "You are not going to pass controversial legislation like health care or welfare reform without the American people behind you. That means integrating communications and legislation. Bush's idea of legislative affairs was having the Speaker of the House up for a drink at the end of the day. That will not be Clinton's."
Another bureaucratic change, Clinton aides say, will be to break down the wall between the National Security Council and the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Clinton has promised to create some sort of economic security council to integrate foreign policy and domestic economic policy, which he contends are inseparable.
Pundits around Washington are already lining up to see who will be the first to write about the inevitable turf clash between a new economic security adviser and the Treasury Secretary.
 
Policies
Setting Priorities, Voicing Concerns
 As for the longer-term initiatives, the top priority will be an economic-stimulus package, which Mr. Clinton and his aides say they want to have in Congress's hands the day after his inauguration.
"Even though he has detailed positions on a lot of issues, and an activist philosophy, some things will take precedence over others," said Bruce Reed, Mr. Clinton's issues adviser. "I think it is safe to say that the economic package will be priority 1A."
The first question that advisers say they will have to decide is which elements of this economic plan go to Congress immediately and which, like health care and welfare reform, may have to come later.
The elements almost certain to go up immediately, aides predict, will be a proposal for an investment tax credit for new plants and equipment, a capital gains tax reduction for investments in new businesses held for at least five years, permanent tax incentives for research and development, initiatives for job training and apprenticeships, and new spending at $20 billion a year for roads, bridges and other public works.
In theory, these programs would be financed by spending cuts in areas like the military and the Federal bureaucracy and by tax increases on overseas corporate profits and Americans earning more than $200,000 a year.
Since many economists have contended that the tax increases will not pay for the new spending, Mr. Clinton has repeatedly promised to reduce his spending plans to the level of revenue available to finance them rather than raise taxes on the middle class.
But while the President-elect and his aides insist they will not go to the still-loosely defined middle class to finance economic stimulation, they have not ruled out increasing the Federal deficit in the short term.
"The question," one economic adviser said, "is, 'If the economy is still dead in the water in January, will we need some sort of net stimulus, something that is not just revenue neutral?' It could be some additional infrastructure spending, it could be a higher investment tax credit or it could be more generous credits for companies which create new jobs over a historical baseline."
Such a package, the adviser said, "would have to be wrapped in a legislative deal that would insure that once the economy is back on track the budget would get cut by an equal amount."
Mr. Clinton's fear of bloating the deficit, his aides say, is at least equaled by his concern that his own, often unrestrained, campaign promises have created expectations for a miraculous economic fix. Whereas six months ago, the candidate's whole emphasis was "I have a plan," now that he has been elected, the mantra of the day is "No quick fixes."
"The big issue out there is what should be in the first legislative package," a leading Clinton economic adviser said. "The sub-issue is how do you handle expectations. The problems are deep and longstanding, and therefore easy, quick, visible successes will be hard to come by."
 
Troubling Thoughts
 Another worry that aides seem to share is that since much of the new spending in any economic-growth package would go into public works the possibilities for a pork-barrel feast are enormous.
"We have to think very carefully about where money will go without looking porkish," one adviser said. "That means making sure that the projects are high priority in anybody's book. Otherwise people are just going to say, 'There go the Democrats. They came back and started throwing money everywhere.' "
Equally tricky will be integrating environmental concerns into the plan for economic recovery, as Mr. Clinton has promised to do. Saying there is "good infrastructure and bad infrastructure," environmentalists want to insure, for example, that public-works spending leans away from autos, trucks and highways and toward rail, mass transit and pedestrian systems. Early drafts of Mr. Clinton's proposals have disappointed many of them.
"The problem," one environmental adviser said, "is that the only plans on the shelf, ready to go, shovel the money out the door and create a lot of jobs, are for more highways. So you lock in lots of long-term spending on things you don't want and you undermine his other environmental goals. If he goes that way, he will be fought by environmentalists."
Whatever happens, once the economic-jobs program is on its way, Clinton aides say they expect other proposals to be broached with Congress in some form in the first 100 days. These include changes in health care, college tuition in return for government service, requiring welfare recipients to work and proposals to improve the energy efficiency of the economy by 20 percent by 2000 and to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions by 2000 at 1990 levels.
But officials say they do not expect such proposals as well as those on family leave and campaign financing to be passed that quickly.
Money is part of the problem, but even more important is the lack of consensus on how to approach controversial issues like health care and welfare reform. Indeed, Clinton aides seem less vexed by finances than by the specter of hostile forces in their own camp. A Democratic Congress, they warn, is no guarantee of consensus.
More than 100 new members of Congress are eager to make their mark, not to mention the other 435 who already have their own agendas. The influence of lobbyists is also as great as ever. Even where there is general agreement among Democrats, there is plenty of room for dissension; for example, there are already at least six health-care plans in the Senate.
"The difficulty will be in persuading Congress to pass his agenda, not theirs," said Mr. Reed, the issues adviser.
Finessing lawmakers will require Mr. Clinton's best imitation of Lyndon B. Johnson's talent for soothing egos and stroking constituencies.
"Labor, minorities, environmentalists, blacks, Hispanics, women, retired people, you name it, all see the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow," a top Clinton aide said. "And somebody is going to be very disappointed."

HEADLINE: The Winds of War, 90's-Style

 BODY:
War with Europe: an inconceivable thought that suddenly isn't so inconceivable. This war, however, would be of the post-cold-war variety -- fought not with bombs and bullets but with escalating barrages of trade restrictions.
The Bush Administration was firm and right yesterday when it announced it would impose punitive tariffs on European white wines. That may lead to a trade war and jeopardize completion of the Uruguay Round of international trade talks. But these immense risks have to be taken. 
 Europe has violated agreements and refused to make amends. For President Bush to capitulate would undermine the credibility of trade agreements past and present and deal a crippling blow to economic growth everywhere.
The controversy goes back to the 1960's, when Europe agreed to keep its markets for soybeans and other oilseeds open to U.S. exporters. The European Community subsequently undermined the agreement by subsidizing its farmers to grow oilseeds. U.S. exports plummeted and after the United States protested, two international panels ruled in America's favor.
Under international trade rules, the E.C. then had two choices. It could have compensated the U.S. for the lost exports or cut back the production subsidies. It did neither. Nor would it agree even to arbitrate.
For six years America has fought to resolve the matter without rancor but without success -- until yesterday. It announced that in 30 days it intended to impose punitive tariffs tripling the U.S. price of European white wines and raising the price of imported ingredients of pet food and cooking oils.
At a superficial level, the U.S. action looks rash and irrational. The E.C. has threatened to respond with retaliatory tariffs. That could set off a spiral jeopardizing the Uruguay Round and, therefore, $200 billion in world trade a year. Why risk that? In a word, credibility. The Europeans, by their own admission and international finding, are breaking an agreement. After six years of walking the last mile, the U.S. must either back down -- stripping future trade agreements of credibility -- or take the only legal measure left.
Hence, far from rashly, the Bush Administration acted prudently, obeying international rules scrupulously. It could have targeted $1 billion of European exports; it limited this step to $300 million worth. It could have imposed the tariffs immediately; instead it put such action off for 30 days.
If the Administration had drawn an inflexible line in the dust, it would warrant condemnation. The world is on the verge of a monumental trade pact that will open up economies as never before to foreign investment and trade in services, food, intellectual property and textiles. To squander that achievement for the sake of U.S. oilseed farmers would be a tragic error.
But the U.S. has made no such mistake. The Bush Administration is looking ahead to when it, and the Clinton Administration, will have to sell the Uruguay Round treaty to Congress. That won't be possible if the U.S. has shown itself unwilling even to defend existing agreements.
The way out is for Europe to avoid retaliation against the U.S. once the 30-day grace period ends, then dedicate itself to figuring out how to honor its trade obligations. Europe triggered this trouble. Now it is up to Europe to keep an ugly skirmish from turning into global disaster.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The New Landscape

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
"In victory, magnanimity." So Winston Churchill advised. But for Bill Clinton it will have to be watchful magnanimity.
Anyone who thinks the gracious concession speeches on Election Night presaged an Era of Good Feeling for the Clinton Presidency -- a suspension of partisanship -- has a short memory. To win, Mr. Clinton had to survive an exceptionally vicious campaign against him. Republicans, embittered and divided, are not going to be kind and gentle to the Clinton Administration. 
 To be effective in the White House, Mr. Clinton will have to win the confidence of not just the 43 percent who voted for him but of many of the other 57 percent. The Republican tactic will surely be to destroy that confidence by personal attack. That is the game Newt Gingrich knows, and it is the one George Bush played in the campaign.
(Was there, incidentally, an inadvertent note of guilt about the nature of his campaign in President Bush's concession speech? I thought so. He said, "We have fought the good fight . . . and I believe we have upheld the honor of the Presidency." It was as if he were trying to reassure himself.)
The hard part of Mr. Clinton's confidence-building will be the central promise he made to the voters: to rebuild the economy. It will take years, even with the wisest policy, to correct the distortions of the Reagan-Bush years and cope with the grim international trends.
What he can do on the economic front, in his first days as President, is demonstrate the caring and the commitment to action that the people felt were missing in George Bush. But his task is complicated by the Perot factor: the fact that Ross Perot won a remarkable 19 percent of the vote on one main argument, that we must eliminate the budget deficit.
If Mr. Clinton actually made the brutal spending cuts that the Perot vision requires, the economic effects would be devastating. The recession would worsen sharply. The Clinton idea, rather, is to stimulate the economy first and then, as it picks up, move toward deficit reduction.
Mr. Clinton can adopt one Perot theme, the reform of campaign financing. The only thing is that real reform will also have to reach the Perot phenomenon itself. It is wrong that one person can spend $60 million in the last month of a Presidential race to flood the voters with propaganda. Careful legislation could persuade the Supreme Court to think again about its 1976 decision that limits on political spending violate constitutional guarantees of free speech.
The area ripe for early action by Congress and Mr. Clinton is social. Within months legislation should end the Federal ban on fetal tissue research and the abortion gag rule. A family leave law will be enacted.
Those so-called social issues touch the most sensitive area of division in the Republican Party. The great struggle shaping up pits the Rev. Pat Robertson and the religious right against conservatives who want Government to stay out of such matters, leaving them to private decision.
Mr. Robertson has achieved great power in the party. His Christian Coalition mailed out 40 million voter guides. (Why is the Christian Coalition tax-exempt? There is a question overripe for inquiry.)
On the other hand, the Robertson forces' domination of the Republican Convention this year offended many voters. Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts warned on Election Night against the Republican Party's following the Democratic example of 20 years ago and moving toward the extreme.
The campaign, on reflection, offers one clear guideline to Bill Clinton as President: Play it straight.
Some of us thought Americans had become so cynical that they did not care what politicians said. But it turned out that dissembling hurt.
Nearly half the voters, asked after they voted, said they thought Mr. Clinton was lying about his draft record in the Vietnam War. But 70 percent thought President Bush was lying about his role in the Iran-contra affair, and that really hurt him on Election Day.
Craig Fuller, Mr. Bush's chief of staff as Vice President, said on ABC's "Nightline" a month ago that the evidence of Mr. Bush's falsity in saying he was "out of the loop" on Iran-contra was irrelevant. "It didn't matter in 1988," Mr. Fuller said, "and it won't matter in 1992." But it did.

HEADLINE: Credit Where It's Due for Cold War's End

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The G.O.P. Won the Cold War? Ridiculous" (Op-Ed, Oct. 28), George F. Kennan states that neither political party can claim credit for victory in the cold war: it belongs to the people who resisted Communism, to Americans of both parties willing to bear the human and material costs, to their allies. But if President Bush takes the blame for America's plight in the global economic recession, why deny him recognition for a happy event that occurred on his watch? 
 Mr. Kennan characterizes as childish the notion that United States policies could have decidedly affected domestic Soviet affairs because "no great country has that sort of influence on the internal developments of any other one." This statement is astonishing for two reasons:
(1) It was the fundamental premise of Mr. Kennan's recommendations of the 1940's that containment would encourage an internal implosion in the Soviet Union. As he expressed it in the famous "Mr. X" article of 1947, "it is entirely possible for the United States to influence by its actions the internal developments, both within Russia, and throughout the international Communist movement."
(2) In the same breath in which he now denies we had the ability to promote the collapse of Communism, he blames alleged American belligerency for the tightening of party and political controls in the Soviet Union during the cold war. For no obvious reason, we could exert an influence on the internal course of the Soviet Union, but only of a baneful nature.
In the 1970's and 80's Mr. Kennan repeatedly warned that the cold war was leading to World War III. Happily, he was wrong. Rather than concede this, he now blames us for having prolonged the cold war. He is at odds with the historical record, the views of those who administer today's Russia and his own previously held opinions.

I.B.M. FIGHTS SOME JOBLESS-BENEFIT CLAIMS

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
I.B.M. is fighting some former workers over their claims for unemployment benefits. Hundreds of I.B.M. employees who left the company in return for a severance bonus have applied for benefits, said Wally Wiegert, director of the State Labor Department's Community Service Center in Binghamton. About half of them have been approved for unemployment benefits, which range up to a maximum of $300 a week, he said. The exact number of claims is confidential, he said. 
 But the International Business Machines Corporation believes that the severance program "is voluntary, so these people aren't eligible for unemployment," said Kathleen Ryan of I.B.M. The computer maker found itself in the position of having to challenge a number of the claims because in New York, people who leave work voluntarily are not always barred from receiving benefits, Mr. Wiegert said. The applications started coming in after July 31, when I.B.M.'s bonus offer ended, he added. Appeals from workers and the company are being heard by an administrative law judge in Binghamton. Unemployment claims can cause an employer's unemployment insurance premiums to rise.

HEADLINE: Fischer Beats Spassky and Carves a New Niche for Himself in Chess

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Bobby Fischer, the temperamental American chess genius, defeated his old rival Boris Spassky tonight, winning a 30-game, two-month exhibition match and re-establishing himself as a force among the world's better grandmasters.
Tonight's victory came after 27 moves when Mr. Spassky, in a hopeless position after accepting a Fischer dare to attack and being crushed by a solid defense, resigned to give Mr. Fischer his winning 10th victory. Mr. Spassky won five games and the rest were drawn. 
 Grandmasters here agreed that the level of play during the match was rather below that of today's championship contenders. Mr. Fischer, who was playing after two decades of mysterious, self-imposed isolation, showed some rustiness, and Mr. Spassky, ranked 101st in the world when the match began, made frequent errors early on. Nonetheless, the experts said, the games were consistently exciting, and Mr. Fischer displayed flashes of his old genius, suggesting that with more practice he would hold his own among the chess elite.
 
May Remain in Yugoslavia
 Mr. Fischer stands to collect $3.35 million in prize money for his victory, while Mr. Spassky is to receive about $1.65 million. Mr. Fischer has hinted he may remain in Yugoslavia; the Treasury Department is threatening him with prosecution if he returns to the United States for violating the United Nations Security Council's economic embargo against Belgrade. At a news conference before the match began, Mr. Fischer held up a letter from the Treasury Department and spit at it.
In 1972, in his last international match, played in the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik, Mr. Fischer also beat Mr. Spassky, who was then a Soviet citizen, gaining the world championship title as a result.
But he was stripped of that title in 1975 by the International Chess Federation after refusing to defend it against Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union. Mr. Karpov became champion by default, and was subsequently displaced by the current champion, Gary Kasparov of Russia.
After losing the championship in Reykjavic, Mr. Spassky took a French wife and French citizenship, settling down to a comfortable life just outside Paris. Though he continued to play regularly, Mr. Spassky, now 55 years old, seldom won tournaments and dropped out of championship contention altogether.
A Yugoslav businessman, Jezdimir Vasiljevic, who organized the Fischer-Spassky match here and who put up the prize money, has said he would like to arrange a match for the official world title between Mr. Fischer and Mr. Kasparov.
But that is not considered likely any time soon. Such a contest would have to be authorized by the world federation, and Mr. Fischer has for 20 years refused to play under its match rules. In addition, Mr. Fischer said recently that he would play Mr. Kasparov only if the Russian accepted a number of unspecified conditions. Grandmasters say they would be astonished if the champion agreed to anything after such an approach.
Meanwhile, negotiations are reported to be under way for Mr. Fischer to play the Hungarian teen-ager Judit Polgar, the world's top-ranked woman, sometime early next year. Ms. Polgar recently became the the youngest grandmaster ever, a distinction Mr. Fischer had held until then.
Today, Mr. Fischer and Mr. Spassky confronted each other on the brightly lighted stage of a darkened auditorium behind a soundproof glass wall. Both sat in high-backed office chairs and studied the chess board between them from under identical black eye shades.
Onlookers followed the moves on color television monitors and large demonstration boards.
This match began two months ago at the luxurious Adriatic resort of Sveti Stevan, a tourist complex built on a tiny piece of land joined by a sand bar to the coast. The setting then shifted to the Sava Conference Center just outside Belgrade.
Grandmasters say they have no idea why Mr. Fischer has decided to return to international competition after his long absence. Some believe he may need the money. Others say he was encouraged to come back by his Hungarian girlfriend, Zita Rajcsanyi, who is herself a good chess player.
Mr. Fischer and Mr. Spassky made no public comment tonight. They are to hold a news conference here tomorrow.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 7, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
The first of four chessboard diagrams yesterday with an article about the match between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky reversed the players' colors. Mr. Spassky had the white pieces, Mr. Fischer the black.

HEADLINE: Is G.M. Fate Still Crucial to U.S.? 

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
"What is good for the country is good for General Motors, and what's good for General Motors is good for the country," Charles E. Wilson, the G.M. president who was to become President Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, is said to have told the Senate Armed Forces Committee. The pronouncement by Engine Charlie Wilson instantly became a symbol of corporate arrogance for a nation that simultaneously loathed and worshiped big business, for there was rough truth in his words.
America was the world's largest consumer of cars, and G.M. was the world's largest producer, a mighty engine of prosperity for G.M. stockholders and the families and communities of workers. 
 Four decades later, with G.M. hemorrhaging jobs and cash, its love-hate affair with America may be ending. Although almost everyone wishes its new managers well, few economists think there is cause for great alarm if they fail to restore the company's profitability or market share.
 
 
Moving On
 "A unique strength of this economy is its capacity to acknowledge failure and move on," said Alfred E. Kahn, a specialist in industrial organization at Cornell University.
Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, added, "Even in bankruptcy, G.M. would not disappear." One way or another, its productive plants and accumulated expertise in engineering and marketing would be recycled.
But isn't the decline of the corporation that symbolized America's postwar industrial dominance a prospect that should be viewed with exceptional anxiety? After all, at the end of 1991 some 370,000 people were on G.M.'s $12 billion North American payroll, while the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands more were indirectly linked to the company. More pointedly, if G.M. reaches the brink, should Uncle Sugar step in to save it, as it saved Chrysler in 1980?
F. M. Scherer, an economist at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, cautiously offers a rationale for treating G.M. as a special case. While the company's jobs are widely distributed across the continent, he notes that big cutbacks would still be "a very severe blow to the already badly damaged city of Detroit." Moreover, the timing of the job implosion, in the midst of a long recession, could hardly be worse.
 Mr. Scherer also expects some jobs lost at G.M. to go overseas. And he worries that a failure by the company in the car business may mean a permanent loss of the sorts of highly skilled, highly paid jobs that Americans need to remain prosperous.
 But many other economists are unpersuaded. Mr. Stelzer says the focus on the fortunes of the corporate entity misses the mark. G.M. is certain to shed payrolls and plants, he notes, whether or not the new managers succeed. And presumably, some of those losses would be gains for workers at other American companies making more popular models.
Paradoxically, an unsuccessful salvage effort -- one in which G.M. fails to cut its payroll and capacity fast enough, and slowly bleeds its way into bankruptcy -- might be least traumatic for most of the workers and communities. They would, at least, have longer to make the transition.
Since there is excess production capacity in the American car industry -- and, for that matter, in the world's car industry -- the number of employees in the business is almost sure to continue to slip. But many analysts think the location of the highly-paid white collar jobs, the jobs that Mr. Scherer worries about most, is no longer tightly linked to the location of manufacturing operations.
What apparently counts most in the good jobs equation is the quality of education and other amenities -- safe streets, clean air, good transportation -- that attract what Robert B. Reich of Harvard calls "knowledge workers." Seen in this light, it should be no surprise that Toyota and Mazda are designing cars in the United States for production worldwide.
Of course, many of the good jobs at risk at G.M. and in the rest of the auto industry are semiskilled, where high pay is a matter of inertia and strong unions -- much as it is in the steel, rubber and heavy machinery industries. Last year, G.M. spent $34.60 an hour for labor, including benefits, roughly twice the average total compensation for the economy as a whole. But Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution argues that high pay in autos and steel has always been a mixed blessing, since it translates into higher prices for consumers.
 Indeed, Mr. Crandall contends that the high pay-high price trade-off has been a rotten deal for the economy. He estimates that the effort in the 1980's to protect blue-collar jobs with import quotas cost car buyers tens of billions of dollars, with much of the money lining the pockets of foreign manufacturers who imported higher-priced, more profitable models.
A common theme running through much of the nascent debate about the public's stake in G.M.'s future is the tension between allowing competitive markets to discipline business, and sparing the innocent the consequences of corporate incompetence. Many economists, including many conservatives, would gladly strengthen the safety net for the underskilled and unemployed.
By the same token, most economists are deeply skeptical about the impulse to reverse the sometimes-harsh judgment of free markets, even when the potential victims are icons of America's industrial might.
The economist Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize winner, concluded, "If you get into the game of too-big-to-fail, you get into real trouble."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: INSIDE THE BELTWAY;
Setting the Table for the Arkansas Travelers

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Even before the election, it was happening. Bookstores displaying the novels of Bill Clinton's favorite mystery author, Walter Mosley, in their windows. Music stores selling out of saxophone lapel pins. Joggers in Clinton-Gore T-shirts sweating their way down K Street. By Wednesday, "Arkansas stew" was on the menu, and selling out, among power lunchers at Mo Sussman's.
Faster than you can riffle through a Rolodex, the world of Washington is realigning itself. But to what? Watermelons and drop-those-final-g's Ozark chic? Jesuitical, community-minded Georgetown University chic? Languid, intellectual Oxford chic? Or brown-bag-lunching, policy-parsing, Federal Register-toting geek chic? 
 "There will be a lot of sweet-potato pie and fried green tomatoes and all that, but these are serious people," said Frank Mankiewicz, the top lobbyist for the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton and a former Kennedy aide. "The talk at dinner parties will be the Canadian health plan and permanent replacement of strikers, things like that. It will be intensely domestic. These are serious people, and times are tough.
 
Camelot, the Sequel?
 "This is much more akin to the entrance of Kennedy than the Carter entrance," added Mr. Mankiewicz, a Peace Corps official in the Kennedy Administration and later press secretary to Senator Robert F. Kennedy. "Jimmy Carter's Administration was the last act of Watergate. The Kennedy election was a tectonic shift generationally, like this.
"Johnson's people came in wondering if they'd be accepted at Georgetown parties. Bill Clinton went to Georgetown. These are not people who are coming to town scorning Washington, or worrying that they'll be scorned. Let's not forget that Al Gore is a product of St. Albans School and the Fairfax Hotel."
So, despite a chilly damp turn in the weather (Oxford chic?), the Republican city-that-was has been bubbling with the prospect of becoming the Democratic city-that-will-be. "It's new and exciting, and he is young and vital," said Esther Coopersmith, a Washington hostess, a Democratic contributor, the mother of a Clinton staff member and vice chairman of the Washington Children's Museum.
 
Opera Buffs and Football Fans
 "He is very interested in art, very interested in culture, loves all kinds of music," Ms. Coopersmith said. "He's been educated. You will see a revival of art and culture in Washington. Hillary will be involved with all the wonderful children's activities."
No word on the plans for parties (Mrs. Coopersmith said it was premature) and no word as to whether the local rubber-chicken banquet circuit wIould be featuring Arkansas fowl in place of the birds of Maryland's Eastern Shore. But no one is ruling out the possibility. If Washingtonians had lived in Biblical Jericho, some here believe, they would have been sporting "I <heart> Joshua" buttons before the walls finished tumbling.
For instance, Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the Washington Redskins, said he would invite some of the new crowd to watch the team play from his box at R.F.K. Stadium, a box that is a venerable institution here. The guest list still "won't be very much different from what it has been," Mr. Cooke said.
"I'm a Republican, but strangely I have a great many Democrat friends. Dodd. Brzezinski. Greenspan -- he's of indeterminate lineage. Sam Donaldson -- what's he? Gene McCarthy and George McGovern."
Does he know of any football fans in the Clinton camp? "You must understand, Mr. Cooke said. "The box is not used to ingratiate myself with the Administration. Please quote me precisely on that. I invite people who are good company, happy, cheerful, good-humored people who love football. That's what counts. I don't care where they come from."
Other cultural institutions will also be sounding out the newcomers. Martin Feinstein, general director of the Washington Opera, said he did not know if Hillary Clinton was interested in opera, but added: "I hope so. I hope the President will become interested."
But more than the cultural elite, more than the idea brokers from DuPont Circle, it is the real estate agents who are most eager to find out who the newcomers are and what they want. If any industry has been in the doldrums in this recession-proof area, it is real estate. And while the turnover in administrations is not likely to have a seismic impact on the market -- perhaps 1,000 home sales and a few hundred rentals -- it certainly can't hurt.
Eager agents are already advertising in The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. "We haven't been getting a lot of calls yet," said Helene Buyten, the receptionist at MGMB Realty, whose ad runs Sunday. The Democrat-Gazette's advertising manager, Karen Hardy, said that a Wall Street Journal reporter's classified ad offering a Washington-area home for rent had produced so many calls the ad was canceled after a day's run.
 
The Big 'They' Factor
 The agents are wondering where "they" will live. Mr. Clinton's transition team is deciding who "they" will be. And carpenters from the General Sevices Administration, the Government's housekeeping agency, are trying to figure out how they can squeeze the 600-member transition team into the top three floors at 1120 Vermont Ave. Idle guards sat among a few random girders and unplugged security gates Wednesday as men with blueprints, hardhats and GSA badges milled around.
Ava Hillman, owner of the candy-and-snack stand in the lobby, said: "I'm trying to figure out if business will get better. I hope it will."
Down Vermont Avenue, David Goldberger at Wonder Graphics Picture Framing hopes they'll mean business for him. "Everyone's going to have to hang up new pictures in their offices," Mr. Goldberger said. "They're going to be putting up new Clinton-Gore glad-handing pictures. They're going to need framing. And we do a very nice job."
At Chapters Bookstore on K Street, the two owners, Terri Meik and Robin Diener, were happily checking their inventories of Mosley mysteries like "White Butterfly" and "Devil with the Blue Dress," of Arkansas poet Miller Williams's book, "Adjusting to the Light," and of Marcus Aurelius's "Meditations."
"Every time Bill Clinton is seen with a book, people want to read that book," Ms. Meik explained. "This is going to be wonderful for us."
 
Yardsticks of Power
 Mr. Clinton's literary tastes are becoming known, but it is the wealth of unanswered questions that add spice to conversations here today. There are the big questions: who will be Secretary of State? Will Mr. Clinton pay his respects to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley on Mr. Foley's turf or summon the Speaker to the White House.
"The big questions are jobs, ideas and coalitions," said Hedrick Smith, who wrote "The Power Game." "The first thing that matters is jobs. And real estate. Power can be measured in real estate -- offices, homes, parking places."
Lloyd Cutler, a senior partner at the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering and a former counsel to President Carter, said: "It's a 12-year drought since all the bright young lawyers in Washington who came here to do public service have had a chance. The line of willing and available people is 10 times longer than the line of jobs, especially when you factor in most people's estimation of what job they should have.
"But there's a sense of great excitement. There was a general feeling, I know, that Democratic administrations are more interesting. The Bush people didn't even fight with one another. There was zero gossip. That should pick up."
Jobs may be the big question, but there are lots of smaller questions, too. Where will the Clinton's daughter Chelsea go to school? Who will give her art and ballet lessons? Where will Mr. Clinton, a Southern Baptist, and Mrs. Clinton, a Methodist, worship? Will Hillary Clinton need a hairdresser, a law clerk or both? Where can a President get a saxophone repaired?
 
New Mistakes, New Laughs
 Joan Cushing, a stand-up comedian here, is exhilarated at the prospect of new material. "It's a new bunch of clowns for me to spoof," said Ms. Cushing, who performs as Mrs. Foggy Bottom at the Omni Shoreham Hotel. "Any time a President comes in for a second term, they're tough to spoof. Reagan was funny for eight years. I don't think Bush would have been funny for eight years.
"What's funny about these guys?," she asked. "I don't know. I'll have to think about the answer to that. Mostly that they're new. They're going to be making all sorts of mistakes."

HEADLINE: The End Of Cynicism

BYLINE: By Steve Erickson; Steve Erickson is author of a forthcoming novel, "Arc d'X."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
It was only a false alarm, 1988. It had only the potential for national revelation, when we would decide as a country to leap into or withdraw from the future. A different sort of discussion that year -- between Mario Cuomo and Jack Kemp, for instance -- might have fulfilled that potential or confirmed why some of us believed that, at the end of the Reagan era with no incumbent seeking the Presidency for the first time in 20 years, it was Leap Year.
In the four years since, it has become clear that in 1988 the 20th century still had to play itself out. In the four years since, the century reduced itself to the cockeyed reverie of a historical nanosecond, in which walls that once seemed to have gone up forever came down in a day. Countries that once invented themselves in an explosion of revolution and sustained themselves in a rage of nuclear power uninvented themselves. 
 These were the four years in which the century would seduce us into believing that it never happened at all. Nuclear imagination gave way to nuclear memory, the temporal whisper of annihilation's possibilities that occasionally reminds us who we are, and what we learned about ourselves before the century vanished. These were also the years in which those of us who call ourselves Americans became too alienated from the courage and audacity that created us to marvel at how we withstood the vagaries of the century -- or to wonder if, given that alienation, we really have.
This year we found ourselves having exhausted every impulse, the shallower ones and the deeper ones. We found ourselves facing the question of whether we would shake off that exhaustion or succumb to it. The contention that the 1992 Presidential election was about the economy is not wholly untrue; it would be glib and insensitive to make such an argument in the face of so much social pain and anxiety.
But this election, as is almost always the case, was finally about ourselves. The last time we thought it was Leap Year, we were not yet ready to leap because we still had one more impulse to exhaust, after the others of idealism, realism, naivete, confidence and heroism that had characterized the previous half-dozen elections. That was the impulse of cynicism, for which George Bush was a more perfect vehicle than we were ultimately willing to live with.
By the early days of autumn, the 1992 election was no longer a referendum on George Bush. That referendum was over, and the President had lost. The election became a referendum on whether Bill Clinton was a suitable alternative to the cynicism we would reject. The re-emergence of yet another alternative, Ross Perot, only made the Clinton Referendum more real, not less.
Cynicism is always the most bitter expression of broken faith. We are now at the end of a generation of broken faith, which began in the 1960's with Presidents who lied to us and ended in the 1980's with us lying to ourselves. Ronald Reagan's pact with the American people was that leadership would henceforth define itself not by Presidents who told the people what they needed to know but what they wanted to hear: it took only slightly more self-delusion than sense to believe Mr. Reagan could increase military spending, cut taxes and balance the budget, as he promised in 1980 and for which we gave him a mandate.
The real scandal of Mr. Bush's pledge never to raise taxes was our complicity in accepting a promise that so clearly served self-interest rather than national interest. This year, when the President virtually accused his opponent of once being a K.G.B. dupe, he again tried to tether his cynicism to our own, after we rewarded similarly squalid slanders against Michael Dukakis in 1988. The great dirty secret of this election has been our insistence that all we wanted from our politicians was the truth, when our history of punishing the tellers of hard truths, from Bob Dole to Bruce Babbitt to Paul Tsongas, insists otherwise. "I wanted sunshine," said a Michigan woman, explaining her disenchantment with the President as though she were voting for a new Wizard of Oz. "I wanted a rainbow."
If Americans found it difficult to take the past seriously and still support Bill Clinton, they finally could not take the future seriously and support George Bush, or take the present seriously and support Ross Perot. Pervading the campaign was the prospect of waking up on Nov. 4 to a Bush re-election: the great collective mood of the country would not have been merely joyless. It would not have been simply depression. It would have verged on the nihilistic. Mr. Bush's cynicism had become so naked it could no longer be denied. We could never feign shocked hurt the next time faith was broken.
In this light, our electoral decision was more than political. Confronted with a similar prospect in 1980, we had no choice but to elect Ronald Reagan. It didn't matter whether he was going to be a better President than Jimmy Carter; the psychic consequences of ratifying Mr. Carter's perceived failure were too dreadful. To choose George Bush again would have been to accept the inevitability of betrayal rather than dare to have faith one more time. To make a choice like that would be a kind of spiritual death.
This was Leap Year. It was the first important American Presidential election of the 21st century, a century that will, by the dictates of time and technology, devour itself faster than the century before it. In a scrambled moral universe, we had to hope that some constant of American faith was intact enough to extract the poetic justice of George Bush being consumed by his own cynicism: the cynical "promises" whose shameless calculations lay not in their breaking but in their making, the "convictions" characterized more by belligerence than by belief, the "commitment" that was never more energized than when it was focused on the consolidation of their own power. The President lost because America could not accept a dawn when the daylight revealed a country for which cynicism was the only identity that remained.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Top 10 U.S. Government Bond Funds

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
United States Government bond funds are regarded as the safest of all mutual funds. Investors in these funds seek an assured steady income.
As of June 30, the latest data available, Treasury bonds made up 41.8 percent of the holdings in the funds. The bulk of the other holdings were in mortgage-backed securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, (23.5 percent); the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, (9.8 percent), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, (8.4 percent). 
 Because the funds invest mainly in Government securities, they have virtually no default risk. But they do carry market risk. As interest rates rise, the prices of the bonds -- and the fund shares -- fall. When rates fall, the share prices of the funds rise.
Government bond funds had a standard 30-day yield of 5.77 percent, on average, in September. They attract more assets, $63 billion, than any other type of bond fund.

HEADLINE: When a Bankruptcy Is the Best Way Out

BYLINE: By DEBORAH M. RANKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Nov. 6

 BODY:
Tom and Annie resisted the decision for more than six months, but in the end they felt they had no option other than filing for bankruptcy. In doing so, this Portland couple, who asked that their family name be withheld, joined more than a million Americans who are expected to file for bankruptcy this year.
Earlier, when Tom and Annie lived in Texas, the economy was terrible and Tom, who is 36, was unable to find a job in the advertising business despite nearly a year of searching. His efforts to start his own ad agency in San Antonio were in trouble. As a last resort, Annie, 32, took a property management job 300 miles away. 
 Tom stayed in San Antonio to give his struggling ad business one last try. But after months of commuting on weekends to see his wife and two young children, he picked up stakes and joined them. They put their San Antonio house up for sale as well as a rental property they had purchased when times were better.
But the autumn passed without a single inquiry about either property. So, 10 months behind on their mortgage, the couple told their bank to foreclose on both houses and filed for bankruptcy.
 
A Big Downside
 They typify the families who are using this route to settle their financial problems. A major result of this decision, however, is a blemished credit history with unforeseen consequences. It could make it tough to obtain credit, to rent an apartment and even to get utility services.
"The main reasons that people end up in the bankruptcy court are circumstances beyond their control, usually employment or medical debt," said Kent V. Snyder, a Portland lawyer who represented Tom and Annie when they refiled for bankruptcy after moving back to Portland, Tom's hometown, because of illness in the family.
As the country's recession has persisted, the number of people filing for bankruptcy protection has reached record levels. For the year ended June 30, there were 972,490 filings, a 10.5 percent increase over the previous 12 months period, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, a Washington research organization. The institute projects about a million bankruptcies by the end of 1992.
"The numbers seeking bankruptcy relief from heavy debt loads are still extremely high, but the worst may be over and we may soon see a leveling off," said Samuel J. Gerdano, executive director of the organization.
There are two ways that individuals can use the Federal Bankruptcy Code to help get their finances in order. Chapter 7, which requires immediate liquidation of whatever assets a debtor may have, is designed for individuals who want to make a fresh start but cannot pay their debts from current income.
By filing for Chapter 7, debtors are allowed to keep certain exempt property such as equity in a home. The remaining property is sold by a court-appointed trustee, with the money then distributed to creditors.
At the end of the case, which usually takes several months, the debtors get a discharge, which cancels most of their debts.
 
The Installment Plan
 Chapter 13, which involves a reorganization of an individual's debts, is designed for people with regular income who want to pay off their debts but are unable to do so. By filing under this chapter, they repay their creditors, in part or in full, in installments that may be spread over three years. During this time, creditors are prohibited from starting or continuing collection efforts.
For Tom and Annie, the decision to file under Chapter 13 was agonizing. "We wrestled with the decision for more than six months," Tom recalled. "It was embarrassing, but we owed about a quarter of a million dollars, including our two mortgages and $20,000 on our two cars. We had only $150,000 in assets. Our family income had dropped to $28,000 a year, or about half of what it had been. There was no other way."
They are now paying a trustee $400 a month, and their creditors are receiving some -- but not all -- of what is owed.
What are the pros and cons of filing for bankruptcy? "The advantage is that virtually all your debts are wiped out, though with Chapter 13 you may pay some of what you owe," said Henry J. Sommer, author of several books on consumer bankruptcy law and a supervising attorney with Community Legal Services in Philadelphia, which provides free legal help for the needy. "It is also a way of protecting some of your property and income from creditors, and stopping creditor harassment."
Another plus for Chapter 13, Mr. Snyder said, is a "cram down" provision that forces lenders to accept repayment terms they may object to but allow a debtor to restructure loans (except mortgage loans) and often stop foreclosure. In addition, a reorganization can allow people to pay off past due Federal, state and local taxes, which are not wiped out.
 
Filing Isn't Cheap
 Another consideration is the cost. Legal fees range from $500 to $800 for a Chapter 7 filing, and can be double or triple that for a Chapter 13 filing. There is also a filing fee of $120.
The drawbacks of filing under Chapter 7, Mr. Sommer said, are that you can lose your nonexempt property, such as some of your equity in your home and car, and in some cases your investments, jewelry or other valuables as well. Bankruptcy can also hurt credit ratings. A filing generally remains on your credit report for 10 years, 3 years longer than most other information.
Mr. Snyder dismisses that negative. "Let's face it," he said, "by the time you're at the brink of filing, your credit rating is already shot, so what difference does it make?"

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Is 7.4% For Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate dropped by a tenth of a point in October for the fourth straight month, to 7.4 percent, but job growth remained at a near standstill, the Labor Department said today.
Analysts found an assortment of good and bad in the latest figures as they waded through crosscurrents that included the end of federally subsidized summer job programs, the return to work of striking school employees, a Postal Service early-retirement program and the cleanup of Hurricane Andrew. 
 Even as it issued the first major post-election economic report, the department sought to rebut or explain newspaper articles challenging the accuracy of recent figures, calling "totally and categorically false" an account in The New York Post that it had tampered with the September data to benefit President Bush's re-election campaign.
 
 
Matched Expectations
 Today's report was generally in line with expectations and appeared to alter few forecasts. And opinion remained divided as to the likelihood of another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
Still, various analysts said today's report did not contradict tentative signs emerging lately, including higher car and chain-store sales and lower claims for unemployment benefits, that pointed to an economic pickup.
"We've changed to a more mixed pattern of the evidence," said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist of the Dreyfus Corporation, although "the economy is still relatively weak."
Payroll jobs, the figure most closely scrutinized by economists, climbed 27,000 last month after a revised decline of 72,000 in September. For the private sector alone -- excluding all levels of government -- the gain was an even stronger 66,000.
 
Effects of Hurricane Andrew
 But analysts noted that the gains were concentrated in health and business services and in construction, where a 20,000 jump reflected rebuilding efforts in storm-damaged Florida and Louisiana.
And these gains, which also included the first monthly increase in wholesale trade in more than two years, were largely offset among workers who produce goods.
Particularly disappointing was a 56,000 drop in factory jobs, following a 38,000 decline in September.
"Employers understand that the third-quarter surge in gross domestic product is unsustainable," said Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. The Commerce Department reported last week that output of goods and services climbed in the quarter at a 2.7 percent annual rate, a result mainly of higher consumer spending not supported by current income.
In Little Rock, Ark., President-elect Bill Clinton issued a statement on the report in which he called the slight improvement in unemployment "a step in the right direction" while repeating his determination "to stem the continued slide in manufacturing jobs."
While shedding workers, factory managers increased the hours of those who remained on the job. The factory workweek expanded 12 minutes, to 41.1 hours, and factory overtime rose 18 minutes, to 3.8 hours. For the private sector as a whole, weekly hours rose 12 minutes.
This allowed the department's index of aggregate weekly hours, a proxy for industrial production figures to be reported at midmonth, to rise to 121.3, from 120.6 in September.
Another payroll gauge, the proportion of industries adding workers during the month, edged up to 50 percent, from 48.7 in September and 42.6 in August.
 
 
Retirements at Post Office
 Employment in local government rose a bit as teachers returned from strikes, despite the end of summer jobs programs. A 45,000 drop in Federal jobs was attributed primarily to an early-retirement option by the Postal Service.
The Labor Department's other survey, of about 60,000 households, showed a continuation of the contraction in the labor force since June. This decline of about 600,000, mostly among adult women, has been the main factor keeping the unemployment rate edging down.
While moves of a tenth of a point are not material, four declines in a row of this size are significant, an official said.
In October, jobs fell 76,000, but the work force fell 314,000, resulting in a 238,000 decline in the ranks of the unemployed. At 9,334,000, the number of jobless people has fallen 640,000 from its June peak.
 
 
Undercuts News Article
 The work-force shrinkage seemed to argue against the contention made in an article in The New York Post on Thursday that the Bush Administration had "purposely tampered" with the September data by artificially shrinking the labor force, thereby allowing the jobless rate to fall. The newpaper had predicted "a shocker" of a work-force rebound in the post-election report today.
In response to a second challenge, department officials said they disagreed with an interpretation of its data that formed the basis of an article in The Wall Street Journal today.
At issue was a divergence again this year between two measures of payroll jobs: one a national figure and the other a figure produced by adding those of the 50 individual states. In the March-July period, the national estimate rose 400,000 while the states' count dropped by 377,000, a difference of 777,000.
Officials said they took the divergence seriously, but noted that it would have been only about a quarter as big if the May-September period had been used. They also said that historically the sum-of-states method had proved far less accurate than the national estimate.
The department predicted today that this year's revision of its national data will be less than 100,000, in a downward direction, far less than the unusually large revision of 640,000 last year and half the average over the last 10 years.
Geographically, 9 of the 11 biggest states for which figures were published showed declines in their jobless rates last month. In New Jersey, the rate fell to 8.1 percent from 9. The New York rate eased to 8.7 from 9.
Regionally, the jobless rate declined to 8.1 from 8.5 in the Northeast; to 6.9 from 7.2 in the South, and to 6 from 6.5 in the Midwest. In the West, the rate rose to 8.6 from 8.1.

The Los Angeles Times in Retreat

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The Los Angeles Times said today that it would stop publishing its San Diego County edition on Dec. 18 and eliminate 500 jobs through a voluntary buyout program and attrition in the next year.
The moves are a result of an advertising slump caused by the weak economy in Southern California and a decline in the circulation of the San Diego County edition, one of several zoned editions produced by The Los Angeles Times, which is owned by the Times Mirror Company. 
 Industry analysts described the actions as drastic. While other newspapers have offered buyouts because of a steady decline in newspaper advertising linage in recent years, this is the second buyout program offered by The Times in about a year. About 300 jobs were cut in the earlier round.
 
Aggressive Zoning
 Also, while other papers have scaled back zoned editions, analysts could not name another big newspaper that had closed one. The Times has had a more aggressive zoning policy than perhaps any other newspaper because its local market is so widespread.
But with the retrenchment of the military and aerospace industries and the decline of the real estate market in the 1990's, all important components of the Southern California economy, advertising linage has fallen. Last year, the advertising linage of The Los Angeles Times fell 14.7 percent, as linage throughout the industry suffered its worst decline since World War II. Linage at The Times has declined every month this year and is down 4 percent to date. The biggest drop has come in classified advertising -- including employment, automotive and real estate notices -- which now accounts for about 25 percent of total advertising, compared with 35 percent to 40 percent a few years ago.
In 1990, The Los Angeles Times became the nation's largest metropolitan daily newspaper, with a daily circulation of 1.2 million. But The Times has been unable to stop suburban newspapers from gaining market share in areas like Orange County, about 50 miles south of the city, and the San Fernando Valley, an area northwest of downtown in Los Angeles County -- regions The Times once presumed were part of its empire.
Industry analysts said that in hard economic times, advertisers cut back their zoned newspaper advertising because they view it as secondary to the coverage they can get in local papers. As a result, those zoned sections are where newspapers make their first cost reductions, the analysts said.
"In a recession, newspapers tend to cut back spending on their country circulation that is beyond their core markets," said John Morton, a media analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan. "It's expensive to keep these editions going, especially if they are losing money, and as a result they tend to get hurt first in a recession."
The San Diego County edition has struggled to gain market share against The San Diego Union-Tribune, which is owned by Copley Newspapers, and local weekly newspapers, many of which have free distribution.
At its inception, the edition for San Diego County, which is about 100 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, had circulation of 28,000 readers, which grew to 65,000 in 1988. But it has since slipped to today's 61,653. The Times does not provide advertising figures for its zoned editions. By contrast, The Union-Tribune, after being formed by the merger of San Diego's morning and evening papers in February, had a circulation of about 390,000.
"Because of its distance from our home base, and the significantly larger numbers of our competitors in San Diego, the overall economics of producing a separate daily edition for San Diego have not worked," David Laventhol, The Los Angeles Times's publisher and chief executive, said in a statement.
"A recent internal study concluded that while our circulation growth has been steady over the years, our base in San Diego is limited by the bigger numbers of other newspapers in the area. There is little likelihood that this would change in the future."
 
Saving at Least $8 Million
 The company said that it expected to save $8 million a year by closing the San Diego County edition but that savings from the employee reduction program had not been determined. The Times will sell its Los Angeles edition in San Diego.
The San Diego County edition's 107 full-time news and business employees will be offered new positions with the newspaper, which will maintain a five-person news bureau in San Diego, the paper said.
The Times introduced its first suburban section in 1952, becoming the first metropolitan newspaper to create zoned editions. Its five regional editions cover broad areas like Orange County and the San Fernando Valley; it also has four weekly or twice-weekly community news sections. In August, the paper introduced a similar section for inner-city neighborhoods, in part a reaction to the riots in the city last spring.
 
Strong Competitors
 The sections and editions are often intended to make The Times more competitive with strong local papers, like The Orange County Register. The Times's Orange County edition has gained circulation in a long-running battle for that market.
For the six months that ended in September, the Orange County edition of The Times had an average weekday circulation of 193,923, a 4.6 percent increase from the similar period of 1991. The Register's average weekday circulation declined 4.5 percent in the period, to 304,755, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
Craig Silvers, an analyst for Crowell, Weedon, said that he doubted that The Times would eliminate other zoned editions because it needs them to maintain a presence in markets that are closest to Los Angeles. "Abandoning Orange County or the Valley would definitely be admitting defeat, and they can't afford to do that now," Mr. Silvers said.
Analysts said that The Times had spent tens of millions of dollars on the zoned editions in an effort to keep the suburban papers, like The Register, Union-Tribune and The Los Angeles Daily News -- the key competitor in the San Fernando Valley -- at bay but that the results were not promising. "The Times has been doing quality work in these zoned editions," Mr. Morton said, "but they are not attracting readers and advertisers in large numbers and that is due mainly to the recession."
In the third quarter, the earnings of Times Mirror, which also owns magazines, other newspapers and cable television stations, increased 6.8 percent, despite a significant drag caused by a decline in advertising at The Times. Times Mirror had net income of $43.8 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with $41 million, or 32 cents a share, in the 1991 third quarter. Revenues rose 2.8 percent, to $914.4 million. The Times's newspaper publishing unit, which includes Newsday, New York Newsday and The Baltimore Sun, posted a 2 percent decline in revenues.
The paper has been seeking to cut costs wherever it can. Some 5,200 employees who have at least a year of service are eligible to apply for the 500 buyouts. The program provides up to two years of pay, depending on length of service and is expected to result in a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter, the paper said.
Shares of Times Mirror closed at $29.75 today, up 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Face of Future At Ferry Dock Is 120 Feet Tall

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
With a clock face large enough to change the whole face of lower Manhattan, a design by two of America's more adventurous architects has been chosen for the new Staten Island Ferry terminal.
The design, by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, won an unusual municipal competition for a plan to replace the old ferry building, which was badly damaged by fire in September 1991. The contest attracted some of the most important architects in the country, drawn by the opportunity to place their signature at one of the city's most visible portals. 
 One hundred twenty feet in diameter, with the seal of New York City in its center -- and illuminated, in the bargain -- the clock proposed by Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown would dwarf even the gaping ferry slips beneath it, through which some 70,000 commuters and sightseers travel every day. It might join the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty as a landmark in the harbor, not only for its design but for the sharpness of feelings it is bound to provoke.
 
'A Bold New Symbol'
 "We wanted this to have a wonderful, vivid image," Mr. Venturi said at City Hall yesterday, after his design was announced as the unanimous choice of an 11-member jury headed by Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Mayor David N. Dinkins predicted that the structure, known formally as the Whitehall Ferry Terminal, would "become a bold new symbol for the city." It is to be completed in 1998 and the cost is estimated at $112 million. The project is being undertaken by the development corporation and the Transportation Department.
Although the clock, equal in height to a 10-story building, has already come under attack and may be modified as the project goes through two years of design, there are many other noteworthy aspects of the proposal.
Behind the clock, and echoing its shape somewhat, is a vast waiting room with a barrel-vaulted ceiling, about 125 feet high, that is meant to evoke the concourse at Grand Central Terminal. A smaller free-standing clock would mark the entrance to Peter Minuit Plaza, which would be redesigned to serve not only pedestrian traffic but also as a one-acre gathering place for community and cultural events.
The waiting room would be lined with concessions, with a restaurant above. City officials have banned vehicles permanently from the ferry, so the new terminal will not accommodate cars, as the old one did.
 
No Stranger to Controversy
 The new terminal would be the first building in New York designed by Mr. Venturi, an unorthodox Philadelphia architect whose 1966 book, "Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture," was one of the most influential criticisms of the spare modernist architecture that predominated after World War II. In the face of Mies van der Rohe's dictum, "Less is more," Mr. Venturi declared, "Less is a bore."
Among the more passionately debated of his own designs was the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London, completed in 1991. Other well-known projects include the new Seattle Art Museum and Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia.
The firm of Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates, is allied in the Whitehall effort with Anderson/Schwartz Architects, of Manhattan.
"We wanted to pick something that says something about the city," Mr. Levitt said. "We wanted to pick something that was joyous, something that's important for our children to come to and enjoy."
Mr. Levitt said the new terminal would be a "signature, to be seen from the water and from the air, which will provide New York with another landmark; more significant, I think, than the twin towers or the Empire State Building, largely because of its location and because of its whimsy."
But 120 feet worth of whimsy is too much for Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island, who said the timepiece made the terminal "look more suitable for a model village under someone's Christmas tree."
The clock "is out of place and will be difficult to adjust when switching, for example, to daylight saving time," he said. "Its only probable benefit would be to remind people that they're late for work -- again."
The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, refused to be drawn into a discussion of the clock. However, she said generally that the Venturi design was "one of the more intriguing and potentially interesting" of the six that had been presented.
The other entrants were Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, James Stewart Polshek and Partners, Aldo Rossi Studio di Architettura, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Rafael Vinoly Architects.
Municipal projects are usually awarded by bidding, rarely by competition. But Carl Weisbrod, president of the Economic Development Corporation, said the site was "one of the most important" in the city, for transportation and access to the waterfront. "That lent itself to trying to engage the greatest architects of our time to make a major civic statement," he said.
Mr. Weisbrod said that the $6 million for the design work and the $16 million to repair the three ferry slips had come from the city and Federal governments. Sources for the construction money are "not yet fully identified," he said, although officials expect some will come from Washington.

HEADLINE: Blue Chips Fall by 3.78 As Bond Market Sags

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks eased yesterday under the burden of a sagging bond market.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 3.78 points lower at 3,240.06. Volume was 205.3 million shares, compared with 219.7 million on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Advancing issues led declines, 892 to 889. 
 The Dow closed the week up 13.78 points and volume was one billion shares.
On the Nasdaq, stocks extended Thursday's rally, as investors continued to select technology stocks on expectations of an economic recovery. The Nasdaq rose 2.74 points to close at 616.82.
 
Market in 'Consolidation'
 On the New York Stock Exchange, profit taking was a big feature after a strong rise of nearly 21 points on Thursday. Slumping bond prices were the spur.
"The market is in a consolidation," said Philip Roth at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "It is still working off an overbought condition."
Analysts said the market had plenty of room to accelerate once the consolidation was over.
The Labor Department said the jobless rate slipped to 7.4 percent in October, its lowest level in six months, even though not many new jobs were created. Analysts said the jobs data created speculation that the Federal Reserve would not lower interest rates soon. That caused the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond to fall.
A trade dispute between the United States and Europe had little impact on stocks because further developments were needed before the market might respond, analysts said. Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards, described the dispute as "pen and pencil rattling."
But some thought that the trade tensions would hurt the stock market over the long term.
"A dark cloud has effectively neutralized a moderately positive employment report," said Hugh Johnson at the First Albany Corporation, referring to the trade conflict.
High-technology and biotechnology stocks continued to forge ahead, benefiting from speculation that President-elect Bill Clinton will move to stimulate growth by spurring small businesses.
Microsoft rose 7/8, to 92 3/4, and Apple Computer gained 3/4, to 55 3/4. Biogen Inc. rose 2 3/4, to 42 1/4, and Chiron surged 4 3/8, to 52 7/8.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Its Gains As Interest Rates Increase

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Helped by higher interest rates, the dollar continued its advance yesterday on world currency markets.
Gold prices declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $335.70 a ounce, off 50 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 80 cents an ounce, to $335.80. 
 The dollar posted gains in Europe and continued to advance when trading shifted to domestic markets, ending near the highs for the week. Trading was quiet, dealers said.
Traders said they were closely monitoring developments in the bond market, where yields were rising as bond prices declined. The yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue is up nearly half a percentage point from before the Presidential election.
 
Yield Up; Dollar Up
 "That yield keeps inching up, and as long as it does that the dollar will keep going higher," said Robert Ryan, a senior trader at the Bank of New York.
The dollar has also been supported by the belief that interest rates in Europe are about to decline, which would make yields on United States fixed-income securities even more attractive in comparison.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 122.95 yen, up 0.27 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.20 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 123.40 yen, up from 122.85 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5375, up from $1.5355 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.5295 to buy one pound, less expensive than Thursday's $1.5365.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5973 German marks, up from 1.5815; 1.4350 Swiss francs, up from 1.4190; 5.4025 French francs, up from 5.3505; 1,367.28 Italian lire, up from 1,352.50, and 1.2550 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2498.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5940 German marks, up from 1.5810; 1.4300 Swiss francs, up from 1.4185; 5.3920 French francs, up from 5.3480; 1.7930 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7785; 1,361.00 Italian lire, up from 1,349.50, and 1.2520 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2481.
Gold traded in London at $335.45 an ounce, down from $339.00 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to $335.30 an ounce from $338.90. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 44 cents an ounce to close at a bid of $337.50.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
BellSouth to Cut 8,000 From Work Force

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The BellSouth Corporation, the largest regional Bell telephone company, said yesterday that it planned to reduce its work force by 8,000, or more than 8 percent of its 97,000 employees, within four years.
About 1,000 jobs will be eliminated by layoff but "a substantial number" of the rest are likely to result from normal attrition. About one out of 100 jobs for managers and one out of 50 jobs for nonmanagement will be eliminated annually in this way. Half the positions eliminated are expected to be management and half nonmanagement. 
 "We expect to eliminate jobs, not people," a BellSouth spokesman said.
John Clendenin, BellSouth chairman and chief executive, said in a prepared statement: "These latest moves are a part of our ongoing effort to maintain our competitive position in the rapidly changing marketplace while continuing to provide our customers quality service."
 
Competition Expected
 Like other regional Bell companies -- the local telephone carriers spun off in 1984 from the old A.T.& T. -- BellSouth has struggled to cut costs. Most have tried to reduce their work forces in the face of expected competition for local service and growing competition for specialized services for large corporations.
Analysts also say that the old Bell System had far too many workers and that overstaffing worsened as carriers moved to digital equipment, which requires fewer workers than previous analog gear.
A company spokesman said that BellSouth did not expect to take a charge against earnings this year as a result of the cut but that it was too early to tell about charges for future years. Such charges, which cut profits, account for money set aside for expensive early-retirement and other severance programs. The company is not expected to offer early-retirement inducements except to certain managers.
 
Focus on Local Carrier
 Shares in BellSouth fell $1.125 yesterday, to $48.875, on the New York Stock Exchange after the announcement.
The job reductions will center on the local carrier, BellSouth Telecommunications, rather than BellSouth's newer operations, like cellular and international services. The local carrier has 83,000 employees.
Excluding the transfer of certain employees from former Bell units, BellSouth said it had eliminated 18,000 jobs since 1984, mainly through attrition. It has 45 employees per 10,000 telephone lines this year compared with 50 in 1990.
Based in Atlanta, BellSouth operates in nine Southern states. It plans to consolidate functions of the comptroller's office and economic analysis office spread over several states. It expects to eliminate 825 jobs in the comptroller's office and 150 in the economic analysis office.

HEADLINE: Pumping Oil: Iran's New Muscle;
Rebounding Iranians Are Striving For Regional Leadership in Gulf

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KHARG ISLAND, Iran

 BODY:
"Welcome to the Islamic Republic of Iran," a sign says at the small, crowded arrival hall of this oil-exporting island in the Persian Gulf.
Outside under a bright sun, stretching for miles into the turquoise waters of the gulf, dozens of tankers line up to load crude oil. On Kharg, occupied by the Iranian Army and only a skeleton crew of oil technicians during much of the Iran-Iraq war, hundreds of Iranian and foreign workers are building and repairing storage tanks and piers. 
 Hundreds of others shuttle far into the gulf by helicopter and tugboat, installing state-of-the-art offshore platforms to feed pipelines that plunge 60 feet beneath the surface and carry oil back to Kharg.
Rebounding from the war with Iraq, which lasted from 1980 to 1988 and devastated Iran's oil industry, Iran under President Hashemi Rafsanjani and Oil Minister Gholamreza Agazadeh has reclaimed its place as the world's second largest exporter of oil after Saudi Arabia, which exports about seven and a half million barrels a day. Producing roughly four million barrels a day, up from a wartime low of fewer than two million, Iran exports about 75 percent of this, mainly to Japan and Western Europe. Venezuela, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Norway rank next with daily exports of about two million barrels.
 
A Huge Rearmament
 The political significance of a revitalized oil industry, although not clearly spelled out by Iranian officials, is obvious. Becoming second to Saudi Arabia as a world oil power, Iran expects to further its greater ambition of being the most important regional power in the Persian Gulf, a long-held foreign policy objective.
More troubling to other countries in the area and to the West is the other side of Iran's plan to achieve this objective: a huge rearmament program, financed largely by the new oil money.
Over the last few weeks, reports by various sources, including the International Strategic Institute in London, have said Iran is in the process of taking delivery on three Russian submarines, hundreds of North Korean Scud missiles, large number of tanks and armored personnel carriers from Russia, North Korea and Eastern Europe, and scores of Russian MIG fighters and Sukhoi bombers. Western officials have repeatedly charged that Iran is also in the process of building the infrastructure to produce nuclear weapons, largely with China's help.
In addition, Saudi intelligence officials say Iran has stationed Silkworm anti-boat missiles on Abu Musa, a Persian Gulf island taken over by Iran a few months ago, after 20 years of jointly managing it with its co-owner, the United Arab Emirates.
 
Ties With Arabs Suffer
 While this report could not be independently confirmed, the takeover of the island has caused a sharp deterioration of Iranian-Arab relations, particularly with Saudi Arabia.
[There are also new tensions with the United States. On Nov. 4, Iran announced that it had arrested an American businessman who lives in Teheran. The same day, Pentagon officials, citing concerns about the three Russian submarines Iran is buying, said an American nuclear submarine had been sent to the Persian Gulf. On Nov. 6, Iran said it had sued the United States in the World Court, demanding reparations for attacks on Persian Gulf oil platforms by United States military forces near the end of the Iran-Iraq war.]
The economic muscle for Iran's new assertiveness, its rearming and its rebuilding of industry comes from oil. By next March, Mr. Agazadeh said, the country will increase its production capacity to 5 million barrels a day.
The mammoth task will require an investment of at least $5 billion in offshore and onshore drilling and exploration and will use the expertise of dozens of Western, including American, and Japanese oil companies.
 
Oil Income Doubles
 The project is Iran's most ambitious since the huge industrialization program begun by Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi in the 1970's before he was overthrown. And it is paying off: this year, Iran's income from oil will reach $20 billion, double what it was in the last decade.
"As far as boosting our oil production capacity is concerned, this is a strategic objective of Iran," Mr. Agazadeh said. "In the past two years investments have increased 15-fold compared to the levels that existed before the war. Every month that passes will witness an increase in our capacity to produce oil."
Iran's oil reserves, estimated at 93 billion barrels, are the world's largest after those of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait. But oil is not Iran's only energy resource. Its natural gas reserves, estimated at 600 trillion cubic feet, are second only to Russia's. And with increasing domestic use of natural gas, Iran will be able to free even more oil for export.
Iran's emphasis on a vast revival of its oil industry became evident in an eight-day tour organized by the Oil Ministry for reporters in October. Although the tour was tightly controlled, visits to Ahwaz, Shiraz, Gach Saran, and the islands of Kharg, Lavan and Sirri, left little doubt that Iran has identified increased oil exports as a prime target of economic planning.
Before the Iranian revolution in 1979, Kharg had the capacity to export more than 8 million barrels a day. During the Iran-Iraq war, it was bombed almost daily for at least three years, at times halting exports completely. Today, it can again load some 5.5 million barrels a day onto tankers.
 
Reconstruction
Economic Shift Reopens Country
 Hundreds of foreign companies have shown a growing interest in returning to Iran after an absence of a decade, lured by the country's rising oil revenues and the end of wars in the Persian Gulf region.
And President Rafsanjani and key ministers in his Cabinet have succeeded in placing thousands of supportive technocrats in crucial jobs. They are forging ahead with a remarkable economic reconstruction program, financed with some $20 billion borrowed from Germany, Japan, Italy, France and Britain, among others, and with rising oil revenues.
These policies are reversing many of the edicts of the first decade of the Islamic revolution. In 1979, revolutionary Iran shunned borrowing from abroad and dealing with "exploitative" Western financial institutions and companies. The Government halved the country's oil production from 6 million barrels a day, arguing that pumping so much oil only comforted avaricious Western consumers.
The new atmosphere was evident this September, when Iran's top hotels were filled with businessmen representing hundreds of foreign, largely Western companies, taking part in the country's annual September International Fair. Iranian importers, supplied with fresh funds from the Government and semi-official institutions, are tapping world markets for computers, machinery, food and industrial expertise.
Reflecting this dash toward reconstruction, Iran's debts are rising fast after having stood at virtually zero in 1988. Since then, they have zoomed to over $20 billion in short-term credits.
 
A Good Credit Risk
 Still, many Western European and Asian diplomats here say they think that with its enormous oil and natural gas resources, Iran is a much better credit risk than other large developing countries like Mexico, Brazil or Egypt.
Moreover, the diplomats assert, despite mounting anxiety in the gulf region and in the West about Iran's rearmament program and its reported pursuit of nuclear weapons technology, the country is not in a position to resort to the use of force or armed aggression against any of its neighbors, as the memory of the devastating war with Iraq is still vivid.
Interviews with many Iranians indicate that the country is exhausted by the war and a decade of revolutionary fervor. The idea of renewed conflict with neighbors or with a large power like the United States has virtually no support from a population anxious to redress a fast-slipping standard of living, cope with rampant inflation and restart economic growth.
"They have a very difficult economic situation and a huge demographic explosion which will make them very careful about new adventures," said a senior Western European diplomat who insisted on anonymity. "As far as the European Community is concerned, the question is do we want to help pragmatists like Rafsanjani come out on top or not? The answer is that it is in our interest to have a normal Iran, busy rebuilding its economy, not an aggressive Iran that feels isolated and abandoned."
 
Relaxation
Rafsanjani Co-opts The Hard-Liners
 To be sure, Iran's Islamic revolution has not been completely transformed into a kinder and gentler movement. But excessive police-state practices that dominated this country of 60 million for more than a decade have palpably diminished. Entering and leaving the country has become much easier with the toning down of extensive security searches at airports and border points.
Cities like the capital, Teheran, Shiraz, Isfahan and Ahwaz are cleaner and have new fountains and public gardens. Shrieking revolutionary slogans are gradually being painted over. Signs of a consumer society are flashed in neon lights, on billboards atop buildings and in newspaper advertising, selling everything from Ecuadorean bananas to Japanese electronic goods.
 
Merchants Back President
 Benefiting from this grudging good will, the end of the Iraq-Iran war and surging oil exports, Mr. Rafsanjani has moved swiftly over the last two years to reopen the door to a wide array of foreign imports. He is gradually floating the rial, Iran's ailing currency, eliminating subsidies that hobble Government expenditures, and forging Iran's multiple security services into one command under his control.
The middle class and the business establishment represented by many of Iran's powerful bazaar merchants strongly support the President, largely because they have concluded that there are no better alternatives among the ruling clergy.
"We have no illusions," said a senior Teheran technocrat, an opponent of the Government. "The best bet we have is Rafsanjani."
An engineer on Sirri island, an important oil industry center, said, "We know our limits, and they know theirs," alluding to the evolving co-existence between the stern social and political requirements imposed by the ruling clergy and its vast, but largely silent, opposition. Restrictions continue on women's attire and public participation in Iranian life, opposition parties are banned, and people wishing to work in the Government must prove their loyalty to the clergy's religious ideals.
 
Support for Rearmament
 The rearming program, estimated by Western intelligence agencies to cost $2 billion a year, appears to have support among technocrats whose lives were deeply affected by Iraq's invasion of 1980.
"Bush burned the forest but left the snake alive," said Mandani Mahmoudi, an oil engineer in Ahwaz, referring to Saddam Hussein's continuing presence in Iraq.
In foreign policy, militant ideologues have influenced Mr. Rafsanjani to pursue their agenda. By all accounts, he continues to support aid to Shiite militias in Lebanon and Islamic fundamentalists in Sudan, Jordan, Egypt and Algeria as well as in the Gaza strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The aim is "exporting" Iran's revolution.
Winning points in domestic policy even as he abandons some areas of foreign policy to more militant members of the clergy, from the earlier phase of the revolution, Mr. Rafsanjani, his supporters say, is nevertheless tackling his opposition after his fashion -- carefully.
"Sheik Rafsanjani is dealing with these people like a man cutting another man's throat with a cotton razor," said Mohammad Sadeq al-Hashemi, an Iranian businessman and politician close to Mr. Rafsanjani's circle.
The Western diplomat, referring to Mr. Rafsanjani's ability to eliminate his domestic foes and free his hand for more reforms, said "It will take three to four years."
 
The Radicals
On the Fringe, But Still Active
 Despite this partial success in pushing militants to the fringe of the decision-making process, Mr. Rafsanjani, who is expected to run for re-election next year, has great odds to beat before becoming master of Iran.
While he has succeeded in ridding the Parliament of its hard-line majority, the hard-liners have moved to other spots where they have become entrenched and where they command enough power and money to mount new obstacles in the way of these reforms.
By far and away the most redoubtable of these spots are the bonyads, or foundations, huge financial organizations built with assets confiscated from the Shah's family and former aristrocratic- and ruling-class members.
For instance, Mohsen Rafiqdoost, the militant founder and commander of Iran's fearsome Revolutionary Guards, has now moved to head the Mustazafan foundation, a multibillion-dollar holding company that controls hundreds of companies.
Bonyad Mustazafan owns some of Iran's finest hotels, prime real estate, pharmaceuticals and other industrial plants, and is planning to make cars in joint venture with Mercedes-Benz. A large portion of its revenues, estimated in hundreds of millions of dollars, are in hard currency, giving Mr. Rafiqdoost the power and ability to finance militant causes overseas. Inside Iran, the foundation, which is accountable to no one, has an even freer hand to maintain the loyalty and devotion of thousands of followers with its funds.
 
Sources of Revenue
 Other, smaller foundations and multiple sources of revenues are available to the community of ideological puritans who disapprove of Mr. Rafsanjani's policies. These include institutions managed by relatives, disciples and ideological followers of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Many of the President's foes realize that Mr. Rafsanjani's reforms are slowly robbing them of influence.
For instance, as the rial rate is unified, an end is in sight for the preferential rate that allowed merchants allied with the clergy to acquire cheap dollars from the Government to buy goods abroad for resale at home at exorbitant profits. Consequently, the generous donations of these merchants to the militant clergy are drying up. Mr. Rafsanjani's project to sell public sector companies to individual investors could eventually demolish the bonyads.
 
Support From Khamenei
 Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Ayatollah Khomeini's successor as Iran's spiritual leader, is giving Mr. Rafsanjani qualified support. Despite frequent calls for a return to the vigilance of earlier times against the West, Ayatollah Khamenei is widely believed to be, in the words of the senior Western diplomat, "playing in on the same soccer field as Mr. Rafsanjani."
Insight into Ayatollah Khamenei's views was provided by an incident last winter that showed to what degree the establishment realizes it is time to ease the strain on the people.
Last winter, Grand Ayatollah Golpaygani, a leading clergyman, said the return of music and chess were contrary to the edicts of Islam. In what appeared to be an answer, Ayatollah Khamenei declared a few days later that it was high time for knowledgeable Islamic scholars to adapt religious edicts to modern times.
The most telling response was evident on a recent night at the recreational lounge of the National Iranian Oil Company on Sirri island. In virtually every corner of the hall, Iranian oil workers coming off oil platforms deep in the gulf sat around tables playing chess. In a room next door, people were standing in line to play billiards.

HEADLINE: U.S., in Job Case, Files First Lawsuit Under New Disabilities Law

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The Federal Government yesterday filed its first lawsuit under the Americans With Disabilities Act on behalf of a Chicago executive who lost his job after his employer, a security-guard company, learned he had brain cancer.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed the suit on Thursday against AIC Security Investigations Ltd., saying the company had illegally dismissed its executive director, Charles Wessel, because of his medical condition even though he was able to perform his job. 
 Mr. Wessel, who is 59 years old and lives in Oak Lawn, Ill., a Chicago suburb, directed a staff of 20 people and supervised 310 security guards. Among his duties was to see to it that the company complied with the terms of the new disabilities law.
The law, which took effect on July 26, makes it illegal for employers to base decisions about hiring, promotion or dismissal on a worker's medical condition except when the condition interferes with the performance of the job. Those who prove they have been discriminated against can recover both compensatory and punitive damages, as well as the job they were denied.
 
'Emotional Stress' Cited
 "We're asking for reinstatement, back pay for the time he's been off and, in his case, the insurance payments he's had to pick up," said Jean Kamp, one of the commission's lawyers handling the case. "We're also looking for compensatory damages for the emotional distress he suffered, after 30 years in the industry and six years with this company -- being dismissed and having to live on unemployment and worry about how to support his wife."
The company issued a statement saying it had not violated the law.
In June 1987 Mr. Wessel developed lung cancer. Last April, after being diagnosed as having brain cancer, he was given 18 days of radiation treatment and was told that he probably had six months to a year to live.
Mr. Wessel and the commission charge that Ruth Vrdolyak, who became the owner of AIC after her husband died in June, told Mr. Wessel to retire in July.
"Mrs. Vrdolyak had her assistant, who had started work about three weeks prior, tell me that she wanted me to retire," Mr. Wessel said in an interview yesterday. "At first I thought it was a joke. When I saw she was serious, I said, 'I'm not old enough to retire, there's no retirement plan and, like everybody else, I live paycheck to paycheck.' "
Mr. Wessel said he was never able to talk to Mrs. Vrdolyak about the dismissal. Instead, he was told not to report to work the next day, but to pick up his paycheck and personal belongings a few days later. His last workday was July 29 -- three days after the disabilities law went into effect.
"One of the things I was working on was a memo and job descriptions for compliance with the disabilities act," Mr. Wessel said. "So when I realized they were serious, one of the things I asked the assistant was if they wanted to get rid of me, why didn't they do it last week, before the law went into effect? I still don't understand why Mrs. Vrdolyak did this. It doesn't make sense."
Mrs. Vrdolyak was not available for comment yesterday. A statement issued by the company said that AIC would not comment on pending litigation and that, in any case, it had not yet received a copy of the complaint.
 
'We Acted Appropriately'
 "We at AIC International Ltd. and its subsidiaries have great sympathy for Mr. Wessel and his family," the statement said. "We are deeply convinced, however, that once all of the facts come out in court, it will be shown that there was absolutely no violation of any law and that we acted appropriately, under the circumstances."
According to The Associated Press, Mrs. Vrdolyak said earlier that Mr. Wessel had been "let go because he is ill," and later said he had not been dismissed but that his position had been eliminated.
"I'm very sympathetic the man is sick," the news agency quoted her as saying. "But with all the medication he had, he was not functioning."
The commission gave a different account. "We're alleging that he was fired because of his disability, although he was able to do the job and in fact was doing the job," Ms. Kamp said.
No trial date has been set. If the case does go to trial the central issue to decide will likely be whether Mr. Wessel was able to perform his job adequately while he was ill. He says he is.
"I'm feeling great," Mr. Wessel said in the interview. "Because of my lungs, I've had limitations for years. I don't run up any stairs. I don't do heavy lifting. But my job was mental, and I know I can do it."
Since his dismissal he has been paying $590.84 a month to continue his health insurance, and $238 a quarter for his life insurance.

HEADLINE: Trans-Atlantic Impasse

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Nov. 6

 BODY:
At the economic summit meetings in each of the last three years, the leaders of the seven most powerful industrial economies have solemnly sworn to do their utmost to bring global trade negotiations to a successful conclusion by the end of the year.
The negotiations were too important to be left to technicians, the leaders agreed at their most recent meeting, in Munich in July. Without firm guidance from the top, they said, the talks were bound to fail, and a dangerous trade war could ensue. 
 They were right. The talks failed this week -- because of failures of leadership on both sides of the Atlantic, European diplomats and officials say. And now a trade war looms between the United States and Europe, instead of an accord that all agree would be the single most effective measure against world recession.
 
Two Principal Figures
 Many officials now look to President-elect Bill Clinton and to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to save the day. But it is unclear what either man intends to do.
Mr. Clinton indicated this week that he did not want to interfere, but many Europeans are fearful, because Mr. Clinton said during the campaign that he believed in punishing nations that closed their markets to American exports. Mr. Kohl was silent on the issue, though members of his Government indicated that they understood the seriousness of the situation.
"We must come together now," the Economics Minister of Germany, Jurgen Mollemann, said today. "We are in the situation that unless there are new impulses for the economy, we will enter a global recession." At a meeting of European trade ministers in Welwyn, England, he said he and his colleagues were continuing to push the French to agree to a compromise.
It is at the door of President Francois Mitterrand of France that German and British officials lay most of the blame for the impasse, but they and other European officials have also been sharply critical of American negotiating tactics.
 
Blocked Compromise
 At a European Community summit meeting in Birmingham, England, three weeks ago, they say, Mr. Mitterrand blocked his 11 colleagues from approving a compromise that most of them believed would settle the remaining issues with the United States.
Officials in Brussels say the stumbling block is the technical issue of whether Europe is willing to reduce subsidies in a way that would limit production of oilseeds, which are used in animal feeds, to 8.5 million tons a year, a move demanded by the United States in the interests of American soybean exporters.
French farmers made life miserable for Mr. Mitterrand in the summer, angry at compromises the community had made to reduce agricultural export subsidies by 21 to 22 percent. With his party facing the possibility of defeat in legislative elections next spring, Mr. Mitterrand has turned a deaf ear to entreaties from his partners to give in again, German officials say.
Only Mr. Kohl has the political clout with Mr. Mitterrand to press him to back down. But the German leader has hesitated to use his influence because the agricultural issue is one of vital political significance to the French President.
Otto Lambsdorff, the leader of the Free Democratic Party in Germany and Mr. Kohl's coalition partner, urged the Chancellor to get more closely involved, even to push the French to the point of isolation if necessary. "I believe the worldwide significance of an improved GATT agreement should take priority," he said today.
As far as officials here can tell, President Bush has left the issue mostly to his Secretary of Agriculture, Edward R. Madigan, and his trade negotiator, Carla A. Hills.
When the Europeans finally wrestled the French into agreeing to the reduction of agricultural subsidies in May, the American negotiators brusquely dismissed the move as inadequate, and Mrs. Hills threatened to impose sanctions on $1 billion worth of European agricultural goods unless more concessions were made.
The Agriculture Minister of Britain, John Gummer, normally the mildest of men, said then, "I hope the U.S. will draw back from this strident action and remember that an agreement requires concessions on both sides."
On Thursday, Mrs. Hills, apparently with President Bush's approval, filed notice that the United States would impose a 200 percent import tax on European white wines and some other items, starting in 30 days. France is by far the largest exporter of white wine to the United States.
Today, French officials called for the European Community to retaliate. And always ready to pose as the champion of Europe against any American attempt to impose hegemony, the French political class has rallied to Mr. Mitterrand.
But German officials fear a far graver crisis could arise unless French intransigence can be overcome or overridden by the other 11.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Pressure on the French
LONDON, Nov. 6 (Special to The New York Times) -- The trade ministers of the European Community nations today put pressure on France, the most outspoken opponent of compromise, to ease its opposition to a deal with the United States on agricultural subsidies.
In an apparent attempt to avoid an escalation of the differences between the United States and Europe, the European ministers meeting outside London made no threats to retaliate if Washington goes ahead with its plans to impose punitive import taxes next month on $300 million worth of European goods.
"We recognized the extremely serious situation that would face the world if a trade war were to develop," Michael Heseltine, Britain's Minister of Industry and Trade, said after the meeting.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister John Major of Britain, who holds the community's rotating presidency, summoned Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, to a meeting at which Mr. Major pressed for a quick resumption of talks with the Bush Administration.
Mr. Delors, who is French, has been accused by some European officials of backing France's hard-line position in an effort to bolster his political ambitions in France.
Mr. Delors today strenuously denied favoring France. And he waved off reporters' questions about whether he would be forced to resign.

HEADLINE: China: Five Years Wasted

 BODY:
China's 88-year-old senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, got exactly what he wanted out of Beijing's recent Communist Party Congress. Delegates endorsed Mr. Deng's latest program of economic reforms, promoted political leaders he favors and removed some of the most rigid hard-liners from top leadership posts.
An identical agenda emerged from the previous congress in 1987. Yet despite impressive economic gains, China has wasted the intervening five years politically, immobilized by the tragedy of Tiananmen and the strict limits Mr. Deng enforces on the reform process. 
 Can economic reform survive without political reform? Some Chinese technocrats, citing the authoritarian capitalism of South Korea and other neighbors, say yes: that's the East Asian way. Yet even they acknowledge that China's structural changes do not yet go far enough to justify such comparisons. Nor are they likely ever to get there under the Communist regime.
Mr. Deng has always taken care to avoid a showdown with moderate conservatives in the Chinese leadership, fearing that that could fatally undermine Communist Party rule.
Instead he has promoted the growth of market sectors, like peasant agriculture, foreign investment and special economic zones, alongside elements of the old command economy like state-controlled heavy industries, centralized controls and non-market pricing. The resulting imbalances have fed inflation and periodically interrupted economic reform.
By putting economic reforms first, the Chinese leadership has avoided many of the problems that undid Mikhail Gorbachev and now threaten Boris Yeltsin. China is unlikely to experience the kind of food shortages and supply and transportation bottlenecks now spreading misery and political disillusionment in Russia.
Yet even Mr. Deng's limited approach to economic reform can unleash the kind of pressures that undermined dictatorial government in Korea. Entrepreneurs, backed by a growing urban middle class, tend to press for more decentralized decision-making and greater governmental responsiveness to public needs.
With its old leadership faltering and no plausible transition arrangements in place, Beijing now stumbles toward what is likely to be an era of wrenching political change. Quite apart from human rights issues, the political paralysis in Beijing signals the need for an imaginative new China policy from the next American administration.

HEADLINE: Japan Can't Teach Us Much About Baseball

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Americans feel compelled to compare their country with Japan, usually with good reason. Americans have also recently started saying that America needs to become better at being itself and should not try to become Japanese. Which doesn't rule out the usefulness of comparisons. In sports and athletics, though, I wonder if Japan has much to offer, as suggested in "Land of the Rising Fastball" by Robert Whiting (Op-Ed, Oct. 7). I recently returned from Tokyo, where I lived and worked more than a year, watching baseball and other sports in person and on television. 
 Baseball has been popular in Japan for 100 years. Amateur informal adult leagues in Japan play baseball with a hardball the way Americans play it with a softball. Yet as Mr. Whiting says about Japanese professional baseball, "the overall level of play is still a notch below that of the big leagues."
And anybody who has walked by a Japanese high school recently would realize that if Japanese baseball players are still smaller than their American counterparts, it won't be the case much longer.
In general, Japanese sports training methods are more authoritarian than American methods, with little input allowed by the athletes; more hierarchical, where athletes move up the ranks more on seniority and less on merit; and more abusive to the athletes -- does anybody in the United States still believe that bloody urine, mentioned without comment by Mr. Whiting, is an indicator of appropriate training?
In addition, unlike their economic equivalents, Japanese sports training methods don't on average seem to work much better than the methods used in other countries. Even in one of their own national sports, judo, where contestants compete in weight categories, the Japanese did not do especially well in the summer Olympics.
A scene comes to mind from the winter Olympics, which I watched in Tokyo on television. A popular woman speed skater had just heroically finished a race, in this, her last Olympics. After crossing the finish line, she collapsed. With her male coaches around her, she kept trying to get up, but fell repeatedly. Nobody helped her. At last, a coach from another country picked her up and carried her to the Japanese warm-up area.
After the Olympics, serious newspapers ran articles with the headline "Now that Sato is done with her athletic career, it is time for her to get married." This might be the Japanese way, but I don't want American athletics to be like this.
A Japanese friend who had been a competitive athlete once told me the Japanese system was unfair to its athletes because the training systems were too primitive. For example, his trainers, to toughen their teen-age athletes, would make them practice all day in the sun during the summer and not let them drink water.
Rather than Mr. Whiting's glowing oversimplification, I would have preferred a discussion of the quiet rerelease of the movie "Mr. Baseball." It was withdrawn from distribution after strong public protest over how the new Japanese owners of the studio changed not only how the movie portrayed Japanese people and baseball, but also the American player's reactions.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Adds Health and Welfare Funds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report that budget cuts have hurt private colleges near Philadelphia (Education page, Oct. 14). 
 The challenge before Pennsylvania is to preserve the fiscal stability that allows us to react to the critical needs of our citizens. Part of preserving our fiscal situation is a re-examination of all programs so we can reduce or discard those that are not essential.
Yes, Pennsylvania has eliminated direct appropriations to 11 select private institutions of higher education. These institutions were receiving special appropriations at a time when we must focus on our many publicly financed universities. There is no reason to continue this practice in difficult economic times. However, you state that Gov. Robert P. Casey's decision was part of a deep cut in health and welfare programs.
Governor Casey's budget provided substantial increases to health and welfare programs. Medical assistance was increased by 13 percent even after proposed cost-containment initiatives; funding for AIDS programs is up 14 percent; early intervention for children with developmental disabilities is up 30 percent, and county children and youth programs increased by 9 percent, including $4 million for adoption.
Other increases include 12 percent for drug and alcohol programs and 8.5 percent for community mental health and mental retardation.
Governor Casey is working with the Pennsylvania General Assembly to provide free or low-cost health insurance for children from birth to age 19. It is estimated 44,000 uninsured children would be served.
Under the Governor's direction, I have worked diligently to maintain the Commonwealth's outstanding record of fiscal management while insuring that our citizens continue to receive critically needed services. Not many states can boast the same record.

HEADLINE: A Confident U.S. Envoy Prepares to Leave Moscow

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 6

 BODY:
When Robert S. Strauss arrived here to take up his post as the United States Ambassador, there was a coup going on, so on the drive in from the airport he settled back for a nap. "There won't be much time to sleep later on," he explained to his surprised wife.
Leaving Moscow a tempestuous 15 months later, Mr. Strauss said he was still not sure when there would be rest. But he said he was convinced that if Russia could hang tough through an additional 18 to 24 months without an explosion, the country's economic crisis would begin to lift. 
 "It ain't the last of the ninth, and I don't know where the seventh-inning stretch comes," Mr. Strauss said, in the sort of talk that Russians sometimes find hard to plumb. "I told them a year and a half, two years, and it'll be different. But I don't know how much worse it'll get, or when it'll start to get better."
 
Momentum of Reforms
 What he does know, Mr. Strauss made clear as he prepared to publicly announce his resignation and return to Washington, is that Russia is on the right track and in the right hands. He said he was convinced that the process of reforms was at least "survivable," and that with every passing day it becomes more irreversible.
"I happen to be an optimist," he said. "I think they're facing another 18 months of crisis, but that the process of reforming their economy is going to survive. I believe that coming out of that 18-24 months there'll be an I.M.F. agreement, a successful Paris Club negotiation, a ruble stabilized at some level -- despite the fact that during those 18 months they're going to have to go through balancing hyperinflation with substantially more unemployment than they can conceive of."
An agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a package of economic support has been delayed by the continuing economic chaos in Russia. The agreement is considered important primarily in the assurance it would give private Western investors. The Paris Club reference was to major Western holders of Russia's debt, from which Moscow is seeking further deferrals in repayment.
Above all, Mr. Strauss seems to believe in President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
"I think President Yeltsin has matured into one of the more astute political leaders I have been around in my time," he said. "He's fiercely anti-Communist, intelligent, he's faced problems that are far more complex and difficult than any politician I have known. He's totally loyal to the people, he has handled nationality problems and former republics with skill and restraint, and more patience that I ever thought he had."
These are strong words from a Texas lawyer who has spent a colorful lifetime as Democratic kingmaker, millionaire deal-maker and consummate political insider.
With that background, it is not surprising that Mr. Strauss has spent the last few days talking less about Russia than trying to explain to incredulous Russians why President Bush was voted out, and assuring them that Bill Clinton will be as sympathetic.
 
Shock Over U.S. Election
 "Nobody out here believed George Bush could lose," Mr. Strauss said with amusement. "Even after the polls closed they were still certain he'd won. So of course they're confused."
One thing he tells questioners with certainty is that he will not be looking for a job in the new Administration. But he is equally certain that he will be returning frequently to Russia to watch the evolution of a process he saw from the outset, one in which he seems to feel a personal stake.
In fact, a good portion of Mr. Strauss's energy as Ambassador to Russia was spent on lobbying, by phone or in Washington, for aid and support for the young Government and its President. He was active in arranging Mr. Yeltsin's trip to Washington this summer and in pushing through Congress the Freedom Support Act, which provides $1.4 billion in aid to Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
Even now it takes only a small prod to awaken the lobbyist in him.
 
The Importance of Russia
 "I think people in the West and in our own country don't really have understanding of the degree to which our own peace and security are tied up with the success of democratic institutions and political institutions and economic stability in Russia," he declared. "There's nothing more important to us than a politically sound Russia."
Mr. Strauss said he understood the hesitation of Western businessmen to invest in Russia now. He said he had stressed to Russians that their country could not grow on Government-to-Government money, and that foreign investment would come only when Russia had built the economic structures to support investment -- laws on taxes, property rights, enforcement of contracts and the like.
"We can't buy a market economy out here," he said. "We can't buy democratic institutions. What we can do is stay fully engaged out here." That, he said, is what he would argue back home.
"I see so many positive things every day -- little shops, women manufacturing jackets at home, shoe-shine stands, sidewalk cafes opening up, people doing things and making money," he said.
"I know there are dangerous forces lurking," he said. "One has to be naive not to recognize them. You can make a case as good as my case that the glass is half-empty. It may be easier to make that case. Maybe I believe they're going to make it because I can't conceive them not making it. I think every day Yeltsin stays in place the process becomes more irreversible."

GREEN DELUSIONS
An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism.
By Martin W. Lewis.
288 pp. Durham, N.C.:
Duke University Press. $24.95. 
 MANY theologians from the fractious days of the early church are known only from the snippets quoted by their enemies, since their own works have perished. Radical environmentalists get much the same treatment in Martin W. Lewis's "Green Delusions." Mr. Lewis cites only those views he wants to condemn, thus assigning the rest to oblivion.
Still, Mr. Lewis presents an interesting analysis of radical environmental credos, provided one can follow him through some fine sectarian hairsplitting. The early church spilled much blood over a single iota -- whether "homoousia" (same nature) or "homoiousia" (like nature) better described the relation between Father and Son. With similar intensity Mr. Lewis, a professor of geography at George Washington University, warns that there exist no fewer than "five main variants of eco-extremism," namely "antihumanist anarchism," "primitivism," "humanist eco-anarchism," "green Marxism" and "radical eco-feminism."
These assorted brands of "eco-extremism" apparently rest on four essential postulates, which Mr. Lewis defines as follows:
* Primitive peoples are the ideal model of how humans can live in harmony with nature.
* Decentralization and local self-rule are the best modes of governance.
* Advances in technology, and probably in science too, are inherently harmful and dehumanizing.
* The capitalist market system is inescapably destructive and wasteful.
Stated thus, the theses of radical environmentalism can be knocked down with less than a book, though Mr. Lewis is interesting in some of his argumentation. He strips primitive humans of their ecological innocence, as he suggests that the first hunters in the Americas, whose arrival coincided with the disappearance of large mammals from the Americas, probably butchered them to extinction. He amusingly takes apart E. F. Schumacher's "Small Is Beautiful" by noting that the "appropriate technology" praised by the late guru "often turns out to mean little more than well-engineered medieval apparatuses." He is also right in noting that new technology is not necessarily more polluting than old technology. Mountains of copper ore had to be smelted to put a telephone in every home, but the optical fiber that will replace it is made only of sand.
"Back to the Pleistocene" is one of the radical environmentalists' slogans. Why labor so hard to crush a thesis so extreme that it even requires that we abandon agriculture? Mr. Lewis has two reasons. He is abjuring a former faith, since, as he disarmingly mentions, he too was once a radical environmentalist. Readers would have been interested to hear why he once embraced the pernicious faith, as well as why he now condemns it.
His second purpose, a little contrived, is to counter what he says is the threat of the radical environmentalism. The movement, he asserts in his introduction, has already grown strong enough that it has begun to assault mainstream environmental organizations for having sold out to the despoilers. "It is precisely to defend environmentalism . . . that I have chosen to speak out against environmental extremism," the author explains.
This premise is surely doubtful. Radical environmentalists are not a potent political movement, nor are they likely to become so as long as the establishment can show that it is responding, however grudgingly, to serious dangers like ozone layer depletion, the destruction of species and the possibility of global warming. Mr. Lewis concedes as much in his conclusion: "Eco-radicalism is admittedly a marginal social movement, its adherents forming an exiguous ideological minority."
But maybe the movement should not be written off so hastily. A catastrophic failure of the planet's natural regulation could well prompt a broader desire for radical change. Though natural systems are robust, they are not invulnerable to every abuse. The appearance of the ozone hole over the South Pole is a striking example of a global system abruptly deranged by human activity. Ecologists may underestimate the marvelous flexibility of economic systems in responding to scarcity with novel alternatives, but economists also err in assuming that the ecological framework is so infinitely flexible that it can be ignored as a constraint on growth.
"Green Delusions" offers a lively cascade of ideas, yet makes for dry reading, given the author's preference for the abstract over the particular. Radical environmentalists will doubtless find the book beneficial, but the already converted may choose to skip the sermon.

HEADLINE: Rage in a Tenured Position

BYLINE: By Anne Matthews; Anne Matthews teaches nonfiction writing at Princeton University. She writes frequently for this magazine on higher education.

 BODY:
Twice a week for the past 32 years, her classes done, Carolyn Gold Heilbrun would leave Columbia University's department of English and comparative literature and walk past the classical facades of the main campus, past the bronze statue of Alma Mater, past the security guards at the wrought-iron west gate, out onto crowded Broadway. Often she would tow along a group of English majors for an open-air conference, arguing imagery and interpretation as they walked the streets of Morningside Heights, finally presenting them with a bus or subway token each, to get them safely home.
In May, Heilbrun walked Columbia's campus for the last time, alone. The 66-year-old professor of English, holder of an endowed chair, past president of the Modern Language Association, a leading feminist literary scholar and, not incidentally, the elusive mystery writer known as Amanda Cross had recently informed the administration of her sudden decision to retire early. 
 "When I spoke up for women's issues, I was made to feel unwelcome in my own department, kept off crucial committees, ridiculed, ignored," says Heilbrun a month or so later, perched on a sofa in her large, light Central Park West apartment, an elderly Maine coon cat in her lap. "Ironically, my name in the catalogue gave Columbia a reputation for encouraging feminist studies in modernism. Nothing could be further from the truth."
Except for brief stints at various schools, including Princeton, Yale Law School and the University of California at Santa Cruz, Heilbrun had taught at Columbia her entire career. "It's like a marriage ending," she says. "Sad, exhausting -- and infuriating, because Columbia will continue to be run by male professors who behave like little boys saying, 'This is our secret treehouse club, no girls allowed.' Well, I'm sick of the treehouse gang."
In this era of fed-up women, with a record 11 major-party female candidates running for the Senate and 106 for the House of Representatives, a strenuous seminar in gender issues has occupied headlines and sound bites: the Hill-Thomas hearings, the Roe v. Wade challenges, the William Kennedy Smith and Mike Tyson rape trials, "Thelma and Louise," "Backlash," the Tailhook Association. In the male-run world of American colleges and universities -- where 88 percent of presidents, provosts and chancellors are men, 87 percent of full professors, 77 percent of trustees -- Heilbrun's defiant departure alarms and fascinates. Is she an ingrate and malcontent -- a grandstanding whistle-blower -- or a courageous speaker of the truth?
"In life, as in fiction, women who speak out usually end up punished or dead," says Heilbrun dryly. "I'm lucky to escape with my pension and a year of leave."
EVEN AS ITS MOST FAMOUS FEMINIST walked out, Columbia was not having a good year. Michael I. Sovern announced in June that he would step down as president of the university. Severe budget problems have led to cutbacks in administrative staff, the dismantling of the School of Library Service and -- thanks to a combination of increased enrollment and a deliberate lag in filling faculty vacancies -- heavier teaching loads. In addition, a continuing federal audit of research spending has been complicated by the university's questionable disposal of 150 cartons of financial records.
Columbia's once-stellar literature program is struggling, too. Long proud of a tradition of well-known intellectuals, set by humanist scholars like Lionel Trilling, Jacques Barzun and Mark Van Doren, the department, as of last year, could boast only two superstars -- the Middle East expert Edward Said, whose academic field is modern comparative literature, and Heilbrun. Whatever their public roles, their in-house prestige could be measured, Manhattan-style, in square footage. Said occupies a suite, complete with fax, computer system and two assistants; Heilbrun spent her tenure in a standard faculty office, licking her own stamps.
The English department is famously inbred: more than a third of the senior literature faculty have one or more Columbia degrees. Many attribute their loyalty to the vigorous life of the mind the program encourages and the faculty's fondness for principled disagreement. Peers at other Ivy League colleges, tracking Columbia's factional warfare in awe, favor terms like "shark pit" and "street brawl for Ph.D.'s."
The 1991-92 tenure season was especially combative. "When the budget pie gets smaller, territoriality gets more intense," says the current department chairman, David S. Kastan, 45. "We had as candidates one white man doing Shakespeare, one white woman doing feminist perspectives on the novel and one black man in African-American poetry and gender studies. Later a white woman in 18th-century drama came up for tenure, too."
All received lifetime employment offers except the feminist -- the third time in six years a feminist scholar backed by Heilbrun was kept off Columbia's faculty. After the fourth graduate student who wanted to work with Heilbrun was rejected by the department's doctoral program this year (three were later admitted), she decided she could no longer make a difference on the issues of women's studies, funding and feminist hiring -- and left. "Hardly anyone was speaking to me anyway," she says glumly.
In books like "Reinventing Womanhood" (1979) and "Toward a Recognition of Androgyny" (1973), Heilbrun helped pioneer the field of women's biography and autobiography with tart, elegant essays written, she says (paraphrasing Marianne Moore), "in language cats and dogs could read." She specializes in British Modernism (roughly 1880 to 1950, the era of Yeats, Conrad and Eliot), and argues that to understand this age of giants, scholars must closely question great writers on their attitudes toward gender, as well as recognize the countermodernist or outsider voices so persistently present in the era's literary conversations: for every D. H. Lawrence a Gertrude Stein, for every James Joyce a Virginia Woolf.
This brand of literary "he said, she said" is now shaking the dim, quiet English offices in Philosophy Hall. Though Heilbrun had been on or around campus since the Truman Administration (when she was a graduate student), some senior male colleagues still seem unsure of her first name, referring to her as "Carol," "Karla" and "Caroline." But many point out that 7 of 31 tenured professors are now female. ("Female doesn't mean feminist," retorts Heilbrun.) Some also add that Heilbrun has a solvent, amiable husband and thus never needed to work at all (hearing this, Heilbrun growls), and still others note that she violated academic decorum by revealing tenure-committee procedure to the popular press -- meaning The Chronicle of Higher Education, a staid periodical for academic administrators.
"That tenure committee had not a single woman on it," says Heilbrun, unrepentant, "and in my experience, confidentiality means complicity, useful chiefly for protecting old-boy secrets."
Heilbrun has always had other lives, rare in a top-class academic. She has been married for 47 years to James Heilbrun, a Manhattan-born urban economist at Fordham University. They met when he was a Harvard undergraduate and she a student at Wellesley, and wed on the eve of his departure for Pacific service in World War II. Their three children are now grown and respectably employed. Much about Heilbrun's off-campus world makes her academic colleagues openly testy. The genteel Central Park West address. The summer house in the Berkshires. The first-name ease with celebrities like Gloria Steinem, whose authorized biography Heilbrun is writing.
And, of course, her publishing record. In 30 years on Columbia's faculty, some literature professors have published only one scholarly book; Heilbrun has written or edited eight. In the crowded universe of mystery fiction, Heilbrun is a star: the 10 exploits of her hyperarticulate amateur sleuth Kate Fansler, Ph.D., a woman "unconstrained by the opinions of others, rich and beautiful," have been translated into Japanese, German, French, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish and Italian, selling in total nearly a million copies worldwide.
That Heilbrun is famous, even beloved, outside Columbia's gates but frequently dismissed or ignored on her home ground baffles some colleagues, angers others. Her departure has sent the department's many factions scrambling for the moral high ground, backbiting and spin-doctoring as they go: Heilbrun is a selfless martyr, Heilbrun is an opinionated victimizer, she is a major mind, a major loss, a major nuisance.
Of seven tenured women, most of whom claim feminism as an area of interest, five, apparently from professional caution, would not discuss Heilbrun. A sixth, the American literature specialist Ann Douglas, waxed indignant in The Chronicle of Higher Education over Heilbrun's criticisms of Columbia, saying "the belief that whatever one sees or chooses to see out one's own window is ipso facto the world, that there is no intelligent dissent or opposition, just (at best) misguided persons in flagrant error, that any one person can speak ex cathedra for a diverse group -- is a pernicious doctrine."
On the other hand, Joan Ferrante, head of Columbia's literature program from 1988 to 1991, feels Heilbrun's complaints are far too modest. "Chairing was hell, but I got my hands on some numbers," Ferrante says. "Over the last 20 years, two or three men have been tenured for every woman. A list of female talent let go from here would make a brilliant department anywhere. Columbia is liberal in everything except the company it keeps; just hint at letting in more women and blacks, and the old boys envision the end of civilization as they know it."
The current departmental chairman, David Kastan, wishes the whole distressing wrangle would go away. "I truly respect Carolyn," he says plaintively. "I found her a very maternal figure. Most of my buddies in the business are feminists. When I was hired, I rushed out and bought all the Amanda Cross murder mysteries, just to get a feel for the Columbia atmosphere."
Only eight bodies turn up in the 10 Cross books, but lacerations to academic egos are severe in these astringent novels of manners. Heilbrun began writing Kate's initial case, "In the Last Analysis" (1964), while an assistant professor at Columbia, living in a crowded New York City apartment with three children under 8, a large dog and a husband in graduate school. She began rising at 5 A.M. to type her way into an alternate existence where epigram, aphorism and cultured badinage about art and life make up nine-tenths of the action.
Unlike P. D. James, Heilbrun does not outline an entire mystery beforehand ("plots are not my strong point," she says cheerfully), but works fast and without notes on her Epson personal computer, using the academic's favorite computer program, Nota Bene. Her competitors receive careful readings: she intensely dislikes Ruth Rendell's work, but enjoys John LeCarre, Michael Gilbert, Dick Francis and Tony Hillerman ("I was on a panel with him -- a truly nice man"). She greatly likes the novels of Sara Paretsky and Sue Grafton, whose creations -- V. I. Warshawski and Kinsey Millhone -- like Kate Fansler, are unabashedly feminist detectives.
Afraid that writing murder mysteries would kill her chances for tenure, Heilbrun took a pseudonym, "Amanda Cross." Gradually she let the mask slip, particularly after one enterprising scholar searched the copyright records. She soon learned that mystery buffs are natural deconstructionists. Did Heilbrun realize, crime fans have demanded, that her pen name reproduces Agatha Christie's initials, that Amanda is the name of Katharine Hepburn's character in "Adam's Rib," that the very syllables of A-man-da-cross are loaded with multiple meaning? Heilbrun-Cross analyses are even a thriving scholarly genre, from master's theses to symposia to learned articles ("Murder in the Canon: The Dual Personality of Carolyn Heilbrun").
Kate Fansler is an enduring presence in Heilbrun's life, though not always a tractable one: she insisted on marrying the dashing lawyer Reed Amhearst halfway through the series, to Heilbrun's annoyance, and remains loyal to Freudian interpretation (Heilbrun, though a fervid Manhattanite, has never been analyzed) and to frequent restorative martinis and cigarettes.
"She started out terribly brittle and skittish, like the women in movies I watched constantly in college," Heilbrun says. "She's become braver, and more real, as she's aged." If the early Cross books milk the comedy, high, low and dark, of any great research university, middle Cross is a sharp -- some reviewers say bitter -- gloss on academe's moral riddles and shortfalls, so much so that "Death in a Tenured Position" carried a blanket disclaimer. In later books, like "The Players Come Again," the deaths chronicled are mostly of the spirit, and sleuthing an excuse for meditations on resilience and renewal in women's lives in middle age and beyond.
Heilbrun is not the first Columbia professor to moonlight as a mystery writer -- in the 40's, the Shakespearean expert Alfred Harbage also depicted Ivy League crime. Even colleagues who insist they've never read an Amanda Cross book ("well, maybe skimmed") still know their criminal geography, confidently pointing out the hallway where the bull terrier Jocasta considers losing her lunch in "Death in a Tenured Position," or the window from which a professor of Middle Eastern studies is tossed, to widespread rejoicing, in "A Trap for Fools." ("No, the victim is not Edward Said," says Heilbrun, with the patience of one who has fielded the question many times.)
And everyone at Columbia seems to know the creaking Philosophy Hall elevator where, in "Poetic Justice," a professor meets a gory end at the hands of a fellow faculty member. The suave murderer is a dead ringer for the late Lionel Trilling, Heilbrun's professional nemesis, who dominated Columbia's literature department for generations and still (it is nervously joked) does the hiring.
Robert Hanning, a Columbia professor who specializes in medieval literature, remembers Trilling's agitation in the late 1960's when women were finally allowed to teach English at Columbia College itself, as opposed to the graduate school or the lowly School of General Studies. "This is not at all a good idea," he remembers Trilling saying often. "Older men should teach younger men, and younger men should then go out and encounter women as the Other."
Founded in 1754, Columbia University (current enrollment: 19,300) is America's fifth-oldest degree-granting institution. In 1983, Columbia College became the last Ivy school to turn coed.
Says Hanning: "Columbia has always been very, very, very male. If you were the good son, you got ahead, you received the mantle of power. The model allows no room for women, and to suggest it might has always elicited varying degrees of Olympian disdain and scorn. Yes, feminism threatens all that. Allowing many voices on campus may not be comfortable, but it's certainly educational. Right now, in New York, in the U.S., in the world, in 1992, it's very important that Columbia not opt for comfort."
Heilbrun is a generational anomaly at Columbia because she arrived before the era of open feminist debate yet after the heyday of formidable "lady" scholars like Marjorie Hope Nicolson. ("The best man this department ever had," declares one nostalgic professor.)
"I've always been alone," Heilbrun says. Born in East Orange, N.J., in 1926, she is the daughter of Estelle Roemer and Archibald Gold. He was an accountant who lost his money in the Great Depression and moved his family to the Upper West Side of Manhattan when Heilbrun was 6. Heilbrun remembers her mother as a woman who "never had the courage to do anything herself in life but saw everything, and saw through everything, very clearly." An only child, Heilbrun grew up solitary in 1930's Manhattan, roller-skating for hours or devouring biographies (in strict alphabetical order) in the St. Agnes branch of the New York Public Library. Her childhood was, she says, good training for future decades as the only woman in the room. Heilbrun wrote her landmark article "The Character of Hamlet's Mother" (its argument: Gertrude may be lustful, but she's not stupid) in 1957, when feminist scholars and consciousness-raising advocates of the 70's were still playing with Barbie dolls. When they came of age, she welcomed them. "Suddenly I looked up and found I had company in the silent room where I had sat, alone and scribbling, for so very long."
How much her lonely climb has embittered Heilbrun, or clouded her judgment, is openly debated by friends and foes. "To my generation, she has been wise leader, facilitator, mentor, muse -- the feminist-critical mother of us all," exclaims the prominent feminist scholar Sandra M. Gilbert, professor of English at the University of California at Davis. Says a current Columbia (female) graduate student: "I've seen her thump a book in seminar and yell, 'Tom Eliot, how can you say that, you utter jerk?' but I found Heilbrun smart, principled and funny. Naturally, that makes her an object of fear and loathing in the academy."
Jonathan Smith, a recent Columbia Ph.D. now teaching at the University of Michigan at Dearborn, feels most English-department senior faculty mambers "placed little or no value on teaching and mentoring of graduate students." When he was preparing for his orals, he recalls, the senior faculty member who had agreed to serve as his major field examiner told him he didn't have the time to meet for an hour once a month. Heilbrun, he says, "was one of the few people at Columbia who made me feel I was being trained to enter a profession. Perhaps this shouldn't count as exemplary behavior in one of the country's leading graduate programs. But it did."
Many of Heilbrun's senior male colleagues insist the department's attitudes toward women have greatly improved in recent years, and whisper that from her Columbia graduate-school days onward, Heilbrun has stubbornly resisted socialization, never acquiring or appreciating basic academic skills like reverence for tradition, teamwork and lying low. Some insist they feel "astonished," "hurt" or "betrayed" at her abrupt exit, offering courteous valedictories -- "a sad, sad end to a distinguished career." Many then go on to add, "but of course you must remember that she is -- " (insert one of the following phrases): "a bit uncollegial," "getting on in years, you know," "quite out of control, where women's issues are concerned," "rather frustrated," "terribly frustrated," "deeply frustrated." (Heilbrun makes an awful face. "Of course I'm frustrated, dealing with such idiocy. If I hadn't been married for 47 years, with three kids, you can imagine what else they'd be whispering.")
Says George Stade, the department's vice chairman, a Columbia faculty member since 1962: "It's hard for her to make a case for gross injustice. If we all have some deep anti-female prejudice, I can't see it, myself. Professor Heilbrun has always been aggrieved, always."
TRACKING POWER struggles in higher education, especially in a rich, private, prestigious school like Columbia, can be like watching sumo wrestlers under a rug. Yet recently, across the country, academic women -- scholars, administrators, staff and students -- have begun formally confronting policies or behavior they consider sexist. Some go public, like the University of Minnesota at Duluth vice chancellor who received repeated death threats after instituting mandatory faculty workshops designed to improve the campus climate for women. Some resign, like the neurosurgeon Frances K. Conley, who charged Stanford Medical School with pervasive sexism, only rejoining the teaching staff after the school seemed to take her allegations seriously.
Others get a lawyer. A former assistant professor of Asian history is suing Georgetown University for sex discrimination and defamation in an $8 million Federal court case. An accounting professor was denied tenure at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee because, she claimed, she was female and pregnant; her suit helped inspire a new state law creating independent appeals committees for contested tenure cases involving "impermissible factors," including race and gender.
Sometimes issues of sexism are exposed but not resolved. At the University of Virginia last spring, a committee of five outside academics appointed by the provost to investigate longstanding problems in tenure, sexual harassment and discrimination concluded that a "hostile" and "unacceptable" climate for women faculty exists at the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration. A 1988 study, not made public, had found similar problems in treatment of women and minorites. In 1992, as they had in 1988, university administrators promised change.
Feminism has become an academic industry since the 1970's. More than 600 women's studies programs or departments exist at American colleges and universities, and feminist theory and criticism are recognized in disciplines from art history and anthropology to history, literature, religion, law, politics, sociology and biology. Carolyn Heilbrun helped found academic feminism, but she has always remained slightly apart, allied to no camp, entirely pleasing no one with her insistence that literature and life are linked, that we are the stories we tell.
Some critics feel Heilbrun's belief in female community is outdated, given the crisis of the mid-1980's, when feminists of color challenged the entire movement as too white and middle class. "Feminisms plural" are now the mode, whether political, literary or cultural. Like the even newer fields of gender and popular-culture studies, today's feminism enthusiastically investigates issues of suppression and oppression, and views gender itself as a fiction, a pose, a performance. Younger scholars' reactions to the Heilbrun affair range from dismayed (if Heilbrun couldn't make a dent, what chance have I?) to dismissive. Says one 28-year-old, briskly, "Carolyn and the old boys are dinosaurs battling in a tar pit."
Increasingly, Heilbrun's audience lies beyond the faculty lounge. On Columbia's main library, names of great men are chiseled in stone -- Homer, Plato, Shakespeare, all the somber masters of Western thought. During Columbia's 1989 graduation, a small group of students unfurled a 140-foot banner from the library roof displaying a far different roster of literary luminaries: Sappho, Juana Inez de la Cruz, Bronte, Dickinson, Woolf. The protesters were removed, but their gesture spurred a two-week university-approved exhibition and lecture series on women's literature.
"I always hated seeing only men's names up there, and decided to do something about it," says the group's leader, Laura Hotchkiss Brown, now a San Francisco designer and writer. "I learned the importance of women's voices by reading Carolyn Heilbrun."
Heilbrun's books "Writing A Woman's Life" (1989) and "Hamlet's Mother and Other Women" (1990) sell extremely well outside academe, in hard-cover and trade paperback. At a June 1992 literary conference at Westbrook College in Portland, Me., honoring the 80th birthday of the poet, novelist and memoirist May Sarton, Heilbrun was a keynote speaker. The audience included dozens of academics trolling for material (Sarton at 80 is a growth industry), but most attendees were civilians -- nurses from Alaska, psychologists from Florida, office managers from Hawaii, many clutching well-thumbed Heilbrun editions. Pre-lecture chatter was of lobster rolls, continuing-education budget cuts and the goddess Ishtar.
In her metallic, emphatic voice, Heilbrun told them of the obligations of women everywhere to, in the words of Ursula Le Guin, "subvert as much as possible without hurting anyone's feelings," and of the lifelong struggles of Sarton, the female artist, alone in a house, wrestling with meaning. When Heilbrun sat down, the men in the packed hall looked wary, the women exalted, shouting and applauding, flushed with emotion.
"She's no Kate Fansler," said a high-school history teacher from Bangor, watching the plump ("I used to be thin, but after 55, I said, Oh, the hell with it") and slightly disheveled Heilbrun greet the receiving line, "but I drove all night so I could say I'd seen the person whose essays made sense of my life."
Heilbrun continues to field letters and calls from academic women she has never met, most on two themes: "No one where I work will talk to me either," and "I'd quit too, if I dared." Offers have arrived from across the country to teach and lecture, and last month a symposium titled "Out of the Academy and Into the World With Carolyn G. Heilbrun" was held at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
Watched gravely by the family cat, Heilbrun spends her days at the computer, drafting the Steinem biography and planning Kate Fansler's 11th adventure. At Columbia, 30 blocks north, a new batch of students is in class, and Heilbrun's office reassigned. Self-exiled on Central Park West, Heilbrun quotes Dorothy L. Sayers: "Time and trouble will tame an advanced young woman, but an advanced old woman is uncontrollable by any earthly force."
There are many old men in academe, but very few old women. Margaret W. Ferguson, a former professor at Columbia now teaching at the University of Colorado at Boulder, says ruefully: "As always, we were planning to watch Carolyn to learn what steps came next in a successful woman scholar's career. Now we'll never know the end of the story." For Carolyn Heilbrun is once again, not entirely willingly, back where she began: a woman alone in a room,writing. Exactly why remains an academic mystery fit for Amanda Cross.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
The Nina, the Pinta and the Fate of the 'White City'

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
Columbia, enthroned on her "Barge of State," sails into the grand lagoon, with Father Time at the helm and Victory at the prow. Eight plaster maidens, representing Arts and Industries, work the oars. From the rim of the lagoon a white city arises, its gleaming arcades and pavilions designed by America's leading architects. Fountains gush. Fireworks explode nightly.
Now, that's the way to celebrate Columbus. Or so it seemed to the builders of the World's Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago nearly a century ago. Unlike the makers of this year's dud Hollywood epics, the architects of the Chicago world's fair knew how to throw a party. Allegory. Spectacle. Classical architecture, an entire city of it, went up in Jackson Park in 1893 to commemorate the discovery of the New World. And for a generation thereafter, Chicago's fabled "White City" was an ideal to which every American city aspired. From the fair emerged the nationwide City Beautiful movement, a progenitor of modern city planning and the force behind such New York landmarks as Grand Central Terminal and the Public Library. 
 The fair's legacy endures. It is evident not just in such banal manifestations as theme parks and festival marketplaces but in the shift of the urban economic base from manufacturing to information. People came to the world's fair not to live, work or shop, but to acquire information -- to gain a global perspective on art, science, history and commerce. A century later, the "world cities" of the global marketplace have come to resemble the White City as places geared primarily to the exchange of ideas.
For Henry Adams, the fair was "the first expression of American thought as a unity." The fair's unified architectural composition of classical facades, spray-painted a uniform white, conferred a semblance of consistency on 19th-century America's cultural hodgepodge. But the unity evoked by the fair's architecture was more than an abstract cultural ideal. In 1893, the Civil War was still a potent memory. An allegorical statue of the Republic, the most prominent sculpture at the fair, was reflected in the lagoon's placid surface; it symbolized a reunified nation.
Above all, the White City expressed the unification of American commerce. As Lewis Mumford observed in the 1920's, the fair's "imperial facade" marked a historical shift in American enterprise: from small, entrepreneurial businesses to large financial trusts; from local industries to national monopolies and the unified rail systems that connected their far-flung operations; from manufacturing to finance.
The world's fair launched the consolidated empire of the robber barons onto a world stage. Its message was commercial warfare. Thus the California pavilion featured a colossal statue of a knight on horseback made entirely of prunes. As the fair's guidebook made clear, the statue "metaphorically impressed the fact that the prunes of that state are being introduced victoriously into all lands, to the discomfiture of the products of other countries." The White City, in short, was a full dress rehearsal for the American Century. It announced to the nations gathered around the lagoon, thanks very much for the Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria, not to mention the Mayflower and General Lafayette, too. Now it's the New World's turn to frame a new world order.
We got our American Century. So where's our Beautiful City? How come, instead of fountains and fireworks, the world's richest nation ended up with glass boxes along Sixth Avenue and burnt-out storefronts in South-Central Los Angeles?
Today, the monuments of the City Beautiful movement loom like haunting reminders of a vision that failed to materialize. For every fixed-up Bryant Park, a dozen neglected Beaux-Arts beauties languish. Spray-painted with graffiti, or with white paint to cover the discordant scrawl, their facades speak not of unity but of fragmentation. They lie scattered about a city increasingly polarized into privileged enclaves and settlements that recall Beirut. Nothing could contrast more sharply with the harmonious vision that arose in Jackson Park.
And yet, for all its visual chaos and social segregation, today's splintered city recalls the White City in one critical respect. It, too, marks a historic shift in commercial enterprise. Manuel Castels, a professor of planning at the University of California at Berkeley, has analyzed this development in depth. His book "The Informational City" traces the decline of manufacturing jobs and their traditional social supports; economic globalization and the new information technologies on which it depends; the mismatch between the city's new immigrant populations and the skills required to succeed in the new service industries. These factors have combined to produce a "dual city" that differs in kind from the industrial city's division between rich and poor.
This city is indeed a New World. It has its intrepid explorers: scholars like Castels, and the economist Saskia Sassen, who have pioneered the study of this new urban terrain. Photographers, film makers, metropolitan news reporters and songwriters are also feeding glimpses of the new city into the cultural mainstream.
Architects have had a harder time getting a handle on things. Buildings are identified more closely with the social segregation of cities than with strategies that might overcome it. Designs for corporate towers, luxury housing, museums and other high-end institutions reinforce the view that architecture chiefly serves the elite.
The view is not entirely a distortion. After two centuries of modern democracy, architecture is still a "white city." Even a recession does not drive buildings down in price that far. But the problem lies only partly with the way buildings are designed and paid for. It is also rooted in the way architecture is perceived, taught and written about. There is no shortage of "downscale" buildings. Courthouses, clinics, schools, subways: if building forms such as these seldom conform to our conception of art, the fault lies with the conception, not just the forms.
Information thus has an important role to play in mending the fractured "informational city." A change in the perception of architecture cannot, by itself, heal a divided city. But it could lead us to discover what lies beyond.

American Indian Art: In the Spotlight at Galleries

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Thousands of American Indian art enthusiasts are expected to converge on New York this week to attend the previews and opening next Sunday of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian, at the Alexander Hamilton Custom House in lower Manhattan. And while they are about it, many people will probably visit the gallery exhibitions timed to coincide with the museum festivities.
The Custom House exhibition of 100 artifacts represents the first stage in the transfer of the oil magnate George Gustav Heye's vast collection of American Indian art. Eventually, more than a million items will be removed from their home at Broadway and 155th Street, where they have been on view since 1922. Some will go to the Smithsonian's permanent satellite downtown, which will bear the name Heye (pronounced Hi); the rest will go to the main facility that the institution plans to build by the end of the decade on the Washington Mall. 
 To celebrate this long-awaited move downtown and to help raise money for the Washington museum, Alexander Acevedo is presenting "Masterworks of Native America," an exhibition of 135 ancient and modern works from 20 dealers at his Alexander Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street. Ten percent of the sales from the show, which will run from Friday night through Sunday, will go to the museum.
"Millions of people have gone to the Heye museum uptown," Mr. Acevedo said. "That's where I fell in love with American Indian art as a boy, when we visited it on a school trip. Now it's time to pay back something."
The artifacts assembled at the Alexander Gallery reflect the amazing variety of American Indian styles, from Aztec to Zuni, that flourished between 200 B.C. and the 20th century. They range in price from $4,500 for a Brazilian terra-cotta Janus bowl made in the 1940's, offered by Spencer Throckmorton of Manhattan, to $3 million for a pre-Columbian collection of 150 pieces of gold jewelry, including pectorals, necklaces, earrings, nose ornaments and headdresses, shown by the Ariadne Gallery of Manhattan.
The show is rich in beaded, painted and fringed deerskin clothing, the most impressive of which is a white outfit, from 1830, of leggings and a war shirt, with one shoulder blackened by gunpowder. It was worn by a Madan, more than six feet tall, from the Upper Missouri region, whose tribe was virtually wiped out by smallpox in the late 1830's.
"He was a very important warrior," said Joel Kopp, whose gallery, America Hurrah, owns the shirt. "It's marked with 27 pipes, one for each of the war parties he led, and a dozen marks for coup sticks, indicating those enemies he touched and did not kill." The price is $375,000.
The fringed frock coat of one of Kit Carson's deerskin suits, which Mr. Acevedo is exhibiting in the show, is lavishly embroidered with silk flowers stitched by an Eastern Sioux in the 1850's. It is $75,000.
In addition to colorful examples of such staples as elaborately beaded moccasins, boldly striped Navajo blankets, painted drums, woven baskets and terra-cotta bowls, the displays include ceremonial masks, buffalo robes, lacy mantas and silver belts.
Each dealer selected one or more rarity. Jeffrey R. Meyers, a New York dealer who has lived among the Eskimos part of each summer for the last 16 years, said his most uncommon item is an ivory drum handle, carved in the shape of a human being, from about 600 A.D. and recently excavated on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea. The figure's ringlike eyes are inlaid with metal. The price is $17,500.
James Economos, a dealer from Santa Fe, chose a powerful Hopi kachina doll, one foot tall, with a bear on its back. "It's not an altar doll but a 19th-century household piece," he said. "The carving on its back means the spirit of the bear has gone into the kachina." The price is $30,000.
Transformation, Aztec style, is represented by a sculpture of a seated ruler in a trance. Mr. Throckmorton, the Manhattan dealer, is asking $50,000 for this 15th-century carving, finely chiseled from volcanic stone.
Another exhibition with some American Indian material, "Masks: Spirits From Beyond," is at the Tambaran Gallery, 20 East 76th Street, through February. Among the eight ceremonial dance masks from the Western Hemisphere are a round-faced Eskimo study, framed by a halo of caribou fur, and a Hopi mask with a chalky face and a curly red wig. And one of the four Guatemalan masks shown, an 18th-century carved-wood deer mask, boasts a haunting bulletlike head and one antler. Prices range from $1,800 to $25,000.
Mr. Throckmorton is presenting "Origins: Lithic Stone Votive Figures From the New World" at his private gallery, Fine Arts of Ancient Lands, 12 East 86th Street, through Dec. 5. The exhibition's 50 egg-shaped votive figures, which were regarded in antiquity as sacred stones, began as axes and were later carved with human features by masters of minimalism between 1800 and 800 B.C. in what is now Mexico. These figures, measuring between 3 and 14 inches high, have eyes, mouths and limbs depicted by grooves or deep routing. They range in price from $500 to $40,000.
Here, too, artists concentrated on magical transformation, with axes metamorphosed into people. "But much of the natural form of the stone remains untouched," Mr. Throckmorton said, "which is the essence of minimalism."

HEADLINE: NOBLESSE LARGESSE

 BODY:
The pressures of the 1992 campaign season were such that the use of language by George Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot became more tarnished by the day (On Language: "Noblesse Largesse," by William Safire, Oct. 11). In a speech following the debate on Oct. 15, Bush compared himself to the pennant-winning Atlanta Braves, saying that politics is like baseball: "It ain't over till the last batter swings." The relevant baseball saying is "It ain't over until the fat lady sings." Perhaps he was being careful not to offend any overweight voters.
Clinton was guilty of awkward language. I heard him speak of "growing the economy" and "growing jobs," as if he were running for national groundskeeper. Perhaps, because of the "character" or "trust" issue, he wanted to reassure skeptical voters by planting an image of Clinton the caretaker. 
 Perot, for his part, committed another racial gaffe in the Oct. 19 debate. Referring to the savings and loan scandal, he said, "Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after the election in 1988." But unlike the infamous "you people" remarks, Perot's slur largely was igored by newspapers and TV.

HEADLINE: New Momentum Builds on 125th Street

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
EFFORTS to revitalize 125th Street have gained momentum in recent months as new ventures have appeared on Harlem's main shopping, entertainment and business thoroughfare.
Last month the Victoria 5 Theater, Central Harlem's only moviehouse, reopened after being dark for more than a year.
In July a local businessman, Joseph Holland, opened a Ben & Jerry's ice-cream parlor on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 125th Street. And before the end of the year a branch of The Body Shop, a London-based cosmetics company, is to take space in the ground floor of the National Black Theater on the northeast corner of 125th Street and Fifth Avenue. 
 Moreover, some local merchants have improved or upgraded their businesses there and a local development agency official says national retailers, including Pathmark and Caldor, are testing the wind for possible positions on the street.
But in the face of these and other improvements, 125th Street, long the economic and cultural center of Harlem, continues to struggle. With each gain that raises hopes about its future, the street seems to suffer a bruising setback.
The Apollo Theater, for example, underwent a $20 million redevelopment a few years ago that added a state-of-the-art entertainment complex, with a recording studio and television production center. But since then losses suffered by the company that operates the historic and cultural landmark have piled up. One problem has been that revenue from the use of these facilities by outside groups has not been as high as expected.
A plan has been devised that will transfer the theater, which is still in full use, to a nonprofit company. Eugene Webb, the principal of Webb & Booker, said that a contract for the transfer could be signed by the end of the month.
Another blow to the retail strip and community at large came last month when fire severely damaged the Carver Federal Savings Bank. The bank is temporarily operating in space in the garage building adjacent to the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building.
Dorothy Pitman Hughes, who owns and operates two stores on 125th Street, said that staying in business on the thoroughfare is a continuing struggle.
"It is difficult being a business person here," she said, standing behind the counter of her new Harlem Office Supplies store. "I am here because I want to be here. But I think we have to work harder to stay in business than people in other areas do."
Mrs. Hughes's new store, which she opened in June, is the only full-service office-equipment store on the street. Its stock ranges from stationery to office furniture and business machines like fax equipment. She also has a copy-and-printing store on the street.
Just three years ago 125th Street seemed poised for a significant turnaround. Rents, at a record high, were pushing toward $60 a square foot. Today, retail brokers say few spaces, when they are available, can command more than $35 to $40. That compares to an average of $50 that owners get for retail space on 14th Street in Manhattan, and $45 to $60 on Jamaica Avenue, the main shopping strip in Jamaica, Queens.
PART of the bounce on 125th Street a few years ago was in anticipation of the start of several sizable new projects. The most ambitious was to have beeen a $160 million International Trade Center on a state-owned parcel at 125th Street and Lenox Avenue. Plans called for a 30-story office tower, a luxury hotel and conference hall and a municipal garage. The project is still planned, but the lack of leases has delayed it more two years.
Like merchants elsewhere, shopkeepers in Harlem have seen business drop and the number of patrons dwindle as the region's economy has soured. Moreover, an older and longer-lasting problem affects businesses and retailers on the street. They have not been helped by the fact that the neighborhood has seen a significant drop in population over several decades and that housing has been abandoned.
Measurable progress has been made by city, state and nonprofit housing groups in the effort to rebuild the community's decaying apartment buildings and brownstones. An area bounded by 110th and 122d Streets and Manhattan and Fifth Avenues has seen the redevelopment of more than 7,000 housing units. But so far the improvements have not reached a level where they can be felt by local merchants and businesses.
Neither have local businesses been helped by the rise in the number of street vendors on 125th Street. On card tables or cardboad boxes set up curbside, they peddle goods ranging from African-made jewelry, art, fabric and clothing to books, tapes, T-shirts and copies of designer leather goods.
"It has gotten worse," said Eugene Giscombe, a principal of Giscombe Henderson, a local real estate brokerage and property management company. "The fact is that they do not have to pay for space and are unfair competition."
Mr. Giscombe, whose company handles 30 stores on 125th Street, said that in addition to the competition from the vendors, shopkeepers sometimes are fined for the street litter left by the vendors or their customers.
The city's zoning laws are on the side of those who want the vendors removed from the street. But dealing with the problem continues to be a sensitive issue.
Part of the problem is that many of the vendors are black West Africans. Some black merchants are reluctant to have them removed by force and others fear reprisals if they are. In the last few weeks tensions between shopkeepers and the vendors have increased as pressure to removed them from the street has built. A loosely organized group of merchants, public officials and people representing the vendors is working to maintain the peace.
DESPITE the problems, Donald Coggsville, president of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, and others remain optimistic, even about the street's short-term future. He points to projects like the Victoria 5 Theater and Mart 125 and to discussions with Pathmark and Caldor and a commitment from the operators of World Yacht Cruises to start a restaurant cruise from the West 125th Street pier by summer.
Among the most successful ventures has been the development of Mart 125, an indoor complex at 260 West 125th where small retailers can rent stalls instead of full-fledged store spaces.
"Mart 125 has been like an retail incubator for the community," Mr. Coggsville said.
Harlem Urban Development, which owns the movie theater building, awarded a new lease to a minority-owned investment team after the previous leaseholder was unable to keep the theater in operation. The theater, which had undergone a $2.5 million renovation five years ago, has five screens and new projection and audio equipment.
"What is significant," said Mr. Coggsville, "is that not only has the movie theater re-opened, but that the investment team is made up of people from the community who have a personal as well as a financial stake its success."
Evidence of the street's potential is visible in the long block between Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevards, where there is literally no space for rent on the south side of the street. It holds a mix of local stores as well as as satellites of national chain stores like Lane Bryant, Woolworth's and the Lerner Shop.
But across the street and along the blocks to the east, buildings stand empty and many of the upper floors have no office tenants or residents.
A PARTICULARLY hopeful sign for the street's future is the redevelopment of the corner at Fifth Avenue and 125th Street.
On the southeast corner is the new Ben & Jerry's ice cream parlor, a result of an unusual public-private partnership. It was developed by Joseph H. Holland, a local entrepreneur who also owns Harlem Travel on Fifth Avenue and 124th Street. Mr. Holland's partner in the venture is a nonprofit community organization, Harlem Ark of Freedom, which operates a shelter on West 129th Street.
To open the franchise, Mr. Holland persuaded the New York State Urban Development Corporation to lend $100,000 in revolving loan funds for women's and minority businesses. The venture also got financing from private investors and a construction loan from Community Capital Bank.
Because the store is owned in part by the nonprofit Harlem Ark, Ben & Jerry waived its standard $25,000 franchise fee. Some of the men who live in the shelter are employed in the ice cream shop and 75 percent of the profits are put back into Harlem Ark.
Mr. Holland said that "business has been better than we expected" and that through September the store had been averaging 4,500 customers a week. Mr. Holland, who owns the building housing the ice cream shop, plans to turn the vacant floors above it into permanent, single-room residences for homeless single adults.
"I believe that to make significant changes you have to reinvest in people as well as businesses," said Mr. Holland, a graduate of Cornell University and Harvard Law School.
Directly across the street from the Ben & Jerry's store, the Body Shop expects to open on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 125th Street before Christmas. It will go into the ground floor of the National Black Theater building.
Lisa Hurling, spokeswoman for the store, declined to give details of the lease. When it opens, the Body Shop will follow three other new tenants into the retail space in the theater's ground level. A restaurant, the Gadabout, which used to be in Mart 125, the Uptown Comedy Club and the Jubilee Book Store have also taken space there.
After the theater was destroyed by fire nearly 10 years ago it was rebuilt and expanded. The new building, designed by Gerard Paul of Geppaul Architects in Broolyn, includes a 288-seat theater, offices and rehearsal-hall space, which is often leased to outside groups and performers. The $7 million theater was built with a package of public grants and private gifts.
Barbara Ann Teer, founder and director of the theater, said that in designing the new building the retail space was expanded so that income from the ground-floor tenants could help support the theater, which is a nonprofit company.
SOME business owners on 125th Street, like Mrs. Hughes, who owns the office supply and copy and printing stores, would like to see state funds being used to redevelop large businesses -- like the movie theater -- apportioned out at her level, too.
"Local merchants are sometimes bypassed when contracts are awarded," she said. "The state should be using their products and services when they can."
Mrs. Hughes is negoting with the state purchasing office and Harlem Urban Development to try to provide the agency with some of its office supplies.
"Right now I am paying H.U.D.C. $35 a square foot for space," said Mrs. Hughes, whose office-supply store is in the retail portion of the garage owned by the corporation. "I am in their house, so to speak, and it would make sense to me that an agency that was set up to develop and support local business could do business with merchants on the street whenever possible.

GOURMET ART
 When displaying sculpture made of chocolate there are no options, temperature wise. So Jacques Kaplan's main concern will be keeping cool during the current exhibition at his Paris-New York-Kent Gallery in Kent, on view through Nov. 22. 
 The theme is food, and in addition to the 25-inch-tall chocolate figures created by Chris Zaima, owner of the The Cafe in New Preston, there are dozens of art works dating from the 17th century to the present, all relating to food.
One of the 19th-century pictures by Howard Brunot depicts a lion being fed raw meat for the titillation of an audience of elegant women. Another is a representation of the Last Supper by the Spanish pop artist Carlos Sansegundo. It is almost nine feet wide, executed in oils, collage and tiny mirrors.
William Copley, Richard Lindner, Don Bracken and Joyce Johnson are a few of the other featured artists.
The gallery, at Station Square, is a converted 9-by-60-foot railroad car. It is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. and by appointment. Information: 927-3357.
 
PUPPETS ON THE WALL
 A portion of the 1,000-year-old East Indian epic, the Mahabharata, has been adapted as a Balinese shadow puppet show at Yale. A performance will be given on Wednesday at 8:30 P.M. in Jonathan Edwards College, 68 High Street, on the New Haven campus. Admission is $5.
The story, which traditionally unfolds over many hours, is about two prominent related families -- one virtuous, the other consumed by greed -- ending in a bloody civil war over land ownership that involves the entire community.
In this version, which takes more than two hours without an intermission, about 30 shadow puppets will be manipulated by I. Wayan Wija, the dalang, or puppeteer. He also provides the voices for the principal characters. The performance will be accompanied by an orchestra from Bali, called a gamelan.
Shadow puppetry, like most other forms of puppetry, originated as low-cost entertainment for adults. The shadows, cast by flat, cutout figures onto a wall or screen, move in and out of the light, manipulated by sticks in lifelike fashion.
For more information or reservations call the Yale Council on Southeast Asia Studies at 432-3431. This is the third Balinese shadow puppet show produced by the council.
 
IRELAND TODAY
 The continuing conflicts in Northern Ireland will be addressed in Hartford today at 7 P.M. by two clergymen who are part of a national speaking program instituted by the Presbyterian Church USA and the United States Catholic Conference. The program will be at the Hartford Seminary, 77 Sherman Street, and is public free of charge.
The Rev. David Clarke, minister at the Terrace Row Presbyterian Church and active in the Presbyterian Church of Ireland, and Msgr. Sean Rogan, pastor of St. Malachy's Catholic Church and a participant in Roman Catholic affairs in Northern Ireland, both served their churches in the largely Protestant city of Coleraine near Derry.
They will discuss Northern Ireland's religious, political and economic problems, and offer their assessment of American attitudes toward the conflict and how efforts have fared in attempting to reconcile Protestants and Roman Catholics.
 
HARPSICHORD RECITAL
 Richard Rephann, a professor of music at Yale who is a harpsichordist and the director of the Yale collection of musical instruments as well as a specialist in the performance of 17th- and 18th-century music, will give a recital of keyboard works by French composers today at 3 P.M.
The performance in the second-floor gallery of the collection, at 15 Hillhouse Avenue, will feature Chambonniere's "Pieces de Clavecin in A Minor," Couperin's "Quatrieme Ordre," and Rameau's "Pieces de Clavecin in G."
Tickets are $15, or $10 for students and the elderly; Call 432-0825 for reservations.
 
TWIST ON IMPRESSIONISM
 Without a doubt, Janet Cummings Good is immersed in her work. A painter, printmaker, illustrator and designer, she has taken to plastering herself with gesso to create printed images on paper, which she calls "Bodyprints." An exhibition of the results may be seen at the Newspace Gallery of Manchester Community College through Nov. 20.
With the addition of color and tone, using oils, prismacolor and graphite, the pieces take on an abstract quality, although flashes of life-sized realistic detail remain, transforming the ordinary into something other worldly.
The gallery, in the Lowe Building at 60 Bidwell Street, Manchester, is open Monday through Friday from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., and Saturday from 9 A.M. to noon.
 
ISSUES OF THE AGED
 One of the most troubling issues for America's older population will be explored in a health insurance symposium for elderly people, to be held on Thursday from 8:45 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. at St. Thomas School, 203 East Avenue, Norwalk.
Speakers will conduct hourlong workshops on such topics as Medigap insurance policies, transferring assets, espousal impoverishment, long-term care, and the prospect of national health care reform.
Danny Albert, principal examiner for the Connecticut Insurance Department, will discuss "Changes, Fears and Trends in Health Insurance for Senior Citizens" at 10:30 A.M. Other speakers include Evelyn Knight from the State Department on Aging, Gerd Weindling and Raymond Moore of the American Association of Retired Persons, Sam Starks of the legal firm of Reiss, Walzer and Starks, and Walter Keenan, an attorney with the Center of Medicare Advocacy.
Advance registration is $2 for those 65 years and older, $5 for those under 65. Registration at the door will be $3 and $6. Call 333-9288 for more information.
 
MUSICAL VARIATIONS
 Tim Prentice, the sculptor, and Robert Andrew Parker, the painter, have a musical side they are exhibiting in a light-hearted show at the Torrington Historical Society Museum through Nov. 21.
For the last 10 years, when not engaged in serious sculptural commissions, Mr. Prentice has been making fanciful musical instruments out of pipe, mailing tubes, 2-by-4's and anything else he might find around the house. For example, his "tenor thump-a-phone," is a sort of xylophone.
Mr. Parker, who moonlights as a drummer at the River Cafe in Gaylordsville, paints pictures that wind up in the collections of the Rockefellers, the Prince of Wales and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But for his own pleasure he has done a series of etchings and paintings of jazz musicians in free-flowing style.
Viewing hours are Monday through Friday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., Saturday from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. and Sunday from 1 to 4 P.M. The museum is at 192 Main Street. Call 482-8260 for more information.

HEADLINE: Election Talk: Federal Funds, Florio's Future

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
GOV. BILL CLINTON'S victory over President Bush last week, officials and political experts say, could change New Jersey's landscape in the coming months -- literally and politically.
State officials' hopes have been raised by Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to create jobs by rebuilding the nation's aging bridges, roads and sewerage systems. Some officials have speeded up the planning process for their pet projects, preparing to weigh in with financing requests when the bell sounds. 
 New Jersey residents contributed $4 million to the Clinton-Gore campaign, the third highest of any state, and officials expect that Mr. Clinton will be looking to New Jersey for men and women to fill key posts in his administration. Some of these appointments could significantly affect next year's campaign for governor.
In an interview, Gov. Jim Florio said this of Mr. Clinton's election: "It means we'll have rapport with the person in the White House, who understands what we're trying to do in New Jersey with welfare reform, with job training and with making health care more affordable and accessible. It also means we won't have to go to Washington every year to fight for mass transportation assistance. President-elect Clinton understands our needs, and we won't have the annual trauma caused by having an administration in Washington that was trying to dismantle our whole system."
Mr. Florio and Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County Executive who served as chairman of Mr. Clinton's campaign in New Jersey, also said New Jersey should benefit from Mr. Clinton's public-works proposals. "In any fair-minded assessment based on need, New Jersey's aging bridges, antiquated schools and road and rail repair problems would have to be looked at," Mr. Janiszewski said. "Such a program would have to be targeted at older states with elaborate but deteriorating infrastructures." In contrast to Mr. Clinton's conviction that the nation's economic problems required such Federal action, Mr. Janiszewski said, "George Bush incredibly stuck to his position that the country's economic needs and high unemployment could be solved by a capital gains tax cut. When did I.B.M. ever build a bridge?"
Mr. Janiszewski cited a report by the State Education Department last year that it would cost $4 billion to repair or replace antiquated school buildings in the state and bring them up to construction code standards. This, he said, could provide another argument for increased Federal aid.
In addition to the public-works program, Mr. Janiszewski said, Mr. Clinton was prepared to support a $20 billion program for public projects that could be ready to go to construction in 90 days. "In Hudson County we've already invested in the planning and design work for several projects, including an addition to the county mental hospital and the court-orderd construction of a new youth center," he said. "So we'll be ready."
 
'Making Tough Decisions'
 Tuesday's election, Mr. Janiszewski said, benefitted Mr. Florio, not simply because of the Democratic victory but because of Ross Perot's strong showing. Voters seemed to understand the independent candidate's message that solving the nation's economic problems carried with it some pain for the taxpayer, Mr. Janiszewski said, "and that being a government leader means making tough decisions." He said this could help Mr. Florio, whose ratings in the polls have still not fully recovered from the backlash against the $2.8 billion tax program he pushed through the Legislature in 1990.
But Stephen A. Salmore, a professor of political science at Rutgers University and a frequent consultant to Republican candidates, called that reading of the election results "a big stretch."
"President Bush ran two or three percentage points better in New Jersey than he did in the rest of the country, and part of that was due to the Republican strategy of linking Clinton with Florio," Mr. Salmore said. "I don't think it bodes well for the Governor's re-election chances. A Florio boost clearly wasn't there."
The Democratic Party is still not the majority party in the state, he added, and most of those who voted for Mr. Perot had been part of the grass-roots anti-Florio tax revolt.
"Republican Congressional candidates were doing much better in their races when the President was attacking the Congress and incumbency was an issue," Mr. Salmore said. "In the last three weeks, however, he didn't talk about Congress in the same way and concentrated his attacks on Clinton." That could have hurt the chances of Republican Congressional candidates in close races, he said. As it turned out, Democrats retained their narrow 7-to-6 majority in the House delegation.
 
Possible Clinton Appointments
 Mr. Clinton's appointments could dramatically alter the dynamics of next year's race for governor, officials say, if he appointed one of New Jersey's two Democratic United States Senators to his Cabinet. Senator Bill Bradley, who campaigned for Mr. Clinton all across the country, has been mentioned as a possible choice for Secretary of State, and Senator Frank R. Lautenberg for Secretary of Transportation.
If either man joins the administration, it would be up to Mr. Florio to appoint a temporary replacement, and a special election would be held next year to elect someone to finish the balance of the term. That candidate's name would appear on the voting machine above the name of the gubernatorial candidate. Assuming that Mr. Florio will be running for re-election, it would behoove him to pick someone who would enhance the Governor's chances.
One name mentioned as a possible Senatorial appointee is Congressman Robert G. Torricelli, who has represented the Ninth Congressional District in Bergen and Hudson Counties since 1982. He won re-election easily on Tuesday. Others include State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak of Elizabeth, the New Jersey State Democratic chairman, and Mr. Janiszewski.
Another theory holds that Mr. Florio would do well to consider appointing a woman to the Senate -- particularly if Christine Todd Whitman, who nearly upset Mr. Bradley last year, wins the Republican nomination for governor. That, some officials suggest, would offset some of Ms. Whitman's appeal to women voters.
 
Speculation on Kean
 The Democratic success last week has also increased speculation about the future of former Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean, president of Drew University and chairman of the Mr. Bush's campaign in New Jersey. Mr. Kean was one of the state's more popular governors and might easily become the favorite if he ran for the open Senate seat against a Florio appointee.
Mr. Kean and Mr. Clinton became friends while serving together on an education task force of the National Governors Association. Officials speculate that if Mr. Clinton were to offer Mr. Kean a Cabinet post, possibly Secretary of Education, New Jersey Democrats would not be inclined to oppose the move.
For his part, Mr. Florio said that he was aware of the various rumors, but that he would decide what to do if and when a Senate vacancy occurs. He declined to join the speculation.
The Governor added that he agreed with the sentiment offered by President Bush in his concession speech. "The election is over," Mr. Florio said. "Now give us a break from politics and let us govern for a while."

HEADLINE: Passaic Flood Tunnel: A Turning Point

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE moment of truth has arrived for the Passaic River Flood Tunnel. Again.
After more than 16 years, $30 million worth of studies by the Army Corps of Engineers, one false start and unceasing controversy, both supporters and opponents of the engineers' proposed tunnel say the time for decision may be at hand. 
 They point to two key developments. Congress has passed and President Bush has signed a bill that could cut New Jersey's share of the tunnel's $2 billion cost to as little as $90 million from an original estimate of $500 million.
And the forthcoming retirement of several influential New Jersey Congressmen including Representive Robert A. Roe, Democrat of Wayne, a co-sponsor of the bill and the chairman of the House Public Works Committee, is widely viewed as a turning point in the prospects for the tunnel, which is aimed at ending the destructive flooding in the Passaic River Basin.
Mr. Roe, who represents the area where much of the worst flooding occurs, has been the driving force behind the project. Without his support in Congress, and without a clear indication -- so far lacking -- that the state is prepared to pay its share of the tunnel costs, Congressional support for the project could dissipate.
This prospect has produced a flurry of proposed resolutions in the Legislature for and against financing the tunnel. The County Board of Freeholders in Passaic County, where the worst of the flooding occurs, has reneged on its support of the tunnel, while some Essex County officials, who had opposed the project, now enthusiastically support it.
Last weekend, opponents of the project gathered in a park in Kearny, not far from the spot in Newark Bay where the tunnel would discharge flood waters. They heard Richard Isaac, chairman of the Sierra Club's North Jersey Group, a strong critic of the project, call it "the biggest environmental issue in the state." They heard warnings that the tunnel could lower the water tables that provide thousands of residents with their drinking water and could actually increase flooding by causing residential and commercial development in the basin. And they heard State Senator John P. Scott, Republican of Lyndhurst, vow to introduce legislation that would bar the project even if it were paid for in full by the Federal Government.
Meanwhile, along the banks of the Passaic River and its tributaries, where rowboats in driveways are almost as common as cars, residents tried to sort out the issues -- including a proposal, offered by tunnel opponents, to have the Federal and state governments buy out and relocate homeowners in the flood plain.
Since the turn of the century, there have been 11 major floods in the basin, which have led to 26 deaths. In the last two decades, portions of the basin have been declared Federal disaster areas seven times. In 1984 alone, three people died and scores were injured when the Passaic River breached its banks. More than 9,400 residents were evacuated, and property damage topped $330 million.
"The Passaic River basin flood problem is listed as one of the two most severe flood problems in the country," Mr. Roe said. "The only solution that will give us the protection that is desparately needed is the flood tunnel."
The centerpiece of the corps' plan consists of two underground tunnels -- a main tunnel, 20 miles long and 40 feet in diameter, and a 1.2-mile spur tunnel, about 22 feet in diameter, that connects with the main tunnel. The two tunnel inlets, about six miles apart, are both in Wayne. Water would enter the tunnels through these two gated concrete inlets that would be opened only during a flood. The main tunnel runs underground, at depths of 125 to 450 feet, to an outlet in Newark Bay.
Also planned are 17.6 miles of levees and 6.2 miles of flood walls along the river.
The Army is ready to start with the design stage of the tunnel, said Raymond Boc, deputy chief of the engineers' Passaic River Division, but it faces a major roadblock. "Right now," he said, "the State of New Jersey has made no financial obligations to the project."
Gov. Jim Florio, who has not taken a position on the tunnel, sent the tunnel proposal to the State Department of Environmental Protection and Energy for its recommendations in 1990. The department says it is still studying the proposal. If Mr. Florio ultimately decides to approve the project, the money would have to be appropriated by the Legislature.
Though estimates of the state's share of the project have run as high as $500 million, the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 signed by the President last weekend would permit New Jersey to use money it has already spent on wetland and watershed land acquisition as a credit toward its share of the tunnel's costs.
The most the state would have to come up with under the new law, Mr. Roe said, is $113 million. And depending upon how certain credits are treated, the state's contribution could be as low as $90 million.
 
Battle in Legislature
 In the Legislature, the tunnel action, for and against, has been heating up. Last month, for example, Assemblyman Gerald H. Zecker, Republican of Clifton, introduced a resolution that would urge the Legislature to commit the money necessary for the project. Before that measure was addressed, another resolution, introduced by Assemblyman John V. Kelly, Republican of Nutley, urged the Legislature to withhold the funds. Neither resolution has reached the floor.
The rally last weekend was sponsored by the Passaic River Coalition, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Basking Ridge that has been fighting the project since it was first proposed in 1988.
Ella Fillipone, the coalition's executive director, said in an interview that the Army engineers' estimates of both the total cost of the tunnel and the state's projected share are too low.
"We come up with $4 billion," Ms. Fillipone said, adding that her estimate was based on what it cost the corps to construct a tunnel under Manhattan -- $100 million per mile. The Army has also underestimated what it will cost to purchase land and easements it will need to build the tunnel, she said, "by at least 50 percent." If her estimates are correct, she said, the state would have to come up with millions of extra dollars beyond the land acquisition credits it would receive under the Water Resources Act. Mr. Boc said he stood by the corps' estimate of $2 billion.
Mr. Isaac of the Sierra Club said the tunnel represented a misguided attempt to change the environment to accommodate development rather than planning development to fit the environment. The tunnel, he said, would lead to increased development in the area, which in turn could negate any benefits the tunnel might offer.
 
Backing a Buy-Out Plan
 "The more you build, the more you accentuate the problem," he said. "You're end up increasing the flooding when there is less grass, fewer trees and more asphalt."
A more economical and environmentally sound approach, he said, would be to buy out and relocate residential property owners who live in the flood plain. "If you insist on building where it floods every year, and you really want to live there, then build a house on stilts or build a house that floats," Mr. Isaac said. "But if you don't like living where it floods, then we will help you move."
Ms. Fillipone said such a plan would cost much less than building a tunnel.
"Let's take the people with the highest risk and relocate them," she said. "It's a one-time cost, and it comes out to $150 million." She said that 774 homes would have to be bought out.
The Army, however, rejected the buyout idea as being too expensive. To buy all the properties that would be affected by a "10-year flood" -- a flood of a magnitude that occurs once in a decade -- would involve as many as 8,000 structures and cost about $2.8 billion, Mr. Boc said.
"When you talk about buying out 8,000 homes and businesses, you're talking about relocating a population," he said. And that would not provide protection against floods of greater magnitude. The tunnel is designed to protect against a 100-year flood.
 
Division Among Residents
 Ms. Fillipone includes only residential structures that are not flood-proofed in her estimates, while the Army estimates also include commercial buildings.
Some residents of the basin, likeJimmy Sulejman, who lives with his wife and child on a street in Wayne that frequently floods, favor a buyout -- "as long as I can get what I paid for it," he said.
But many say they prefer the tunnel.
"The buyout plan is absurd," said Jim Wright, who lives in Lincoln Park, about 500 feet from the Passaic River. "How can you take a town and then just level 'X' number of homes and expect the rest of the town not to be affected?" Mr. Wright said, referring to the effect on the tax base that a large buyout would have.
Elected officials have had decidedly mixed reactions to the project.
In 1988, the corps proposed a shorter tunnel that would have ended in the Passaic River near Clifton. It won the approval of then-Gov. Thomas H. Kean, but it was scrapped following protests from area residents and officials who feared that the tunnel's discharge would create new flooding along the southern banks of the Passaic River.
 
Changes in Support
 In 1990 the corps offered the current plan, winning the support of Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who had opposed the initial proposal.
Meanwhile, the Passaic County Board of Freeholders, which had favored the plan, has recently withdrawn its support, citing water supply concerns raised by some environmentalists.
These critics fear that construction of the flood tunnel could have far-reaching effects on the state's water supply.
Mr. Isaac, for example, expressed concern that the tunnel would be so effective in keeping the Passaic River Basin flood-proofed that it would lower the water tables in the natural aquifer there and reduce the available drinking water.
Mr. Boc, however, said such worries were unfounded. "The intent of the project is to only skim those flows that exceed a 'one-year' flood event and to keep the river in its banks," he said.
As for the charges by some opponents that there would be flooding in the areas adjacent to Newark Bay where the tunnel will discharge, he said: "The water exiting the tunnel is a relatively small volume compared to the carrying capacity of Newark Bay. There will be very little effect. Less than three inches at low tide."

 Using laser beams, dynamite and a $15 million drill, the Army Corps of Engineers is prepared to dig a 20-mile tunnel beneath the heart of the most densely populated area of New Jersey.
"We'll be taking out about 10 million cubic yards of material," said Raymond Boc, deputy chief of the corps' Passaic River Division.
The Passaic River Flood Tunnel -- comparable in scope only to the "Chunnel" being constructed beneath the English Channel -- is expected to take about 2,000 laborers 10 years to complete. Mr. Boc described the process.
After digging and blasting a 450-foot-deep work shaft at a point in Kearny near where the tunnel would end, workers would lower a $15 million tunnel boring machine -- known as a mole in the tunnel trade -- piece by piece into the shaft. The machine would be assembled in a work space cut out at the bottom of the shaft.
From there, using a laser beam to keep it moving straight ahead, the mole would chew its way toward Wayne through layers of bedrock 200 million years old, leaving tons of granulated earth -- called muck -- in its wake. Railroad cars and conveyor belts would take the granulate back to the work shaft, where workers would raise it to the surface.
After the mole bored its 40-foot-diameter hole, workers would line the tunnel with concrete.
Except for activity at four other work shafts to be drilled at isolated locations along the tunnel route, work would be virtually unnoticeable on the surface, Mr. Boc said. The tunnel would reach depths of as much as 450 feet on its journey to Newark Bay.
At Newark Bay, workers would construct a cylindrical structure -- a cofferdam -- from the water's surface down to the floor of the bay. They would then excavate down through the floor of the bay, using dynamite and conventional digging machines.
"If your surveying is good," Mr. Boc said, "you meet the tunnel down there."

HEADLINE: Something to Celebrate At Fairleigh Dickinson

BYLINE: By PATRICIA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
TWO years ago few would have predicted that Fairleigh Dickinson University's 50th anniversary this year would have been anything to celebrate. The university was awash in debt, enrollment had fallen more than 40 percent from its high in 1980, the faculty and administration were at odds and morale at the school was low. But on Sept. 30, as a colorful academic procession of more than 300 slowly wended its way down the commencement green on the university's Teaneck campus to honor the installation of a new president and the official start of the golden anniversary, the institution's future seemed as bright and brisk as the day itself. The two years have brought profound change, in terms of financial stability and a renewed sense of vigor, to Fairleigh Dickinson -- the state's largest private university, with campuses in Rutherford, Teaneck-Hackensack and Madison-Florham Park. The feeling on campus and within New Jersey's higher education community is that the school has made a remarkable comeback.
"The university uses the term 'cautious optimism,' but we're probably even more optimistic," said Elizabeth Cayer, assistant director of the New Jersey Department of Higher Education's Office of Senior Institutions. "While we're cautious, we're saying, 'Heavens, it looks terrific.' " 
 This is not the first time the university's turnaround has been trumpeted. In the late 1980's, after a restructuring effort and a brief upturn in freshman enrollment, university officials were talking about a rebound. But continuing low faculty morale and an inability to control the school's mounting debt soon dashed any hope of real recovery.
The latest plan to revitalize the university appears to be having greater success. By consolidating programs, reducing expenditures and offering new programs that are bringing in additional revenue, Fairleigh Dickinson expects to have a balanced budget this year, its first in a decade. Enrollment is stabilizing, admissions standards have risen and school spirit is on the rise, as activities like faculty-student volley ball games, homecoming and pep rallies have taken on a new life. And, perhaps most significantly, the faculty is backing the reforms.
Dr. Francis J. Mertz, the university's president, said part of the university's problem has been that, as a comparatively young institution, founded in 1942, it could not count on history to see it through tough times when the twin forces of a declining college-aged population and emergence of a strong public college system began to rattle New Jersey independent colleges in the 1980's.
"We did not have a solid reputation, and our infrastructure was not solidly in place, so the first frost hurt us more than established institutions," said Dr. Mertz, who was named interim president in 1990 and was installed as the university's fifth president at the anniversary ceremony in September. "While we suffered ahead of the cycle, maybe now our road to recovery will be ahead of the cycle."
Another blow came when the state announced in 1989 that it was withdrawing its support from the university's dental school following a national decline in dental school enrollments. The lost aid compounded the university's already dire fiscal and morale problems. The dental school, was closed in 1990.
 
Loss in Students
 While many of New Jersey's 16 independent colleges and universities have experienced population declines, none has fallen as precipitously as Fairleigh Dickinson. Enrollment, which had held steady at around 20,000 students throughout the 70's, is now just 11,552 students, its lowest level since 1958.
When enrollment began to fall in the 80's admission standards were loosened in an unsuccessful effort to fill empty classrooms. By the middle of the decade, the university found itself saddled with mounting fiscal troubles and a physical plant that was too large for its needs, and by 1990 the university's operating deficit had reached $6.5 million and the cumulative deficit was $32 million.
The trustees gave Dr. Mertz two years to restore the university to fiscal stability. One of his first acts as president was to appoint a commission of all the university's constituencies to take a broad look at the institution to see how it could be salvaged. In one recommendation that is credited with giving the university much of its renewed sense of purpose, each of the university's three campuses, which had been a hodgepodge of classes and degree programs, was to develop of specific mission. The Rutherford campus now focuses on undergraduate and graduate business programs. At Teaneck, there are associate to doctoral degree programs in areas other than business. The Madison campus has extensive honors courses in every discipline.
The commission also recommended tightening admissions standards. Through increased recruiting efforts and what admissions officers call a "shift in perception" about the school's academic offerings, the university was able to maintain freshman enrollment this year while being more selective. S.A.T. scores for this year's 938 freshmen jumped 50 points over last year. Their average score of 950 for this year's 938 freshmen was also 59 points higher than the New Jersey average. The class includes 52 students who were in the top 15 percent of their high school classes.
 
A New Breed of Student
 Students themselves are aware of the new breed of student. "The freshmen are different," said Seth Weisleder, president of the student body on the Teaneck campus and a dormitory resident assistant. "They want to have fun, but they're also academics. They keep asking me to keep the noise down in the hallways, because they have to study. That's amazing, coming from a freshman."
Buildings and services have been upgraded to lure and retain students. On the Teaneck campus once-dingy dormitories have been renovated, and $160,000 was spent transforming a drab campus snack bar into a new student hangout.
Curriculum offerings have been more finely honed with an eye to what the job market needs. Several degree programs with low enrollments have been eliminated, and others, particularly in business, have been added. The university is also actively seeking accreditation from the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, a prestigious honor for business education that only Rutgers and Seton Hall have achieved in New Jersey.
Outside of class there is more interest in student activities.
"F.D.U. has had a problem for a long time with generating student involvement, largely because the apathy of upper classmen was quickly picked up," said Michelle Rochester, editor of the Madison campus' student newspaper. "But recently we've seen a lot more involvement from a lot more students."
 
A Time of Tension
 For years strained relations between the faculty and administration had added to the problems at Fairleigh Dickinson. A five-day faculty walkout at the start of the 1986-87 term over salary issues and the subsequent elimination of the faculty union as a bargaining agent were only the most visible signs of a tension that paralyzed many of the university's efforts to pull itself together.
While the university still lags behind others of its kind in what it pays teachers, it is trying to narrow the gap. Faculty received a 4 percent salary increase this year.
"That isn't tremendous, but given the economy and the state of things, it was a real commitment that necessitated our making other sacrifices," said Dr. Geoffrey Weinman, vice president for academic affairs.
The salary differential between Fairleigh Dickinson and other universities is largest on the upper end of the pay scale. A full professor at Fairleigh Dickinson last year made on average $49,800, nearly $8,000 less than professors at comparable institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region, according to statistics provided by Dr. Weinman.
Dr. Thomas Beam, president of the faculty senate and a professor of accounting, said the faculty were generally upbeat "in anticipation of better things to come."
"Morale is certainly improving," he said. "Frank Mertz listens better than anyone else I've ever seen. Sometimes the response is we can't do anything yet, but at least he responds."
 
80% From New Jersey
 Because more than 80 percent of the university's students come from New Jersey, it is often referred to as the most public of the state's independent institutions of higher learning. Two-thirds of its students attend school part time, an unusually high percentage for an independent college. Dr. Mertz said because of its distinctive demographics and its size, he has never really questioned the university's long-term viability.
"We were big enough so if we had to get smaller, then we could do it with small surgery as distinct from a hatchet," he said. "Pruning rather than cutting down a tree."
For nearly a decade before joining Fairleigh Dickinson, Dr. Mertz, 55 years old, held the dual presidencies of the Independent College Fund of New Jersey and the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in New Jersey. He said his worst moment as head of Fairleigh Dickinson came on Father's Day, six weeks into the job, when a newspaper ran an article about the possible closing of a campus to solve some of the university's fiscal problems, and he was besieged by telephone calls from alumni, students and faculty members.
"I started reading Truman, I started reading Churchill to get comfort," he said. "It was my darkest day, because I worried what others would say. But it also was a turning point, because the most difficult of options was now out there."
Dr. Mertz said closing a campus was no longer under consideration.
 
'The Pipeline Is Full'
 Edward Hennessy, chairman of the university's trustees for the last eight years and a former chairman of Allied Signal Inc., has mixed reviews for the pace of change at his alma mater.
"Being a businessman, you can make decisions a heck of a lot faster than in academia," said Mr. Hennessey, a 1955 graduate. "But if you look over the past few years, we've accomplished a lot. The pipeline is full, it's pulling together, and in another four years, we'll really have a first-class institution."
Mr. Hennessey credits much of the university's recent progress to Dr. Mertz's ability to bring together different factions of the university to focus on a common goal. While students and faculty members praise Dr. Mertz's accessibility, the president himself frets about the lack of opportunity to develop close personal relationships on a three-campus university.
"I'll never be a Mr. Chips," he said.

HEADLINE: Luckinbill, Portrayer of Giants, Takes One to the Courthouse

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
Laurence Luckinbill strode into the Westchester County Courthouse here, an artist for sure among the briefcases and the suits. His thinning mop of brown hair stuffed into a blue baseball cap, and wearing a beaten-up leather jacket and jeans, he grinned and apologized for being late.
Not the usual place for an interview, but fitting: the 57-year-old actor will play this house on Nov. 16 when he holds forth in the Ceremonial Courtroom as Clarence Darrow, the famed lawyer who is the only character in the play "Clarence Darrow" by David Rintels. The play will be performed here once only at 7:30 P.M. as a benefit for the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts. 
 There is nothing show biz about the craggy-faced actor, who is best known for his work in such plays as "The Boys in the Band" (he also appeared in the 1970 film version), "The Memory Bank" -- for which he won the New York Critics Circle Award -- and such films as "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier."
He drove to the courthouse from the northern Westchester residence that he shares with his wife, the actress Lucie Arnaz, and the couple's three children, ages 12, 10 and 8. They have lived in Westchester since 1983, are "gentleman and lady farmers" who eat "$300 salads" from a garden that cost $3,000 to put in shape, Mr. Luckinbill said, and lead hectic double lives as devoted suburban parents and busy actors. (Ms. Arnaz, the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, is currently creating the role on Broadway of Bella in Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers.")
He smiled, telling of the family's earthy country life, and offered the views of each child on Presidential politics. They have learned about the politics of theater and the theater of politics from their father, who is passionate about both subjects. "Politics is the only four-letter word with eight letters," said Mr. Luckinbill, who has been steeped enough in political affairs to know.
During the Kennedy Administration, he worked for the State Department in Italy and Africa as a director, writer and lecturer on theater. He also passed the Foreign Service examination and was offered a job with the United States Information Agency but ended his work in Government service when President Kennedy was assassinated.
"I didn't want to be part of a Johnson Administration," Mr. Luckinbill said. Years later, fate brought the actor and Lyndon Johnson together in spirit, when Mr. Luckinbill played the title role in "Lyndon," a one-character play by James Prideaux produced in 1987 as a PBS special.
The actor still tours with the play and notes the irony of portraying Johnson. "His fate is in my hands," he said, amused by the idea, but Johnson has earned his respect. "Lyndon himself is a great intellectual on the model of Sam Adams or Paul Bunyan," Mr. Luckinbill said. "He is a figure large on the landscape. But he didn't read books, he read bills."
Clarence Darrow, best known for defending a Tennessee high school science teacher, John T. Scopes, for teaching the theory of evolution, focuses the actor's attention on a different kind of brilliance. "He was a great man, with a passion for mercy," Mr. Luckinbill said of Darrow, who also defended the infamous murder team of Leopold and Loeb. "He believed mercy was the greatest human attribute. He centered himself in the logic of compassion."
Darrow, a fervent opponent of capital punishment and abortion, defended a total of 102 men on death row, none of whom was executed. "He said, 'Open the prisons, rehabilitate people, recognize that when you have unemployment, drugs and ghettos, you're going to have young men committing crimes,' " Mr. Luckinbill said. " 'It isn't fair to lock them up.' "
 
'You Don't Survive Without Laughing'
 Other moments dramatize the lawyer's fight for the eight-hour working day, a decent standard of living, his interest in peaceful integration and the right of citizens to criticize their government. Humor studs both "Lyndon" and "Clarence Darrow," which is one reason Mr. Luckinbill likes the plays so much.
"Everything I do has a lot of comedy involved," he said. "You don't survive in life without laughing." The Arkansas native recounted how he decided to major in drama after seeing his hopes of becoming a doctor dashed. He had finished three years as a premedical student at the University of Arkansas when he got a D-minus in organic chemistry; for the young man, this was as good as failing.
"The man who flunked me, a Dr. Royce, was a chemist who had been on the Nuremberg Trials Committee," Mr. Luckinbill said. "I told him, 'You're wrecking my life.' "
"I had been the class clown," the actor continued, and Dr. Royce said, " 'Mr. Luckinbill, you have amused us all year -- and well. You don't belong in medicine. You belong somewhere in the performing arts.' "
A battery of aptitude tests confirmed the chemist's insight, and after graduating as a drama major, Mr. Luckinbill went on to receive his master's degree in playwriting from the Catholic University of America in Washington. Writing still occupies much of his time; he is working on a musical play called "Desi!" based on the life of his father-in-law and intends to write a pilot for a series dramatizing American history.
 
Second Marriage for Both
 All of his and his wife's projects -- including a nearly completed program based on the home movies of Miss Ball and Mr. Arnaz -- are properties of the couple's company, Arluck Entertainment. Mr. Luckinbill met Ms. Arnaz when they were performing in two other plays on Broadway by Mr. Simon, he in "Chapter Two" and she in "They're Playing Our Song." "It was 'Chapter Two' of my own life," he said, recalling that their present marriage is a second one for them both, and yes, it was nearly love at first sight when a fellow actor introduced them at Joe Allen's Restaurant on West 46th Street in Manhattan.
He, possibly alone among all people "in the hemisphere," he said, had never seen an episode of "I Love Lucy" and had "no knowledge of or interest in her parents." Despite or because of this, the couple were married nine months later, in June 1980. They have since toured together as co-stars in such plays as "Who's Life Is It, Anyway?" "Educating Rita" and "I Do, I Do."
Life as a family man and the portrayer of social giants seems to have invigorated the actor. He even sounds ready to take on the undying, periodically revived campaign for a Westchester performing arts complex. What is needed, Mr. Luckinbill said, is a county-financed structure with five or six theaters in a central location. And, he said, "It should not be tangled up with the politics of an educational institution."
He said he and his wife had come to live in Westchester because "I found the brightest, most motivated and deeply talented people in the world here. But," he added, "I don't see any place in the county where they can express that close to home. New York City is like a black hole, drawing everything toward it."
 
A Backer of Arts Center
 He said he and Ms. Arnaz would love to run such a theater complex, and -- arts activists, take notice -- he would be willing to "lead a fight" to build one in the county.
In the meantime, he has thrown his support to the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts, a 14-year-old, nonprofit organization in Goldens Bridge with activities and classes in all the arts as well as programs in schools, summer camps and community centers.
Bira Rabushka, the organization's founder and director, said that Mr. Luckinbill had offered to waive his fee and perform "Clarence Darrow" as a fund-raising event and that the courthouse had seemed the ideal place to stage it. County administrators agreed to make the 285-seat Ceremonial Courtroom available, Ms. Rabushka added.
The evening, which features a dessert reception at which the audience can meet Mr. Luckinbill in the Mural Room, adjacent to the Ceremonial Courtroom, is co-sponsored by the Westchester Women's Bar Association, the Columbian Lawyer's Association of Westchester County, the Benjamin Cordozo Society and the Pace University School of Law. There are two ticket categories: $100 a person for patrons and $250 for sponsors. Sponsors are offered priority seating and their names will appear in the program. For reservations or more information, the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts can be reached at 232-5740.

HEADLINE: Can He Get This Thing to Run?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
On President-elect Bill Clinton's desk in the governor's mansion in Little Rock, Ark., are four thick briefing books. They run to hundreds of pages and lay out the pros and cons of the numerous decisions he must make. Probably nothing is more pressing in these pages than an issue not really dealt with in the campaign: Whether to attempt emergency measures to revive the economy and how to do so.
By all accounts, the new President has not decided whether to act precipitously. But if he does, the main tool widely favored within the Clinton camp is an investment tax credit for business -- reminiscent of what John F. Kennedy proposed when he took office in 1961, during a recession. The credit would return to businesses 10 percent of their investment in machinery beyond a certain level. The only other big measure under consideration to lift the economy quickly, the advisers say, is swift enactment of $20 billion in new spending next year on public-works projects. 
 Mr. Clinton has for months listed these two measures as part of his plan to rebuild the economy over the long run, but now his top advisers are pushing them forward as the new Administration's short-term weapons for ending an economic slowdown that has persisted through most of the Bush years.
If Congress quickly enacts the two measures, they undoubtedly would help the economy, many economists say. But they alone would probably not be enough to end the stagnation, the economists add. Investment tax credits, introduced by President Kennedy and used by most Republican and Democratic administrations ever since, failed to make a noticeable difference during the 1981-82 recession, and before that they were imposed only after the economy had begun to recover.
Furthermore, other factors enter into a company's spending plans. "The credit crunch, the general uncertainty, the low level of consumer confidence, these are all problems that could hold back the economy and discourage investment despite a tax credit," said Alan Auerbach, a University of Pennsylvania economist.
 
Betting in Billions
 As for the $20 billion in proposed new public works spending, it is a drop in the bucket for an economy that generates nearly $6 trillion a year in new wealth. A growing number of economists argue that at least $50 billion a year is needed to move the American economy, all of it through deficit spending so that other wealth is not canceled or diverted to pay for the public works.
"If the economy is as weak in January as it seems to be today, then $20 billion or $30 billion won't be enough," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel Laureate in Economics and a leader of the group lobbying Mr. Clinton for at least $50 billion in public works spending.
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton's "Putting People First" platform promised economic growth and job creation, but only over the long term and on a pay-as-you-go basis. Now the debate within the Clinton camp is whether the economy needs a quick fix, even one that might have to be paid for later. If Mr. Clinton decides it does and gambles, failure could be damaging. "I think Clinton is on the hook to deliver some help for the economy fast," said Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But if he acts and then fails to deliver enough stimulus, the public will not view that as very credible."
Mr. Clinton's decision must be made at an awkward moment in the economic cycle. Every so often, during the nearly four years of stagnation and recession, the national statistics measuring economic performance have turned up for a few months, briefly holding out hope that America was finally regaining its vigor. One such period came last spring, only to evaporate by late July. Another showed itself last month.
"The last thing anyone wants to do is stimulate an economy when the stimulus is no longer needed," said Bruce Reed, issues director in the Clinton camp. "But no one knows whether this incipient recovery is for real."
 
Investment Tax Credit
 Whatever the future holds, the investment tax credit is clearly emerging as the favorite revival tool among Mr. Clinton's advisers. That is partly because it enjoys wide support among American executives. And it is partly because Mr. Clinton's aides have found a way to argue, perhaps incorrectly, that the tax credit would pay for itself, thus not violating Mr. Clinton's pledge to keep the deficit from rising while he rebuilds the economy. "We are not going to have spending now and deficit reduction later," Mr. Reed said.
Gene Sperling, economic coordinator in the Clinton campaign, heartily endorsed Mr. Reed's comment. But he seemed to suggest that a temporarily larger deficit might be considered when he said that Mr. Clinton "has always stressed as a priority the $20 billion-a-year Rebuild America infrastructure program and the targeted investment tax credit."
Mr. Reed and Mr. Sperling have begun to circulate a study, commissioned over the summer by Mr. Clinton, that comes to optimistic conclusions: The Clinton investment tax credit would cost the Treasury $11 billion in the first two years. But growing tax revenues from an expanding economy would recover this amount. And the stimulus would create 500,000 jobs next year.
The study, done by Lawrence H. Meyer & Associates, a St. Louis research and consulting firm, was delivered by Mr. Meyer to Mr. Clinton on Oct. 11. But it is only now being made public by Mr. Clinton's aides. They cite the study in support of their argument that the Clinton investment tax credit would not raise the deficit.
An investment tax credit, in one form or another, was a fixture of every Administration from Mr. Kennedy's days until 1986, when it was eliminated by Congress and the Reagan Administration in favor of a lower corporate income tax. American companies have in the past purchased more machinery and equipment when tax credits existed. But never has a tax credit been shown to stimulate enough investment to revive an economy mired in hard times.
 
The Clinton Plan
 Mr. Clinton's tax credit, never tried, would reimburse a company for 10 percent of its outlays for machinery and equipment -- but would apply only to investments that exceeded some percentage, yet to be determined, of the outlay in a previous year, also to be determined.
The goal is to get companies to keep raising their capital spending. The rising demand for new machinery, in turn, would create jobs among machinery manufacturers. The new workers, spending their wages, would stimulate demand for and production of consumer goods. More new hiring would take place and the economic revival would be under way.
That is the theory. Mr. Clinton takes his approach, known as a marginal tax credit, from the late Walter Heller, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Kennedy. Mr. Heller had wanted Mr. Kennedy to adopt a tax credit that rewarded businesses for increasing capital outlays each year. But the credit finally passed by Congress in 1962 gave a straight 7 percent tax credit on all capital outlays.
"There were two reasons for rejecting the marginal tax credit, and they might come up now in the debate over Mr. Clinton's proposal," said the University of Pennsylvania's Mr. Auerbach. One was complexity -- which investments qualify for the credit and which don't. The other is fairness. In a declining industry, like autos, a company might invest every year, but not at increasing rates. In a growing industry, like biotechnology, a company would be more likely to benefit from a marginal tax credit.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said his group would welcome a 10 percent investment tax credit, but on all investment, not only the increased amount over a previous year. "The neat thing about an investment tax credit is that it stimulates the economy while the machinery purchased improves productivity," Mr. Jasinowski said. "But any immediate increase in the deficit should be in the context of a package that reduces the deficit in later years."
Many studies show that investment tax credits do stimulate capital spending. But whether they are powerful enough to lift an entire economy has never been proven conclusively. The Kennedy credit took effect in 1962 when a recovery was already under way. It was repealed in 1969, during the Nixon Administration, because the economy appeared to be growing too rapidly, and re-established in 1971, again when a brief recession was already ending.
The recession that began in 1974 prompted President Gerald Ford and Congress to raise the credit to 10 percent from 7 percent, but the new rate took effect in 1975, when the recession was ending. The 10 percent credit was still in effect during the 1981-82 recession and made little if any difference during the subsequent recovery. After the credit was ended in 1986, attempts during the Bush Administration to revive a version of it were included in bills Mr. Bush vetoed because they included tax increases.
Whatever the shortcomings of an investment tax credit, Mr. Meyer, president of the St. Louis firm commissioned by Mr. Clinton to evaluate his version, is bullish. He based his calculations on a tax credit that would apply to investments in machinery and equipment that exceeded 80 percent of a company's outlay in fiscal 1992, which ended Sept. 30.
The Treasury would lose $3.1 billion in the current fiscal year and $8.1 billion in fiscal 1994, his report said. But, urging that Mr. Clinton act quickly, even making the tax credit retroactive to Election Day, Mr. Meyer concluded: "Because of the powerful stimulus to aggregate demand and hence income and employment, the deficit would actually decline by $1 billion in fiscal 1993 and would be unchanged in 1994."
If private investment falls short of Mr. Meyer's optimism, then public investment, primarily for public works, might give the economy a lift. But it would have to be sufficiently large and involve deficit spending to have an impact, in the view of most economists. The stimulus from public spending in a weak economy is thought to be lost if it is immediately offset by spending cuts that eliminate jobs in other areas or tax increases that remove money from households.
What is required to keep the deficit from getting out of hand are "sunset provisions" that would end the spending once the economy begins to recover and also raise new revenue to pay off the debt, said Mr. Giordano of Goldman, Sachs.
Mr. Clinton's public-works plan so far does not meet two standards set by the economists: its size and its financing through deficit spending. His proposed $20 billion annual outlay -- instead of the $50 billion proposed by Mr. Solow -- is geared to creating jobs over the four years of his Administration, not immediately, and always on a pay-as-you-go basis, with much of the new revenue coming from a tax increase for the wealthy and for foreign corporations in the United States.
What's more, there is great uncertainty among economists concerning which public investments give the best payoff. Should Federal spending be channeled to highways, to construction of inter-city bullet trains or to an overhaul of the nation's rail system? Everyone knows that shirt makers need a way to get their goods to market. But is a highway more efficient than a better rail system?
But the Clinton camp has overcome one major obstacle. In the past, the great objection to public works spending as an economic stimulus has been the time it takes to plan a project, put out bids, sign contracts, hire workers and get started.
 
The Mayors' List
 The United States Conference of Mayors provided the solution last winter. Its survey of 506 cities produced 7,252 projects all planned, contracted and ready to go, but shelved for lack of municipal funds to pay for them. Their total cost would be $26 billion over several years.
"But realistically, you could spend $12 billion to get them started and generate 418,000 jobs in a single year," said J. Thomas Cochran, executive director of the mayors' group. The list includes projects like a $3.5 million bridge-repair program for Manhattan, employing 200 people.
With the mayors' list in mind, two Democratic Senators, Paul D. Sarbanes of Maryland and Jim Sasser of Tennessee, introduced this year a bill that would have granted $20 billion in Federal funds to help pay for the projects. But the bill failed to include a means of repayment, and under the 1990 budget enforcement act, intended to reduce the deficit, there was no spare money available.
Only if Congress and President Bush had declared an emergency could $20 billion have been appropriated, through deficit spending, without violating the budget act. Neither was willing to do this, so the bill died.
Mr. Clinton faces the same ceilings during the current budget year, which ends next Oct. 1. And that is prompting some of his supporters to suggest that the new President amend or scrap the enforcement act. "I see no reason to be wedded to the budget deal," said Lawrence Mishel, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research group that backed Mr. Clinton.
If the hard times persist, then Mr. Clinton's emergency measures, even if they are financed with deficit spending, might become more acceptable to the public, particularly on Wall Street. When the deficit rises or seems about to do so, bond traders in particular become fearful of inflation and drive up interest rates.
Higher interest rates spreading to mortgages, car loans and corporate borrowing to buy new equipment, would make a weak economy even weaker. But in the face of persistent stagnation, a growing number of Wall Street economists and traders have said in recent weeks that modest deficit spending to revive the economy could now take place without the reaction of higher interest rates.
Henry Kaufman, the consultant and money manager who for years personified the bond market as chief economist at Salomon Brothers, put it this way: "A fiscal stimulus of $20 billion to $30 billion over the next 12 months, financed through deficit spending, is something that is now acceptable to the market."
 
 
 
WHAT HOPE FOR A HAPPIER CONSUMER?
 BILL CLINTON is taking over at a delicate moment for the American economy. Since early 1989, the gross domestic product, measuring all the wealth created in the nation, has barely grown, and for nine months starting in July 1990, the nation was in recession, with the G.D.P. actually shrinking. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs as companies cut back to adjust to the hard times and the huge weapons industry shrinks in the aftermath of the cold war.
Through much of the campaign, Mr. Clinton's aides expressed the hope that while the weak economy would defeat President Bush, a post-election upturn would ease public pressure on the new Administration for emergency action. And some recent indicators, such as a spurt in the G.D.P. in the third quarter and a rise in housing starts and in industrial production, encourage this hope.
One major item that has not turned up in recent months is consumer confidence, a key measure of whether Americans feel secure enough to raise spending. Mr. Clinton's advisers argued before the election that a Clinton victory would revive consumer confidence. "A new President with a long-term economic agenda should have a very positive stimulative effect on the economy," said Gene Sperling, economic coordinator in the Clinton campaign, in late October.
But Fabian Linden, who directs the monthly survey of consumer sentiment published by the Conference Board, a business research organization, disagrees. He argues that politics is too far removed from daily life to affect consumer attitudes.
"You go back to Ronald Reagan replacing Jimmy Carter, and there was no improvement in consumer confidence in the first four or five months," Mr. Linden said. "Ordinary citizens respond to their everyday lives in the economy and not to a new President. We have tracked this through five Presidential elections, the last five, and there was no discernible immediate improvement in consumer spirits."

HEADLINE: All About/Heating Systems;
The Cost and Cleanliness Equation

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI

 BODY:
SQUIRRELS gathering nuts and birds winging their way south may be strong indications that winter is approaching, but rising heating bills are an even surer sign in most parts of the country.
Overall, growth in the residential heating system-supply market has slowed along with the hard-hit construction market. But while sales of oil and electric furnaces have fallen in the last three years, sales of gas furnaces are edging back up. 
 Furnaces that burn natural gas to produce hot air are far and away the nation's largest source of residential heating. Industry experts say that the current sales rebound is partly because natural gas utilities have become more aggressive in extending their pipelines -- and marketing muscle -- into the Northeast, where oil heat still predominates.
In any case, 2.1 million gas furnaces are expected to be shipped nationally this year, up from 2.06 million last year and 1.95 million in 1990, said Johnny Johnson, director of residential heating products at the Carrier Corporation's Indianapolis office. Carrier, a unit of United Technologies of Hartford, is one of the nation's largest sellers of heating and air-conditioning systems.
This year, new sales of all furnaces have been aided a bit by a new Federal law that requires builders to install more fuel-efficient furnaces in new homes and apartments.
"The heating industry is moving in the direction of making products as small as we can make them and more efficient to lower monthly operating costs," Mr. Johnson said. "Most importantly we're trying to make products more environmentally correct."
 
Aging Systems
Choosing a Fuel And Delivery Mode
 Home heating systems start with a fuel source, usually gas, electric or oil. The fuel then heats either a hot-air furnace, or a hot-water boiler. Depending on the system, hot air flows through ducts, or hot water or steam flows through pipes and radiators.
Electric baseboard heating systems, with no furnace or boiler, work more like a toaster oven, by heating coils embedded along the bottoms of walls.
Despite the poor economy, companies like Carrier; York International, in York, Pa., and the Burnham Corporation, in Lancaster, Pa., have not suffered as much as they might have, heating experts say. All are among the biggest sellers of furnaces or boilers.
Sales have been helped by homeowners and landlords replacing aging heating systems with more energy-efficient ones. Also, many consumers, staying put during the recession, have been upgrading their systems as part of upgrading their homes.
For some affluent people who are building new homes, the heating system of choice is hydronic radiant floor heating, in which hot water is circulated through a maze of polyethylene pipes beneath floors.
Because of the work involved in snaking coils of flexible pipe throughout a house, a radiant system is very expensive to install. But it is inexpensive to run, because it operates at much lower water temperatures than other systems.
Only about 7 percent of new homes in the United States have the system, but the market for radiant heat has grown nearly 30 percent yearly over the last six years.
Hot-air systems and electric baseboard heating are the cheapest for builders to install, and so continue to be standard in many new homes and condominiums. But monthly fuel charges and maintenance costs are often high.
"The builders don't really care about the monthly cost," said John Kaussner, president of the Hydronics Institute, in Berkeley Heights, N.J., a manufacturers' trade association. "They're interested in building homes and selling them quickly for a profit."
Decades ago, electric heat was cheap. But as the cost has risen, electric systems have become prohibitively expensive, especially in the colder climates.
Heat pumps are largely used in the South. Essentially, they are central air-conditioners with a reversing valve that can provide a limited amount of heat from the outside air in mild winters.
York International says sales of residential heat pumps are expected to fall to 550,000 units this year, from 558,000 units in 1991.
Forced hot-air systems use the same ducts as the central air-conditioning. But the heating system tends to leave cold spots in rooms and circulates dust throughout the house.
 
The Changing Law
More Efficiency Is Now Mandated
 A big reason that gas furnace sales have risen and that others have fallen only moderately is the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, which took effect on Jan. 1.
The law, which also applies to air-conditioners, heat pumps and other appliances, mandates that furnaces bought after that date have an annual fuel utilization efficiency of at least 78 percent. Older furnaces often operate at 50 percent or less efficiency, experts say, meaning that half the oil or gas they burn does not directly heat the house.
The more efficient furnaces can cost $1,000 to $3,000, depending on size.
"Many people are refinancing and upgrading their houses, especially to make their houses more fuel efficient so that their monthly payments will be down," said Mr. Johnson of Carrier.
Boilers can last 20 or 30 years, compared with 15 years or so for furnaces. Executives at Burnham, a leading boiler maker, said that industrywide boiler sales this year should be 325,000 units (62 percent gas and 38 percent oil). That would be up from 296,000 last year (60 percent gas and 40 percent oil).
Robert L. Coons, vice president for marketing at Burnham, said 80 percent of boiler sales were to replace existing units at a cost of about $3,200 for a 4,000-square-foot home.
"One of the trends that is helping the boiler market grow is radiant heat," he added, because of switching from furnaces or electric heat to boiler-powered radiant systems.
 
Radiant Heat
Installation Versus Monthly Expenses
 Randy Woodworth, an independent contractor and plumber in Hunter, N.Y., has just built a 4,000-square-foot house in the mountains around a hydronic radiant floor heating system. He designed the system with engineers from Wirsbo, a supplier of radiant floor heating systems based in Apple Valley, Minn. Wirsbo's parent company, the Uponor Group, is based in Espoo, Finland, near Helsinki.
He said that the radiant system for the three-bedroom house cost about $16,000 to $19,000 to install. But the heating bill is about $80 a month. That compares with $600 to $800 a month in the winter for electric systems, and $400 a month for a conventional oil-fired hot-air or hot water system.
Besides the initial cost, radiant systems have another potentially big drawback. Improperly installed, the pipes can crack or leak underneath the floor, turning into a homeowner's nightmare.
Joel Hollenberg, a professor of mechanical engineering at Cooper Union in Manhattan, says neither gas nor oil will be the choice of the next generation. He thinks it will be hydrogen. "Hydrogen can be burned with no pollution and I see this as the fuel of the future," he said.
 
DAVIDS, LOSING TO GAS GOLIATHS
 Nearly everywhere in the United States, except in parts of the Northeast where gas pipelines are not yet common, natural gas is the fuel of choice for home heating systems.
And even in the Northeast, gas companies have made inroads by marketing their product as a steady provider of clean, even heat. They also assert that oil is dirty and unhealthy to live with.
 For their part, oil suppliers strongly hint that gas can blow up your house. At least that is part of their counter-advertising. They assert that you don't save money by switching to gas. And they make much of the fact that to get service for gas systems, homeowners have to make a dreaded call: to a plumber.
Gas companies are public utilities with multimillion-dollar budgets. Heating oil companies, by contrast, are mostly small, independently owned businesses.
"It's an impossible battle to compete with gas companies," said Cliff Sullivan, owner of the Sullivan Fuel Company in Salem, N.H., which pumps about 1.5 million gallons of fuel oil a year, for which it currently charges 82.9 cents a gallon. "Every time you look there's another gas advertisement."
His company, which has been in the Sullivan family for three generations, has seen sales decline since the recent installation of natural gas lines in the area.
"Gas is becoming more popular because people perceive it as a better way," said Mr. Sullivan. Despite gas-company ads that depict oil as a dirty fuel, he insisted that oil was no worse for the environment than gas.
To combat gas utilities' marketing campaigns, independent oil companies have joined forces in groups like the New York-area Metropolitan Energy Council, to pool money to pay for better advertising.
A main point of the gas industry ads is that natural gas is cheap, plentiful and not subject to Middle East wars or politics. But people who follow oil prices say they can be slightly cheaper than gas.
"The price of oil is staying about where it is," said Paul Geiger, editor of Fueloil and Oil Heat, in Fairfield, N.J., a trade magazine.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Interest Rates: This Year's Big Speculation

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Rarely have so many bet so much, and with so much borrowed money, as is now being bet on one simple proposition: Short-term interest rates will not rise, or at least will not rise very much.
The public now believes it, but it is not individuals who are doing the bulk of the speculating. The big bettors are institutional investors, banks and brokerage houses. Those who made the bets a couple of years ago have cleaned up, a fact that has enticed many others to follow. 
 But what will happen if they are wrong, if rates move up significantly? The answer could be a financial debacle. If it happens, it will probably be interpreted as a Wall Street reaction to the Clinton Administration. In fact, it will be the result of excessive speculation by bettors in search of a sure thing.
The game now is simple, at least for big investors. With no money down, you borrow at short-term rates, maybe 3 percent or so, and use the money to buy longer-term securities, paying 5 percent or more. The difference is profit.
The brokerage industry, as George Monahan of the Securities Industry Association noted the other day, now has three times the bond inventory it had five years ago. Banks now have more Treasury and Government agency securities than they have business loans outstanding. Hedge funds -- the investment vehicles that try to make big killings quickly -- are said to own upward of $100 billion in Treasuries. Much of that is financed with short-term loans.
The risk, obviously, is that short-term rates will move up, wiping out the profits. Those on Wall Street, you will be happy to know, have an answer for that. We won't get into all the details here, but the idea is that they will sell futures contracts, thereby being able to profit from rising short-term rates and offsetting their losses from the original bond investment. Alternatively, they could dump the longer-term bonds. Both strategies assume willing buyers will be easily found, which might happen only after prices had fallen a long way.
"There are a huge number of people on one side of the boat," commented Gordon Ringeon, a hedge fund manager in San Francisco who is not playing the game. "If they all decide to switch to the other side of the boat, it could get interesting." At worst, it might even bring back memories of 1987, when institutions believed they could protect profits in stocks by selling stock index futures after prices began to fall. That delusion -- called portfolio insurance -- was the major reason the crash was so devastating.
Treasury bill rates have been rising for more than a month, although not yet by enough to do much damage. The consensus is that rates will fall again, but Bill Clinton has yet to unveil his plan to get the economy moving.
History shows that governments are not always determined to lower interest rates, and this year's election shows that low rates do not guarantee popularity. It is puzzling why Wall Street seems to be so sure that they will endure.

THE ECONOMY
 
Some Well-Placed Loopholes in the Looming Trade War 

At first blush, it seemed as if the United States and the European Community might be headed for a trade war. After years of talks under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, negotiations broke down last week over European agricultural subsidies. France, with elections looming, has refused to take anything away from its politically potent farmers. To show the Bush Administration's displeasure, the U.S. Trade Representative, Carla A. Hills, imposed a 200 percent tax on European white wine, cooking oil and pet food ingredients. The Europeans complained. The tax "constitutes an illegal position according to GATT's rules," said Frans Andriessen, the Community's External Relations Commissioner. But Mrs. Hills's tax contained several outs. It does not go into effect until Dec. 5, allowing the Community to formulate a new position. And it applies to goods worth $300 million -- not much by global standards.
 
Bush Veto No. 37
 
He may have lost the election, but President Bush still wields a mean veto. Last week he used it -- veto No. 37 -- to kill a $27 billion urban aid and tax bill. Mr. Bush objected to the measure because it made permanent certain tax increases. It would have required corporations to pay more of their taxes in advance and it limited deductions for individual moving expenses to $10,000. But the provision also contained elements from Mr. Bush's own economic agenda: incentives for setting up enterprise zones, expanded tax breaks for individual retirement accounts and renewed tax breaks for research. Those items were not enough to get Mr. Bush to unlock his jaw. "The original focus of the bill -- to help revitalize America's inner cities -- has been lost in a blizzard of special interest pleadings," the President said.

Uptick in Manufacturing
 
After sputtering along for months, the nation's manufacturing economy finally gained a little ground last month -- but the key word is little. The National Association of Purchasing Management's index rose to 50.6 percent in October from 49 percent the month before. The index, which tracks purchases at about 300 industrial companies, signals expansion when it rises above 50 percent and contraction when it falls below that mark. The rise may be encouraging, but the index "will have to advance to higher levels for the economy to improve at a more vigorous pace," said Robert Bretz, chairman of the survey committee.

Forecast Is Stagnation
 
The economy may be squeeking along now, but watch out after Inauguration Day. The Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators -- meant to forecast economic activity three to nine months hence -- fell 0.3 percent in September, the third decline in the last four months. Of the 11 indicators that comprise the index, six posted declines. Among them were raw materials prices, the length of the work week and the number of unfilled orders for manufactured goods. "I think we're in a prolonged stagnation," said Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser at DRI-McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., economic forecasting firm.

The long-dormant construction sector is advancing -- tentatively. According to the Commerce Department, spending on new construction rose by 1.3 percent in September.

A Glow on Retailing
 
For the nation's retailers -- a little relief. An index of sales at 50 chain stores compiled by Prudential Securities registered sales gains of 6.5 percent last month, compared with a rise of 5.9 percent during September. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's No. 1 retailer, posted a hefty 16 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. The Kmart Corporation, the No. 2 retailer, said its overall business was up 11.1 percent. "Overall, the tone of the business has been pretty good," said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at the First Manhattan Company, an investment bank. "I think it will be a decent Christmas."

Nothing Cheery on the Job Front
 
For the fourth time in three months, the nation's unemployment rate fell -- but not for the right reasons. According to the Labor Department, 7.4 percent of the work force was unemployed in October, down from 7.5 percent the month before. But economists say only 27,000 new jobs were created -- not enough to bring unemployment down. So what was the reason for the decrease? The size of the work force -- those employed as well as those looking for work -- contracted by 314,000. With fewer people looking for work, the unemployment rate goes down. "We still haven't had enough growth to create many new jobs," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities Inc.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Lufthansa Bows Out
 
Continental Airlines -- about to emerge from bankruptcy protection -- has been the object of a lot of other airlines' affections. But last week, one of Continental's suitors, Lufthansa German Airlines, said it would have to extricate itself from the competition. Though Lufthansa's management wanted to team up with Continental to feed more passengers into its global system, the German airline's board said no. Lufthansa, which lost $449.9 million in the first half of the year and has laid off workers, was in no financial condition to go ahead with its $100 million investment in Continental and its plan to buy an additional $300 million of Continental's bonds, its supervisory board said. That leaves two bidders for Continental: Charles Hurwitz, the Houston financier, in combination with Aeromexico, and Air Canada, in combination with two Texas financiers. The bankruptcy court will decide who gets Continental in the next few weeks.
 
The Gloom Rating in Germany
 
Polls from the Conference Board may say Americans are gloomy about the future, but it's worse elsewhere. According to a survey of 25,000 German executives by the German Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the mood there has also turned positively morose. Because of pessimism about the economy, one-third of the respondents said their companies would be cutting their work forces next year and 34 percent said they plan to invest less next year. It all means "a recession cannot be ruled out any longer," said Franz Schoser, the federation's executive director. "Confidence in government and politics to solve problems is waning fast."

Breaking the Vietnam Barrier
 
Last week, despite an American-led economic embargo, Japan resumed giving economic aid to Vietnam. Japan said it would provide loans of up to $370 million, which could be used to purchase commodities and Japanese products. With its well-educated, low-wage work force, its deposits of raw materials and its nearby location, Vietnam is an attractive place for Japan to invest. But what about the embargo? "We have our policy and the United States has its policy," said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Masamichi Hanabusa.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Big Bite for A.T.& T.
 
When A.T.& T. was broken up in 1984, no one ever suspected it might someday challenge the Baby Bells -- the regional phone companies like Nynex that emerged from it. But if A.T.& T. takes a $3.8 billion stake in McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the nation's No. 1 cellular phone company, as it is negotiating to do, it would become one of the largest players in the local markets where the Baby Bells do business. Having A.T.& T. own a third of McCaw would add a lot of muscle to the cellular company, which has two million subscribers. It would enable McCaw to sell its wireless services through A.T.& T.'s 400 retail stores and to its tens of millions of customers and it would give McCaw's wireless customers direct access to A.T.& T.'s long distance system -- advantages its competition doesn't have. The deal will "lift McCaw one level above the rest of the industry," said Robert B. Morris of Goldman Sachs & Company.
 
$39 Million for the Songs
 
Rocker Elton John made a name for himself writing sensitive songs and performing them in sequined get-ups and platform shoes. The public ate it up. Last week, the megahit-maker and his longtime lyricist, Bernie Taupin, made a monster deal with Warner/Chappell Music, a unit of Time Warner Inc., to sell the publishing rights to their catalogue of songs for a cash advance of $39 million against royalties. Mr. John and Mr. Taupin will continue to own the tunes, but Warner/Chappell will collect 15 to 20 percent of sales over the next 12 years.

Acustar Plastics on the Block
 
It may have lots of snazzy new models hitting the showroom floors amid fistfuls of rave reviews, but the Chrysler Corporation still lacks cash. And so Chrysler said last week it would sell the plastics-making operations of its Acustar parts subsidiary. The money would be used to pay back debt in the hopes of raising Chrysler's credit rating, which is in the "speculative" -- a k a junk -- category. Chrysler tried to sell all of Acustar in 1988 but the plan was scotched by the unions. The division does $200 million of business a year.

The Jaffe-Lansing Show
 
As an independent production team, Stanley R. Jaffe and Sherry Lansing had their share of hits -- "Fatal Attraction," and "Black Rain" both with Michael Douglas. But two years ago, the team broke up when Mr. Jaffe became president of Paramount Communications Inc. Last week the team was reunited when Ms. Lansing, who was once president of 20th Century Fox, signed on as head of Paramount's motion picture group; she will report to Mr. Jaffe. Ms. Lansing replaces Brandon Tartikoff, the TV-programming whiz, who resigned unexpectedly from Paramount to spend more time with his family. "I have been offered this type of position several times, but I always said no," Ms. Lansing said. Why did she change her mind? The first reason, she said, "is Stanley. We were partners for 10 years. I missed that partnership."

Piling On the Dismal at Travelers
 
It was already undergoing a restructuring, but last week, when it released its third-quarter results -- it lost $358 million -- the Travelers Corporation said it would restructure even more. Instead of eliminating 3,500 jobs over the next two years, Travelers will cut 5,000. Its restructuring plan includes selling a 27 percent stake in the company to the Primerica Corporation. What would have been only a poor showing was made dismal by $240 million in losses resulting from Hurricane Andrew. Traveler's had a profit of $65 million in the same quarter last year.

China's Steel Bargain
 
Exports have been the engine of growth for the economy. But plant by plant? Last week, California Steel Industries agreed to sell China's Capital Iron and Steel Corporation part of a steel finishing plant in Fontana, Calif. California Steel bought the plant from bankrupt Kaiser Steel. The plant was built in 1978 for $287 million and closed in 1982. China got itself a bargain. Kaiser had originally wanted $60 million. Last week's sale price was $20 million. Capital Iron will send 300 workers from Beijing to disassemble the 10-acre plant, label it and put it on the boat.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Toward the Factory on a Hill

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
SOME guys just get lucky. On Tuesday, the candidate who inhales policy thrillers between campaign speeches prevailed over the candidate who might rather have been reading "A River Runs Through It." Otherwise, "Negotiating the Future: A Labor Perspective on American Business" (Basic Books) could have been consigned to the testy oblivion of academic conferences, and Irving and Barry Bluestone, the pere et fils team that wrote the book, could have been just a kinship curiosity.
But now all the might-have-beens are history. "Negotiating the Future" was published last week with an ecumenical list of blurbs, including one from "Bill Clinton, Governor of Arkansas." "We wouldn't mind if the publisher changed his title," Irving Bluestone said. 
 The book calls for a rehabilitation of the traditional adversary relationship between labor and management into a civil, cooperative new industrial order dedicated to restoring American competitiveness. It is a message that will find a warmer audience in Mr. Clinton's Washington than in a Bush Administration that did not so much bother to oppose labor as simply to render it invisible.
And it may be a message that business -- especially at companies tired of the wars of attrition that some disputes with labor have become -- will be relieved to hear. Last week, General Motors indicated it was ready to try to find common ground with union leaders as it begins what it hopes will be a march back to viability. Managers will find familiar the book's emphasis on worker empowerment and involvement, even if they pause to gulp over the utopian "enterprise compact" that would replace the typical contracts now governing industrial relations.
"Negotiating the Future" is, first of all, a primer on workplace issues in the extraordinary post-World War II economy. Labor and capital's "glory days" began in the consumer abstinence of the war. After, a convergence of pent-up demand, rising income and full employment created almost unprecedented abundance. With war-damaged foreign competition turned inward to rebuild, the United States was able to assert economic dominance internationally.
THE dream lasted a quarter of a century and ended prosaically, in congestion at the gas pumps during the oil crisis of the early 70's. For the 20 years since, the high amperage of the 80's notwithstanding, the long-term American economy has looked ever more vulnerable and volatile.
The decline of the unionized work force may account for the slighting of labor-management relations in prescriptions for the country's economic troubles. The Bluestones emphasize the dignity and importance of worker-employees. They do not however argue for enlightened self-interest, but in favor of the mutual interests -- "co-responsibility" -- of workers and employers in making a high-quality, competitively priced product.
Their vision is considerably more expansive than the total-quality worker empowerment-employee involvement programs now so fashionable. "We are talking about strategic decision-making at very high levels," Barry Bluestone said. G.M.'s Saturn plant uses aspects of this approach.
The "enterprise compact" is modeled on the Mayflower Compact, a self-conscious break with the past to establish a utopian community, and it may be too much of an errand into the wilderness for some executives. The compact would give workers more than a hand in all kinds of decisions -- pricing, productivity goals, strategic decisions -- that management now reserves to itself, as well as a voice in more traditional labor issues like seniority, layoffs and compensation. "Quality of the product," the book says, "will be a strikeable issue."
Though much of what the Bluestones argue for would happen in the workplace, Government should have a role. They propose labor law reform and re-establishment of programs in the Labor Department gutted during the Reagan-Bush years. Would Barry Bluestone like to run Labor? Hmm. "Ray Marshall is a possibility," he said, referring to President Carter's Labor Secretary. "I'm looking on with a great deal of interest."
 
 
 
THE ACADEMIC AND THE UNION GUY
 SOME families came apart much as the nation did during the 1960's. But when Barry Bluestone decided to go South to join the struggle for civil rights, his parents gave him their car. "In terms of basic social issues, we've always seen eye to eye," said Irving Bluestone.
It is not surprising, then, that both men say differences that arose during their collaboration on "Negotiating the Future" were more of nuance than substance. Barry, 47, a political economist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, contributed his academic perspective; Irving, 75, a retired vice president of the United Automobile Workers union who now teaches industrial relations at Wayne State University, brought his practical experience. "My father will stress the importance of dignity," Barry Bluestone said. "Dignity is critical, but you can't eat it."
General Motors, a company that has featured large in the Bluestones' lives, could take a lesson from their book. "They could take a crack at an enterprise compact right now, to see if they can forestall cuts, build product and rebuild market share," said Barry Bluestone. Both Bluestones hope G.M. resists pressure from Wall Street to, in Irving Bluestone's words, "sack and use the axe." "That would be a terrible mistake," he said. "It's tough as hell to get decent quality out of workers you're killing off one by one."

HEADLINE: The Growing Battle of the Big Bookstores

BYLINE: By DAVID BERREBY; David Berreby writes on business topics from New York.

 BODY:
Last Aug. 3 was a banner day for Barnes & Noble Inc., the nation's second-largest bookseller. That was the day the company opened five "superstores" -- each stocked with 100,000 books -- in Houston, Chicago, Grosse Pointe, Mich., Orange, Conn., and Auburn, Mass.
Yet Aug. 3 was just a drop in the bucket of the grand plan hatched by Leonard Riggio, the man who controls Barnes & Noble. On Oct. 18, he opened three more giant outlets -- in the Cleveland suburbs of Shaker Heights and Mayfield Heights, and in Jenkintown, Pa. With 105 superstores opened in the last three years, including 30 in the New York area, Mr. Riggio plans to add 28 more by Jan. 1. By the end of next year, he hopes to have about 250. 
 He isn't alone. The Kmart Corporation's Waldenbooks chain, the nation's biggest, began building superstores this year, opening three under the Basset name. Then, last month, Kmart acquired Borders Inc., a widely admired chain of 19 superstores based in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Though the details of the relationship between Waldenbooks and Borders are still being worked out, the two chains will be opening as many as 60 superstores between them by the end of 1993, said Charles R. Cumello, Waldenbooks' president.
Meanwhile, smaller chains, including Crown Books and Books-a-Million, are also active in the superstore marketing niche.
"Retail is very Darwinian," Mr. Riggio said. "The bookseller species is continuing to evolve and change, and this is the next step toward bigger, stronger, faster."
In short, the battle of the big bookstores has been joined in earnest. The stores -- which stock from 50,000 to 100,000 titles, as much as 10 times more than some mall bookstores -- have been popping up here and there for several years. Now, they promise to appear almost as fast as Stephen King turns out bestsellers. If projections play out, the country's current stock of 175 or so chain-run super bookstores could grow to more than 425 by the end of next year.
"You've got to be a dominant category killer in this area," said Mr. Cumello, who cheerfully conceded that much of what went into his chain's three Basset shops was a frank imitation of the Borders stores, which are much praised by booksellers for their combination of efficient marketing and bookish ambiance.
"Mall stores are just not as profitable as they were," adds Robert M. Haft, the founder and president of Crown Books, a discount chain with some 200 outlets in Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Mr. Haft has 20 "Super Crown" stores and plans to open 20 more by the end of 1993.
Still, a number of other retailers have their doubts that American readers need or can make use of such a vast increase in available books.
"There's a lot of skepticism," said Jack Lamplough, marketing director of the book division of Tower Records, the 76-store record chain. Though Tower has opened 15 super bookstores, each affiliated with one of its music stores, it does not see a huge new market for large bookstores and has no immediate plans to open more. "We just don't see the numbers," said Mr. Lamplough.
But superstore boosters say there's plenty of room for growth. According to the American Booksellers Association, book sales in 1991 came to some $7.9 billion, 8.4 percent above the 1990 level, despite, as Mr. Riggio likes to point out, both a recession and a war.
"We think superstores will become the dominant channel of book distribution within five years," said Lois Connelly, assistant director of investor relations at Kmart.
 WHAT the consumer can expect from the superstore wave is in ample evidence at Barnes & Nobles's shiny new outlet in Manhattan on Lexington Avenue near 86th Street. The 8,000-square-foot store features carpeting, soft music and dark wood. Poster-size signs proclaim store policy: A 30 percent discount on best-sellers, 20 percent off books recommended by the staff and 10 percent off everything else.
One recent Saturday, the author of a book on cat horoscopes sat at a table, promoting her work by offering readings "for all your cat's nine lives." No cats were in evidence but, Mr. Riggio indicates, they'd have been welcome. "The store is a public space," he said. "I'd like to put up a sign -- 'Pets, food, people welcome.' "
The superstore rivals differ in the details, but they agree that the book version of the category-killer store has to offer superb service and a welcoming atmosphere.
"The strength of a bookstore is the people managing it," said Mr. Haft of Crown, a unit of the Dart Group.
Each Super Crown store has a children's play area and future stores may also have cafes. A cafe to encourage people to browse and linger is already a fixture at Borders Bookshops and at Basset.
In fact, while amenities differ slightly from superstore to superstore, the book chains' plans are remarkably similar: All stress giving managers autonomy to make their store fit its area by stocking local authors and sponsoring readings and activities for children.
To a large degree, all are following lessons learned from the independent operators, which still account for 60 percent of the nation's 4,500 bookstore companies. The stores run by independents have gotten larger and more comfortable over the past 15 years -- some are even superstores -- as a way of distinguishing themselves from the mall outlets opened by the chains in the 70's.
 THAT'S an irony that distresses Bill Kurland. Mr. Kurland and his partners, who own Shakespeare & Company, which runs two bookstores in Manhattan, were not happy to learn that Barnes & Noble is planning two superstores on the Upper West Side, not far from their shop on Broadway near 83d Street.
"Independent bookstores spend years developing a market," he said. "Then a chain sweeps in and says there's room for two more giant bookstores. I don't think there is. I think this is predatory, frankly."
Mr. Kurland fears the book superstore will do to the independent sellers what Wal-Mart did to the general store or what Kmart's Home Depot is doing to hardware stores.
"In the short run, it appears better for the consumer," he conceded. "There are more stores, everybody's on his toes about service. But in the long run, when the little guy is knocked out, the consumer is not served. Because a locally owned store can serve the community better than some absentee company."
 MR. RIGGIO dislikes being portrayed as the heavy. In his own eyes, he represents the forces of good, up against a Kmart army of number-crunchers just as happy to sell widgets as Wittgenstein. "Ours is a bookseller's culture," he said. "We are not an appendage of some larger empire." His company has about 900 stores, including the B. Dalton chain, Bookstop, Doubleday and Scribners. Waldenbooks has about 1,400, including Brentano's and Basset.
In any event, Mr. Riggio argues, "The more bookstores you open, the larger the market's going to be." In fact, he said, some 60 percent of superstore sales represent new business, not sales taken from elsewhere.
Some independent store owners concede there may be some truth in this argument. "When the chains put stores in all those malls in the 1970's, they argued that they were creating new markets," said Charles Robinson, the current president of the American Booksellers Association and the owner of an independent bookstore in Bellingham, Wash. "In retrospect, I think they did expand the market."
Superstores could have the same effect, Mr. Robinson said, when they're opened in areas that don't have bookstores already. "But to the extent that they're going into well-established markets like Chicago, they'll be taking from each other and from other stores," he said.
The sudden appearance of many more superstores will soon reveal whether Mr. Riggio is right, and that's "the particularly interesting question" for publishers, said Laurie Brown, vice president for sales and marketing at Farrar Straus & Giroux in New York.
Ms. Brown sees some virtue for publishers in the creation of better stocked stores; with more room for some of the 950,000 titles in print, the superstores should help publishers sell their "backlist" of works published in previous years, she said.
In the meantime, all Mr. Kurland can do is stay on his toes. "You sharpen your pencils and try to be better," he said.
 
 
 
RAISING THE MONEY TO RAISE THE STAKES
 TURNING an empty retail shell into a book superstore is an expensive operation -- they typically cost more than $1 million apiece -- and so several companies with big-store ambitions went looking recently for capital.
Barnes & Noble Inc. announced plans in September to raise $130 million by taking part of the company public. The market, which has not been enthusiastic lately about many public offerings, was no kinder to Barnes & Noble's president, Leonard Riggio. Some analysts recommended avoiding the stock, citing the company's $275 million in debt and the fact that it lost $7.8 million last year on $892.6 million in sales. (Waldenbooks, by contrast, reported profits of $38 million on sales of $1.14 billion.)
Undaunted, Mr. Riggio canceled the offering and turned to private sources. He says he has raised more than $100 million -- from his own funds, those of Vendex International (the Dutch firm that owns the 50 percent of Barnes & Noble that Mr. Riggio doesn't) and private investors. He insists his initial filing was just a means to keep his options open, and that his offering was never really tested in the market.
"We didn't even do a red herring," he said, referring to an initial prospectus.
Last August, Borders Inc., the respected 19-outlet chain of book superstores, also announced that it would go public, hoping to raise as much as $190 million for its planned expansion. Less than two months later, the chain was acquired by Kmart for a sum the giant retailer did not disclose.
"Their problem was lack of money to grow," said Charles R. Cumello, president of Waldenbooks, now a member along with Borders of Kmart's specialty retail division. "Now they have Kmart's cash, so that's not a problem."
Two months ago, Books-a-Million Inc., a family-owned chain based in Birmingham, Ala., announced its plan to raise some $34 million by selling 2.275 million shares. Unlike the other two chains, Books-a-Million stuck by its plan. Its shares began trading last Tuesday on the Nasdaq exchange. The chain has some 100 stores in the Southeast, including 12 superstores. It hopes to build 25 more of the big stores within the next year.
Of all the companies gathering money for expansion, Mr. Riggio's is the one with the most on the line. His plans call for more stores and more spending than anyone else.
If Mr. Riggio is worried, he's not showing it. Barnes & Noble will report a profit in 1992, he said, precisely because he's opened so many superstores in time for the Christmas season, when some 40 percent of book-buying takes place. "We've been loading up-front all the costs of jumping into the superstore business," he said.
Other retailers agree that, despite the recession, a big burst of spending on superstores makes sense.
"The customers are spending twice as much time in the store," said Clyde Anderson, president of Books-a-Million. "If they spend more time, they spend more money."

HEADLINE: First, We Need to Have a Peacetime Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Cold War: Get Over It" (editorial, Oct. 22) raises the central issue facing Americans -- the imperative to put an end to our semimilitary economy and construct a system geared to peacetime needs. Many of us can recall when the country faced the dangers from the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis. The Roosevelt Administration, after grappling with a number of problems, was able to mobilize our economic strength to cope with the prospects of war. 
 Committees were formed under Federal auspices, with the support of Congress, to organize our economic resources for military production. The plans and programs put into action by these committees developed our military might and brought the Axis powers to their knees.
Today neither the executive nor the legislative branch has addressed the challenges emerging from the end of the cold war. Instead, we hear voices cautioning against reducing military expenditures because of the alleged baleful effect on the economy. We are told that thousands of jobs are at stake. Hence both major parties avoid taking positions that would threaten the livelihoods of workers.
However, these workers need not experience pain if both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue genuinely want a peacetime economy. That is, the joint action of the executive and legislative branches could create a council of conversion, consisting of representatives from government, labor, business and science, to work out programs for converting the economy to meet the needs of all Americans. Such a body could minimize the problems facing defense workers.
If the economy could be mobilized to meet the exigencies of war during the Roosevelt years, certainly we can convert to meet the exigencies of peace.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In This Three-Sided Civil War, Only Death Is Claiming Victory

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast

 BODY:
NOT long ago, the violent struggle over the fate of Liberia seemed nearly over. Charles Taylor, the American-educated guerrilla leader, had agreed to disarm and encamp his forces. Meanwhile, troops from a multinational West African peacekeeping force had begun fanning out through territory under the rebel leader's control, which includes nearly 95 percent of the Liberian countryside-- and appeared poised to enforce a truce. There was even talk of elections this year, the first in nearly a decade.
But in a blink, the conflict was rekindled last month, and now Liberia's warring factions appear to be thrusting the country once again into chaos, and this time possibly engulfing its neighbors in the region. 
 That fact was brought to the world's attention last week by news that five American nuns had been slain near their convent on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia's capital; the city became the focus of the latest fighting when Mr. Taylor's forces laid siege to it on Oct. 15 after weeks of mounting tensions. Mr. Taylor, however, has disavowed any involvement by his forces in the killing of the nuns, insisting that the area where they died was not under his control.
It was not a case that acquaintances of the nuns found persuasive, in part because the killings resembled other atrocities in which Mr. Taylor's troops were involved. "We hold Mr. Taylor responsible, directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously, for the death of these five lovely people," Archibishop Michael Francis of Monrovia said last Sunday.
In any event, the nuns were only the most publicized victims of Liberia's seemingly inexorable slide into anarchy. Tens of thousands have died in the Liberian civil war so far, and relief workers and diplomats say at least 3,000 -- most of them unarmed civilians -- have died just since mid-October.
The current fighting involves Mr. Taylor's forces, a rival rebel group and the West African force, which backs an interim Government. On Tuesday, Nigerian jets were reported to have killed 38 civilians in a raid on a rubber plantation east of Monrovia where military officials said Mr. Taylor's forces were storing munitions.
"What's happening now is everyone's worst nightmare," said Janet Fleischman, an expert on Liberia who works for Africa Watch, a New York-based advocacy group.
What went wrong? Archbishop Francis and many others in Liberia blame Mr. Taylor, who they say has time and again sabotaged efforts to settle the crisis. The latest breakdown began in mid-September, after fighting between the two rebel groups broke out and peacekeeping troops who were entering Mr. Taylor's territory came under attack. The West African force then withdrew and the situation deteriorated, culminating in the present siege of Monrovia.
"Taylor is driven by an all-consuming desire to become Liberia's President, and nothing short of that goal will ever satisfy him," said Makau wa Mutua, director of the Human Rights Project at Harvard Law School. "He's too power-hungry to ever sit down at a negotiating table."
Mr. Taylor has mostly blamed leaders of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States, a trading consortium that installed the interim Government in Monrovia in 1990 as part of a regional peace plan. Mr. Taylor has argued that the interim Government is a puppet of Nigeria, the region's dominant power, and indeed Nigeria has supplied most of the troops and materiel for the peacekeeping force.
Mr. Taylor, now 45 years old, has been involved in Liberia's power struggles since he was a student at Bentley College near Boston, when he helped organize Liberians in the United States against President William R. Tolbert Jr. When Master Sgt. Samuel K. Doe overthrew President Tolbert in 1980, Mr. Taylor returned to Liberia to join the new leadership. But he fell out with Mr. Doe, and in 1983 fled to the United States.
In December 1989, he and about 100 guerillas invaded northern Liberia from the Ivory Coast. The insurgency gained momentum but split into rival factions. Eventually a former Taylor follower, Prince Johnson, captured, tortured and killed President Doe.
At first, Mr. Taylor was hailed by many Liberians as a hero. But the accolades turned to condemnation when he refused to surrender territory he controlled on the ground that the peacekeeping force was not neutral. For nearly two years the acrimony stymied efforts to resolve the crisis.
Then, inexplicably, Mr. Taylor reversed himself in April and agreed to allow peacekeeping forces to be deployed in much of the area he controlled. He said he would disarm his fighters in anticipation of elections.
What neither side counted on, however, was the complication posed by yet another rebel group, the United Liberation Movement of Liberia. It began to attack Mr. Taylor's positions just as the West African peacekeeping forces were being deployed, and it was during this fighting that the peacekeeping troops came under attack and withdrew.
For a time, leaders of the West African force believed the best strategy was to negotiate a settlement between Mr. Taylor and the other rebels. But that effort failed and the West African force launched an offensive against Mr. Taylor. The current carnage in and around Monrovia followed.
The increasingly bloody three-way struggle over a tiny war-weary country presumably has its limits. If there is no clear winner, the pressure to talk could well grow. Chances are, though, that many more Liberians will die before that point is reached.

HEADLINE: TAKE A NUMBER;
What Can Clinton Change, and When?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
GOV. BILL CLINTON and his supporters had just begun to savor the sweet taste of election victory when the heartburn of governing set in.
By the end of last week, they clearly recognized that the policy changes Mr. Clinton promised daily during the campaign can only take effect slowly, incrementally and painfully even if they are enacted early in the year. "The word now," said an adviser in Little Rock trying to dampen expectations, "is no quick fix." 
 The economy cannot be turned on like a light switch. The country's health care, welfare and education systems cannot be reformed until a consensus is built in the country on which directions to go. Competing interests in many areas will have to be weighed against one another, with some supporters sure to be disappointed. The Republican influence on the bureaucracy and the courts will last for years.
Some campaign promises can indeed be fulfilled in Mr. Clinton's first days in the White House. He will almost certainly sign orders changing the Government's restrictions on abortion -- lifting the ban on abortion counseling at clinics receiving Federal money, permitting abortions at military hospitals, allowing aid to go to organizations overseas that provide abortion services and permitting the importation of RU-486, the French abortion pill. Mr. Clinton will probably sign other orders permitting homosexuals to serve in the military and ending the ban on medical research using fetal tissue, and he will doubtless appoint a coordinator of the Government's AIDS policy. He will also surely withdraw President Bush's proposals to open for development all of Alaska's wetlands and half of those in the other states.
Beyond that, some measures President Bush vetoed are likely to be reintroduced and enacted quickly once Mr. Clinton takes office. Bills in this category include those guaranteeing workers unpaid time off for birth and family emergencies, changing campaign finance laws and requiring states to let people register to vote when they get a driver's license.
 
Tough Choices
 Many fervent Clinton supporters, out in the cold for 12 years, say the most pleasant change for them will not be so much in policy as in tone and attitude. "We're going to have a sympathetic ear in the Government," said Tom Joe, one of the capital's authorities on policies affecting the poor. "Instead of mean, callous, insensitive people, ignorant about what's really going on out there, I expect an intelligent debate now, a dialogue on the main issues."
But all that is relatively small stuff. In the last days of the campaign, Mr. Clinton began to enumerate his highest priorities: turning the economy around and creating more jobs; controlling health-care costs, while extending medical insurance coverage to everyone; reducing the Federal budget deficit, and improving the country's education and job-training systems.
Many of those elements are interdependent; some are contradictory. The tax cuts and spending increases needed to stimulate the economy would worsen the deficit in the short term. Universal medical insurance could lead to more spending on health care, not less. The deficit cannot be reined in without limiting the Government's medical expenses. The promise of more jobs depends in part on better education and training, and those cost money, which in turn would make it harder to lower the deficit.
Such are the tough choices to be weighed initially by the transition team led by Warren M. Christopher and Vernon E. Jordan, who were appointed on Friday. But Mr. Clinton has a big advantage many of his predecessors have not enjoyed: he has big majorities of his own party in Congress dying to follow the lead of a Democratic President. The lawmakers say it is in their own self-interest to prove that they can be productive.
THE ECONOMIC 'LASER BEAM' Mr. Clinton won the Presidency in large part because of the economic hard times, and last Wednesday, the day after the election, he promised to "focus like a laser beam on this economy." He has not said and probably does not know yet exactly what he will propose. But these are good bets: tax credits for business investments in new plants and machinery (Look for what is called a "marginal" tax credit, intended to reward businesses only for investments they would not otherwise have made); permanent tax breaks for business spending on research and development; billions of dollars in grants to states and cities for public works like highways and waste treatment plants; higher tax rates on family incomes above $200,000, and stricter enforcement of tax laws affecting foreign corporations.
That is a popular package, even if Mr. Clinton does not include the tax cut for the middle class he proposed during the campaign. Congress would doubtless pass the measures quickly. But two big questions remain: Would they actually succeed in giving a quick boost to the economy? And will Mr. Clinton ask for long-term steps to lower the budget deficit as part of his package?
Reflecting the prevailing view, Charles L. Schultze, a top economist in the Johnson and Carter Administrations, said, "My judgment is that you can't do a lot very quickly, but you could feel the effects, maybe, in 1993, by the end of next year."
Meantime, the determination of many businesses to cut their operating costs will continue in light of international competition, lessened demand for military equipment and other fundamental changes in the economy over which Mr. Clinton will have little or no control. That means more layoffs. Just in the last couple of weeks, for example, such corporate giants as American Express, Bell South, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Borden announced plans to eliminate among them more than 20,000 jobs in the next year. Against such forces, the Clinton economic package might seem feeble.
The matter of dealing with the budget deficit is even more of a conundrum. Mr. Clinton did not stress it during the campaign. But many Democratic economists, Mr. Schultze among them, hold that the deficit is the country's most critical problem, one that is slowly eroding the nation's foundation by borrowing against the future. They say that unless the Clinton Administration tackles it at once, enacting early next year foolproof legislation to lower the deficit once the economy improves, the chance for success will be lost.
Ross Perot's surprising strength in the election and exit polls showing many voters demanding deficit reduction could give Mr. Clinton political cover. But here's the rub: the only way really to reduce the deficit is to raise the taxes of middle-income Americans, cut popular programs or both. Those moves are politically unappealing; if Mr. Clinton pressed for them, it might delay if not completely block the chances for approval of his economic stimulus plan.
Other important campaign promises like changing the health care and welfare systems and granting college scholarships in return for public service will not be acted on until the primary economic issues are disposed of. In the case of health care especially, that might enhance the likelihood of eventual success because it will give the new Administration time to develop a consensus for its proposals.
"The public hasn't been prepared by anyone to face the explicit trade-offs a new medical system would require, like higher taxes and restrictions on choices," said John Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons. Without such careful spade work, he added, major health care legislation can never blossom.
COMPETING DEMANDS Like any new President, Mr. Clinton owes debts to important supporters. Big-city mayors have a seven-point plan that would cost $35 billion. Teachers want more money for schools. Women's groups want to see women get top jobs in the new Government. Some of these and other interest groups will be rewarded; others will not. For Mr. Clinton it will be a delicate balancing act.
Nowhere is this clearer than in the case of the philosophy he assumes on protecting the environment. Mr. Clinton's running mate, Al Gore, and former Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont, who will probably get a big position somewhere in the new Administration, favor sharply increased Government regulations on business and development. Other important advisers like Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado and Fred Krupp, the influential director of the Environmental Defense Fund, generally oppose new rules and restrictions and prefer tax breaks for businesses and other market-based inducements to improve the environment. How Mr. Clinton comes down on this matter may be seen in whom he appoints to be Secretary of the Interior and head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Whatever the case, the authorities agree, Mr. Clinton must move quickly. The two recent Presidents most successful in turning the Government's policies around, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan, won most of their triumphs in their first year in office. Harry C. McPherson, who was Johnson's White House counsel, gives Mr. Clinton a year before a political backlash develops. Joel H. Silbey, a historian and Presidential scholar at Cornell, allows 18 months. Mr. Rother, the lobbyist for retirees, thinks Mr. Clinton may have as much as a two-year grace period, but no more.
No President can completely prepare for everything he might face. But Mr. Clinton intends to make sure that at least he is not blind-sided by the substance. Asked by reporters in Little Rock on Friday how he was spending most of his time, he said, "I'm reading volumes of stuff on things that I need to decide on."

HEADLINE: Conversations/Wang Chigang;
An Illiterate Peasant From Nowhere Speaking Volumes About China

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: TUQIAO, China

 BODY:
HE IS an unimportant man. He did not go to school, cannot write his own name, and never makes decisions that affect his village, let alone his nation.
Wang Chigang is a Chinese peasant, one of about 800 million. A sinewy 76-year-old, short, lean and beginning to bend with the years, he lives in the little village of Luqiao, miles and miles from nowhere in the central Chinese province of Anhui. His face is rough and covered with creases, the texture of a softball that is about to be retired. He wears a navy blue version of the tunic known as a Mao suit, with a matching cap on his close-cropped head. 
 "Sit down, sit down," he says, beaming a smile that displays his three remaining teeth as a foreigner in search of a Chinese Everyman wanders over to his new two-room concrete home. "Let me pour some tea." He follows the ritual of insisting several times before being persuaded that tea is unnecessary, and then he sits on a folding chair in the bare living room and begins to speak of his life.
Mr. Wang's tale is not unusual in these parts, nor is he especially articulate. He is simply a fairly typical member of the Chinese peasantry, which accounts for one person in seven on Earth. It was the peasants who played a fundamental role in China's Communist Revolution of 1949, who today are the main builders of China's ongoing economic miracle, and who continue to provide the troops who protect the party -- those who three years ago fired their machine guns at university students demanding more democracy. Collectively the peasants exert a stabilizing force in China, and Mr. Wang offers a window into their feelings of contentment, docility and indifference that help keep the Communist Party in power.
"Life was very poor when I was growing up," Mr. Wang began expansively, as his grandson and great-granddaughter watched quietly from a few feet away. "All the homes in the village were made of mud, and there was no school. Most girls in those days bound their feet, of course, wrapping them up to make them as tiny as possible."
"My family was among the poorest in the village, and it was impossible for me to go to school," he said. "I was the fifth son in a large family, and so I didn't get any land."
 
Chinese Gothic
 Mr. Wang spoke without a hint of bitterness; indeed, he seemed to relish the chance to relate what he had endured. He grinned repeatedly, sometimes disconcertingly, even when recalling painful periods of his life. Unflappable and self-satisfied, he was not in the least inquisitive about life in America.
At the age of 21, Mr. Wang married a young woman who was also from a poor family -- too poor to worry about binding her feet to make her more beautiful. There was no work to be had in those days, in the 1930's, so in desperation he set off to try to get food any way he could.
"We went begging," he said, speaking easily in Mandarin with a strong local accent. "We were together then, because one guy alone can't get anything. You need a wife and babies to beg."
Asked what it was like to beg, Mr. Wang paused and seemed to regard it as a silly question. "It was terrible," he said. "How could a beggar be happy doing that?"
Over the years, Mr. Wang worked on-and-off as a day laborer, a farmhand and a quarry worker. The revolution in 1949 turned everything around and for a while his village was full of hope. The fields were divided up, so that Mr. Wang, his wife and three children received some land of their own.
Life began to go awry in Luqiao in 1958, when Chairman Mao proclaimed the Great Leap Forward, a bold plan to catch up with the industrialized West. Mr. Wang's farmland was taken away and made part of a commune, and he and other peasants obeyed orders to build a steel furnace -- part of a scheme to industrialize by making steel in backyard furnaces rather than huge smelters. Mr. Wang and the other peasants ate their meals together in a village cafeteria, and everything was supposed to be shared.
"At first, we could eat as much as we wanted in the cafeteria, but that only lasted a few months," Mr. Wang said. All China was then in a frenzy, with officials setting impossible goals for grain harvests and steel production, and then falsely claiming to have met the targets. Most peasants and workers joined in the giddiness, for they felt enormous faith in Chairman Mao and could not believe that he could be so wrong this time.
But he was. The hoes and pots that Mr. Wang and millions of other peasants put into the backyard steel furnaces ended up as useless gobs of metal, and farm work was so neglected that China suffered the worst famine ever recorded in world history. Perhaps 26 million people died.
"Nobody in my family died, but a lot of others did," Mr. Wang said coolly. "About 20 percent of the people in the village died then."
The Cultural Revolution had only a slight impact on Luqiao, Mr. Wang said, because it was so remote. A few city youths came to live in the village for a while, to learn from the peasants, but went away after the glamour wore off.
 
Deng's Revolution
 The real revolution in Mr. Wang's life, with far more impact than 1949, came after Deng Xiaoping became paramount leader in 1978. The commune was dissolved and Mr. Wang and his eight-member family again got land of their own: 1.6 acres.
Life improved steadily, and lately his family has begun to go into business. Mr. Wang's grandchildren have turned the entrance to their home into a small shop, selling baby clothes and knickknacks. One grandson has made modest amounts of money selling piglets.
"Young people think very differently," Mr. Wang said, gazing proudly at his 25-year-old grandson, Wang Zhichun. "They think big! Me, I figure it's enough to get a bite to eat. But the kids want to do a lot of business and make pots of money.
"Young people are so much more capable than I am, so I never interfere in the business decisions. Why, they can make 100 yuan in just a few days. I sure can't do that."
One hundred yuan is equivalent to about $18. The per capita cash income for peasants in Anhui Province is about $100 per year.
Electricity arrived last year, and the family bought a television. Now Mr. Wang has turned into something of a couch potato, watching three or more hours of television each evening -- especially dramas and musical performances.
"Sometimes I stay up half the night watching programs," he acknowledged, with a hint of embarrassment.
Mr. Wang does not pay much attention to the news, and he could not name the Prime Minister (Li Peng) or Communist Party leader (Jiang Zemin). But he is interested in the food on the table. "Before, I could never eat meat -- three years could go by without eating meat," he said. "Now I eat meat almost every day."
These days Mr. Wang helps his family with the work, and he is also thinking about getting a coffin ready in case he dies unexpectedly. Like most elderly villagers, he plans to keep the coffin in a corner of the house so that it is ready if necessary. "It's best to be prepared," he said.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Bypassing the Press Helps Candidates; Does It Also Serve the Public Interest?

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
MARISSA HALL, the young woman from Richmond, Va., who stood up at the second Presidential debate and asked "How has the national debt personally affected each of your lives?" probably wasn't expecting to become a major campaign figure. But as William Figueroa, the student Dan Quayle coached to spell "potatoe," can attest, celebrity sometimes comes in unexpected ways.
After the second debate was over, many Americans hailed Ms. Hall's question as one of the campaign's most illuminating, calling it proof that the political process functions best when the role of the news media is minimized. Others argued that the question itself was wrong-headed -- Ms. Hall seemed not to understand the difference between the recession and the national debt -- and called it one of the best arguments that could be made for the importance of the press. 
 Perhaps better than any other incident, this debate over a question illustrates a theme that was central to the 1992 campaign, but never appeared on a candidate's position paper: Who should ask the questions?
Never before had so many Americans -- from reporters to talk show hosts to rock stars to ordinary citizens -- had the opportunity to stick a microphone in the face of a Presidential candidate. With the campaign ending in record voter turnouts, even many journalists of the "old news" school have been commending the broadening of the political process to include "new news" types like Phil Donahue and Larry King.
"Obviously it generated an enormous amount of interest by people who normally weren't turned on by the process," said Tim Russert, the moderator of NBC's "Meet the Press."
At the same time, traditional journalists are clearly anxious about losing their franchise. And while almost everyone agrees that it can be informative to see the candidates in a relaxed setting -- as on MTV, for example -- this fall the settings often seemed a little too relaxed. In the final weeks, Ross Perot submitted to hardly any questions except those posed by a friendly interviewer who happened to be on his payroll. Some journalists wonder whether Bill Clinton's plans for direct interaction with ordinary people will mean fewer press conferences.
As early as the New Hampshire primary, it was clear that the struggle for control of the questions was going to be a big subplot.
When the Gennifer Flowers story broke, aides to Governor Clinton insisted that New Hampshire voters were not much interested in the story. Reporters, however, were. They questioned the Governor about it wherever he went.
 
Friendly Coverage for Sale
 Finally Mr. Clinton decided that he was going to get a different kind of coverage, even if he had to pay for it. He bought a half-hour of local television time, assembled a group of undecided voters and let them ask the questions.
After that, at almost every important juncture of the campaign, Mr. Clinton tried to find forums beyond the political press corps. During the New York primary, when polls suggested he might lose to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown, Mr. Clinton spoke with Don Imus, the radio host. After the California primary, when the polls showed him third behind George Bush and Mr. Perot, he appeared on Arsenio.
What he was trying to avoid was the kind of questions that reporters love to ask and candidates hate to answer -- ones that center on unfavorable polls, rumors of misconduct and contradictions in the candidate's positions. Many press critics say the tactic worked because voters, too, are tired of such questions.
"The press is dedicated to a 'gotcha' frame of mind, to an interrupting style, to a way of almost saying 'I'm am as important to the process as this person who is President or who wants to be,' " said Marvin Kalb, director of the Shorenstein Barone Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "The voters have for a whole variety of reasons developed heavy scar tissue when it comes to professional journalism."
It is not clear, though, that the alternatives are much better.
With several billion dollars at his disposal, Mr. Perot was able to go through much of his extraordinary campaign avoiding reporters almost completely. On his paid programs, the independent candidate sometimes posed questions to himself and sometimes had them asked, in near-reverential terms, by a paid interviewer. On Election Day, Mr. Perot received almost 20 percent of the vote, a tally that suggested many Americans were satisfied to see the candidate only in a controlled setting. But Mr. Perot's performance also prompted calls for campaign reforms that would prevent future candidates from buying their own coverage.
Talk show hosts like Mr. King do not play "gotcha." Presumably to many viewers, and certainly to the candidates, this is a virtue. But a campaign run entirely on "Larry King Live" would leave a rather lopsided view of the candidates.
What about letting the voters themselves ask the questions? This happened frequently this year -- including in the second debate -- and many people say that this was one of the best aspects of the 1992 campaign. But one reason the press exists is that most Americans have neither enough time nor enough access to examine the candidates' positions in great detail. And if one listened to the many forums at which voters queried the candidates, one found that many of the questions were repetitive and involved a single theme: themselves.
"There is nothing more self-centered than an audience of untrained voters who ask the same question: me, me, me," complained Michael Robinson, a professor of government at Georgetown University.
Even with the campaign over, average citizens may get to keep asking. Mr. Clinton has said he will use bus tours and town meetings to try to build public support for bills he favors.
"We had a talk show campaign," said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Will we have a talk show Presidency?"

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
It's a Wonderful 2d Term (Apologies to Mr. Capra)

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
OF all the reasons why George Bush unravelled, the one most often cited is the 1990 bipartisan budget deal that broke his "read my lips" pledge. Lyn Nofziger, the former Reagan aide, called it "the wound from which all blood flows."
With a little humorous license, it is possible to imagine what would have happened in the Bush Administration if the President had, at the last moment, just stood up to John Sununu and Richard Darman, his aides who worked out the deal, and said: "Can't do it. Can't break my promise to the American people. Wouldn't be prudent. Might lose in '92." 
 In a variation on Frank Capra's revisionist 1946 fable "It's a Wonderful Life" starring Jimmy Stewart, here is what might have been:
Although Mr. Bush does not like to fire people, he is put on the spot when Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman, the "Raging Bulls" of the White House, paw the earth and threaten to quit if he does not sign the tax pact. He accepts their resignations, names Dick Cheney chief of staff and installs Phil Gramm, the conservative Texas senator with a Ph.D. in economics, as budget director.
The new advisers escape what they regard as a trap set by Democratic leaders, and, after a 16-day Government shutdown noticed by few Americans, get Congress to agree to a package of spending reductions without tax increases.
Concerned about internal polling numbers that show 75 percent of Americans think the country is "on the wrong track," the new team refocuses the entire Administration on domestic affairs.
Mr. Bush asks Peggy Noonan to write a speech for the George Bush-Puts-America-First Bus Tour and, at her urging, huddles with Housing Secretary Jack Kemp. "My friends, in small towns and big cities all over the country," he says, "what's past need not be prologue. We must remake economic policy and change the flow of money in America so the government gets less and the people get more. Message: I care about the economy."
Instead of recommending that Republicans running in mid-term Congressional elections distance themselves from Mr. Bush, Ed Rollins, the party's strategist, recommends that they cleave to the President, because he is on the right track. The appreciative Mr. Bush then cleaves to Mr. Rollins, who finds it impossible to defect to a tart-tongued Texas billionaire named Ross Perot.
Pat Buchanan decides not to run for President, because the conservatives, while never content, are not grumbling too much about Mr. Bush. He even says nice things about Mr. Bush on his television show, "Crossfire."
At the end of the gulf war, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf calls the President and recommends that the allies push on into Baghdad. Mr. Bush, confident of his domestic base and less anxious about a long entanglement, decides to go for it. Baghdad falls the next day, and Saddam Hussein is carted off by vengeful Kurds. Everybody forgets the word wimp.
In less need of conservative approval, the President and his wife, Barbara, spend 15 queasy minutes watching the Anita Hill testimony to Congress. Mr. Bush calls Judge Clarence Thomas and suggests that he withdraw his name.
Cruising at a 97 percent popularity rating at the beginning of 1992, President Bush decides he feels smothered by rich, white, middle-aged males, and reaches for some younger blood to run his re-election campaign: the Vice President's chief of staff, Bill Kristol, the State Department's Margaret Tutwiler and James Pinkerton, the junior White House aide. The President goes on MTV. "Message: Rock the Deficit," Mr. Bush raps.
On "Larry King Live," Ross Perot grudgingly gives credit to Mr. Bush for getting under the hood and tinkering with the engine, for dealing with that crazy aunt in the attic, the deficit. Says he won't run himself.
Before the Houston convention, after a lunch with Mr. Bush, Dan Quayle announces he's bored with politics and has decided to take a job as the chairman of the United States Golf Association. Mr. Bush takes Gen. Colin Powell as his running mate.
With the conservative base intact, the convention emphasizes Lee Atwater's inclusive "big tent" and showcases uplifting moderates like Education Secretary Lamar Alexander; Tom Kean, the former New Jersey Governor and Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts. Pro-choice night gets the biggest TV ratings of the week. Coming out of the convention with a big bounce, the President feels no need to insist G-O-D is on the Republican side.
Instead of slouching back to run the campaign, Secretary of State James Baker stays in the Middle East, works out a comprehensive peace deal and wins the Nobel. The 35-year sibling rivalry between George and Jimmy intensifies.
In Little Rock, Ark., Bill Clinton's strategists decide it will be hard to get any traction on the economy, so they tack up a sign at their headquarters that reads "Social Justice, Stupid!" and with this theme alienate Reagan Democrats. They worry, since Mr. Bush has kept all his major campaign promises, that the Republicans may have success using the character issue. And they worry that Mr. Bush will be able to successfully attack Congress, since he never made any cozy deals with them.
Mr. Bush wins, taking larger percentages of the black vote, the women's vote and the youth vote than any Republican in history. In his second Inaugural Address, the President calls himself an agent of change and becomes the first President to (almost) quote Bette Davis. "My fellow Americans, fasten your seatbelts," he says. "It's going to be a bumpy ride."

HEADLINE: NOV. 1-7: Washington's Warning Shot;
Europe Holds Its Fire But a Trade War May Have Begun

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
In the global economy, where nations risk trade wars when diplomacy fails, weapons can be as mundane as soybeans or as stylish as fine wine. So it went last week in the apparent failure of talks between the Bush Administration and the European Community.
Soybeans -- innocuous cream-colored legumes about the size and shape of green peas -- figure centrally. The United States wanted Europe to end or reduce the farm subsidies that allow its growers of soybeans and other oilseeds to unfairly undersell American growers. After European officials refused, the United States moved to impose 200 percent taxes on some imports, chiefly white wine. 
 The taxes would effectively triple the price of these products, but would not be collected until Dec. 5, allowing time for possible further talks.
The European Community, which for months had threatened to retaliate with stiff taxes on American products, took no immediate action. With its headquarters in Brussels in chaos as officials blamed each other for finding themselves on the brink of a trade war, the foreign ministers of the community's member countries planned to meet tomorrow. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a world trade body in Geneva, planned an emergency meeting for Tuesday.
American officials predicted that just as European countries have never been able to agree among themselves on how to resolve the soybean dispute, they will also be unable to agree now on how and whether to retaliate.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Budget Crisis Set for Replay as Costs Rise but Revenues Stay Weakened

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
After three straight years of fiscal crisis, beleaguered New Jersey budget makers may be about to tangle with the worst budget year yet.
Barring a bold upswing in the economy, which most analysts consider unlikely, the state is looking at yet another year of lean revenues. Furthermore, in closing last year's budget gap, legislators used nearly a billion dollars in one-time opportunities, like a revaluing of pension plans, that will not be available again. 
 In addition to the loss of one-time revenues, said Treasurer Samuel F. Crane, "Health care reform will have to be added, along with new correctional facilities. Medicaid grows $200 million plus per year."
"I think it's safe to say that growth in revenue will not match growth in expenditures," Mr. Crane said.
 
Planning Process Starts
 The current budget, itself cut sharply in the Legislature this year, producing a painful round of job cuts at state agencies, runs through June of next year. But the state's 19 department heads are already drafting their requests for the next budget, which Gov. Jim Florio is to submit to the Legislature in January.
Mr. Crane expects economic growth to produce at best only a modest increase in revenues.
The Republican Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, has a rosier forecast. He said he was optimistic that the state would pull out of the economic doldrums and see enough growth in the next 18 months, through the next fiscal year, to meet budget demands.
"There has already been some growth in the economy," he said. "By July 1 of 1994, we should be out of the doldrums. I think the economy will be humming along by then."
And if not?
"If the economy stays flat?" Mr. Haytaian said. "We would be $1.2 billion, or $1.3 billion short of this year."
 
Anger Over Taxes
 That would mean that the state would have only about $13.4 billion or less to spend compared to the $14.6 billion budgeted this year, which is itself more than a billion dollars less than the Governor asked for.
But Mr. Haytaian also says a tax increase would be "literally impossible," with anger still simmering over the record $2.8 billion increase in sales and income taxes in 1990.
The state over the last two years has significantly cut its work force, through attrition and layoffs, from 71,000 to 66,000.
If revenues do not pick up as he expects, Mr. Haytaian says, "we still think there are areas in the present budget we can go into" for further reductions, including, he said, the Departments of Human Services, Transportation and Corrections.
 
One-Time Fiscal Devices

The bleak fiscal situation did not develop overnight, nor did it have a single cause.
Because of the bad economy, tax collections have been almost flat for three years. The sales-tax rollback reduced revenue by $608 million this year.
To balance the budget in the face of the severe revenue reductions, the Florio administration has resorted to several one-time devices.
This year, for example, the state managed to raise $1.2 billion through a change in the method of valuing pension funds. Last year, it accelerated collection of utilities taxes and raised $150 million.
 
Paying for Past Gimmicks
 But in the coming budget, the state will pay for the gimmicks it has used. The pension revaluation benefit, for example, means $773 million less in the new budget, and accelerated collections of utilities taxes will also provide $110 million less next year than this year. That means that if all else stays even, the state will have $883 million less in the next budget than it now has.
And the Republican Legislature, to keep its promise to continue to hold the line on taxes, has already imposed a series of revenue measures such as fee increases that cannot be stretched much farther.
Hospital admission fees, for example, were raised from $3.55 to $5 to get $1 million more in revenue. The amount the elderly and others chip in as co-payments for prescription drugs was raised from $2 to $5, which raised about $16 million. A similar increase in the prescription fee for state employees raised another $3 million. All told, the fee increases in the budget produced about $24 million in new revenues.
There have also been a rash of separate bills that would raise other fees or return money to the treasury from other sources. One measure, for example, would raise $47 million by returning certain savings in local pension funds to the state.
 
Further Cuts Possible
 Another would increase the fee for filing for divorce from $35 to $160; another would increase beverage license fees to raise another $1.2 million; another would impose a $15 surcharge for certain traffic violations.
None of these raise large amounts of new revenue, but the grumbling and complaining even over them will make further such increases difficult.
To make up for the tax cut and other budget problems, the Legislature also cut the Homestead Rebate program by more than half, from $685 million to $300 million, eliminating or sharply reducing rebate checks.
The Florio administration is already trying to turn the rebate reduction to its political favor. The Democratic State Committee is running radio ads pummeling the Republican Legislature for cutting the rebates, and the Governor is sending out letters, at at cost of $250,000 to taxpayers, reminding those who got a check of up to $500 last year why they are getting none or less this year.

HEADLINE: For One Lawmaker, Allure of Capital Had Double-Edge

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
He was one of the brash, bold reformers who swept into Congress 18 years ago on a wave of popular revulsion over Watergate and the Vietnam War. Elected at age 25, he was so boyish that he was carded in bars and mistaken for a Congressional page. And no one really begrudged him when, with an immature charm, he researched whether he could be called the youngest person ever to enter the Congress.
Representative Thomas J. Downey of Amityville literally grew up in the marble corridors of the Capitol. He married during his tenure in Washington and made a home with his wife and children in a Capitol Hill townhouse. 
 But as the years passed, voters in Long Island's Second Congressional District began to wonder if he had drifted away from his roots and from the people who had elected him. And last week, they resoundingly defeated Mr. Downey in favor of someone who was remarkably reminiscent of the Tom Downey of old: a young Turk from the Suffolk County Legislature who said the incumbent had become too high and mighty and distant.
 
'Lost Touch' With Voters
 Mr. Downey, whose only adult job outside government was a brief stint in the personnel department of Macy's, was devastated. "I did not have any sense that I had lost touch with the community," he said, but he admitted that his opponent had fatally wounded him with that charge. "Sadly it stuck and had nothing to do with reality."
Some members of Congress now see Mr. Downey's defeat as a cautionary tale of how the power and the perquisites of Washington can seduce them all; of how even the brightest star of the post-Watergate era could eventually seem to the voters as too much like the insiders he once scorned.
And in Suffolk County, some wonder whether the voters had turned on Mr. Downey precisely because they had once loved him so, mothers and grandmothers cooing over the boy Congressman, with the Paul McCartneyesque cap of brown hair.
"That kind of -- it may be too strong to say adoration -- that kind of feeling for him, love for him, may have dissipated as he climbed up the ladder," said Dominic J. Baranello, the Suffolk County Democratic leader.
Mr. Downey first went to Washington on a tidal wave of voter revolt against the Nixon presidency and the Watergate scandal. Campaigning door to door and undaunted by the seeming futility of being an anti-war liberal running in a district that had given Richard M. Nixon 72 percent of the vote just two years earlier, Mr. Downey prevailed over the incumbent Republican Representative, James R. Grover. The next day's papers had pictures of the young Congressman-elect playing basketball with his 11-year-old brother.
 
Symbol of His Time
 In his youth, fervor and brashness, Mr. Downey was symbolic of his time. The elections of 1974 sent 75 freshmen into the House of Representatives, Mr. Downey the youngest among them. They were righteous, idealistic, ready to change the world, and they promptly ran a minor revolution in the tradition-bound House by toppling three committee chairmen. Mr. Downey did his part on the House Armed Services Committee, where he helped deposed the aging chairman, Representative Edward Herbert of Louisiana.
Mr. Downey quickly became one of the leaders of the Democratic newcomers, a tight-knit circle who shared anti-establishment political views and played ferocious basketball in the House gym. Along with Al Gore, who came to the House two years later, he made himself into one of Washington's select coterie of arms control experts.
His colleagues remember his utter confidence. "He would be announcing, 'We're going to do this. We're going to that,' " recalled Representative George Miller, a California Democrat. "We'd say that the Speaker won't like that and he'd say it didn't matter."
Mr. Downey also emerged as one of the Democrats' most articulate -- and vitriolic -- polemicists , a role that left him with enemies on the Republican side of the aisle. "If he had a weakness as a speaker, it was that he'd leave you no quarter. He'd cut you off at the knees and take a second swipe at you," Mr. Miller said. "That would cause you problems in the Congress because members of Congress weren't used to being devastated publicly."
 
Serving the Voters
 As he became an ever larger presence in Washington, Mr. Downey remained a model of the constituent-oriented Congressman. He invited thousands of voters to his parents' home in West Islip to talk issues. He made a van into a mobile office to move about the sprawling South Shore district. Former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro of Queens, who entered Congress in 1978, remembers that Mr. Downey was so successful that he was asked to address freshmen on how to serve their districts.
In 1980, with the birth of his first child, Lauren, Mr. Downey and his wife, Chris, who had been an elementary school teacher in Dix Hills, were faced with the choice all members of Congress must wrestle with, how to mix the demands of family and politics. They moved to Washington so that Mr. Downey could spend more time with his daughter and later, with his second child, Theodore. On weekends, the Congressman would commute back to Long Island.
The Downey home in Washington eventually grew into a social center for a small circle of House Democrats. Once a week, Chis would cook dinner for a group that could include Marty Russo of Illinois and Leon E. Panetta, Barbara Boxer, Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Miller, all of California.
In hindsight, several of Mr. Downey's colleagues said that his relocation to Washington might have set the stage for his defeat. "I really think that matters," said one representative, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "You by nature stay in touch more if you live in your district. You live in Washington, you just get sucked into Washington."
In fact, it was sometime in the mid-1980's that Frank R. Jones, a Republican official who is now supervisor of Islip, first began hearing complaints about Mr. Downey. "He had good constituent service, he absolutely did -- for the first 10 or 12 years," he said. "After that, real or perceived, it began to fall off. I had a fellow, a staunch Democrat, who said to me, 'You know, I've had innumerable meetings with Congressman Downey and he was always late.' "
By the late 1980's, Mr. Downey had reached the height of his legislative powers as an influential member of Ways and Means Committee and the Select Committee on Aging.
He also became acting-chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources after Representative Harold E. Ford, a Tennessee Democrat, fell under the cloud of an indictment. And there he became one of the lead legislators in the Congress on welfare policy and child care. On an issue of key concern to Long Island, he also led the effort that prolonged the life of Grumman's F-14 fighter plane for three years.
But in 1990, just before an election, Mr. Downey was one of many members of the Ways and Means Committee caught by hidden cameras on ABC's "Prime Time Live" at a junket in Barbados, jet-skiing in a bathing suit and playing football on a beach. He apologized to his constituents and said he had made a mistake. And he was re-elected.
 
'Vulnerable This Year'
 But Republicans noted that he had won with only 56 percent of the vote against an weak opponent. It was, said Suffolk Republican leader Howard C. DeMartini, "the early warning signal that Downey would be vulnerable this year."
Mr. Downey also saw the trouble signs. "I had a sense that things were very wrong in 1990," he said in an interview. "I have all these diary notes about this: You've got to get to work. You've got to work a little harder." He said he started serving his district with renewed vigor, returning to Long Island one out of every three days in 1991 and every other day in 1992.
Then the House bank scandal struck at a time when Long Island was in deep recession. It was bad enough that Mr. Downey had overdrafts on 151 checks totaling $83,000. It was worse still that Mrs. Downey, who had a patronage job working for the House sergeant-at-arms, had been hired on a budget line that listed her job title as auditor of the House bank.
Rick Lazio, a 34-year-old two-term Suffolk County legislator, built his campaign against Mr. Downey around the bank scandal and Barbados trip, in a race that was strikingly reminiscent to Mr. Downey's own battle 18 years ago against an entrenched incumbent.
 
Anger Toward Congress
 Mr. Lazio sent out a last-minute blitz of direct mail playing on the popular resentment of Congress. One flier offered "Tom Downey's Limousine Liberal guide to surviving the recession," a 10-point primer.
"Tough times on Long Island getting you down?" it asked. "Move to Washington. Rent out your multiple-family Long Island home (one of three homes he owns); put your children in private school in Virginia." That was just point No. 1.
Mr. Downey was thrown on the defensive, forced to invite voters to drop by his two-family house in Amityville to prove he still had a place to live on Long Island. "I live on Long Island, I have lived here all my life," he said in a televised debate. "If you have any doubt, come to 155 Cedar Street where I have lived for 13 years."
Mr. Lazio, a moderate pro-choice Republican, offered a refreshing gee-whiz quality, as evidenced in his reflections on the race a few days after victory. "There's something bigger than how powerful you are, how many powerful people you know and whether you get invited to powerful cocktails parties," he said. Of the voters, he added, "what they want is to say, 'I know him. He goes to the same diner I go to.' "
Election Day was bittersweet. The Democrats had recaptured the White House and Washington hung on the threshold of generational change. Mr. Downey's close friend, Al Gore, had become Vice President-elect. It should have been Mr. Downey's time; he still so young at just 43 and yet with nearly two decades of Congressional seniority.
But instead, he spent election night consoling his children about his defeat and telling them they should be happy for the victory of Bill Clinton. The next day he drove back to Washington and strove to put the best face on things. "This has been -- all losers must have this sense -- this has been a wonderful 18 years," he said. "That's how I'd prefer to remember it."
 
'No Tom Downey'
 He showed a small hint of his old sharp tongue, when asked if he had the feeling that he had been beaten by a new Tom Downey. "I know Tom Downey, and he's no Tom Downey," he said of Mr. Lazio. "I'm sure there's some irony in all of this, but it's lost on me at the moment."
Across the country, Mr. Downey's House colleagues raged that Long Island's voters had not appreciated Mr. Downey as they had. "This is a person who is extremely bright, very talented in knowing the possibilities of government," said Representative Pelosi. "He was masterful at shaping legislation and he was very respected." She added, "It's hard to understand why there wasn't a recognition of his value in his district."
But at the West Islip firehouse, near Mr. Downey's campaign headquarters, the dispatcher, Mel Lauber, said he had voted against Mr. Downey although he had supported him in the past. "I didn't like the idea of rubber checks," he said, "and I didn't like the idea of him parading around on vacation on taxpayers' money." All that puzzled him was why so few other Congressional incumbents had fallen: "I thought they wanted a clean Congress."

HEADLINE: A Republican Message That Roiled the Waters;
Just Who Makes Jobs?

 BODY:
President-elect Clinton has said that an economic stimulus program, including money for new roads and other public works projects, s at the top of his agenda. As an indication of how dominant an issue the economy was in the Nov. 2 elections, readers are continuing to respond very strongly to "The Beauty of Indexing Capital Gains" (Viewpoints, Oct. 25) by Theodore J. Forstmann, national co-chairman of the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign. Some of their letters follow.
To the Editor: 
 No one is as blind as those who will not see, as Mr. Forstmann's love song to subsidizing investors demonstrates again.
"New jobs are not created by the government or big corporations," he announces. Governments employ about 27 percent of America's work force. Does Mr. Forstmann believe small entrepreneurs created those jobs?
If government builds a school or a road or a dam, who "creates" the jobs of the men and women who do the construction and staff the facility when it is finished?
Many of our mightiest industries got started with government as a partner. Government land paid for our railroads. The government subsidized airlines with lucrative mail contracts when interstate air travel was in its infancy and with government-designed airplanes later.
If Mr. Forstmann were not so caught up in the tendrils of latter-day Republican orthodoxy, he might note that government, America's largest industry, is in a deep recession, laying off workers and cutting their salaries. That government recession in no small measure is attributable to Mr. Forstmann's masters, who have been in charge and bad-mouthing the product (government services of all kinds) for so long that the customer-taxpayers won't buy any more.
How long would a General Motors president who detested cars, and told customers they should abandon them, last?
We've suffered too long from Forstmann-Bush myopia. Out, out, you nitwits! It's time we had a President who believes in the business he runs, that government is important enough to pay for and make effective again.

HEADLINE: About Those Stats on Women's Pay

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Women's Progress Stalled? Just Not So" (Oct. 18) confirms that while the glass ceiling is still a popular notion and a reality for some, it is less of a barrier than once believed. 
 I wish the writer had looked beyond the numbers, however, and focused on a subtle but more significant issue; progress should be measured not by salary levels or job titles but by what women are doing from their positions of leadership to influence their community's social and economic future.
Many accomplished women in cities across the country have emerged as powerful and effective leaders in their companies, trade associations, chambers of commerce and union halls.
These women are bringing energy, talents and vision to numerous economic and civic enterprises, working in close partnership with their male peers. They are not only influencing their community's economic future, but have also become important role models for younger women.

HEADLINE: An Incomplete President

 BODY:
Angry Republicans point fingers in every direction to account for President Bush's defeat. Some blame an unfortunate turn in the business cycle from which no President could have escaped. Others blame bad advice from passive economic strategists, the nasty convention in Houston, his unaccountably late and lame campaign.
All true, but the main reason for George Bush's precipitous fall from political grace was George Bush himself. 
 Even after four years as President and a quarter-century in public life, Mr. Bush remains an oddly bifurcated, incomplete figure. He spent the better part of his life preparing for the White House -- and fate dealt him probably the strongest hand in foreign affairs ever awarded a new President.
For the most part, he played that hand cleverly and energetically. But on the home front he was just the reverse, clumsy and irresolute. As the cold war receded, his domestic agenda was exposed as little more than a list of talking points.
His political persona was no less baffling. Capable of kindness and courage, the amiable and well-bred President turned into something quite different on the campaign trail, pinched and shrill.
In the end, voters saw a Presidency without cogency and a President without credibility. His approval rating last May wavered between 35 and 39 percent. His share of the vote total Tuesday was 38 percent.
So hapless was Mr. Bush's last year that it's easy to forget some early accomplishments. He began smartly, moving quickly to end the endless ideological combat of the Reagan years. He broke cleanly with his indifferent predecessor on important environmental issues, faced up to the savings and loan scandal and offered creative new approaches to third world debt.
Of his diplomatic successes, three stand out. Confronted early in his tenure by a crippling debate over Nicaragua, he cut a deal with Congress to send humanitarian but not military aid to the contras -- removing in one stroke an issue that had paralyzed Mr. Reagan's relationship with Capitol Hill.
His ability to orchestrate a collective global response to Iraq's aggression in the Persian Gulf was a greater triumph still. And he deserves great credit for nurturing the continuing peace talks between Arabs and Israelis.
Behind all three successes lay a willingness to muster a principled explanation of his objectives and to exercise the power of his office to achieve them. But on matters closer to home, Mr. Bush vacated the bully pulpit, subcontracting domestic policy to his advisers and leaving the impression that he really didn't care.
Even when he did something that was both essential and courageous -- like reversing his "no new taxes" pledge of 1988 to win a budget agreement in 1990 -- he failed to defend it coherently. Worse, in that case, he apologized for it.
Mr. Bush did get bad advice, especially from those who kept telling him that the economy would turn around. But his own passivity made him vulnerable to that advice. Last January, given a last big chance to establish his economic management, he came up empty. His State of the Union rhetoric was strong: "I look at hard times and make this vow: This will not stand." His programs were pallid.
Mr. Bush did devote time and energy to one domestic cause: romancing the right wing of his party, especially on abortion, civil rights and Supreme Court appointments. Yet it gained him little. For all his supplicatory gestures, the right always suspected him to be an Establishment Republican at heart.
Meantime, his Brahmin friends -- economic conservatives with a social conscience -- felt betrayed by his positions on individual rights and his bargains with the cultural right. Of these, the most exasperating was his willingness to cede the party's 1992 platform, and the Houston stage, to Pat Buchanan's and Pat Robertson's exclusionary anger.
Perhaps, in a second term, freed from the exigencies of politics and popularity, George Bush might have found a clearer sense of direction. Perhaps history will judge him, and his diplomatic record especially, more kindly than the voters did last Tuesday.
The sad judgment for now, however, is that he sailed well at the start, then lost his compass.

HEADLINE: Help the Cities First

SERIES: BILL' LIST: These are the first articles in a occasional series commenting on ideas and issues facing the new Clinton Administration.

BYLINE: By Edmund G. Brown Jr.; Edmund G. Brown Jr., Governor of California from 1974 to 1982, was a 1992 Democratic Presidential candidate.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Dear Mr. President-elect:
Since our last meeting, you have been besieged by many voices. Mine will continue to be for those who have grown silent because they have lost their jobs, because they are poor or because they have no hope. For them, stand and deliver. 
 The specter of "Blade Runner" haunts our cities as global trade and technology separate the professionals at the top from the growing third world of welfare and poverty wages at the bottom. It is ripping apart our social and civic fabric.
This Great Urban Crisis is just as much a threat to our society as the Great Depression. Our second-largest city would not have exploded in burning and insurrection if something was not profoundly wrong. In community after community, the intolerable conditions are worsening: burnt-out buildings, rubble strewn about as small children play nearby, homeless lying in doorways.
This is why the nation's mayors marched on Washington and pleaded all year for their seven-point $35 billion program of urban aid. We sat there together in New York City and you promised them face to face that you would hear their plea.
Many pundits and advisers are now coming forward to tell you to focus on policies to stimulate economic growth and reduce the deficit. That is important. Yet, let me warn you, economic growth by itself will not diminish the crisis tearing at the country.
Look at the facts: since 1973, our national income per capita rose 28 percent while weekly paychecks fell 18 percent. In the past decade alone, the number of young people working full time but paid below the official poverty line doubled. Perversely, the number of jobs and the size of the G.N.P. increased but in ways that dangerously widened the gap between those doing well and those millions of other Americans who are daily thrust into a twilight zone of economic hardship. This growing inequality and social injustice must be the first priority of your Administration.
During the campaign, you repeatedly called attention to the loss of "high-wage jobs" and set forth a plan for "putting people first." In that strategy, you have the elements of a bold and Rooseveltian response. Now you must redeem those campaign promises and pave the way for an entirely different type of economic recovery -- one that is grounded in social justice rather than that "trickle down" you condemned.
More than anything, people are looking for something real. That is why you need to take action right away -- before you are inaugurated.
Call in the mayors this month and tell them you embrace their seven-point agenda completely. During the California primary, you said, "We will find the money." Follow through on your pledge to extend the Earned Income Tax credit to all working families so that they no longer fall below the official poverty level. And ask Congress to raise the minimum wage a dollar in addition to your promise to index it for inflation. These two actions alone would immediately lift up the spirits of those struggling at the very bottom of our society.
Inaugurate your Youth Opportunity Corps, National Service Trust Fund and Community Service jobs. As a start, enroll in the first year at least as many people as have been and will be mustered out of the military. Roosevelt established the Works Projects Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps and a National Youth Administration. There's your $20 billion model -- anything less is politics.
I implore you to block the North American free-trade agreement until you have locked in iron-tight protections for American wage and environmental standards.
Health care, education, tax and campaign reform come next. But first, take care of the core. Listen to the desperate. Rise above the politics of the past. Rise to the trust invested in you.

HEADLINE: Death After Police Beating Inspires Fear in Detroit

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 7

 BODY:
All day, in the cold and the swirling snow, cars carrying people like Florence Frazier and her grandchildren pulled up to the curb in front of a ramshackle two-story building.
"Is this where they killed him?" Mrs. Frazier's 9-year-old grandson, Lawrence Newell, asked today. 
 "Yes," she said, the cold wind and hard facts making her eyes water.
On Thursday night, a 35-year-old, unemployed black man, Malice Green, was beaten to death by police officers here on Warren Avenue on the city's west side after being stopped on suspicion of a drug violation.
Violence is nothing new near the avenue of crumbling buildings, but the death of Mr. Green has shaken the city and turned the curb where he died into a shrine of anger, tears and betrayal.
 
'People Are Numb'
 People here said this was not supposed to happen in this overwhelmingly black city, where the 4,000-person Police Department is more than half black and where Mayor Coleman A. Young has long stressed making the force sensitive to the community.
But the two officers suspected of the killing are white, longtime members of department with reputations for toughness.
"People are numb," Mrs. Frazier said. "It's like who do you lash out at? Who can you trust? I'm having a hard time dealing with another Rodney King incident where my grandson lives, where my son lives. It could have been them."
Her grandson is now scared of the police. "One day," he said, "it will probably be me."
The sharp similarities between the incident and the beating of a black motorist, Rodney G. King, in Los Angeles last year have made city officials and neighborhood advocates nervous. It was the acquittal of four officers in that case that led to rioting in Los Angeles last spring.
What happened exactly and why is still unclear. But the city and the police department have moved quickly to begin an investigation and to maintain calm.
 
'This Is a Dream'
 The police Chief, Stanley Knox, on Friday ordered the two white plainclothes officers, Larry Nevers, 52, and Walter Budzyn, 47, suspended without pay. He also suspended four white officers and one black sergeant who are believed to have seen the beating.
The Detroit Free Press today quoted Officer Nevers as saying: "I must've done something wrong, a guy died. If I can ever sleep again I'm going to wake up and say this is a dream, it didn't happen, it didn't happen."
But he added, "Nobody knows what it's like out there."
Paul Hubbard, the president of New Detroit Inc., an organization formed to rebuild the city after the 1967 riots, said the Chief's quick actions have helped maintain calm.
"The community stayed cool because they felt these officers would be put into the criminal justice system," Mr. Hubbard said. "If the Chief had not immediately taken action, we may have had a problem."
 
Something in His Hand
 A senior police official said the incident began about 10:30 P.M., when Mr. Green dropped a friend off in front of the run-down building, which the police said is a crack house. Moments later, Mr. Green was stopped by Officers Nevers and Budzyn.
When they asked Mr. Green for his driver's license, he reached into his glove compartment, then appeared to hold something in his hand. One of the officers asked him to drop it. Mr. Green did not and the officers began hitting him on the hands with their 3-pound flashlights, the official said.
The struggle quickly escalated and Mr. Green was dragged out of the car. The beating continued as backup police units arrived, and at least one other officer also struck Mr. Green, the official said.
Mr. Green was taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival about 11 P.M.
It is unclear what, if anything, Mr. Green had in his hand. Later, four pieces of crack cocaine were turned in as evidence by one of the officers.
Mr. Green spent most of his life in Detroit and had no police record there. His sister, Sherry Green, said he worked for a time in a steel mill near Chicago. At the time of his death he was preparing to move to North Carolina where his wife lives.
Mr. Green's mother, Patricia, said her son "was a gentle man."
Mrs. Green said she had driven by the curb twice since he died. One time she stopped and got out.
"His blood was still in the street," she said. "It was like somebody had run over a cow. I don't think he even had a good bone left in his body after they got through beating him."
Today, the blood had been covered with sand, but bloody rags were still visible and so was anger.
"The neighborhood is upset," said Dossa Merchant, 55. "People, young people, talking about burning again like they did before unless something is done about it. They're very serious."
Clayton Smith, a Baptist minister, walked by carrying his daughter. His older children had asked him to bring them to the curb.
"I thought we had made it a little further than this as a city and a country," Mr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: European Is Hopeful Trade War Can Be Averted

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HATFIELD, England, Nov. 7

 BODY:
The European Community's chief trade negotiator said today that he was confident that Europe and the United States could settle a dispute over farm subsidies that threatens to turn into a trade war. But France continued to plan for possible retaliation.
The community's Trade Commissioner, Frans Andriessen, speaking after a two-day meeting of trade ministers from the 12 community countries, said he had no plans to meet with negotiators from the United States. But he said further developments could come on Monday after a meeting of community foreign ministers.. 
 Mr. Andriessen said he was optimistic that an agreement could be reached by Dec. 6, the day that Washington has threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on some European products, mainly white wine.
Germany's Economics Minister, Jurgen Mollemann, who attended the meeting of trade officials outside London, said Prime Minister John Major of Britain, President Bush and the president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, should meet if the trade talks fail.
Talks between the United States and the community broke down on Tuesday in Chicago, and on Thursday the United States fired the first salvo in what could become a trade war. Washington said it would impose the punitive tariffs within 30 days on $300 million worth of French wines and other imports if the community refused to reduce payments to farmers.
France, Europe's biggest farm producer, opposes efforts to cut agriculture payments to the extent demanded by the United States. French farmers are viewed as a powerful constituency, and France's Socialist Government is worried about how the party will fare in legislative elections in March.
The farm subsidy dispute is also the main obstacle delaying a 105-nation accord on liberalizing world trade sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. The organization has called an emergency meeting for Tuesday in Geneva, where it is based. Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and other nations have pleaded with the French for a compromise.
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, France's Industry and External Trade Minister, said his Government would not act for a month, but could demand retaliatory measures if the United States acted. In an interview in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, he said France would ask the community to start drawing up a list of potential American products on Monday. Excerpts from the interview were made available ahead of the paper's publication on Sunday.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn said that at least three other community nations -- Ireland, Belgium and Spain -- would support retaliation but that Germany and Britain opposed it, arguing that a global trade battle could further cripple recession-bound economies.
Trade between the United States and Europe amounts to roughly $200 billion each year, and a trade war could threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.
The United States Agriculture Secretary, Edward R. Madigan, told BBC radio today that the two sides remained far apart.
"I must have an honorable deal, a responsible deal and a deal that is going to be perceived as being fair to the entire world, and we are not anywhere near that," Mr. Madigan said.
Washington says the subsidies keep prices for European farm goods unfairly low and rob American farmers of export sales. France says deeper cuts could drive many of its small farmers out of business.
Despite the seeming firmness of both sides, Mr. Andriessen said: "I remain optimistic for two reasons. The first is that I think the differences in view, although not insubstantial, could be bridged. And secondly, because we are not entitled -- the commission, nor the United States -- to make a failure."
Mr. Major said Friday after meeting with Mr. Delors of the European Commission that they agreed the talks should resume "without delay."

HEADLINE: Jordan's King Urges Iraqis to Put an End To the Hussein Era

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 7

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan said today that Iraq was suffering badly under sanctions imposed by the United Nations and suggested it was time for Iraqis to end the Government of President Saddam Hussein and push for a democratic, pluralistic society.
Although the King did not specifically call for Iraqis to overthrow their President, he provided a bleak description of conditions in Iraq and an unusually caustic assessment of the man he long viewed as his friend and ally and actively supported during the Persian Gulf war and in its aftermath. The King did not directly refer to the Iraqi ruler by name. 
 "I think that the situation cannot last for very long in any event, and I think that there is every need for the Iraqi people themselves to put an end to it," the King said, speaking at his palace office in the capital.
He added that there was also a need "for all of us to see what can be done to see Iraq recover its territorial integrity and the unity of its people under conditions of freedom of choice and for them to be able to move ahead."
The King's remarks were a significant departure from his silence in recent months as the United States and other Western nations have stepped up pressure on Iraq, tightening economic sanctions, intensifying inspection missions and barring Iraqi aircraft from specific zones in northern and southern Iraq.
The remarks by the King could well be be a psychological blow to Mr. Hussein because Jordan is the last neighbor with which Iraq has a relationship. Over the last year, it has become increasingly clear to Jordanian decision makers that Iraq's strategic value as a major commercial outlet and a significant military power has evaporated under the weight of sanctions and military defeat.
Furthermore, senior Jordanian officials eager to bring about an Arab reconciliation that would benefit Jordan appreciate now that key Arab countries like Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia would not agree to include President Hussein's Government in a reconciled Arab world.
 Some in the West maintain that Mr. Hussein has been able to circumvent the sanctions and keep the country going, but the King's remarks seemed to give a totally opposite view. During the Persian Gulf war, the King was widely criticized in the West and by some Arab leaders for his sympathy toward Iraq.
King Hussein said he felt enormous sympathy for Iraqis because of their country's deteriorating situation.
Speaking of his onetime Iraqi allies, he added, "Some people may say I have no right to speak in this tone, but this is something I have felt very, very strongly, and I haven't hidden it from the Iraqi people."
 
Tells Jordan of Cancer
 He said he was speaking out because "one cannot look at the suffering of people, at the damage to an upcoming generation in terms of all their needs and the continuous deterioration of that country to the point where it has been turned gradually into a pre-industrial state."
King Hussein looked fit and relaxed in what was his first interview after his report to the nation on Thursday that he had undergone treatment for cancer at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., in September and that, although he had been cured, he would need further checkups.
The King's left ureter, a duct that carries urine from a kidney to the bladder, was found to be cancerous and it and a kidney were removed. He said today that he had recovered speedily.
"My health is fine, and they are thrilled that my progress since the surgery has been excellent," he said of his doctors. "I have been able to come back to work much quicker than anticipated before. It was quite a major surgery, but nevertheless I have done very well. I think the surgery was successful. They were optimistic they have dealt with the problem; however, it was their view that there should be regular checkups.
 
Sense of Urgency Noted
 The King also expressed optimism that the peace talks with Israel were progressing well.
He declined to give details of the agreement reached with the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, that the goal of the two countries is a formal peace treaty within the framework of a comprehensive Israeli-Arab settlement. The King described it as a positive development that Jordan planned to pursue in future talks.
"I have always been guardedly optimistic," the King said. "But I believe there is a sense of urgency there as there is here and there must be everywhere. Things are certainly moving, and hopefully in the right direction."
Offering indirect praise for Israel's recent negotiating stance, he added, "I think that we saw a sign that was very clear as far as I was concerned with the Israeli elections when the Israeli electorate decided on a change to move toward peace and commit toward it and this, in itself, is probably a major turning point or has been."
King Hussein warmly praised President Bush, describing him as a friend and predicting that the bitter Arab divisions engendered by the Persian Gulf war, which divided the Arab camp between supporters and opponents of Iraq, might soon come to an end with a summit meeting of Arab leaders.
The King said he had sent a congratulatory message to President-elect Bill Clinton but had not yet spoken to him. He added that he expected the new President to continue American involvement in the region and the peace talks because of the United States role as the "one and only superpower."
 
Important New Assessment
 The King's remarks were significant because of the widespread sentiment here that Iraq is putting up a valiant resistance to the accumulating hardships and that it can resist these pressures for an indefinite period.
Because of his friendship with the Iraqi leaders and the extensive network of ties between Jordanian and Iraqi business establishments, King Hussein's comments are likely to be taken as an important new assessment of a situation that is difficult for outsiders to evaluate.
The King emphasized that his vision of a future Iraq was one of a society that differed radically from the current one-party rule of President Hussein.
"What do we wish for Iraq? What we have always wished, a national reconciliation, pluralism, democracy, respect for human rights and then for the Iraqis to harness the tremendous assets that they have toward building a country that is stable and that has a place under the sun as it did in the past".
These comments, coming from one of the few Arab leaders to have instituted tentative measures of democratization here over the last three years, are likely to be seen in the Arab world as a challenge to other totalitarian regimes as well.
The Jordanian program of democratization, which the King said was continuing, encompassed the first free parliamentary elections here and a liberalization of press censorship.
Returning to his new theme of opposing dictatorships in the region, he mused that it "is such as pity that I have lived through this Arab nation to see time and again tragedies occur when people believe that life begins with them and as if it ends with them."
"This doesn't reflect upon them only but it reflects upon their people as well. That's where, hopefully, in the future, we will see greater democracy and greater power-sharing and therefore stability and continuity."

HEADLINE: Europe's State-Industry Ties: Successes, and Utter Failures

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 7

 BODY:
In 1969, a discussion began in Germany between the Government and industry about the development of a train without wheels, powered by electromagnets. After an investment of $1 billion of German taxpayers' money, the Transrapid train is now ready for use; its first route may be between the Orlando, Fla., airport and Disney World in 1996.
It is too early to say whether the Transrapid, which travels at 180 miles an hour, will be a commercial success. But the development of this relatively quiet, fast and ecologically desirable train illustrates the way in which governments and private companies have frequently worked together in Europe on innovative but costly industrial projects. 
 "This train was such a long-term development that it would not have been possible without public money," said Christian Rausch, an official at Thyssen Henschel, the leading company in the development of the train. "No private company could have carried the costs over 23 years."
 
The Question: Does It Work?
 With President-elect Bill Clinton talking admiringly about aspects of Europe's industrial policy and advocating a strengthened role for the Government in technological research and worker training, the question arises: Has European industrial policy worked, or has it largely consisted of the protection and financial support of businesses and projects that would have collapsed without Government money?
During the Reagan and Bush years there was little doubt in Washington as to the answer: European industrial policy was protectionism or worse.
In fact, the European record is distinctly mixed, with industrial successes and humiliating disasters in roughly equal measure. There was the Concorde, the British-French supersonic plane that was a commercial flop, and Airbus, the dynamic four-nation consortium that -- after receiving $26 billion in government money -- now has captured more than one-third of the world aircraft market.
The most centrally directed economy in Europe is in France, where about 33 percent of industry is under Government guidance. France is now widely regarded as having the Continent's strongest economy, with low inflation, a balanced budget, a big trade surplus and comparatively resilient growth.
"The Clinton victory shows that we were right not to fall into the dogmatic, laissez-faire craziness of the Reagan years," the Finance Minister of France, Michel Sapin, said in an interview. "We have always felt the state had a big role to play, even if that role could change."
France has indeed been modifying the Government's role in recent years, selling shares in some state companies, doing away with exchange controls and reducing central planning. Its shift has been in line with a marked change in European industrial policy over the last decade, as Europe's emerging single market has brought pressure for greater competitiveness.
"We have tried to use this old-fashioned expression -- industrial policy -- and fill it with new content," said Reinhard Buscher, a senior official of the European Commuity's Executive Commission in Brussels. "The old style of subsidies, quotas, insistence on local content and other protective measures is over and finished. There is no alternative to being competitive, but you can set guidelines and policies to encourage that."
The priorities of the emerging European policy sound remarkably like "Clintonomics": professional training, technological research and development, and the coordinated establishment of ambitious public targets in areas like transport, the environment and telecommunications, combined with fiscal incentives and other measures to encourage industries in these sectors to invest.
What seems to have been widely recognized in Europe is that industrial policy has a role to play in setting broad guidelines, in modernizing core industries and in financing certain long-term projects of special public interest, but that it should not get involved in bailing out losers.
 
Not Following Japan
 It is also clear that Europe has rejected the model of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which sets targets for certain key sectors. Thus there has been no centrally coordinated attempt to streamline the troubled auto or computer sectors by forcing mergers that would probably make sound business sense.
As a whole, the current policies are described as "horizontal," to distinguish them from the old "vertical" practice of pouring money into one particular industrial sector.
One example is the $180 billion high-speed train network being built around Europe, known as the T.G.V., for Train a Grande Vitesse, or very fast train. This project, unrelated to Germany's magnetic train, is being coordinated and financially backed by the European Community.
Having begun as separate developments in different countries, each with a different standard, the network is now being standardized and extended across borders. Smaller countries, like Belgium, get hundreds of millions of dollars from the Community's $85.8 billion annual budget to build their sections of a project that would otherwise be financially impossible for them.
"European industry will clearly benefit both directly from the construction and later from the network that will result," said Jean Hourcade, an official overseeing the project at the European Commission.
 
Frictions Over Trade
 European subsidies are, of course, a matter of dispute in trade relations between Europe and the United States. Just this week, Washington imposed punitive tariffs on white wine and other products from Europe, arguing that European oilseed subsidies unfairly denied markets to American farmers. And the American aircraft industry has long argued that Airbus can compete unfairly because of the subsidies it receives.
European officials counter that the American military-industrial complex has for decades acted as a hidden source of subsidies for a range of industries, serving as the chief vehicle of an industrial policy that was not openly declared. They also say that American farmers receive as many subsidies as those working the land in Europe.
For every success like the T.G.V., however, there is a skeleton in Europe's industrial closet. The European computer industry has been piling up huge losses in recent years and, in some instances, various national governments have continued to pour money into uncompetitive enterprises. They contend that this is sound industrial policy.
The worst offender has been France, where the state-owned computer maker Groupe Bull S.A. has lost more than $1.5 billion in the last two years alone. One change of strategy has followed another, but there is as yet no sign of the company's breaking even. Still, this year the European Commission approved a $1.3 billion subsidy from the French Government to the company in the hope that it would soon return to profit.
 
Supporting French Computers
 "Policy at Bull has not been an error, because France still has a computer industry, and that is vital," the Industry Minister of France, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said. "Our problems have not been any different from a private company like Siemens, because there is a worldwide crisis in the sector."
Yet the French policy at Bull smacks of the approach that has left Europe littered with perennially unprofitable industries in coal, steel, shipbuilding and other lines, all sustained by government money.
On another front, the French Government last year decided to merge the loss-plagued consumer electronics and semiconductor activities of Thomson with the profitable nonmilitary operations of its Atomic Energy Commission. Both entities are owned by the state, and what France seemed to be doing was fusing a highly successful example of industrial policy -- the Atomic Energy Commission's 56 nuclear plants provide more than 80 percent of France's electricity -- with a struggling and unrelated state industry, merely to shore up the latter.
"It was an example of the old and bad style of interventionist industrial policy," said Mr. Buscher of the European Commission. France argued that the merger would allow Thomson and the agency to draw from each other's research activities.
Similarly, the European Community has insisted on forging ahead with its own analog system for high-definition television -- a technology that provides picture clarity similar to that of film. Almost all industry analysts believe the American digital system is superior and should eventually be adopted worldwide. Here again, industrial policy looks suspiciously like protectionism.
But over all, it seems that Europe's integration is producing a steady modernization of the concept of industrial policy. And it is this new, improved version, based largely on German practice, that inspires Mr. Clinton and his advisers.
"There is certainly a Continental European platform to Mr. Clinton's agenda, when it comes to the retraining of workers, education programs, infrastructure networks and a stronger safety net," said David Hale, the chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, who has contacts with many of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers. "But nobody's talking about subsidizing industry or creating state industries."
 
Creating a Compromise
 Over all, as the European Community has come together, it seems that the clash of the more free-market cultures, like Britain and the Netherlands, with the more directed economies, like those of France and Italy, has defined the shifts in development of industrial policy and shaped a compromise.
Roughly at the halfway point stands Germany, whose economy has been basically free market but has allowed the state to play a role in promoting the general good.
"When we think there is an industrial project that is beyond the financial horizon of private companies, like the magnetic train, but that can bring real social benefits, we will back it," said Walter Moenig, spokesman for the German Research and Development Ministry, which has an annual budget of $6.3 billion.
But criteria are strict, and a recent discussion at the ministry on whether to put Government money into developing the next generation of microchips ended with a rejection because it was felt private industry had the means to do so.

HEADLINE: 2 Reports Find Wide Abuses by India in Kashmir

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
A new Indian Government drive on separatists in the Kashmir Valley has resulted in dozens of killings of suspected militants by military forces and the widespread terrorizing of civilians, according to two American human-rights organizations that sent representatives to the area in October.
A military campaign called Operation Tiger, which began in August, has also resulted in the sexual abuse and murder of noncombatants, a preliminary report from Asia Watch and Physicians for Human Rights concludes. It says that patients are dragged from hospital beds and medical staff detained and assaulted in raids. 
"Detainees are routinely subjected to severe and prolonged beatings, electric shock and other forms of torture," the report says. "The Asia Watch-P.H.R. team documented a number of cases of renal failure caused by the extensive use of the roller torture treatment, which crushes the muscle tissue and releases toxins, which cause serious, and sometimes fatal, damage to the kidneys."
A final version of the report will be published before the end of the year, according to Asia Watch.
An armed rebellion has been growing in the Kashmir Valley since 1989, prompting harsh retaliatory measures from New Delhi, which accuses Pakistan of fomenting terrorism in the disputed territory. Kashmir has been under martial law since 1990, with all civil rights suspended and troops empowered to shoot on sight during curfews.
Indian officials argue that much of the violence in the region is caused by the militants and that all allegations of military abuses are investigated. They say that human-rights groups do not adequately condemn violence by militants.
Kashmiris are predominantly Muslim, and most Indians are Hindu, but the dispute is not a religious one. It has its roots in political and economic alienation, residents of the valley say. The separatists have wide middle-class support as well as the backing of virtually all political factions in neighboring Pakistan, which has controlled another part of the former princely state of Kashmir since 1947.
The State Department's 1991 human-right reports said that while militants also were responsible for abuses, there was evidence that troops were killing suspects and detainees.
"Little is done to punish those responsible for extrajudicial killing," the State Department said.
It also found official abuses in Punjab state, where Sikhs are fighting New Delhi.
Although the Indian Government bars official visits to Kashmir by international rights organizations, representatives from Asia Watch and Physicians for Human Rights were able to travel in the valley as tourists for a week, interviewing victims or relatives of security operations in Srinagar, the Kashmiri summer capital, and other towns.
"In one case, four students who were arrested during a search operation on Oct. 14 in the Dal Gate area of Srinagar were shot dead that night and their bodies handed over to the families the next day," according to the preliminary report made available to The New York Times. "The security forces also broke up peaceful protests against these killings by beating, tear-gassing and shooting demonstrators."
Among other incidents investigated by the two organizations' representatives were these:
On Oct. 1, after an attack by militants on a patrol near the village of Bathekut, in which one soldier died, troops "rampaged through the village, killing 10 villagers, raping 4 women and burning houses and grain stores."
On Oct. 15, a man and woman were burned alive in the town of Badsagam after Border Security Forces troops locked them in their shop and set fire to it.
In a search operation by an army unit near Shopian, also on Oct. 15, eight women and an 11-year-old girl were raped, the human-rights groups were told.
"Throughout the conflict, the Indian Army and other security forces in Kashmir continued to exhibit blatant disregard for international norms of medical neutrality," the report says.

HEADLINE: Cuban Says Next Chief Shouldn't Be an Exile

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
A young leader of Cuba's human rights movement on his first visit to the United States says a new generation of Cubans looking toward a more democratic future wants to choose a national leader from within their society, not from among the exiles in Miami.
In what amounted to a message to those exiles who might be positioning themselves for political power after Fidel Castro leaves the scene, the rights leader, Sebastian Arcos Cazabon, said at a news conference on Friday that his contemporaries "want mostly economic support from Miami." 
 "But they know they will have to choose their leaders from inside," he said. Mr. Arcos, 31 years old, who is active in the Cuban Committee for Human Rights, added that a democratic election would and should be won by a Cuban citizen.
"In Cuba, the need for change is so overwhelming that everyone is thinking about the future," he said.
Neither the supporters of Mr. Castro nor his longtime adversaries seem relevant to a new post-cold-war era, Mr. Arcos has told his American hosts, according to Frank Calzon, Washington director of Freedom House, the human-rights organization. Mr. Calzon, who was born in Cuba, broke several years ago with the Cuban American Foundation of Jorge Mas Canosa, the Miami exiles' most powerful and most conservative leader.
"Young people no longer care about 1959 and the revolution, an important time to both the exiles and the supporters of Castro," Mr. Calzon said.
Mr. Arcos, who had been applying since 1986 to leave Cuba legally with the intention of returning, is a member of a prominent Cuban family that first backed the Castro revolution but has moved into opposition over the years.
His father, Sebastian Arcos Bergnes, who joined Mr. Castro in the 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks, a milestone of the revolution, later served an Ambassador for the Castro Government in Europe.
A few weeks ago he was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison on charges of disseminating enemy propaganda. The elder Mr. Arcos had been communicating with the United Nations and its special human rights rapporteur for Cuba. At his trial, Mr. Arcos was accused of accepting money from the United States National Endowment for Democracy, an accusation his son denied.
Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, the elder Mr. Arcos's brother and general secretary of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights, is widely considered a potential political opposition leader if Cuba's closed Communist system is opened to other parties.
The younger Mr. Arcos, who does not know why he was permitted to make this trip abroad, said on Friday that the Cuban human rights and democracy movements were seeking support from the international community beyond the United States, Mr. Castro's traditional foe. He said that while Latin American presidents had apparently spoken to Mr. Castro privately about political liberalization, they would have to say so publicly to have an effect on the Communist leadership.
Facing an economic crisis so severe that many Cubans are reduced to one daily meal of beans, rice and eggs, Mr. Castro has apparently decided not to debate the international human rights organizations, Mr. Arcos said. The Cuban leader has decided instead to try to isolate Cuba by curtailing international direct telephone communications and stepping up interceptions of local calls, making it difficult for local human rights groups to collect information and send it abroad.
Mr. Arcos said that despite a new wave of arrests and harassment over the last year, human rights organizations are growing in Cuba and spreading from the intellectual circle of Havana to small towns throughout the island. "Our leaders are mostly older people who fought against Batista," Mr. Arcos said. "We have intellectuals, even professors of Marxism."
Young Cubans of both African and European descent are now joining the ranks, he said, carrying the movement beyond Havana and those "who understand politics."

HEADLINE: RUSSIANS PLANNING TO CONTINUE USING FAULTED REACTORS

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Senior Russian nuclear officials have told a watchdog group of Western experts that Russia's notorious graphite-core nuclear reactors -- the kind that blew up at Chernobyl in 1986 -- will go on operating indefinitely. If the West wants to make them safer, it can help to pay for improvements, but in any case, the reactors will not be shut down.
The official United States position on these reactors has strongly opposed their continued operation, and has sought to discourage or bar financing of measures that would prolong the reactors' lives. 
 But American and European technical experts acknowledged at the meeting of the watchdog group this week that this position is unrealistic, and that the former Communist countries using the reactors should get all the help the West can afford, since the reactors are essential to the faltering economies of Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic countries.
 
Nuclear Experts Meet
 At the meeting sponsored by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency that ended here on Thursday, nuclear experts from nine Western countries conferred with senior nuclear power officials of the former Soviet Union on the safety of Soviet reactors of the Chernobyl type.
Of 62 Soviet-designed reactors operating in the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe, 47 are pressurized-water reactors similar in principle to most American types. American experts believe that although some of the older pressurized-water reactors could be made reasonably safe, all 15 of the Chernobyl-style reactors, called R.B.M.K.'s, should be scrapped without delay.
The R.B.M.K.'s are seen as threats not only to their operating crews and nearby communities, but also to much of Western Europe. Millions of Europeans were exposed to fallout from the Chernobyl disaster, possibly suffering long-term health effects, and many Western experts believe that it could happen again.
 
Larger Stakes Seen
 Moreover, the future of nuclear energy itself could be at stake. "All of us here are acutely aware "that another serious nuclear accident could doom nuclear power everywhere, with immense economic consequences for many nations," said Dr. James Guppy of Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island.
Realizing that it is unrealistic to expect the R.B.M.K.'s to be shut down in the near future, organizers called this week's meeting to review Russian documentation that significant steps have been taken or are planned by Russian administrators to make the reactors safer. Although neither the Atomic Energy Agency nor the experts it invited to the meeting have regulatory authority over the Russian reactors, their opinions carry weight with international lending agencies from which the Commonwealth of Independent States is seeking assistance. Some of these agencies insist on enhancement of nuclear power plant safety as a condition for granting credit to the commonwealth.
Western experts who spent the week reviewing mountains of Russian technical reports and data were impressed by the scope of measures adopted or in progress to enhance the safety of R.B.M.K.'s.
Some of the improvements adopted by the Russian engineers seemed almost ridiculously simple. One change was in the "scram" button used in the reactors -- the button that stops the reactor in an emergency. Before Chernobyl, an operator had to keep his finger on this red button for up to a minute to complete the reactor shutdown, but now the scram is completed by just pushing the button and releasing it.
The Western engineers "applauded" this change, as they did scores of others, including a change in the enrichment of the uranium fuel to reduce the chance of a runaway chain reaction. The Russians explained that they had also drastically modified the design of R.B.M.K. control rods -- which, when inserted into a reactor core, slow and stop the reaction.
But the consensus of Western experts was that the R.B.M.K. (for Reactor, Big Power, Channel Type in Russian) has inherent design flaws, and probably never can be made as safe as the best Western reactors.
 
Disagreement
Internal Disputes In Ex-Soviet Union
 The Russians sharply disagreed. The newest and safest versions of the R.B.M.K. are on a par with the most reliable reactors in the West, they said, and have some significant advantages over Western counterparts.
"We have had 40 years' experience with these reactors," said Dr. Eugene O. Adamov, who, as chairman of Russia's Research and Development Institute of Power Engineering, is his country's top nuclear-power official.
"Like your Western reactors," he said in an interview, "our oldest ones are the least safe. But development is an evolutionary process, and our newest R.B.M.K. designs, we believe, are the safest and best reactors in the world. We certainly intend to pursue R.B.M.K. development."
The people and political leaders of the former Soviet Union do not necessarily share Dr. Adamov's enthusiasm for the reactors. The Ukrainian Parliament has ruled that next year at the latest, the functioning reactors at Chernobyl must be shut down, along with Chernobyl's Unit 4, which has been buried in concrete since it blew up in 1986, and Unit 2, which closed down last year after a very dangerous fire.
But the Ukrainian Government faces problems far more pressing then nuclear safety. On Thursday, Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma told reporters in Kiev that if his nation could not quickly stabilize its economy, "we will face a major social explosion." More than 25 percent of the Ukraine's electricity is nuclear -- some of it from Chernobyl's two surviving reactors -- and the country could ill afford the loss of power.
"Chernobyl's two remaining reactors could safely continue indefinitely," Dr. Adamov said. "The decision to close them was political, not technical."
 
The West
Foreign Critics Show Anxiety
 Dr. Ivan Selin, director of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is among the many foreign critics of the R.B.M.K. toward whom Dr. Adamov addressed some of his comments.
"Selin told me when he visited us that he just doesn't like R.B.M.K. reactors on principle," Dr. Adamov said, "but that's like saying you don't like the looks of a woman. It's an emotional reaction, not a scientific assessment. The R.B.M.K. is a type of reactor that is not understood in the West, and we can't explain all the technical details of the R.B.M.K. to your officials overnight.
"It's true that we need help from the West, especially in the form of trade, but instead you've been sending us lawyers who come just to condemn our reactors," Dr. Adamov said.
To emphasize his faith in the R.B.M.K. -- including the reactors at Chernobyl -- Dr. Adamov invited the entire group meeting here to reconvene in Chernobyl next February.
The affection of Russian nuclear officials for the reactor causes considerable anxiety to many Europeans who might be downwind of radioactive fallout from a future disaster. Sweden in particular, where much of Chernobyl's fallout landed in 1986, is investigating the safety of the reactors on its own, and is expected to issue a detailed report next spring. Many Scandinavians are fearful of some new R.B.M.K. accident, like the one last March at the Sosnovy Bor plant near St. Petersburg (which leaked radioactive gases), or at the Ignalina plant in Lithuania (the largest of all R.B.M.K. plants) which has had a series of minor accidents -- or at Chernobyl itself, where contamination by radioactive debris and operating problems persist.
Moreover, despite many recent improvements in the reactor, Western experts have decided that this type of reactor is even more inherently dangerous than they were led to believe during the first few years following the Chernobyl disaster.
Just after the Chernobyl accident, Soviet authorities ascribed the blame to plant operators, who supposedly took unauthorized steps during an experiment with Chernobyl's steam turbines. Human error rather than design flaws was chiefly responsible for the disaster, Moscow asserted, and this explanation was widely accepted by Western experts.
But new evidence has come to light, said Dr. Ahmed Karbassioun of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that suggests the R.B.M.K. design was at least as much to blame as operator bungling. Part of this evidence was a letter sent in March last year to the agency's director, Dr. Hans Blix, by Anatoly Stepanovich Dyatlov, who was the chief engineer in the Chernobyl control room on the night of the disaster on April 26, 1986.
Mr. Dyatlov was one of six Soviet reactor officials sent to prison for their supposed blunders. But after his release, Mr. Dyatlov complained in his letter to Dr. Blix that he and the other convicted operators had been scapegoats, and that nothing they did violated Chernobyl's operating rules or the procedures for which they were trained. The fault, Mr. Dyatlov said, was in the vague and uncoordinated administrative system of the Soviet nuclear power authority, including a lack of communication between safety officials, as well as the flawed design of the R.B.M.K. itself.
The testimony of Mr. Dyatlov and others prompted a major review by the Atomic Energy Agency of its original assessment of the Chernobyl accident, the results of which have just been disclosed. The agency's new report substantiates some of Mr. Dyatlov's charges, and places much more blame on the R.B.M.K. design than did its 1986 assessment.
Dr. Adamov sharply disagrees with the agency's new criticism of R.B.M.K. design. "Dyatlov was in charge that night, and he was criminally responsible for the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster," he said.
 
History
 Soviet Secrecy Produces Suspicion
 Traditional Western suspicion of the R.B.M.K. is partly the result of longstanding Soviet secrecy concerning its technical details, details that only now are fully available to Western examination.
The Soviet R.B.M.K. is the descendant of a family of military reactors designed partly to produce plutonium as bomb fuel. Unlike commercial power reactors in the United States, the reactor's core is a huge graphite block into which a myriad of holes is drilled.
Graphite, a form of carbon, serves as a "moderator" in these reactors; it slows down neutrons that spew from spontaneously splitting uranium atoms so these neutrons can readily combine with other uranium atoms and hasten the fission process. This is called a nuclear chain reaction. If it happens suddenly the result is a nuclear explosion; in a reactor, the chain reaction is slowed down to produce useful heat.
Some 1,690 of the holes in an R.B.M.K. graphite core hold fuel rods, hollow metal rods filled with enriched uranium fuel, which are embedded in "channels" through which boiling water and steam normally flow, cooling the reactor core and carrying away useful heat. The steam, heated by nuclear fission in the fuel rods, drives turbines that power electric generators.
A strength of the R.B.M.K. not shared by other reactors is that it can be refueled while it operates, thereby reducing shut-down time. Each channel is independently loaded and serviced, and an average of one fuel channel is reloaded every day.
Another set of holes in the graphite core of the reactor is designed to accommodate control rods, rods made mostly of boron. When a reactor's control rods are fully inserted, they instantly bleed away so many neutrons that the fission chain reaction quickly slows and stops, a process known as a scram.
But because the Chernobyl control rods were tipped with graphite, which the Russians admit was a design failure, their insertion initially caused a surge of power rather than a reduction. Moreover, the water flow to the core had been turned off the night of the disaster, and a dangerous peculiarity of the R.B.M.K. reactor is that when it is drained of liquid water, the chain reaction can speed up; in Western reactors, a loss of water stops the chain reaction and shuts down the reactor.
Dr. Adamov's team members said they had cured this deficiency by increasing the level of enrichment in R.B.M.K. fuel from 2.0 percent uranium-235 to 2.4 percent. The added enrichment requires compensations in the controls that reduce or eliminate the reactor's tendency to speed up when water is not flowing.
Dr. Adamov said the R.B.M.K.'s control rods had been lengthened to make them more effective, and their insertion mechanism has been greatly speeded up, so that insertion can be completed in about 2.5 seconds instead of the 19 seconds it formerly took.
 
Concerns
Western Experts Remain Worried
 Scientists here approve of the change in enrichment, but call the complicated piping system inside the R.B.M.K. "a plumber's nightmare." Much of the piping lies buried in inaccessible channels within the core, where it cannot be easily inspected.
The possibility that one or more of these steam pipes could break open also worries experts. If several high-pressure pipes were to give way simultaneously (which probably happened in the 1986 disaster), their combined steam pressure might be enough to blow the top off the reactor and expose the entire core -- a development that would produce another Chernobyl disaster.
Perhaps worst of all, Western engineers say, is the lack of a "containment" surrounding either the R.B.M.K. reactors or older versions of the Soviet pressurized-water reactors called V.V.E.R.-440/230s.
Western reactors are fully enclosed in reinforced concrete housings designed to contain radioactive debris even if an explosion occurs. Some Soviet reactors are equipped with "bubbler towers" to remove radioactive matter from escaping gas, but the R.B.M.K.'s and the old pressurized-water reactors can vent dangerously radioactive substances directly into the atmosphere.
But Dr. Adamov adamantly defends his country's general approach to reactor design, if not its safety failures.
"During this week I've seen how difficult it is for Westerners to understand our channel reactors. We've tried to explain our modernization process, but outsiders really need two or three years experience with our reactors to judge them fairly."
He grimly added: "Reagan and Bush set out to destroy the 'Evil Empire,' and they succeeded. Now it seems you want to destroy our economy as well. There's nothing wrong with our reactors that some economic help in the form of better trade terms won't solve, but instead you seem to want to close us down. What we need from you is medicine for the illness, not just the symptoms."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Foreign Policy;
PROBLEMS ABROAD MAY FORCE CLINTON TO CHANGE AGENDA

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
While President-elect Bill Clinton puts together an Administration devoted to keeping his promises on domestic affairs, the outgoing Bush team is leaving him with a series of problems abroad that could force him to devote much more time than he had planned to foreign policy.
Now that they are on their way out, some Bush Administration officials concede that there has been very little top-level focus, direction or Presidential political capital expended on foreign policy since former Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and President Bush went on the campaign trail last summer.
 
Stalled and Broken Talks
 Partly because of the absence of such high-level American attention, several sets of negotiations have stalled or broken down and some trouble spots around the world have worsened. Subordinates of Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker have continued to work on these problems, from arms control talks with Moscow to the Arab-Israeli peace process. 
 But Bush Administration officials said that without the attention of the President and the Secretary of State, who kept the reins of foreign policy tightly in their own hands, lower-level officials were not being taken as seriously abroad.
"It was obvious to a lot of people abroad that the Administration was not engaged in foreign policy at a level that was politically significant," said a senior Administration policy maker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The President was not paying much attention to foreign affairs, and the only other guy with clout was Baker, and he was otherwise engaged.
"The perception of the outside world was that things here were on hold, and that perception created a different reality. It gave some people who wanted to redirect or redefine things in their area an opportunity."
 
Series of Problems
 President Bush still has time to refocus on foreign affairs, but for now, Administration officials point to a series of diplomatic problems that worsened during the campaign:
*Backpedaling by the Russians on their commitments with Mr. Bush last June to destroy SS-18 intercontinental nuclear missile silos and some other multiple-warhead missiles as part of the follow-on agreement to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Had he not been distracted, Mr. Bush would almost certainly have sent Mr. Baker to Moscow to get the agreement back on track.
*Turkey is close to a decision to stop allowing its bases to be used by the United States to support the no-flight zone over northern Iraq and relief operations for the Kurds. Without Turkey, a Clinton Administration would have much less room to maneuver against any new Iraqi military threat.
*The Arab-Israeli peace talks have stalled because high-level American pressure, which all the parties need as an excuse for making concessions to one another, has vanished.
At the same time, while the nation was focused on the election, several new problems that were hidden beneath the surface have erupted, including a potential trade war with Europe. Mr. Clinton said during the campaign that he favored retaliating against countries that closed their markets to American exports, but he has refrained from commenting now to avoid complicating the matter for Mr. Bush.
In addition, the Khmer Rouge are threatening to scuttle the United Nations election plan in Cambodia, which the Bush team helped to forge; there has been a new surge of Haitian boat people, and the civil war in Angola, which Washington and Moscow helped to settle, has resumed because Jonas Savimbi, the rebel leader who had been supported by the United States, was unhappy that his party lost the recent election.
 
The Challenge: Finding Continuity
 This is the backdrop against which Mr. Clinton will arrive in Washington. While Mr. Clinton used his first public statement the morning after the election to emphasize his intention to maintain continuity in American foreign policy, his advisers are beginning to realize that, in several major areas, there may be little continuity to build on. In many areas they could be plugging into a broken socket.
As a result, it is likely that Mr. Clinton's untested instincts in foreign policy and crisis management will be challenged as quickly as his well-honed instincts in domestic policy, if not sooner.
Lyndon B. Johnson wanted to hold the world at bay until he built the Great Society at home, but his prosecution of the Vietnam War would not let him. Mr. Clinton is not so naive as to think he can keep the world at bay, aides say, but they insist he can juggle both foreign and domestic affairs. That will depend, however, on the nature of the problems that arise abroad, and whether they are of the boilerplate variety or those that will require the sustained attention of the President.
"Congress may gave Clinton a honeymoon, but the world will not," said Joshua Muravchik, a foreign policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, who has written several policy papers for Mr. Clinton.
For now, his advisers say, Mr. Clinton plans to continue the basic approaches of the Bush Administration in the Persian Gulf, Arab-Israeli peace talks, Cambodia and in the still incomplete arms negotiations with Russia.
They say he wants to move away from the Bush policies on China, where he intends to be tougher on Beijing; on Haiti, where he has promised to let in refugees seeking political asylum, and on Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he has vowed to do more to protect the former Yugoslav republic from Serbian forces -- if Bosnia still exists by the time Mr. Clinton takes office.
Mr. Clinton, they say, also plans to revamp the moribund Agency for International Development and to transform American military strategy to put greater emphasis on smaller, more mobile forces, and on helping military industries shift to commercial manufacturing.
Those who have been advising Mr. Clinton on foreign affairs divide his policy in-basket into two categories: the urgent and the important.
 
The Urgent: Gathering a Team
 The first urgent matter is to assemble a foreign policy team that can work together as smoothly as the Bush national security team did, Clinton aides say.
The Clinton advisers include Anthony Lake and Samuel Berger, former advisers to Jimmy Carter; former neo-conservative Reagan Democrats like Richard Schifter, Penn Kemble and Mr. Muravchik; young Democrats like Nancy Soderberg on the staff of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and academic experts like Will Marshall and Michael Mandelbaum.
There are also lawmakers: Representatives Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Les Aspin of Wisconsin and Senators Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Sam Nunn of Georgia, and retired military officers like Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. and diplomats like Morton Abramowitz.
Forging a coherent team from this group and others will not be as easy as it might look. There are pro-Israelis and pro-Palestinians, former hawks and former doves, and all sorts of other strands. Virtually none of these Clinton foreign policy advisers have worked together in government before. In addition, they will be asked to wrestle with post-cold-war issues that few of them, or anyone else for that matter, have any experience in handling.
Once he has a team in place, Mr. Clinton's first task will be to deal with the unease among long-time American friends or important powers, from Saudi Arabia and Syria to China and Russia, that have been rattled by the downfall of the Bush Administration.
"This has been the first change in party in 12 years," said a Clinton foreign policy adviser, "and we will have to move quickly to let everyone know that in most areas there will be continuity, and where there will be change there will be prior consultations."
Another priority for Mr. Clinton in foreign policy will be dealing with the American economy, say Clinton aides. Their reasoning is that without some success in resolving domestic problems, Mr. Clinton will have no support for playing a major role abroad, nor will he have the economic resources with which to influence events.
 
The Important: Arms, Peace, Trade

In the basket labeled "important" will be a variety of negotiations that the Clinton Administration will inherit. The follow-up agreement to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which was negotiated by Mr. Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia last June, is still up in the air: the Russians have voiced second thoughts about provisions relating to the destruction of their SS-18 missiles silos.
The Russian military is apparently trying to persuade Mr. Yeltsin to use the recent hiatus in American foreign policy to secure a better deal. Mr. Clinton will insist that the Russians abide by the original agreement, his advisers say.
On the Mideast, the Arab-Israeli negotiations are by no means on a smooth track. The Syrian-Israeli and Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are basically dead in the water.
Mr. Clinton has promised "continuity" with the Bush Administration in pushing for progress in these talks, but says he will have a warmer relationship with Israel. But by the time he takes over in January, his challenge may be to revive negotiations in a state of serious decline.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton's mere election will almost certainly invite the Syrians and the Palestinians, even the Israelis, to test the new President. They want to see if Mr. Clinton is more amenable to their demands than was the Bush Administration before they determine what concessions they intend to offer one another.
The Baker-Bush peace process was primarily an effort to bring the parties to the negotiating table. It was never really intended to get the parties to agreements. The Clinton Administration will need new ideas for proposals, not simply a spirit of continuity.
The North American Free Trade Agreement does not have to be renegotiated, but Mr. Clinton has said he will only accept it as written if there is a supplemental agreement with Mexico on enforcing Mexican labor and environmental standards. He would also insist on additional legislation for retraining American workers who would lose their jobs because of the accord.
Mr. Clinton has said that he will support the use of limited trade sanctions, if necessary, to pressure the Chinese leadership on human rights. Congress will not have to take up the question of most-favored-nation trade benefits for China again until June 2, although Clinton advisers are pressing for him to have a new policy in place before then.
But any change in the already volatile relations between Washington and Beijing could create a crisis for the new President, a prospect that clearly alarms Japan and other Asian powers.
On Bosnia, Mr. Clinton has said that he is ready to use force, in conjunction with the United Nations, to get aid to Bosnia this winter; that he wants to tighten the embargo on Serbia, and that he will consider lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia.
But his foreign policy consultants note that by the time he takes office on Jan. 20, Bosnia may have been so dismembered by Serbian and Croatian forces that for all practical purposes it will no longer exist.
The same is true with Somalia. Mr. Clinton's instinct has been to press the United Nations harder to get peacekeeping forces in Somalia, on the assumption that "if you can get security you get supplies in," said one adviser. But whether the United Nations can negotiate access with the local Somali warlords, or should muscle its way in is something that may be determined by January. Instinctively, Clinton aides say, the President-elect would favor a muscular approach.
On the question of Japan, there is a clear division already between Clinton advisers, with some preferring to move aggressively against the Japanese on what they perceive as unfair trade practices. Others want to be tough in bargaining trade access agreements but prefer, as one adviser put it, to do it "in the context of building and maintaining mutual confidence."

HEADLINE: First, We Need to Have a Peacetime Economy;
More Than Skin Deep

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Economic Scare Stories" (Op-Ed, Oct. 16), Professors Robert E. Hall and John B. Taylor would have us believe that the sad state of the American economy is simply due to massive withdrawal by a misunderstanding and angst-ridden public. The professors seek to exorcize this psychic condition with charts presenting statistical evidence that shows our problems to be mild compared with previous recessions. 
 Their triumphant demonstration that in the economic downturn gross domestic product is off by only 1 percent in contrast to the 30 percent drop during the Great Depression of the 1930's is not only well known to any serious student of the problem, but should also constitute the starting point for studies of the nature of the present crisis.
The statistical evidence Professors Hall and Taylor present is also, doubtless, well known to the heads of G.M., I.B.M. and other corporate giants now undertaking massive downsizing, though it has not deterred them from plant closings and mass layoffs. I do not see any corporations acting on the notion that the crisis results from a vast misunderstanding by the buying public.
Are these two professors not aware that an increasing number of economists now speak of the economy's problems as structural and that other scholars and commentators are discussing the American economy in terms of historic decline, with massive downsizing as one symptom? Can (or should) this phenomenon be kept a secret from the public? Is not the public's curtailment of purchases in favor of debt reduction and savings cause for respecting the public's keen awareness of what is happening?
The public is also vaguely aware that the roots of the crisis are not solely economic, as seen in the outcry against widespread "greed" -- essentially a protest against our ethos of acquisitive individualism run amok. It is hoped that the public will also discover that remedies will require, not only major restructuring of our economy -- probably farther reaching than that of the New Deal -- but also altering our underlying value system in favor of greater communitarian concerns.

HEADLINE: First, We Need to Have a Peacetime Economy;
For a New R.F.C.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Old Idea Gains New Respect: Spending Way Out of Slump" (front page, Oct. 8):
There is another old way out. It worked brilliantly before, but the men you interviewed are much younger than I am and do not remember the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It was run by Jesse Jones and credited by most economists with having done more to bring us out of the 1929 Depression than all the costly alphabetical agencies created. When liquidated, R.F.C. returned a profit to the Treasury. 
R.F.C. was financed by the Government, but its stock was always carried as an asset on the books. I suggest such a corporation now. It could be partly financed privately. It is desperately needed first to finance the hundreds of banks in trouble to bring them back to health. They then can return to lending badly needed funds to corporations for expansion, and thus more employment. This would be much cheaper for the taxpayer, who otherwise would have to foot the bill for failed banks.
Such an agency could lend to new corporations formed for specific purposes. For instance, a corporation of engineers chartered to repair our bridges equals employment. Likewise one for nationally repairing our roads.

Jobs Plan That Worked

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter Passell's Oct. 15 Economic Scene column states that Gov. Bill Clinton's advisers have been looking positively on a suggestion for employment tax credits -- say, $2,000 for the first year for employers who add workers. Mr. Passell then quotes a critic who mentioned that the 1977 credit was only used by about one-third of the eligible businesses. 
 I was an author, along with the economist Robert Edmonds, who originated the idea, of two reports to the Economic Development Administration that described a humaninvestment tax-credit program. We suggested a group of employment tax credits and provided research to support turning them into law.
The 1977 job tax credit program, which reflected some of these ideas, generated 900,000 private-sector jobs, fully 20 percent of all new jobs created that year. It resulted in more jobs in less time than any other single piece of legislation in our history.
A Census Bureau survey showed that only 34 percent of all businesses were aware of the little-publicized program. The White House opposed the job tax credit, and it was little advertised. If promoted effectively, with all of the recommended incentives, it might have met the original goal of generating three million to six million new jobs and encouraging one million to four million people to become self-employed.
Since Congress created the program over Administration opposition, the following year the program was gutted and became the targeted jobs-tax credit, with only a small fraction of its previous effectiveness.
Unemployment remains our most pressing problem. The tax incentives in the human investment tax credit program need to be updated and voted into law as the first order of business for the new Administration and Congress.

HEADLINE: City Hall and Sex: 'My Character Is Up for Grabs'

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
When Barbara Wood heard on the radio that her former boss was about to be named a Deputy Mayor of New York City, she thought of the night five years ago when, she said, Randy Daniels walked her to the subway station and propositioned her with crude, explicitly sexual remarks. And then she put that thought aside.
Ms. Wood said she never had any desire to block Mr. Daniels's career path, not when she quit her job working for him in City Council President Andrew J. Stein's press office in 1987 and not after the radio report in October. But her experience was leaked to news organizations without her consent, she said, thrusting her into a public scandal. And, in the ensuing uproar, Mr. Daniels withdrew as Mayor David N. Dinkins's new deputy, even though no formal investigation had been conducted, and he filed a libel and slander suit against her. 
 As the country vividly learned during the Anita F. Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings, sexual harassment cases usually pit her word against his word, with little outside corroboration. In high-profile cases like this one, the public is left to judge what really happened. And in this case, however, Ms. Wood has offered few words publicly until now. But on Thursday, sitting cross-legged on the rug of her lawyer's office at Rockefeller Plaza, Ms. Wood sipped hot soup, pinched the bridge of her nose and reluctantly started talking.
"I don't want to tell you anything -- because it's the past and because it's ugly," she said in her first newspaper interview since her story was made public on Oct. 21. "So why am I here? Because my character is up for grabs. All kinds of things are being said just to hurt me. So I feel I have to set the record straight."
In the interview, Ms. Wood described a work environment in which Mr. Daniels routinely complimented her appearance, brushed by her in their small office, proclaimed himself her mentor and asked her out on dates. She said she gradually grew discomfited by his insistent attentiveness, which culminated in the night he walked her to the subway station. And she said that after she rebuffed him once and for all, Mr. Daniels sought retribution by refusing her assignments and withdrawing his offers to further her career.
In a telephone interview yesterday from his home in the Bahamas, Mr. Daniels rejected her accusations as lies. "It's sick, it's pathetic, she's lying," he said. "I am more convinced than ever that Barbara Wood has a problem. I guess she got angry with me way back then and still needs to spite me now. It's out of control.
Ms. Wood also said that she never filed a formal complaint against Mr. Daniels because of a previous experience pressing charges of sexual harassment against a co-worker at RKO Radio in 1983. The co-worker used to tickle her good morning every day, and she just wanted him to stop, she said. But as a result of her complaint, she was questioned in a way that she found humiliating, and her harasser was transferred to another department, a punishment that she found excessive.
During hours of conversation, her tension dissipating, Ms. Wood spoke of her coming of age as a professional woman, of the hard lessons she learned when she was younger and more vulnerable. As she talked about sexual harassment and the belated aftermath of her encounters with Mr. Daniels, she described an apprenticeship in the delicate balance of power in the modern work place.
"It's all about power," she said. "Randy Daniels pressured me to have a relationship with him outside the work place so that I could have a good relationship inside the work place. He held my job over my head."
Mr. Daniels claims that Ms. Wood, who worked for him for four months, fabricated the sexual harassment, perhaps because he criticized her performance on the job. In a news conference announcing his libel suit against Ms. Wood, Mr. Daniels did not mention the previous incident at RKO Radio. But he did say that she had made accusations against men at two other news organizations -- both companies denied this -- exhibiting what he described as a paranoid pattern. That characterization enraged Ms. Wood.
"Because I say it happened it before, does that preclude any future occurrences?" she said. "I mean, wouldn't that be nice if you were inoculated against sexual harassment just because you once made a complaint? Am I to be persecuted for having a certain standard, for just saying I don't want people to do this to me?"
Ms. Wood's lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin, called a reporter at The New York Times last week to offer an interview with his client. He said he selected the reporter on the basis of her previous articles. He requested that the interview be run on a Sunday for maximum readership but was told The Times made its own decisions on when stories appeared. And after consultation with his client, he said she would not sit for a photograph because she did not want to appear to be seeking celebrity.
 
Watched Anita Hill And Sighed in Relief
 Twenty-nine years old, Ms. Wood, an only child, lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, with her father, a retired Metropolitan Transit Authority supervisor, and her mother, a retired lab technician. She was happily settling into a new job as a television reporter at New York 1 News, a cable-television station, when the story of her relationship with Mr. Daniels resurfaced.
"I did not wait for him to get a good job to come forward and try to take it away from him," she said. "I would have been perfectly happy to keep this to myself and run into him at City Hall and say nothing to him. I mean, I watched Anita Hill just thanking my lucky stars that I didn't have to go through that type of interrogation."
Mr. Daniels's lawyer, Regina Darby, said she did not believe that Ms. Wood had any intention to derail Mr. Daniels's career.
"At this point in her life, she is not a vindictive, vengeful person," she said. "But some time ago, she either misinterpreted him, or fabricated a story for her own psychological purposes."
After graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, Ms. Wood worked at odd jobs in the city -- from a messenger to a desk assistant at RKO -- saving money to go to college. At the age of 21, she began night classes at the Harvard Extension School, working full-time during the day at a Cambridge, Mass., photocopy store. When she graduated, she moved back to New York to accept a reporting internship at Newsday.
Through an editor at Newsday, Ms. Wood obtained an interview with Mr. Daniels for a press officer's job in Mr. Stein's office, she said. She started work shortly after Labor Day in 1987, with the belief that Mr. Daniels planned to take her under his wing professionally. She was 25 years old, and, she said, excited to be near Room Nine, the reporters' office at City Hall.
As Ms. Wood describes it, what she eventually saw as harassment began innocently.
 
At First, Self-Doubt; Then, a Proposition
 "I knew something was wrong but you can kind of doubt yourself," she said. " 'Oh, gee, that's nice,' he says. 'Oh, gee, that looks good.' And it escalates. You may not even catch the escalation, but you start to feel uncomfortable, with the way he is saying something to you, the way he is looking at you. And it feels inappropriate, but maybe you're wrong. But it's happening too much. But maybe you're wrong. And maybe he shouldn't have brushed up against me like that -- it didn't feel good -- but it's a small office. And certainly he shouldn't be asking me out -- he's married! -- but it's couched in terms of an after-work thing."
Ms. Wood continued: "That stuff was intermingled with, 'So, where do you want to go with your career? It's really tough out there. I can make calls for you.' And, those things together were putting pressure on me, and then one day after work, he walked me to the train station and propositioned me. And, yes, he told me what I could do. Graphically, explicitly."
Not for publication,Ms. Wood specified the sexual activity that Mr. Daniels had proposed. She continued: "He said, 'I know what you need, like I know how to satisfy you,' " Ms. Wood said. "It was disgusting and it was trashy and it was so sexual."
Mr. Arkin noted that men sometimes claim they were getting signals. Ms. Wood responded explosively.
"If he got any signal at all, it was a signal to stop," she said. "I was not responding. He didn't have to get a billboard, 'Barbara, do me.' He didn't have to basically give me a diagram of what his appetite was for."
After that night, Ms. Wood said, Mr. Daniels's behavior toward her changed. He withheld work from her, she said, and ignored her. And after her uncle, Bob Teague, a WNBC News reporter for 28 years, visited Mr. Daniels to complain about his behavior, her boss lashed out at her, she said.
"He said: 'Do you think your uncle can scare me? He can't scare me," she said. "He said: "I know what you're about. I knew what you were about when you first came in here.' And then he let me know he was not going to help me in any kind of way at all."
Mr. Daniels said yesterday that Mr. Teague had met with Mr. Stein and had only paused to introduce himself as Ms. Wood's uncle and to tell him, "I am very well connected down here."
 
Getting Out Of the Situation
 Ms. Wood said she confided in Sara Vidal, another employee in Mr. Stein's office, who told her to work out the problem with Mr. Daniels. Mr. Daniels's lawyer said Ms. Vidal told her she was misinterpreting her boss.
Ms. Darby, the lawyer, recalled, "Sara said: 'Girlfriend, let me tell you something. I know boys that play around and he's not one of them.' Then Sara called Jackie, Randy's wife, and told her to come down there in her finest and let the woman know that this man has no need to be looking outside his marriage."
Ms. Wood, meanwhile, took a trip to Israel, hoping the situation would improve on her return. When it did not, she said, she resolved to quit. But she was uncomfortable telling Mr. Daniels that she was leaving, so she went to see Maggi Peyton, Mr. Stein's chief of operations, and eventually Mr. Stein, too.
"She was really afraid," Ms. Peyton said. "She wanted me to get her off the payroll without telling Daniels."
Ms. Wood said she met with Mr. Stein, whose staff encouraged her to file a formal complaint against Mr. Daniels. She did not want to do so.
"I didn't want to bring down a black man who had made it," she said. "Also, at RKO, it had turned into this big thing where it felt demeaning." After Ms. Wood quit, with a month's pay, she was unemployed for 18 months, doing freelance articles. She did a lot of work for a Long Island television news program, and in June landed a job with the new New York cable news station. When she heard the news of Mr. Daniels's appointment, she had one reaction.
"Dread," she said. "Dread, dread, dread that it would come out. And when it did -- New world. Re-creation. Nothing will be the same. Life changed. Printing press did it to me."
In defending himself, Mr. Daniels claimed that Ms. Wood was a pawn being used by Mr. Stein to attack Mr. Dinkins. Defenders of Mr. Daniels have cast aspersions on Ms. Wood's professionalism and suggested that she was excessively flirtatious. Some blacks have criticized her for making accusations against a black professional.
But Ms. Wood, who sighed continuously during the interview, said she was sleeping and eating and working, intent not "to lose another job over this situation." Although she said she wants to remain on the reporter's side of the microphone, her experience seems to have made her an advocate for women, particularly vocal on the insidious, murky subject of sexual harassment.
"It's not always going to be a hand in your blouse or up your skirt," she said. "It's not always, 'Hey, baby, let's go do the motel thing.' It's more the double-entendre game, the setup. And it's not done for witnesses, because it's bad behavior, and they know better. And so people say they're not the type. And then after, when you say no, they don't have to fire you. It's just easier to disrespect you completely in the work place until you decide you can't take it anymore. And then you speak up, and boom, hunting season is open on your character."

During her first interview since, she continued, "So why am I here? Because my character is up for grabs. So I feel I have to set the record straight." Ms. Woods appeared on television on Oct. 22.

HEADLINE: A Republican Message That Roiled the Waters;
The Zero Return

 BODY:
President-elect Clinton has said that an economic stimulus program, including money for new roads and other public works projects, s at the top of his agenda. As an indication of how dominant an issue the economy was in the Nov. 2 elections, readers are continuing to respond very strongly to "The Beauty of Indexing Capital Gains" (Viewpoints, Oct. 25) by Theodore J. Forstmann, national co-chairman of the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign. Some of their letters follow.
 To the Editor: 
 In failing to differentiate sufficiently between ordinary income and capital gains, the government actually loses revenue. Investors holding high-interest, long-term municipal bonds find their bonds have appreciated considerably in the current low-interest climate. To take profits, however, means incurring taxes and having to re-invest at the lower current rates.
A person with a municipal bond portfolio might have a paper profit of $10,000. Under the previous tax law, a sale would produce $2,000 for the government and $8,000 for the investor. Under the present law, since the investor will pay 28 percent in taxes and need to invest what remains in lower-yielding instruments, there is no advantage to selling. When the bonds mature, the investor receives face value and the government, zero.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
A Searing Examination Of Private Adoptions

BYLINE: By LEAH D. FRANK

 BODY:
RECENT plays like "After Shocks" by Doug Haverty, at the defunct Long Island Stage in Rockville Centre, and the poignant "Phantasie" by Sybil Pearson, at the Studio Theater in Lindenhurst, have explored the subject of adoption. Now the Studio Theater is taking another look, in "The Baby Dance" by Jane Anderson.
The play had its premiere in Pasadena, Calif., in 1990. Last year it was at the Lucille Lortel Theater on Christopher Street in Manhattan. 
 Where "After Shocks" and "Phantasie" examined the effects of adoptions on adults' searching for their birth parents and geneaological roots, the subject of "The Baby Dance" is found in the morally ambiguous world of surrogate motherhood and private adoptions.
The story opens in the trailer home of Al and Wanda, an uneducated unemployed couple who have nothing except children. Wanda is pregnant for the fifth time. Practicalities about how they will be able to pay for the hospital and doctor, and then baby food and clothing, seem overwhelming. Wanda sees a newspaper advertisement asking healthy pregnant white women to consider putting up their children for adoption, and she responds.
A lawyer who arranges private adoptions matches Al and Wanda with Richard and Rachel, a wealthy educated couple who have everything life can offer except the ability to have children, and "The Baby Dance" begins in earnest. Ms. Anderson uses the couples and the lawyer to create a microcosm of cultural difference. The question of American diversity and problems of national unity underlie and add complexity and depth to this otherwise simple melodrama about surrogate parenthood.
Ms. Anderson is too clever a writer to dictate solutions to the problems that she addresses. "The Baby Dance" guides the viewer, but the final character analyses and moral judgments are left to the audience.
Macey Levin has directed with a sensitivity for the charged emotional content, and he eschews histrionics at every point. The play could easily become a melodrama about selling babies, but because Mr. Levin avoids soap-opera pitfalls, the searing ending retains its power.
Mr. Levin has also cast well. Justine Dennis as Wanda and Karen Rowan as Rachel, who wants to adopt Wanda's baby, give riveting performances. Wanda is in conflict about what she is doing, but consoles herself with the dream that her daughter will have the material benefits that she and Al could never provide. Ms. Dennis displays the desire to give her child the best of everything, but she also reveals Wanda's base nature.
Ms. Rowan's Rachel complements Wanda. Although one is left with every societal advantage that the other lacks, an empathy develops between the two that yields the play's sole ray of hope. Ms. Rowan is sympathetic and gentle as Rachel, but like Wanda this Rachel has a cold pragmatic streak that makes the character real and appealing.
The men are written more as stereotypes than the women. Al, Wanda's virile husband, is an ignorant Southern redneck. T. Patrick Shore captures the essence of a "good ole boy" and adds a depth to the character that makes Al into a believable man. Mr. Shore is a charismatic actor, and the scenes he shares with Ms. Dennis are among the play's most riveting.
Eric Leone struggles with the role of Richard, a rich Jewish financier. At times, he explodes with anger and frustration as the man who is put in the position of buying a baby; at other times, Mr. Leone seems to be doing nothing more than reciting memorized dialogue.
The lawyer, Ron, is everyone's nightmare of a well-dressed legal flesh peddler. He is smooth, unflappable and unconcerned with anything other than concluding the deal and moving on to the next one. Christopher Riordan's polished manner makes Ron appear as irritating as his character was meant to be.
"The Baby Dance," which continues through Nov. 28, is receiving a first-rate production.

BYLINE: By Ed Regis; Ed Regis is the author of "Who Got Einstein's Office?" and "Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition."

 BODY:

JOHN VON NEUMANN
By Norman Macrae.
405 pp. New York:
A Cornelia and Michael Bessie Book/
Pantheon Books. $25. 
 BY any measure, John von Neumann was a rare creature. Unequivocally one of the brightest minds of the 20th century, he made an indelible mark in mathematics, physics, economics, nuclear weapons technology and computer science, and had a hand in inventing at least three new fields -- cellular automata theory (showing how groups of inanimate cells can be made to behave as if they were alive), game theory (applying mathematics to the art of decision making) and the systematic study of the similarity of minds and computers. In one of his own pet phrases, he "jiggled the planet." So why is it that most people haven't the faintest idea who he was?
Good question. Norman Macrae, the former principal editor of The Economist, sets out to rectify matters in "John von Neumann," the first full-scale biography of this polymath, who was born Jewish in Hungary in 1903 and died Roman Catholic in the United States at the age of 53. And Mr. Macrae has some great stories to tell.
Von Neumann's grammar school tutor, we learn, "came home with tears in his eyes from his first encounter with the young prodigy." One of von Neumann's college professors happened to mention in class an "unsolved" problem in mathematics. "Johnny came up privately at the end, and solved it."
When he was 17 years old, von Neumann decided to pursue his undergraduate and graduate degrees simultaneously, in two different disciplines and in two separate countries. He wound up getting a diploma in chemical engineering from Zurich's famous Federal Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Budapest, both in the same year, at the ripe old age of 22.
But he was also one of the guys. He loved money, fast living and gawking at women. When he was working at Los Alamos, N.M., to develop the atomic bomb during World War II, Mr. Macrae writes, the secretaries, who had desks open in the front, used to stick cardboard there "because, they said, Johnny had a habit of leaning forward, muttering, and peering up their skirts."
Von Neumann was, in spite of some quirks, a man of considerable charm and wit. On one occasion he and his colleague Jacob Bronowski had been arguing late into the night about the correct solution to a problem. "When I called his hotel in London," Bronowski recalled, "he answered the phone in bed, and I said 'Johnny, you're quite right.' And he said to me, 'You wake me up early in the morning to tell me that I'm right? Please wait until I'm wrong.' "
Almost involuntarily, Mr. Macrae believes, people took a great liking to von Neumann, even those who disagreed with his right-wing politics. (After World War II, von Neumann worked with Edward Teller to push for the development and possible deployment of thermonuclear weapons and was "grieved" by the pacifism he found among physicists.)
The risk in writing a biography of a man like von Neumann lies in contracting a bad case of hagiography disease. Mr. Macrae has not managed to avoid it -- one of the drawbacks of the book, he says, is "a danger of praising Johnny too glutinously" -- nor has he even tried very hard. From this account, one would think that von Neumann, whom Mr. Macrae calls "Johnny" throughout the book, rarely did anything bad, boring or stupid -- other than occasionally driving cars into trees while contemplating the glories of higher mathematics.
But a more serious drawback than the possibly justified hero worship is that the book's explanations of scientific theories are often facile, unintelligible or just plain wrong. In one case the author mentions nine major scientists and seven different versions of quantum mechanics, all in a single breezy paragraph. This is name-dropping, not science writing.
In another case, we read: "Hilbert had a spectral theory for bounded symmetric operators, but this did not help explain much until Johnny unveiled the notion of symmetry for unbounded operators. He did this by creating a spectral theory for unbounded operators that are self-adjoint." Such unintelligibility is not mitigated by the author's frank admission in the next sentence that "the ordinary reader (and this ordinary writer) may be staggering with incomprehension."
Godel's theorem, Mr. Macrae says, is "an assertion something like 'The following statement is unprov able.' " This rendering omits the single most distinctive feature of Godel's theorem: self-reference.
For all its faults, Mr. Macrae's biography has rescued a lot of good science gossip from probable extinction, and has introduced many of us to the life story of a man we ought to know better.

HOMESTEAD
The Glory and Tragedy of an American Steel Town.
By William Serrin.
Illustrated. 452 pp. New York:
Times Books/Random House. $25. 
 ONLY 17 percent of working Americans now manufacture anything, down from 22 percent as recently as 1980. More than one million manufacturing jobs have disappeared during the last four years alone. Factory jobs that used to pay unskilled workers middle-class wages have been among the first to go. On average, the incomes of Americans without college degrees (roughly three-quarters of the adult population) are 16 percent lower than they were in 1970.
These are the data, but numbers have no soul. William Serrin, formerly a labor correspondent for The New York Times, has given them life in this tender account of one community's rise and fall during America's industrial century. "Homestead: The Glory and Tragedy of an American Steel Town" is, in microcosm, the story of American steel, which in many ways is the story of American manufacturing.
Homestead, Pa., rode the crest of the wave of American steel, and when the wave crashed Homestead was pulled under. Its population swelled from 2,000 in 1880 to 20,000 in 1940. The Homestead Steel Works was closed in 1986. Today, no more than 4,000 people remain.
Mr. Serrin tells us that the Homestead Works pioneered the open-hearth process, which generated cheap steel in large quantities -- supplying rails for the railroads that thrust westward, plates for helmets and warships in the two great wars of this century, beams for bridges and for the nation's first skyscrapers. When the mill opened in 1879, the United States Army was at war with Indians and the Industrial Revolution had just taken off; by the early 1950's, when the mill was breaking production records, the United States was making half of all the steel in the non-Communist world. By the time the mill closed, more Americans worked on Wall Street than in the steel industry, and the country's second-largest export (behind jet aircraft) was entertainment.
Homestead also traced the turbulent arc of the American labor movement. Mr. Serrin offers a stirring account of one of the nation's earliest and bloodiest confrontations, the Homestead strike of 1882. Andrew Carnegie and his second-in-command, Henry Clay Frick, decided to break the power of the incipient Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers -- then the largest union in the nation, with 24,000 members. The company won, and the growth of American unionism was seriously stalled until the New Deal. Thereafter, with the help of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the spur of World War II, unionism in America grew to embrace 36 percent of all workers. But the battle continued in other ways -- through management's use of spies, scabs and intimidation; through labor's indulgence in nepotism, overmanning and theft. As manufacturing jobs grew scarcer in the 1970's and 80's, industrial unions imploded. Today, only a bit over 12 percent of the nongovernment work force is unionized, and the percentage is shrinking daily.
Homestead was its mill. The plant provided almost all of the employment in the town, most of its taxes, many of its services. Mr. Serrin shows how the mill owners dominated politicians, controlled the police, infiltrated the town's social organizations, summoned the state militia when necessary. The Slavic immigrants who constituted a large portion of the work force in the first half of this century were especially tractable; few were citizens, most were illiterate. Generations worked in the mill; by 1951, more than 40 percent of its employees were father-and-son combinations. Workers and townspeople were proud of the mill and enjoyed the economic security it provided. They also hated the control it exerted, the long hours it demanded, the dangers, the deaths.
Always in the background and influencing these lives in ways the people of Homestead barely comprehended was the American steel industry and its place in the American and global economy. Mr. Serrin traces this history, too, and aptly demonstrates the close relationship between industrial innovation and competition.
GREAT strides were made in steelmaking methods in the 1880's, when companies battled one another for markets, but the industry fell into lethargy as steelmaking became a comfortable oligopoly. By the mid-1930's, Germany had become the leader in steel technology; in 1950, Austria developed the basic oxygen furnace. American steelmakers were unprepared for substitutes such as aluminum and plastics, and even after gaining protection from foreign imports in the 1970's they were dogged by poor quality and waste. Today, profits are up but foreigners are still blamed for the industry's problems, and the layoffs continue.
Mr. Serrin tells his story well, but he is less successful helping us decide what to make of it. Sometimes he suggests that Homestead's demise -- like that of so many other American industrial towns -- was the inevitable result of technological change ("it is an immutable rule of industrialism that advanced methods mean fewer people"). But that is surely wrong. Henry Ford's advanced methods of making automobiles created hundreds of thousands of new jobs, and even Andrew Carnegie's steelmaking experiments created more jobs than they replaced. At other times Mr. Serrin seems to lay blame on management, or on the steel industry in general, for cutting employment and closing mills. That is simplistic. Steelmakers would have gone bankrupt had they continued to run giant mills with swollen payrolls, providing wages and benefits 80 percent higher than the average for American manufacturing.
The reality is that both management and labor failed to use technology to keep Homestead's mill and its workers competitive. With little domestic competition, followed by decades of protection from foreign imports, management didn't much care; with secure job classifications, work rules and cost-of-living adjustments, the workers didn't either. Homestead and the other great steelmaking towns of the United States could have survived had steelmaking technologies been upgraded continuously, and workers retrained to use them. That way, steel might have evolved into new materials of ever greater strength and lighter weight, just as iron had evolved into steel. Demand would have grown, so that even with higher output per worker, larger numbers of workers would still have been needed. Unskilled blue-collar workers could have become semiskilled technicians, monitoring computers and maintaining complex machinery, thus justifying higher wages. If all this sounds too good to be possible, it is the route that was followed by Japan and Germany.
But even this cheery possibility begs the question Mr. Serrin continually raises but never answers. Why should we care about Homestead, or, for that matter, about any town or city in decline? Where, exactly, is the "tragedy," other than in this book's subtitle? Americans are always leaving some place behind; departures are in our ancestral genes. Shouldn't the objects of our concern more properly be the people who once inhabited such places, and the lives they are able to lead elsewhere? Or does rootedness matter more than we have allowed ourselves to admit?
Mr. Serrin feels obvious affection for Homestead and its people, but the two are separable. In fact, they already have separated, for the most part. His narrative might have been more complete had he examined what became of some of the tens of thousands who have departed from Homestead during the last three decades. Homestead's demise would be less worrisome if its former residents had gone on to achieve better lives for themselves and their children. But available data suggest the opposite: most of them, after migrating west and south, got jobs in the service sector paying no more than one-half to two-thirds of what they had once earned in the mill. This is not so much the tragedy of an American steel town as it is the tragedy of modern America.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
A Silicon Valley Spin On Financing the Arts

BYLINE: By Michael S. Malone; Michael S. Malone writes frequently about Silicon Valley from Los Altos, Calif.

 BODY:
A tycoon tired of being pestered and industry executives with an eye to the arts have combined to produce in Silicon Valley what may be a model for fast-growing communities too new to have a tradition in cultural fund raising.
The new Silicon Valley Arts Fund, based in San Jose and composed of 11 big cultural organizations, each of which hopes to raise more money than it would alone, aims to bring in $20 million by the end of 1993. 
 Even before its formal introduction on Oct. 14 the fund had raised more than $6 million, not only from longtime contributors like the city of San Jose, but also from companies and individuals never noted for their cultural ties. Ten of the 13 historically fractious cities in the valley are already committed.
The man behind the fund is David Packard, chairman of the Hewlett-Packard Company, who had tired of the many fund-raising pleas from scores of local arts groups. Shouldn't it be possible, he asked, to create a one-stop giving program that would distribute money more fairly and give these groups more long-term financial stability?
The idea fell on fertile ground with local arts groups, which, though normally competitive, are suffering in one of the worst recessions in decades. Under the aegis of the area's Community Foundation, a community-service organization that is manager of the fund, 10 nonprofit organizations with revenues greater than $1 million a year -- including the San Jose ballet, opera and symphony and arts groups from other communities -- began to meet. They were joined by the Arts Council of Santa Clara County, which represents smaller arts organizations.
The idea was just as appealing to the business community. Hewlett-Packard, for example, had never given more than a few thousand dollars or some company computers to local arts groups. For the Silicon Valley Arts Fund, it put up a prompt $250,000.
"I think the main reason was the leadership of the campaign," said William E. Terry, an H-P executive vice president. (Let it be noted in this context that Mr. Packard, a big charitable giver locally, leaves his company and its officers to their own devices in causes ranging from the arts to politics. For example, an outspoken Bush supporter, he found H-P's chief executive, John A. Young, equally outspoken for the Clinton cause.)
Mr. Terry went on to explain: "The approach always used to come from the arts people themselves, or from their trustees, most of whom weren't business people. Groups were always coming around, hat in hand, saying, 'We've got to save the ballet, symphony, etc.' This group was different. They talked our language."
Indeed they did. The structure of the fundreflects its Silicon Valley origins. Fifteen percent of the money will be designated as "bridge funding," to help participating groups pay off existing deficits. Seventy-three percent will go to create the endowment, meant to provide a predictable source of capital for the groups, good times or bad, and to signal to the community that these institutions are truly established -- a crucial factor in their independent fund-raising. The final 12 percent is for a "venture fund" to allow the groups to support new activities through interest-free 12-month loans.
H-P gave so much, Mr. Terry said, for two reasons: a growing recognition that most of the area's cultural organizations were in financial trouble and, again, business. "I can't quite put my finger on it," he said, "but certainly the valley, as manufacturing is moving out, is becoming increasingly filled with professional people. This group, with its greater discretionary income, tends to put the arts high on its value list." So, by supporting cultural institutions, he expects to cultivate employee loyalty.
Steve Kirsch, vice president and co-founder of Frame Technology, a software company in San Jose, had a different reaction to the pitch. "Basically," he said, "I got this thing in the mail inviting me to a reception. I went not knowing what to expect. One of the most impressive things for me was a fellow got up from the Knight Foundation." It was giving $1.05 million, the largest donation to an arts organization in its history.
"As it turns out, this is the largest donation I've ever made -- $100,000 over five years," Mr. Kirsch said. "And no way it was a business decision. That was the farthest thing from my mind. I did it because I feel a sense of pride in being able to contribute in some small way."
To be sure, not everything is perfect in this philanthropic paradise. As currently structured, about $2 million will go to the Arts Council of Santa Clara County. Spread out over 350 organizations, these shares don't amount to much. And there has been some grumbling, albeit only on a not-for-attribution basis, among heads of these smaller groups that the Silicon Valley Arts Fund may actually hurt their own fund-raising programs and starve local diversity by skimming off the big donors.
Stung by this criticism, the fund has gone to great lengths to show solidarity with the Arts Council members and to urge donors to continue helping smaller groups.
But its case is undermined by comments like this one from Mr. Kirsch: "This one contribution is going to pretty much blow my arts philanthropy budget for the next few years."
Still, there may be some validity in the fund's argument that building a spirit of philanthropy in what has been a notoriously tight community can only help. Certainly its novel strategy and early success have caught the attention of other communities.
Barbara Beerstein, consulting director of the fund, says she has had inquiries from groups as far away as Virginia and Delaware and thinks the program will provide a useful model for fast-growing cities that have been in the shadow of more established neighbors. Just as San Jose is to San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Can Clinton Close The Vision Gap?

SERIES: BILL' LIST: These are the first articles in a occasional series commenting on ideas and issues facing the new Clinton Administration.

BYLINE: By Garry Wills; Garry Wills, adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University, is author of "Lincoln at Gettysburg."

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
Democrats are under standably elated. They hear hoofbeats the cavalry's arrival, in the nick of time, to rescue the Supreme Court. A high turnout, a landslide Electoral College win, the customary graciousness of the losers. These things help dispel, for the moment, the sourness that pervaded much of the campaign. But we should not forget, in the fizz of celebration, that the overall winner this year was not F.O.B. (Friends of Bill) but N.O.B. (None of the Above).
Sometimes N.O.B. ran under his own name, sometimes under that of Jerry Brown or Paul Tsongas or Patrick Buchanan or Ross Perot. But mainly he ran -- and won big -- as Term Limits. The clearest margins of the year were given to energetic dismissal. The message was simple: be gone. 
 As late as Election Day, CBS published a poll showing that 60 percent of the populace had misgivings about Bill Clinton's character. But the nation could not (yet) throw this rascal out. The one it could, it did. There is nothing unusual about this in a time of economic hardship. Exit polls showed that Ronald Reagan was not chosen in 1980 for his own person or programs. There were lingering doubts about him (as extremist or dopey or both), but those had to wait on the first order of business, the throwing-out job. The same thing occurred in 1932. Franklin D. Roosevelt announced no real reform plan in his campaign. He did not have to. Whatever else he might be, he was not Herbert Hoover.
Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan correctly diagnosed the troubles of their predecessors and addressed the economy with vigor and imagination. President-elect Clinton intends to do the same. But he is hampered in ways they were not. It will be harder for him to spend, regulate and insure the nation out of an economic trough, as Roosevelt did, since the deficit, regulations in place and insurance-become-entitlements have pre-empted those solutions.
Not only must Mr. Clinton not "tax and spend," but he cannot spend and spend as Mr. Reagan did, since the bill for that orgy of unfunded expenditure has come due. Some Republicans were at least partly comforted to see that their man is now spared the demanding, perhaps impossible, task of dealing with the economy in the coming year.
Yet even this is not the full measure of Mr. Clinton's problems. There were deeper than economic discontents expressed in this race. The political system itself was under attack -- the Congress, the special interests, the very idea of incumbency. This mood was profound but diffuse. It was not merely a reaction to the excesses of campaigning: this was a more substantive campaign than the last one, than most in our history.
Nor can blame for any cynicism be pinned on a corrupt Congress; this Congress is cleaner than most if not all in our history (the House bank scandal was small potatoes by past standards). Yet people were ready to believe the worst of Washington. They sensed that something had gone wrong somewhere. George Bush's last-minute attacks on "gloom and doom" people just confirmed how out of touch he was.
The end of the cold war obviously had something to do with this spiritual restlessness or drift. The crusade that justified so much of our activity has been taken from us, leaving a gaping hole where there was, once, a sense of purpose.
After all the weapons gaps, we have a mission gap. The idea that we have reached some kind of imperial plateau is also asserting itself in quiet but discernible ways -- the sense that foreign competitors are all around us where we used to have only foes or clients. It is hard to say "We're No. 1" with the old easy assurance (except, of course, where we are No. 1 -- in murders committed, drugs consumed, debts run up).
President Bush's ultimate failure, nebulous as it sounds, was in "the vision thing." Roosevelt and Mr. Reagan did not simply institute piecemeal economic changes. They made their efforts coherent in a framework of mobilizing ideals. This requires political genius, a thing one cannot count on.
In Arkansas, Bill Clinton did base nitty-gritty reforms on the vision of a new state, competitive with others because it is better educated, more open to the world, less bound by provincialism. But he was cramped in what he could do there by the state's anti-governmental constitution, by historical resistance to taxes and by skepticism about change. After he pushed too hard, in his first term as Governor, he was defeated and became far more cautious.
In the Presidency, a stalled economy calls for boldness and the opportunity of the energetic first days must be capitalized on. A President can recover from mistakes made early in his term (Roosevelt trying to expand the Supreme Court as his second term began, John F. Kennedy invading Cuba). But Mr. Bush's lassitude at the outset made later accomplishments all the more difficult.
In foreign policy, Mr. Clinton ran the typical Democratic campaign, trying to be as tough as the Republicans, avoiding criticism of Mr. Bush that might sound "unpatriotic." But the end of the cold war calls for reconceptualizing America's place in the history of our times, if Mr. Clinton is not merely to respond in an ad hoc fashion to trouble spots. Here, too, a coherent vision can brace people to depart from old reflexes.
It is not only our physical infrastructure that has decayed but our intellectual infrastructure. That collapse explains the perception of discredited leadership, tainted procedures, resented measures. We have been eating into our intellectual as well as our financial capital, living off depleted supplies of anti-Communism, trickle-down capitalism and Rooseveltian liberalism.
It is catch-up time in our history, when government must not be so much reinvented as relegitimized. What vision does it serve? What mission does it have? Mr. Clinton ran an efficient if cautious campaign. That will not be enough to reverse the trend of recent years in government. It is clearly unfair to put political genius at the top of the list of things required of Mr. Clinton now. That, nevertheless, is what we need.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Political Memo;
Clinton, After Raising Hopes, Tries to Lower Expectations

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 8

 BODY:
As President-elect Bill Clinton begins the transition from campaigning to governing, his overarching concern is to cope with the emotion he has stirred: hope.
A volatile expectation colors everything about the beginning of the Clinton years. Against accepted political wisdom and the currents of an angry year, Mr. Clinton's Presidential campaign seemed to revive at least a limited belief that Washington can actually do something good for people. 
 Now, as the President-elect settles into his job, he and his strategists face the tricky task of bringing the grandly hopeful promises of his campaign into line with the grimly difficult realities of governance: a huge Federal deficit, a highly taxed public, a Congress determined to hold onto its own share of power and the factionalization of politics by pressure groups.
The inculcation of a vast and passionate Hope (the word, uttered every few seconds in Clinton circles, seems to come out capitalized) was at the core of the Clinton electoral strategy, a plan based on the idea that people eager for change would vote for him if their hopes could be made to rise above the level of their trepidations.
"This is a race of hope against fear," was Mr. Clinton's slogan. The glowing biographical film that created the candidate's general-election image celebrated his upbringing in Hope, Ark., and in speeches Mr. Clinton made a point of saying he "still believed in a town called Hope."
 
Facing the Perils of Hope
 Post-election polls indicate the strategy's success: an overwhelming percentage of the voters who chose Mr. Clinton did so not just to remove President Bush from office, but also in the belief that the new President, as he had promised, would improve their lives. Among other things, the candidate promised to end working-class poverty, to change welfare, to provide health care for everyone and to eliminate illiteracy.
Publicly, Mr. Clinton's advisers describe the national expectation level as a great opportunity. Privately, some of them regard it with worry as well. Hope got Mr. Clinton elected, they figure, and will be the crucial weapon of the first hundred days of his Administration, a stick with which to beat the recalcitrant and critical forces of Congress, the permanent bureaucracy and the press. But hope expects success, and deferred, sours with nearly the violence of spurned love.
To retain the political promise of hope while minimizing its peril, Mr. Clinton and his strategists are beginning to chart a course of contrary impulses. The nascent strategy is directed at maintaining expectations for a Clinton Presidency at a high enough level that Congress, the bureaucrats and the press will fear thwarting the Administration's aims, while simultaneously dampening those expectations to bring them closer to what can be achieved.
Mr. Clinton voiced the dual nature of this approach in his first official statement of Presidential intent, a five-paragraph speech delivered the day after his election.
 
Lowering the Expectations
 "We have entered a period of great challenge and extraordinary opportunity for our nation," he said, in a passage that spoke in high and rich terms of national greatness. But the next, and final, passage sounded a note of shared sacrifice, a signal that greatness would not be achieved without pain.
"America has called on me to be our next President," Mr. Clinton said. "But our forebears call on all of us at this moment to honor their efforts, their sacrifices, their ideals and their lives by working hard and working together to improve this good and great nation as much for our children and our children's children as those who preceded us did for us."
It is this latter theme of sacrifice and a lowering of hope to reality's borders that is most urgently sounded now by Mr. Clinton's advisers. The imperative, in the wake of a campaign of blue-sky, no-pain promises, is obvious to them. Asked how much patience the American public might have with the Clinton Administration as it sets out to fulfill its promise, Eli Segal, Mr. Clinton's campaign chief of staff, had a succinct answer: "Not much."
And so, this week, the low-balling began.
"The expectation is not that he will solve everything in a hundred days, but that he will address the problems seriously, and begin the process of working toward solutions," said Mandy Grunwald, one of Mr. Clinton's chief image and media consultants.
Bruce Reed, Mr. Clinton's issues adviser, said: "I'm not that sure how high expectations are. Obviously, in record numbers people demonstrated that they thought there was a lot at stake in this election, and they care deeply about the outcome of the questions raised, but I think people still have doubts about what Government can do.
 
Considering Many Ideas
 "The Governor never promised that Government could solve every problem; he just promised it was time that leaders start trying," he added. "As he has said over and over, we didn't get into this mess overnight and we won't get out of it overnight."
Possible means of furthering this point are under discussion within the wide circle of Mr. Clinton's advisers. A strategy pushed by one economic adviser calls for him to address the nation in a televised "national audit," in which he would, in Ross Perot style, grimly lay out economic realities.
A Clinton campaign official cautioned that neither this idea nor any other specific plan had yet been brought to Mr. Clinton's attention. But the essence of the ideas is clearly in line with the desires of a number of Mr. Clinton's policy advisers.
"I think leveling with people is a good idea always," said Al From, the director of the Washington-based Democratic Leadership Council and one of Mr. Clinton's advisers. "If you level with the people, they're going to be more willing to help you get along with what you need to do."
 
'Audit of Where We Stand'
 Another Clinton policy adviser, who would speak only if not identified, said: "I think it clearly makes sense a lot of people would recognize, telling people how bad the economy is. Is the best way to go about it us doing a national audit? Or is it better to have the guys in Congress do it? Is it better done in November or January? These are all things we're talking about."
Warren M. Christopher, Mr. Clinton's transition director, spoke of another version of the "national audit" idea today on the CBS News program "Face The Nation."
Saying Mr. Clinton would convene a group of business executives and economic leaders to advise him, Mr. Christopher called that effort "an attempt to make an audit of where we stand now."
The need for reducing hope to a manageable level arises directly from the oratory that helped elect Mr. Clinton. The Democratic candidate, in the course of the campaign and especially toward its conclusion, did often make the point that positive change could only come with shared responsibility and that it would not be easy to achieve. But he also spoke, and more often, in promises that were breathtaking in their ambition.
In the course of the 13 months in which he ran for the office he will soon hold, Mr. Clinton uttered promises that seemed to commit his Administration to many goals.
He said he would end welfare "as we know it." He would restore America's industrial manufacturing base so that good, high-paying jobs are widespread. He would insure that no working family would fall below the poverty line. And he would make "health care a right, not a privilege," for all Americans without subjecting businesses to an additional tax burden or rationing health care.
 
Problems and Promises
 He promised to eliminate adult illiteracy in five years, to halve the Federal deficit in four years without raising taxes on the middle class or significantly cutting the Government entitlement programs that account for the bulk of Federal spending, while offering a modest tax break to the middle class.
He said he would guarantee all Americans either a college education or two years of vocational training after high school, under the guidance of a national service program that would "solve the problems of this country while educating a generation of Americans."
Mr. Clinton pledged to keep abortion legal while "making it as rare as possible," to end racial, religious, geographical and sex-oriented divisions in society, safeguard environmental concerns without costing jobs and protect the rights and privileges of workers without costing business growth.
Implicit in every speech, and directing the course of the campaign, was the allure of hope. "This is a race of hope against fear," Mr. Clinton would say in almost every speech.
And while Mr. Clinton also voiced tough-minded opinions that put him at odds with the positions of such crucial groups in the Democratic coalition as blacks and organized union workers, it often appeared during the campaign that those statements were taken by leaders of the groups as indicators more of the politics of the moment than of the policies of a Clinton Administration.
It is the hope of Mr. Clinton's advisers that he will be able to cope with both the heightened hopes of the public at large and the deferred expectations of Democratic interest groups through the great skill of promoting himself and his ideas through the mass media that he demonstrated during the campaign.
Increasingly, the model for Mr. Clinton's Administration was seen as that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, another President who took office amid doubts of his trustworthiness and whose fireside chats induced in the nation a sense of shared sacrifice and common good that carried it out of the Great Depression and through World War II.
"Bill Clinton is an information age politician; he understands the importance of communication," Mr. From said. "With that talent, what he has to do is what Roosevelt did, which is subsume the narrow agendas of organized interests into a larger national agenda for progress. I believe he is going to make this an idea-driven Administration, and an idea-driven Administration can appeal to a potpourri of interests. If he can do that, he will be fine."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: The Overview;
CLINTON TO SUMMON ECONOMIC LEADERS TO SET PRIORITIES

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 8

 BODY:
In an effort to demonstrate a commitment to boosting the battered American economy, President-elect Bill Clinton plans to assemble a conference of business and economic leaders within the next few weeks and create an Economic Security Council after he takes office, his transition leaders said today.
The council, Mr. Clinton's advisers said, would be separate from the three-member Council of Economic Advisers, whose role is to evaluate the economic impact of the President's policies. The new council would effectively usurp the role of the existing Domestic Policy and Economic Policy Councils. It would be modeled after the National Security Council and headed by an assistant to the President for economic affairs, who would coordinate the efforts of Cabinet departments that handle economic affairs, the advisers said.
 
Littler Rock Meeting Planned
 The transition leaders, Vernon E. Jordan and Warren Christopher, appearing on four television news programs, said they had been given the responsibility of filling 27 major Administration posts by Inauguration Day. They also said they would bring "structural change" to the new White House that would include fulfilling Mr. Clinton's campaign pledge to reduce the White House staff by 25 percent. 
 The top 27 jobs would presumably include all the senior Cabinet posts, but Mr. Jordan said it would not include the new official whom Mr. Clinton has promised to appoint to coordinate Federal response to AIDS.
"I think it's fair to say that sometime very soon, that the Governor will convene in Little Rock business leaders, economists, a variety of people with expertise in the economy and international economy to come and have a conversation with the Governor and with Senator Gore about priorities and about his approach," said Mr. Jordan, who is the chairman of Mr. Clinton's transition team. Senator Al Gore of Tennessee is the Vice President-elect.
 
Emphasis on Analyzing
 Mr. Christopher, the transition director, said that the business leaders would meet with Mr. Clinton in "an attempt to make an audit of where we stand now, to get advice from these individuals who run big companies or who are well known in the economics field as he moves through this process."
Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, said that Mr. Clinton was eager to hold such a meeting, probably within the next three weeks, but that no details had been worked out.
"It's an idea that's been kicked around for a while, and it's something they have talked about with the Governor," she said. "And he's high on the idea. It's something he would very much like to do.
"But it will take some more talk. There is right now no guest list, no location, no date set." The emphasis, she said, would be on analyzing the state of the economy rather than on prescribing specific solutions.
Both Mr. Christopher and Mr. Jordan, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," CBS's "Face the Nation," ABC's "This Week" and CNN's "Newsmakers Sunday," said that the first major Cabinet appointments would probably not be made before Dec. 1.
"I'm sure he wants to make careful, wise choices," Mr. Christopher said of the President-elect. "He has about 75 days between now and the time he's sworn in, and we hope to use them very well."
 
Early Announcements Possible
 Mr. Clinton, who spent his day in Little Rock exercising and attending church services, refused to respond to all specific questions about the transition, but he agreed with his new advisers that little would be done quickly.
"I'm going to work hard, but not rush decisions," Mr. Clinton told reporters after returning from jogging. "We're going to work very hard not to rush things."
He added, "I want to make some decisions in a fast way, but I want them to be good decisions, and I think it's important that we kind of get this whole thing reoriented, you know."
Mr. Jordan said that if Mr. Clinton was satisfied with "the person" and "the process" the transition team had set up, some announcement could conceivably be made by Thanksgiving.
"We will do it with a word, or phrase, that I am not sure I want to use -- with all deliberate speed," Mr. Jordan said.
Mr. Jordan also said that he assumed that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, would serve out his term, which expires in 1995. But he added that he had not yet had "a specific conversation" with Mr. Clinton about the subject.
Mr. Clinton said today that he had been resting since Election Day to overcome the exhaustion of the campaign and that he had been reading briefing books provided him by his transition staff.
"I was so exhausted I couldn't read very much for two days," Mr. Clinton said. He said he advised his staff to stop thinking about the campaign and sleep for two days. But he said he did not know when he would take a formal vacation.
"The way things are going, I've got a notion there won't be a lot of vacations in that first year," he said. "There's a world of work to be done."
Mr. Christopher, who met with Mr. Clinton over chicken soup at the Governor's mansion last week, said he expected that the emphasis of Mr. Clinton's first months in office would remain on economic concerns, and that appointments in that area would be equivalent in importance to appointments made to the National Security Council.
He also said he expected that Mr. Clinton would travel to Washington to meet with Congressional leaders at some point during the transition. Mr. Clinton told reporters today that he had not decided when that would occur.
Mr. Christopher confirmed that there had been a struggle for power among some of Mr. Clinton's former campaign staff members about who would run the transition. At the time, some campaign officials involved in the fight publicly called reports of discord "ridiculous."
"Governor Clinton resolved it very quickly," Mr. Christopher said today. "It was not allowed to fester."
Mr. Jordan, who is a senior partner in the Washington law firm of Akin, Gump, Hauer & Feld, also said that he would not advise clients who do business with the Federal Government during the time he helped Mr. Clinton with the transition. But he said he would continue to participate on the boards of corporations on which he serves, with the understanding that he would divulge no details of transition planning.
"The one thing I've learned on these boards is when to talk and when not to talk," he said. "I've learned that as a lawyer. I understand privilege, I understand confidentiality. And this will prevail in that process."
Unlike Mr. Christopher, who said on Friday that he assumed that by taking the transition job he would be taking himself out of the running for a Cabinet post, Mr. Jordan made no attempt to do so today. He has been mentioned most frequently as a candidate for Attorney General.
"You know, to everything there is a season," he said. "Right now, this is the transition season. At some point in that transition season, that bridge will obviously have to be crossed and will be dealt with then."

HEADLINE: A Culture Strives to Root in Freedom's Stony Soil

SERIES: The Arts in Russia: A Loss of Glory -- First of three articles

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
The collapse of Communism and the Soviet empire awakened widespread hopes that the arts in Russia, so long repressed, might suddenly blossom into a new golden age. But that flowering has been blighted by the grim, uncertain realities of the country's economic and political life.
Although there are signs of stability in the provinces and of innovation throughout this vast land, the most immediate image of the country's cultural life is of poverty and creative paralysis. A cultural establishment accustomed to virtually total state support and centralized control was suddenly cut adrift, its subsidies reduced by fiat and inflation and its administrators forced to cope on their own. And it was the most prominent museums, theaters and conservatories, the glories of the Soviet system, which had the greatest obstacles to overcome. 
 The lack of money, the dead hand of the past and an almost hopeless capitulation to the worst of the West can now be seen everywhere: in routine performances before dated and shabby opera sets at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, in crumbling hallways and decaying facades at the country's leading museums and conservatories, in cheap popular entertainments at its theaters, in third-rate American films on television and in movie theaters, in pornography sold at flea markets.
Most established artists and arts administrators believe that the artistic life of the country has suffered with the breakup of the Soviet Union. "The whole level of culture has been lowered," said Yevgeny Y. Sidorov, the Russian Minister of Culture, who is an ally of President Boris N. Yeltsin with firm progressive credentials.
Anatoly F. Malkov, the administrative director of the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, the home of the Kirov Opera and Ballet, was optimistic about his own companies, but pessimistic about the country as a whole. "My general impression is that the situation is getting worse," he said. "And to a great extent, that is connected with the difficult economic situation of the country at large."
The most immediate sign of crisis has been an extraordinary diaspora of Russian arts and artists. Sometimes the flight to the West, of performing groups capitalizing on known artistic brand names, or cobbled together for the sole purpose of earning hard currency, becomes dizzying in its confusion.
"They're tripping over one another," said the promoter John Cripton of Satra Arts International, speaking of four competing Red Army Choruses that have crisscrossed North America this year.
Most museums still refuse to "deaccession" -- to sell off their assets -- but they happily diminish their collections by sending them on long tours with precious little in the way of exchange exhibitions from the West. Contemporary artists are likewise restless. Oleg Kulik, who runs the Regina Gallery in Moscow, grumbled: "No artist here loves his country. They all want to go to New York."
 
An Upward Talent Drain
 The drain began before the relaxation of Soviet rigor by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, with dissidents, star soloists and rank-and-file dancers and orchestral musicians. Some emigrated to Israel. Many more are fleeing now to the West, or even to other former Communist countries, in search of hard currency and a better life. Every absence worsens the quality of artistic experiences available to Russian audiences now and Russian arts students for the future.
"This year we lost seven solo dancers, who went to Moscow and St. Petersburg to replace others who went to the West," said Igor M. Nepomnyashchy, the director of the Voronezh State Opera, Ballet and Theater, 300 miles south of Moscow. "It takes years to train a good dancer."
 
Decentralization
No More Control, No More Money

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, one unlamented victim was the old Soviet Ministry of Culture, which with the Communist Party, the K.G.B. and the various artists' organizations sought to control the arts from on high. In its place, Russia and each of the former Soviet republics gained their own ministries of culture.
Yet the Russian ministry's role and budget were sharply reduced as part of President Yeltsin's decentralizing reforms. Mr. Sidorov, the Minister of Culture, said that under the Soviet system, culture received between 3 and 4 percent of the national budget but that now the share was below 1 percent.
And the regional and municipal agencies that are supposed to fill the gap are undeveloped or are crippled by the country's economic upheavals and rampant inflation. The old Soviet artists' unions or associations have lost most state subsidies, and artists are being forced to struggle for survival on their own.
Nor has there been much help from sponsors, or private and corporate philanthropists. Mr. Sidorov, the Minister of Culture, along with arts leaders all over the country, laments the absence of a provision in the tax laws that would significantly reward arts support. The current law allows companies to donate 2 percent of earnings, but the definition of a nonprofit entity is vague (if a troupe sells tickets at the box office it may not qualify), and Mr. Sidorov would like the figure raised to 5 percent. So far, efforts to pass such a reform have been bottled up in the recalcitrant Russian parliament.
 
Cultural Plenty, on Paper
 Even without its former Soviet satellite republics, the Russian cultural establishment is enormous. According to figures supplied by the Ministry of Culture, there are 402 state-supported seasonlong repertory theaters in Russia. These include 23 opera and ballet companies (the two are usually combined here) and 19 theaters for operetta and musical comedy. There are 80 full-scale symphony orchestras. There are more than 200 major arts museums (the figure is vague because some museums blend in history and natural history). There are nearly 4,000 state-supported music schools. In each case "state" can mean national, regional or municipal, with many institutions now falling painfully into the cracks.
 
Coping
Trying to Stretch What Isn't There

Some of the big performing institutions have managed to sustain performances and hold ticket prices within reach of their old audiences (at the Bolshoi, Russians can still pay as little as 3 rubles, or about 1 cent, while tourists are asked to pay up to $75 in hard currency). But others have watched their audiences slip away, unable to afford rising ticket prices, distracted by popular entertainment on television or, in the words of Mikhail V. Bychkov of the Voronezh Theater for Youth, "spending time trying to find food, clothing, everything."
Some former showcases of Russian culture, like the Pushkin Drama Theater in St. Petersburg, rent out their space several nights a week for popular revues or commercial exhibitions. "It's another lost fragment of our national culture," lamented Leonid N. Nadirov, the director of the Vaganova Ballet Academy in St. Petersburg and himself a former actor. "There are still people there who worked with the famous actors of the previous century."
Most arts institutions seem unsure about how to cope in a new international world in which their currency is practically worthless, and how to handle the new fund-raising and marketing needs thrust upon them by the withdrawal of state control and support. "Not everyone is inclined to appeal for help," said Vladislav A. Chernushenko plaintively. Mr. Chernushenko is the rector of the Rimsky-Korsakov State Conservatory in St. Petersburg, and his biggest problem is obtaining quality musical instruments from the West, for which he needs hard currency.
 
The Day-at-a-Time Approach
 In the general economic confusion, long-term planning becomes nearly impossible as attention is focused on day-to-day survival. Backstage machinery and physical plants grow antiquated and dangerous. Even now, with the first snow of the season gracing the bare trees and crumbling facades, ("Winter is not all bad; it covers the dirt," Muscovites like to say), the decay of the infrastructure cannot be escaped.
Mr. Bychkov in Voronezh needs 3 million rubles to fix a leaky roof, but has no prospect of getting it. Even when restorations are undertaken, they are often protracted into a years-long holding pattern in which nothing much seems to get done, as in the desultory construction at the Tretyakov Museum in Moscow. The new wings are handsome and up to date, but the main central building has been closed for eight years.
Most museums, like the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, have little immediate hope of installing modern air-conditioning or security systems, leading to fears in the West that their masterpieces may be damaged or stolen. And masterpieces they are: the Hermitage has one of the great collections of Western art, with especially extensive examples by nearly every major Italian, Flemish and French artist from the Renaissance to early modernism.
On the horizon looms an even greater danger to the large museums. In the treaty establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States, it was agreed that cultural artifacts from the former Soviet republics would be returned to them. Although no formal claim has yet been filed, Ukraine has threatened to do so, and Russian officials are apprehensive.
 
Specter of Culture Wars
 "This is a very serious issue," said Dr. Vitaly A. Suslov, who retired this past summer as director of the Hermitage. "The agreement was not properly thought out. If we had to return objects, science at large would suffer. It would be as if all the Italian and Dutch paintings were taken from the Louvre."
Anatoly N. Konstantinov, of the Mayor's Cultural Committee in St. Petersburg, said, "If this decision were implemented, we would lose the Hermitage Museum completely."
 
Artistic Effects
Old Methods, But New Problems

Most of the big state institutions are still administered by holdovers from the Soviet regime, people who either were Communists or had made some sort of peace with the old regime. Many are simply unable at this stage of their lives to adapt to the straitened economic realities and the artistic challenges of today.
"Instead of trying to create a new kind of theater, they struggle to sustain the kind of theater they had before," complained Mr. Bychkov in Voronezh. "In the current situation, that's outdated." An official of the United States Embassy in Moscow, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "Younger people who work in these institutions are dying to do different things, but they are terrified."
Big companies like the Kirov Opera can at least count on sponsorship from well-established firms, Russian and Western, that hope to profit from an association with a widely recognized artistic brand name. The Kirov Opera's summer tour to New York included transportation provided by Baltia Air Lines, which said it "wanted to be linked with the best."
Smaller troupes, museums and municipal arts programs, victims of cutbacks at the local level, must rely more heavily on private sponsors. But in Russia's chaotic economy, that is an almost impossibly unsure way to build a company over the long run.
Yevgeny Panfilov, a modern-dance choreographer in Perm, near the Urals in central Russia, dramatically shaved his flowing locks last spring to protest the reneging of a local sponsor. Mr. Panfilov later conceded, puckishly, that he also rather liked baldness as a fashion statement. The loss of the promised funds was no laughing matter, however: it meant Mr. Panfilov had to cancel a new production of his Experiment Modern Ballet Troupe, and his dancers went without pay for several months.
"A lot of people who are very wealthy now in this country are not very cultivated," said Viktoriya Pavlova of Ardani, a private arts management organization in Moscow. "They have no idea what modern dance or the avant-garde is. They simply do not understand what it means to be a sponsor. They think we bring them rubles, and they somehow gain hard currency."
Writers, painters and other individual artists are suffering from a collapse of the Soviet institutions that assured them privileges and access to the public. In every city, composers or writers' unions offered publication, performances, income, pensions, weekend homes and a host of other benefits, along with repressive ideological control.
 
No Skills Beyond Art
 Though many such unions have been given their buildings by the regional authorities, they have little money to sustain their privileges. For artists accustomed to the old system, with or without political complicity on their part, adjustment to a free-market artistic climate, as in the West, can be painful.
"A hundred members of the Artists' Union used to work and live in Voronezh," said Yuri Pchelkin, the head of the Arts Department of the Regional Department of Culture in Voronezh and a proud former Communist. "Now, no one buys their paintings. What can the artists live on? They have no other skills or professions. It's not right."
Former dissidents who never, or only fitfully, enjoyed Soviet sinecures are often discouraged, as well. For them, the solidarity they experienced in common opposition to the state has been replaced by a queasy sense of uncertainty, a loss of center and purpose. For some, the depredations of capitalism are as painful as the repressions of totalitarianism.
"Today, you can do what you want and make a living out of it," said Garik Sukachev, the lead singer of Brigada S, a popular and respected Moscow rock band. "But the hard thing is that somehow it evolves into a profession, and it was never supposed to be that."
 
Popular Arts
High Art's Woes Are Low Art's, Too

Curiously, given the widespread complaints in Russia about the triumph of commercialization in the arts, the popular arts are in similar crisis. Film production has almost ceased at the old Soviet studios, and private investment is erratic at best and shady at worst. At the last Berlin International Film Festival, a common thread in discussions of film financing in Eastern Europe was that underworld money, in need of laundering, was being plowed into any and all film projects.
In fact, few films are being made in Russia today. With a ramshackle distribution system and heavy competition from cheap or pirated Hollywood rejects, the chances for profit are slim. Especially since so many contemporary Russian films accent a bleakness that can hardly be expected to entertain a large public. "The tone of Russian movies is too gloomy," said Sergei V. Koptilov of AIST, the private television station in Irkutsk. "They promote the black side of Russian reality."
The former state television networks limp on, plagued by inefficiencies, nepotism and a capitulation to the sorts of soap operas and game shows that routinely clutter Western television. Leonid Orlov, a producer for the second, and supposedly innovative, national channel, complained that "a lot of the people who work there aren't even professionals." High culture on the state networks has declined. The most popular program in the country just now -- work in offices and shops grinds to a halt when it comes on -- is a Mexican soap opera called "The Rich Also Cry."
 
Lure of Private Enterprise
 Private television stations like AIST, which have sprung up around the country, have siphoned off many of the trained technicians who used to work at the state stations. But they are usually reduced, given Russia's economic woes and its refusal to sign the Bern copyright convention, to recycling Hollywood's worst.
"The distributors try to get the cheapest films possible," said Mr. Koptilov in Irkutsk. "Sometimes they ignore the copyright laws and show good American films, just to prove that American movies aren't always bad. If anyone complains about copyright questions, it's the distributor's problem, not ours; we just buy them."
Rock and jazz, though still popular among young people, have been undercut by commercial pop music far removed from the political and moral passions that inspired the dissident bands. "There is a distinction between rock and pop," argued Dmitri Groisman, the manager of Brigada S. "Rock music is what was before perestroika, and pop music is the result of perestroika."
In the Communist system, there was a coherent network of folk groups and community arts activities, often paid for by contributions, voluntary or expected, from factories and workers' groups. But in many Russian cities, former community centers stand empty as local amateur folk-dance groups, choruses and theater ensembles have withered away.
Throughout the country, leaders in the arts seem overwhelmed by the despair and confusion of their everyday lives. Vladimir Martyanov, a composer of sacred music who teaches at the Zagorsk monastery near Moscow, worried that "as in the West, more freedom does not automatically mean a deeper or better culture."
Mr. Sidorov, the Minister of Culture, put it this way: "Now," he said, "we are free, proud but poor."

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Facing Deficit of $260 Million

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
In the opening move of a complex political joust likely to last into next year, the New York City Transit Authority will announce this week that it is facing a 1993 deficit of about $260 million, Transit Authority officials said.
For New York City residents, such deficits -- the result of declining tax revenues and continued low bus and subway ridership -- have become something of a fall ritual auguring the threat, implied or overt, of a fare increase. This year is no different. 
 "The fare increase is the least attractive alternative," said John Cunningham, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency. "But without financial assistance, it remains an alternative."
 
Competing Interests
 But whether that most drastic and politically unpalatable step occurs depends on the intricate byplay of Albany politics. In a special session expected to start in December, the State Legislature will debate not only the Transit Authority deficit, but also proposals to help the agency replace, rebuild and renovate its aging systems to attract new riders and -- Transit Authority officials hope -- prevent future deficits.
The debate will pit region against region, city against suburb, even borough against borough. And on a much broader scale, it is part of an unfolding dialogue over the allocation of $16 billion in new state and Federal transportation funds expected to flow through Albany in the next six years.
How the Legislature deals with the M.T.A. this winter is likely to set the tone for how those billions will be spent into the next decade.
"How do you divvy all this up?" said Steven A. Greenberg, spokesman for Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin. "Mass transit or roads? Upstate or down? There are a lot of questions."
The deficit is primarily the result of the region's weak economy, M.T.A. officials say. A slump in real-estate sales has caused the authority's revenue from taxes on those transactions to drop from $302 million in 1988 to $118 million this year, according to M.T.A. statistics.
To close the shortfall in the Transit Authority's anticipated $3.7 billion budget, prevent a 1993 fare increase and finance a five-year capital program, the M.T.A., which has an overall $5 billion budget, has developed a sweeping legislative proposal that includes these measures:
*The State Legislature would allocate more funds from state and Federal sources to mass transit. The largest of these pots is $700 million from the petroleum business tax; the M.T.A. wants half of it.
*The Legislature would give the M.T.A. greater discretion in parceling out its government subsidies. Currently, strict formulas prevent the authority from moving funds from its cash-rich division, the commuter railroads, to its deficit-ridden one, the buses and subways.
*New York City would give the Transit Authority $65 million more in operating funds.
*Tolls at the nine bridges and tunnels operated by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority would be increased 20 percent in January. Public hearings on the proposed increase, which would provide about $45 million to the Transit Authority, will begin this week.
These are big ifs. Only the toll increase, which is subject to approval by the M.T.A. board, seems certain.
Upstate legislators will want more money from the petroleum tax to go toward road and bridge construction. Suburban legislators will be squeamish about allowing the M.T.A. to divert subsidies meant for the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North to subways and buses. And residents in Queens and Staten Island are objecting to toll increases on the bridge and tunnel authority crossings, which include the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the Triborough Bridge and the Queens Midtown Tunnel.
M.T.A. officials concede they face a daunting task. But they say they most want to avoid a replay of the bitter 1992 budget fight in which the Legislature approved one-shot accounting maneuvers that closed the Transit Authority's $165 million deficit without providing means to prevent the 1993 shortfall.
 
Long-Term Deal Sought
 Even if the transit fare does not increase next year, the M.T.A. officials say, they could still emerge losers this winter if they do not win larger measures that make the authority more self-sustaining and less vulnerable to the annual rites of budget brinkmanship.
"If all they do is save the fare, they won't give something real to riders," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a subway-riders advocacy group.
Key to the M.T.A.'s long-term plans is a $10 billion, five-year capital plan. Earlier this year, the Legislature approved only the first year of that plan.
But M.T.A. officials say they cannot invest in major improvements without at least a five-year plan in place. And many of those improvements are central to the M.T.A.'s broader vision for preventing future operating deficits, the officials say.
Labeled the "Fare Deal" by Peter E. Stengl, the M.T.A. chairman, the plan sounds as simple as Marketing 101: improve services, keep fares down, and the riders and their money will come. The plan calls for Transit Authority fares to rise only once before 1997: to $1.50 in 1994.
Improvements would range from the small, such as improving the public-address system, to the large, such as installing automated fare-collection systems, which would enable the Transit Authority to offer a wide range of discounted fares, including reduced prices for two-fare zones and monthly passes.
"We're approaching things differently this year," said Mr. Cunningham. "If you are constantly on a treadmill to raise fares and cut services, you can't attract new riders."
But the fate of the plan in Albany depends heavily on two people: Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and State Senator Norman J. Levy, the Republican chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee.
This week, the staffs of Governor Cuomo, State Senator Ralph J. Marino, the Senate majority leader, and Mr. Weprin are expected to meet to begin thrashing out the proposals.
Mr. Cuomo, who can provide the most carrots and sticks in Albany, has the greatest power to bring harmony to the cacophonous Legislature. Some transit advocates say he will be particularly motivated to push M.T.A. proposals this year to help Mayor David N. Dinkins, who is up for re-election next year.
"Fares just do not go up just before mayoral elections," said Mr. Russianoff.
To many in the Republican-controlled Senate, Mr. Levy is the last word on transportation issues. Earlier this year, the Nassau County legislator blocked the shifting of $90 million in surplus money from the commuter railroads to the Transit Authority. As a result, the city and state had to contribute millions more to prevent bus and subway fares from rising to $1.40.
"The M.T.A. proposals are very complicated," said Bill Stevens, a spokesman for Mr. Marino. "Senator Levy will clearly be involved in any thoughts about what will happen with them."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Post-Election, Bonds Remain Vulnerable

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
A lot of uncertainties for the bond market were eliminated last week. But not enough was made clear to fire up a rally or push market yields out of their recent trading range.
Right now, the market is vulnerable to prices falling a little further and yields inching up, even above the 7.76 percent yield reached Friday on the 30-year bond -- the highest since the end of June. At the same time, balancing forces -- the old friends of slow economic growth and low inflation -- help check any rout. 
 "The scales are evenly balanced," said Stephen Maher, head of fixed income at Nikko Securities. "I can't see this market climbing out of this range that it is in."
What happens beyond the spring -- when the promises of the Clinton campaign should be becoming programs of the new administration -- is much harder to forecast. Remember that just two months ago, as the bond market rallied to a 7.21 percent yield on the long bond, the lowest in six years, many forecasters were talking of reaching 7 percent soon.
 
Continued Vulnerability
 John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said the market would remain vulnerable over the next several months because of the uncertainty of the new Presidency and doubts about the economy. But he still forecasts that by the end of next year continued slow economic growth and low inflation will bring yields down again, leaving the 30-year bond with a yield in the 7.5 percent range.
Between the election on Tuesday and the October unemployment figures released on Friday, several important questions were answered.
But traders and investors are still wondering what kind of fiscal stimulus program President-elect Bill Clinton will propose. And they want to know who will be appointed to the crucial economic positions in his Administration, especially Treasury Secretary.
"If Clinton would give us a couple of appointments, that would help the market," said Barbara L. Kenworthy, portfolio manager for taxable fixed-income funds at the Dreyfus Corporation. "The infighting raises uncertainty."
 
A Confidence Factor
 Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said he did not think Clinton policies or proposals "would have any direct impact on the economy for some time." But, he added that the appointments "will have a confidence-related impact."
Mr. Kudlow, the former chief economist in the Office of Management and Budget at the beginning of the Reagan Administration, said he is not worried. "I am taking the attitude that Clinton ran a brilliant campaign and will make equally good appointments," he said, adding that he thought the President-elect would work with the current chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan.
The unemployment report showed the economy was still weak yet inching ahead, with an increase of 27,000 in nonfarm jobs. Other data, including car and truck sales and initial claims for unemployment compensation, indicate that the economy may be rising to a firmer footing if not growing a little faster than expected.
Both the Clinton Presidency, until its plans for fiscal stimulus are outlined, and the slightly firmer economic signals seem to end for now the speculation over whether the Fed will ease interest rates further, which is a certain disappointment for the bond market.
 
No Easing Seen
 "Given the context, no Fed easing is plausible," Mr. Lipsky said. Ms. Kenworthy said the Fed probably would not ease because it wanted to wait to see what Mr. Clinton would propose.
"The economic numbers will give the Fed the opportunity to do so if they want to," she said. "But politically I am not sure they will."
Compounding these uncertainties is this week's Treasury auction of $37 billion of 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. This certain pipeline of new supply has already helped knock prices down sharply, with the 30-year bond tumbling more than three-quarters of a point on Friday.
For all these reasons, Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., does not expect the Treasury auction to go all that well. "The market has a downward momentum and the psychology is very poor right now," he said.
He also also suggested that the Veterans Day holiday on Wednesday, when the bond market will be closed, could hurt by interrupting whatever momentum might develop.
The bidding will be done under the traditional system where the securities are awarded starting with bids at the lowest yield (highest price) and rising until all the securities are sold. Under this system, one dealer can pay more than another for the same security.
But auctions are hard to predict. Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said he thought the yields on the notes and bonds to be auctioned were attractive, especially after the selloff on Friday.
The 5.11 percent yield at which the three-year note was trading in the pre-auction or when-issued market was the highest since the beginning of July, just before the two most recent cuts in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
Of the three auctions, this should do the best, analysts said, because of the attractive yield and the shorter maturity, which makes the purchase less risky. (In pre-auction trading Friday, the yield on the 10-year note was at 6.99 percent and the 30-year bond at 7.64 percent.)
Many traders said the selloff on Friday was mostly motivated by dealers trying to set up for the auction. The selling cleared dealers' shelves and brought prices down and pushed yields up to make them more attractive.
"It is healthy to get set before the auction," Ms. Kenworthy said. "Why give the Treasury a break? Let's give ourselves a break. This is what we want to see happen so that we can have good bidding at the auction."

HEADLINE: A Quiet Alteration at Brooks Bros.

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
When Brooks Brothers installed escalators in its flagship store on Madison Avenue three years ago, it incited something approaching hysteria among its clientele. The offending contraptions, standard fixtures in most stores of more than two levels, became the symbol of unwelcome change at an institution that had stoically upheld the status quo for well over 150 years.
Today the escalators rarely arouse the attention of anyone other than the occasional repairman, and the revolution they were supposed to portend has failed to materialize. Brooks Brothers has instead undergone an appropriately subdued metamorphosis, evident in Hermes-esque neckwear, stylishly faded sports shirts and stirrup pants hanging unobtrusively alongside the rep ties, button-downs and kilts that are the chain's signature merchandise. 
 Its most obvious deference to the times is the liberation of its boxer shorts, now ensconced in help-yourself fixtures instead of discreetly housed under glass counters.
 
Owned by British Retailer
 After four tumultuous years in which economic recession and life-style changes made the nation's oldest retail clothier seem every bit of its 174 years, Brooks Brothers has finally started giving Marks & Spencer P.L.C. a return on the $750 million it spent to acquire the company in 1988.
In a recent interview, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks & Spencer, firmly set aside the persistent rumor that the British retailer wanted to sell Brooks Brothers. "We're here for the long run," he said, although tartly adding that Marks & Spencer had paid too much for its American subsidiary.
For the year that ended on March 31, Brooks Brothers' sales rose 4.6 percent to $314 million, an increase that was somewhat better than average compared with other American retailers. But operating profits accelerated 64 percent, thanks to stringent cost controls and computerized inventory management systems. For the first six months of fiscal 1992, through September, operating profits rose 30 percent from the comparable period a year ago, while sales increased about 10 percent.
"The message today is: we're back," said William V. Roberti, president of Brooks Brothers, who nonetheless is still sensitive about the escalators. He refused to have his photograph taken anywhere near them.
Independent assessments of the chain's status are difficult to obtain. British investment analysts who follow Marks & Spencer say Brooks's parent keeps news about its American stepchild to itself. And since Brooks contributes less than 2 percent to the bottom line and generates only about 3 percent of the British retailer's revenue, they find it easy to ignore. "I'm quite sure you know much more than us," said one analyst at a major British investment bank.
 
Locked Into a Niche
 Retail consultants contend that Brooks's very strength, its lock on the niche market for traditional clothing, is its weakness. They say Brooks has so locked itself into that niche that it cannot respond to changes in tastes. "They cannot go out of suit," said Walter K. Levy of Walter K. Levy & Robert E. Kerson Associates Inc., a retail consulting firm. "They have no credibility with the updated customer."
The chain has also been dogged by questions about the quality of its merchandise and its relevance in a world enamored of deconstructed casual clothes, jeans and Lycra. It narrowly averted a strike by unionized employees this spring, and the weak economy in Japan is buffeting its stores there.
Most recently, Consumer Reports gave a lukewarm rating to a $595 Brooks Brothers suit called a Brooks Ease, the chain's second-best seller in tailored clothing. While the magazine's panel, which tested 17 men's suits, gave the Brooks suit high marks for tailoring, it did not like the way it dry-cleaned, its finishing details or its price. In fact, the panel preferred $240 and $325 suits from J. C. Penney to the Brooks suit.
The peppery Sir Richard is undaunted, although irritated, by such adversity. "Men have got to have a trouser to cover their backsides," he said, putting into perspective others' concerns about the impact of currency fluctuations, the weak Japanese economy and declining sales of the tailored suits that were once Brooks Brothers' bread and butter.
For men who still want a suit but do not want to spend $500 or more, Brooks has developed what it calls the Wardrobe Collection. Using new dyeing techniques that allow it to match different bolts of fabric instead of having to use the same bolt of woven fabric to create a suit, Brooks Brothers has cultivated sales of "suit separates," pants and jackets for men whose waistlines are out of synch with their shoulders or who simply want to mix and match. The Wardrobe Collection, with jackets priced at $270 and trousers for $125, gives Brooks a bridge to customers who are looking for more moderately priced clothes.
As for Consumer Reports, Sir Richard said, "I find it utterly appalling and disgraceful that any trade paper, magazine or newspaper can, on the basis of one garment when we sell thousands and thousands, use that garment as a yardstick by which we are judged."
Mr. Roberti said the suit used by the magazine to test quality had been made in 1989 in a factory the company no longer used. He said new technology in tailoring and sewing had improved all of Brooks's suits since then.
And the computerized systems Marks & Spencer has installed to monitor Brooks's inventory, distribution and buying should insure that no suit made in 1989 is available for sale in 1992. In the use of computers to reduce costs and increase productivity, Marks & Spencer is the British version of Wal-Mart, and the parent has shared its expertise with its subsidiary.
Sir Richard said he had been shocked by how backward the chain had been when Marks & Spencer had acquired it, technologically and physically. On his first visit to the flagship store, he tripped over a hole in the carpeting.
"We had to maintain all the best traditions of Brooks Brothers and what it stands for, but that doesn't mean we have to keep it dowdy and hidebound," he said. "We want to attract somebody who wants more than a gray flannel suit."
Unlike many of its competitors in the tailored clothing business, Brooks has recognized a fundamental shift in the psyche of its customers. Unemployment has affected the ranks of loyal suit wearers in banking, law and financial services, and those who have managed to hang on to their jobs think twice about paying $600 for a new suit. More fundamentally, corporate culture is relaxing, making twill pants and a sportcoat acceptable attire in an increasing number of workplaces.
 
Permanent Taste Change Seen
 "I don't see the suit business coming back," Mr. Roberti said. "The life-style change we're seeing now is permanent."
Brooks is keeping step with what it calls the Friday shirt, a less formal shirt with a button-through breast pocket, and items like whimsical ties and soft, pigment-dyed shirts that should generate $1 million in revenue for Brooks this year. The chain introduced varsity jackets, this fall's fashion statement, three years ago, and at $195 the garments are competitive with those The Gap has made famous.
Therein lies perhaps the most nettling of Brooks' problems: getting its message out to new, younger consumers whose tastes are markedly different from that of their grandfathers. While the Gap has unabashedly used eye-catching advertising to make varsity jackets de rigueur, at Brooks Brothers they have been a well-kept secret for three years, like many of the chain's other gems.
But Mr. Roberti and Sir Richard shake their heads emphatically when asked whether Brooks will use advertising to draw attention from a new clientele. Mr. Roberti said the chain was instead using thirtysomething models in its catalogues to convey its unbuttoned side and posters in each of its departments to clearly spell out the message that Brooks Brothers clothes have value.
"We don't spend a whole lot on advertising and marketing -- don't believe in it," Mr. Roberti said. "The downside is you don't get recognized for doing anything."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
A Judge's Interest in Being Governor Is Decided the Hard Way

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
AS Chief Judge of New York State's highest court, Sol Wachtler was the Republican Party's great robed hope -- the suburban, moderate, Jewish jurist who might some day challenge the Democratic hegemony that has held the governorship since 1974.
Judge Wachtler himself was ambivalent about elective politics. His arrest Saturday by Federal agents, who accused him of a bizarre extortion scheme involving a woman with whom he had had a long relationship, renders the debate all but irrelevant. 
 When, 25 years ago, he was defeated for Nassau County Executive, he announced that he could see no circumstance that would draw him into politics. Five years later, though, he mounted a successful campaign for the Court of Appeals. The race was remarkable for its high cost and for a television commercial in which Mr. Wachtler, slamming a jail door, pledged to "get the thieves and muggers and murderers into these cells."
As an associate judge of the Court of Appeals, he nearly declared his candidacy for Governor once. (Among those who he said had encouraged him to run was Mario M. Cuomo, then the Lieutenant Governor). But one weekend at the United States Open tennis tournament at Forest Hills, a brash upstart named Donald J. Trump wagged his finger in Judge Wachtler's face and said, as the judge later recalled, "I hear you may run; we should talk."
If that encounter suggested the pandering to which Judge Wachtler would have to stoop during a campaign, he wanted no part of it. He held his news conference, on schedule, but announced that he would not run.
Three years later, Mr. Cuomo appointed him Chief Judge. Twice since then, leading Republicans urged him to challenge Mr. Cuomo. He politely declined. Bereft of talent, the party of giants like Thomas E. Dewey and Nelson A. Rockefeller chose lesser candidates: Andrew J. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, who was reduced to toting around a cardboard cutout of Mr. Cuomo to dramatize the Governor's disinclination to debate; and Pierre A. Rinfret, an economist whose name was plucked from a telephone book and whose campaign proved embarrassing.
Last week, Republicans survived a Clinton landslide in New York -- retaining control of the State Senate and preserving the United States Senate seat that they have held for nearly five decades. But nothing would invigorate the party more than to win the governorship in 1994.
Judge Wachtler's uncle, Abe Minsky, once confided to him a fundamental tenet of burlesque: a woman is most alluring when she leaves more to the imagination. The same rule applies to politicians. Another cardinal rule of politics is that you can't beat something with nothing, which may leave Republicans in the same straits as in 1986 and 1990.
Among those who may run are Richard Rosenbaum, an affable former Rochester judge and Republican state chairman, and Evan Galbraith, who, because he had served as Ambassador to France, failed four years ago to meet the state residency requirement. That impediment might also disqualify Jack Kemp, who moved to Washington to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
That leaves, among others, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who, immediately after winning a third term last week, retreated from his pledges not to seek re-election or to run for Governor. Mr. D'Amato is regarded as so Machiavellian (make that Bismarckian, to avoid inferences of ethnic stereotyping) that the elaborate sting operation that snared Judge Wachtler and the unseemly clambering for credit by so many prosecutors even raised the suggestion that Mr. D'Amato, somehow, had had a hand in it.
Judge Wachtler and Mr. D'Amato were products of the Nassau County Republican machine. But they differed philosophically and politically -- particularly since the Senator, as Judge Wachtler recalled, had crowed that Mr. Cuomo would never name him Chief Judge and because Mr. D'Amato originally promoted another New York jurist, Roger J. Miner, for the United States Supreme Court, without even mentioning Judge Wachtler's name publicly.
It was uncertain whether Judge Wachtler would have agreed to run for Governor in 1994. But he was certainly considering it. He was reluctant to relinquish the power to shape judicial precedent and policy; yet he was frustrated at the shortage of funds. He was increasingly angry with Mr. Cuomo, describing his unusual lawsuit against the Governor over court financing as his most agonizing decision.
The judge's second most agonizing decision might have been whether to run for Governor. He planned to decide by next summer. If he decided yes, he planned to resign from the court and announce that he was exploring a possible candidacy -- assuming, until Saturday, that he would have the nomination for the asking.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
A G.M. Issue Has Created An Anomaly

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IN a world of uncertainties, it is unusual to find one investment that is absolutely certain to be better than a competing investment, no matter what else happens in the world.
But that is the case now in General Motors securities. General Motors common stock is clearly a superior investment at current prices relative to one type of G. M. preferred stock, known on Wall Street as a perc, for preferred equity redemption certificate. That will be true if G. M. stock goes up, or if it falls, or if it does nothing. 
 The anomaly, which has persisted for several weeks, reflects investors' desire for current yield on their investments. The G. M. perc does provide a better current yield than the G.M. common, but that advantage will not last long and is more than offset by the higher price.
What has happened is that some mutual funds have locked up large quantities of the G. M. percs to get high reported yields for their funds. Yields are a big selling point with some funds, and that may have helped them in marketing.
But as Emmett J. Hardy, president of the Parallax Group of Stamford, Conn., and an expert on such securities, notes: "There is more to investing than simply looking for current yield. There is a buzzsaw waiting to take their heads off."
There is not a lot of argument on that point. "Anybody who has looked at those percs says they are overpriced," said John Maurice, co-manager of the Putnam Growth and Income Fund, which at last report owned 800,000 G. M. percs. So why does the fund own them? "For the yield," he replied, adding that an income-oriented fund could not participate in G. M. because of its low dividend, except through the percs. Mr. Maurice said the fund still owned a large position in the security, but declined to say whether it was more or less than at the last required report.
Here is how the G. M. perc works: It pays a $3.31 annual dividend, and because it is a preferred stock, that payout is quite secure, even though the common dividend was halved last week. At the current price of $37.625 for the G. M. perc, the yield is 8.8 percent. With today's low interest rates, that is a tempting figure. By contrast, G. M. shares, which closed Friday at $30.50, yield only 2.6 percent, based on the new annual dividend rate of 80 cents a year.
The catch is that G. M. will pay that rate on the percs only through July 1, 1994. Then the G. M. perc will convert into common stock, almost certainly at a ratio of one perc to one common share. (In the very optimistic case, where G. M. common is trading at a price above $53.79 on that date, the perc could be converted into less than one common share of G. M.)
A buyer of the G. M. perc now will get six dividend payments, one a quarter from March 1, 1993, through June 1, 1994, of 82.75 cents each. That is a total of $4.97. (The record date for the Dec. 1, 1992, payment is this Thursday, so a buyer of shares today would not get that payment, assuming the trade settled next Monday, as would normally be the case.) Then, at best, a holder of the G. M. perc will get one common share of G. M.
By contrast, a holder of one G. M. share will get six quarterly dividends of 20 cents each, assuming the dividend is maintained at the current rate, before the mandatory conversion of the percs. That adds up to $1.20, but of course it could be more or less.
If you assume that G. M. will maintain its current dividend rate, that adds up to an advantage of $3.77 in dividends for the G. M. percs over their life. The maximum advantage, of course, is $4.97. Those calculations ignore the time value of money -- the fact that a dollar a year from now is worth less than a dollar today -- so in fact the maximum price advantage of the G. M. perc over the G. M. common ought to be less. Mr. Hardy says he finds it impossible to justify a premium over $4, whatever assumptions are made. But at Friday's prices, the premium was more than $7.
One might expect arbitragers to narrow that difference. Indeed, a strategy that would seem to be guaranteed to earn a profit would be to sell the G. M. perc short and buy the common. Unfortunately, to short the perc one must be able to borrow it, and all the shares that can be borrowed have been. Thus the premium can persist unless enough current holders decide to take advantage of the anomaly and sell their shares.
Last summer, when it seemed more believable that G. M. stock would rise above the $53.79 limit by July 1, 1994, the common and the G. M. perc traded for the same price. Since then, the G.M. perc has held up better than the common, creating the clear overvaluation.
It is possible, of course, that both the G. M. common and the G. M. perc will provide good returns from here. And it is possible that neither will be a good investment. But it is impossible that the perc will do better than the common, and mutual funds that are holding onto the perc, thus inflating the reported yield of the fund, are doing a clear disservice to their customers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Magazines;
Interior Design and Social History

BYLINE: By Deirdre Carmody

 BODY:
The sale of Metropolitan Home to Hachette Magazines last week parted the curtains and provided a glimpse into one of the most fascinating and fluctuating categories in magazine publishing -- the interior design and home decorating field.
Tracking these lushly illustrated versions of the American dream usually provides pretty good social history. It did so again last week when Des Moines-based Meredith Magazines decided to cast its lot with the simpler, more traditional articulation of that dream. It sold its sophisticated urban child, Metropolitan Home, and will now stick to its knitting with Better Homes and Gardens, Traditional Home and Country Home. 
 On the other hand, Hachette is betting that although the 80's are over, even Americans on tight budgets will still want to read about beautifully appointed dwellings and furnishings they couldn't possibly afford. Met Home is, in fact, a better fit with Hachette's stylish, European-inspired Elle Decor than it was with Meredith's more practical publications.
For the last few years these two categories -- the voyeur books and the country books -- have engaged in a tug-of-war for advertisers. The high-end magazines -- Architectural Digest, HG, House Beautiful and Met Home -- have been hit particularly hard by the recession. In 1989, for instance, they totaled 4,920 advertising pages. In 1991, the number had fallen to 3,872. (Elle Decor started in 1989.)
On the other hand, the circulation of magazines like Hearst's Country Living and Colonial Homes; Hachette's Home; The New York Times Company's Decorating Remodeling, and Meredith's Traditional Home and Country Home are all up or about even for 1992's first nine months compared with a year earlier.
"The first group are the leadership books, and for the vast majority of the readership, they are a source of ideas," said George Fertitta, president of the ad agency Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss. "The second group is reality. But I don't believe that the second-tier publications could exist without the first tier."
"I think the top category can support five books," he added. "If you normally ran 20 pages of ads spread over five books, you might want to run 15 pages spread over three books and then after two years, rotate to the other two books."
Karen Ritchie, senior vice presidenta and director of media services at the ad agency McCann-Erickson in Detroit, disagrees. "I think in general there are too many magazines," she said, "and this is especially true in the shelter market.
"I think you tend to see some editorial that tends to be dated and some of these magazines locked in the 50's. This is one field where we are likely to see some fairly dramatic disasters occur."
Louis Oliver Gropp, editor in chief of House Beautiful and a former editor in chief of both HG and Elle Decor, sees the second category as "the field within the field."
"This is a whole category that grew up around the vision that Country Living first enunciated, and it is a field that has grown astronomically over the last 20 years," he said. "The top category includes people that travel more, are better educated and certainly have more worldly interests that it does take a little money to pursue.
"But something happened and there was a profound shift in the mood of the country. The 80's did leave a kind of bad taste, and some of the top magazines got borderline vulgar."
Two of the beneficiaries of the switch in mood are Deborah Jones Barrow, publisher of Traditional Home, and Karol DeWulf Nickell, editor in chief. They preside over a magazine where circulation is climbing and ad pages are up 73 percent this year compared with 1991.
The magazine is just what its name suggests, filled with articles about new country French furniture, gracious decorating for the Christmas holidays and rooms that do not look very different from the suburban homes in House Beautiful. In fact, Traditional Home, with newsstand sales of 203,000, has just surpassed House Beautiful in single-copy sales.
"Everybody thinks back to the 80's as big spending, and we are now into more family-driven values," Ms. Barrow said. If so many people's sense of themselves changed, it stands to reason that the books and magazines that honor those changes will come forward. "Certainly there is no time in the last 30 years when a magazine that has the word tradition in its title would have more marketing equity than right now as the baby boom is into its families," she said.
Better Homes and Gardens, with a circulation of eight million, is far and away the leader in the home field. David Jordan, editor in chief, thinks it is essential for his magazine and Traditional Home to be based in the Midwest rather than New York. "I think we get a sense of what's going on in the country much more than if we were in a major urban area," he said.
Better Homes focuses directly on what people can do with their families. It has spun off dozens of smaller once- or twice-a-year publications for Meredith, like Country Kitchen Ideas, Remodeling Ideas for Kids' Rooms, and Window and Wall Ideas.
Country-based publications, like Hearst's Country Living with its circulation of 1.8 million and Meredith's Country Home with one million, are also riding on a real wave. They may hit bumps in the road, however.
"We are in a country phase now, and it sounds good," Ms. Ritchie of McCann-Erickson said. "But I think they are going to find that titles like that are going to be a serious handicap someday."

HEADLINE: Peace Corps' Training Using Camden Schools

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMDEN, Nov. 7

 BODY:
In an elementary school in the poorest neighborhood of one of the most impoverished cities in the nation, graduate students from Rutgers University are training as Peace Corps volunteers.
Camden, where 65 percent of the children live below the poverty line, was seen as "perfect training for the third world," the director of the Rutgers program said. 
 Crouched next to a child-sized table, one of the graduate students, Michael Merola, dredges up bits and pieces of his high-school Spanish to coach a bewildered 8-year-old Hispanic girl in arithmetic.
"I had no idea that things could be this bad in this country," said Mr. Merola, 22, who with seven other students began work in the blighted neighborhood six weeks ago. "I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed."
 
Real-World Experience
 The four-year-old program at Rutgers's Camden campus is one of 18 master's programs in the nation run jointly by universities and the Peace Corps specifically for Peace Corps volunteers. But what has set the Rutgers program apart is the real-world experience of Camden.
"Rutgers is the only school to send people into the inner city to train as part of its formal curriculum," said Kristin Wennberg, a spokeswoman for the Peace Corps in Washington.
Three days a week, Mr. Merola, of Cranford, N.J., his fellow graduate students and 15 undergraduates in a public policy course make the trek from the Camden campus to the Rafael Cordero Molina Elementary School and the nearby Pyne Poynt School to spend two hours tutoring about 100 elementary-school children after classes have let out for the day.
"Unfortunately, Camden does mirror a lot of the problems that are experienced in third-world countries," said Ian Jacobs, an assistant professor of public policy at Rutgers University-Camden and director of its Master's in Public Policy/Peace Corps Program. "You have a high level of poverty, unemployment, poor housing and tremendous pressure on the school system.
"It's not a real positive thing, but it's a reality."
 
Cannot Rely on Native Tongue
 Another part of the reality, for many of the Rutgers students, is that for the first time, they cannot rely on English as their primary language.
Here at Molina Elementary School, Hispanic students account for 70 percent of the school's 750 children in kindergarten through fifth grade and at least that percentage of the students who attend the after-school tutoring program.
The 8-year-old girl seemed baffled by a set of simple addition problems until Mr. Merola used his halting Spanish to try to help her. She quickly seemed to grasp the problems.
"These kids are so bright and there's so much potential," he said. "The two words I hear the most during the two hours here are, 'Help me, help me.' I'm not going to change Camden in one year here. But you just have to make small victories."
Home to nearly 88,000 people, more than a third of them below 18 years old, Camden is New Jersey's sixth largest city and its poorest. Statewide and nationally, it ranks at or near the bottom in virtually every economic and social category the government measures.
Half of Camden's residents receive welfare, and its percentage of children living in poverty, 65, is the highest of any major United States city. The teen-age death rate is 354 percent of the state average, infant mortality 185 percent and low birth weight 167 percent.
In an article that still rankles city leaders, Time magazine described it in January as a city where "only people with no other choice" live.
Within view of Philadelphia's gleaming skyline, Molina Elementary School sits in a north Camden neighborhood that residents and outsiders alike agree is the worst section of the city. Open drug deals on street corners, youth gangs and drive-by shootings have given the name Danger Zone to the five-square-block area of dilapidated or gutted houses.
"It's a very difficult life in the neighborhood," said Dr. Frances C. Gibson, principal of Molina Elementary School. "Yet the school has sat here for years like an oasis."
Inside the school there is a well-stocked library, neat classrooms and hallways full of posters and other artwork, much of it with anti-drug themes. There also are full-time security guards.
Students are served breakfast and lunch at school and a snack during the after-school tutoring.
Most of the children are picked up promptly at 4:30 P.M. by parents or much older siblings for a short walk home. Many are not allowed to walk alone or to play on the streets because it is too dangerous, parents said.
"The situation is very similar in many ways to the third world," said Rhonda M. Horried, 23, of Baltimore, a member of the master's program and the student supervisor at Molina Elementary. "It's very disheartening because we are suppose to be the greatest country on earth."
When she completes the Rutgers course next spring, Ms. Horried hopes to be posted to Namibia, which she visited during a stint as an aide to the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa.
"I think this will lessen the shock for us," she said.
Mr. Jacobs became director of the Rutgers Master's in Public Policy/ Peace Corps program in 1990, when it involved only the traditional classroom lectures. "We were giving our students a good academic foundation, but I wasn't convinced that they had the practical foundation," he said. "I was told straight up that Camden was perfect training for the third world."
Mr. Jacobs said his approach has startled some participants and toughened others, but there have been no dropouts among the 20 students who have finished the course at Rutgers.
"Sometimes it's frustrating here, but when they reach overseas they are going to find there are lots of problems that they can see but will be unable to solve in the years they are there," he said. "They have got to look at it on a micro level, that even if they only make impact on one child in the Camden city schools or somewhere overseas, that is important."

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
Necessity, Ingenuity and Gourmet Tomato Sauce Yield a Thriving Company

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
The tale of how Nancy Battista DiStefano became a businesswoman could begin with the memory of her father bringing home bushels of tomatoes for her and two sisters to can in Mason jars with a bit of olive oil and basil.
Or it might start with lonely midnight runs in her Volkswagen to the rough-edged Hunts Point market in the Bronx to buy tomatoes to supply a tiny new enterprise. Once she saw a man stabbed a few feet away from her. 
 But this is an entrepreneurial career that had the starkest of origins. It grew out of the disappointment of a failed marriage and the urgent drive of a mother to insure the well-being of her precious son, Daniel, then 2 years old.
 
'On a Mission'
 "I was on a mission," said the president of Pomodoro Fresca Foods, which in January moved from a minuscule former ice-cream parlor in Queens to a 10,000-square-foot factory in West Sayville, L.I.
It is selling gourmet tomato sauce in all 50 states, though mainly in the New York metropolitan region. Sales this year are expected to exceed $500,000.
"And I don't see any problem doubling or tripling that every year," Ms. DiStefano, who is 31, said.
She is part of a tidal wave. Census data from 1987, the latest figures available, indicate that 30 percent of all businesses in the nation are now owned by women, a proportion expected by census officials to increase to 50 percent by the year 2000. Two of every three new businesses, most beginning with just one person, are started by women. Many of them, like Ms. DiStefano, never set out to be entrepreneurs, but, when faced with the necessity of making ends meet, they tap an ingenuity and drive they may not have known they possessed.
 
'The Only Way'
 Marsha Firestone, vice president of the American Woman's Economic Development Corporation, says this surge is the result of women having less chance of making it to the top of big companies, where only 3 percent of top managers are women.
"The only way they're going to be at the top is to do it themselves," she said.
It was three years ago that Ms. DiStefano drove her husband to the train station, hoping he would at the last minute beg to stay, but knowing he wouldn't. At the same time, her best friend was dying of lung cancer.
It all made her so tense she thought her throat was constricting. To help her relax, she carried a paper bag to breathe into. She now believes she experienced a minor nervous breakdown.
And paying the bills was no picnic. Ms. DiStefano had a mortgage on a Queens condo and regular fees for day care and baby sitting.
 
Italian Peasant Menu
 She was working as a technician at a design company in SoHo. Since it held frequent business lunches, she asked if she could cater at a cost of $15 to $25 a person. Her bosses said yes, and she devised what she calls an Italian peasant menu.
The biggest hit was her homemade tomato sauce, pretty much the same recipe she had devised as a teen-ager. Some of the guests asked her to cater events at their offices too. Friends persuaded her to print business cards.
Though she soon was catering for customers as varied as television production companies and art galleries, she could not bring herself to quit her regular job and become a full-time caterer.
"I worried that people would stop liking it, and not use me," she said.
She would work a full day at the design company, maybe cater a lunch there, cater another event in the evening, then go home and cook until 2 A.M. or later. She lost weight, and worried about how little time she was spending with Daniel. But the catering business was growing by leaps and bounds.
Then people started asking if they could buy the sauce she usually brought in Mason jars. "People would pay whatever I charged," she said.
Ms. DiStefano figured she had a hot commodity. She paid a visit to the Manhattan headquarters of the Food Emporium, the upscale chain of food stores. She arrived with a bowl of sauce, "a beautiful napkin" and absolutely no idea how the grocery business works.
 
A Trial Run
 But the sauce "had panache," said Robert Damato, director of the deli and bakery divisions, and Food Emporium executives decided to give the product a trial run in five stores.
The battle was far from over. Ms. DiStefano needed to find someone to pack her sauce in sufficient quantities. She turned to "co-packers," companies that specialize in packing for other companies' labels.
She was disappointed to learn that all said they could not pack the tomatoes cold but would have to heat them first. No matter that she argued that the beauty of her sauce was the pure taste of the chopped-up fresh tomatoes.
"Every co-packer from here to Florida told me I was crazy," she said.
She is not the type to take no for an answer. "I was on a mission," she said. She would do it herself. Somehow.
Ms. DiStefano's brother let her use a 300-square-foot store near Shea Stadium he had leased. The space was cramped, and the hours were endless. Ms. DiStefano sometimes bathed Daniel in the same sink where she washed tomatoes. The crew was mainly women from Ecuador.
Fresh tomatoes were the key. Thus it was that Ms. DiStefano ventured to the Hunts Point market, a place she had not known existed. She arrived in her Volkswagen a little after midnight, when she had been told the selection was greatest.
It was a world she was clearly unprepared for. Wandering aimlessly between the huge trucks, stacks of crates and piles of produce of the world's biggest vegetable market, she pushed sleeping Daniel in a carriage. Her mother walked beside her, waving about a big pocketbook.
"Get out of here!" an alarmed merchant screamed. "Take the baby away! Hide that pocketbook!"
He then led the odd entourage around personally. And gradually, but only gradually, she acquired market smarts. People would show her a sample of beautiful tomatoes, then slip her ones much inferior. When she asked for credit, she was told, "Do you know what we do to people who don't pay their bills?"
"You don't know the humiliation I had to face," Ms. DiStefano said.
But things were improving. In January 1990, she finally quit her job at the design studio. She began taking around her sauce, which retails now for $6 a pint jar, to gourmet stores. Many were interested.
She even got an early nibble from a major food distributor, whose representative mentioned quantities she could not then dream of producing. To hide the facts, she lied and said she was in the process of building a 100,000-square-foot plant and hiring her own sales force.
"In the meantime, I'm hysterical, crying," she said. "Every day, I thought it was going to end."
What happened next is the key to her present success. Louis DaGroza, a businessman she met through friends, was impressed with what Ms. DiStefano was doing. And he was interested in a new plant for his own company, Bruno's Specialty Foods, which makes kosher frozen entrees.
When he came upon a 10,000-square-foot building in Sayville, he made a proposal to Ms. DiStefano. She could have half the space and he would put $100,000 into her company. In return, he would get 45 percent ownership of Pomodoro.
Pomodoro now has distributers in California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland and elsewhere.
 
A Blur of Motion
 Ms. DiStefano's typical business day is a blur of motion. She checks a broker on constantly changing tomato prices; she converses with the rabbi who regularly comes to make sure her processes -- as well as Mr. DaGroza's -- are kosher; she checks operations with her 21-year-old sister, Lia, who is operating the eight-foot-tall, 300-gallon 1948-vintage kettles she bought from Chef Boy-Ar-Dee.
Not that she doesn't have help, mainly from women. Her accountant, lawyer, production manager and all other supervisors are women. Most of her 30 other workers are local housewives who are welcome to adjust their schedules for personal needs.
Lately, Ms. DiStefano has begun to get inquiries from big companies interested in buying into her dream. She isn't ruling them out, but said, "I'd like to keep it a privately owned profitable company."
Most important, her feet are now firmly on the ground. She pays herself $39,000 a year, is renting a house in East Hampton, L.I.; schedules her life so she can often pick up Daniel, now 6, from school, and after years of nothing but struggle is dating a man she calls "a prince."
She feels this incredible pride. "I walk around the plant, and I still get butterflies in my stomach," Nancy DiStefano said.

HEADLINE: Peruvians Refuse to Give Up Hope

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In Peru profound changes are coming from the grass roots, which may explain why President Alberto Fujimori has extensive popular support. Despite desperate economic times, produced partly by the developed world's demand that Peru repay its foreign debt and damage (estimated at $22 billion) resulting from terrorist destruction, not all is glum in Peru. 
 Mr. Fujimori was elected by the people, who felt themselves disenfranchised by their government. He seems to me to have stayed attuned.
The large-scale move to the large cities has produced not only misery but also a way out of misery. The largely indigenous immigrants from the Andes bring a fierce capacity for hard work and an ancient commitment to community. Democracy is rarely talked about and frequently practiced. The slums of 20 years ago are no longer slums.
In the last five years, I have taken 70 volunteers from Fordham University, St. Peter's College and other places in the United States to work in southern Peru beside the people. Most of this time Peru has been in economic decline. The people we worked with have become much, much poorer. But they have not given up hope. Nor have they remained paralyzed. Having no money, they tithe time and energy to build schools, health posts and waterworks; they run breakfast programs so that all their children can eat a meal a day.
These people support Mr. Fujimori; they do not canonize him. He provides their best hope that Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) terrorism and corrupt government can be overcome. Remarkable police work has led to the capture of Abimael Guzman Reynoso and other Shining Path higher-ups. The terror practiced by police and military on the people caught in the middle has also apparently diminished in recent months.
Watch President Fujimori as he tries to empower some of the grass-roots leadership to speak with the voice of their people in the constituent assembly, which will rewrite the constitution and restore representative government.

HEADLINE: Peruvians Refuse to Give Up Hope;
The Struggle Continues

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The arrest of Abimael Guzman Reynoso is undeniably a serious loss for the Peruvian revolution. However, in "Peru Waiting to See if Rebels Open Offensive" (news article, Oct. 18), you mistakenly state that I share the view of Prof. David Scott Palmer that the leadership of Shining Path, the Communist Party of Peru, will fracture in a "bitter power struggle" or end up a "loose confederation" with Mr. Guzman in jail. 
 Mr. Guzman and the party leadership spent 15 years building an ideologically unified, revolutionary Maoist organization able to withstand severe repression and replace fallen leaders even before beginning the armed struggle in 1988.
This unity has been tested through a 20-year "people's war." This is why a 1992 Rand Corporation report acknowledges that previous losses of top leadership had "no noticeable long-run impact on group actions."
Mr. Guzman has been central to the growth of the party, but he himself stated: "What is important to me is the conviction that others will continue the work to which I am committed." Unquestionably, a collective leadership has been forged to carry on the party strategy during his incarceration.

HEADLINE: House Leaders and Freshmen Agree To Try to Avoid Carter Era's Failures

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Freshman Democrats and House leaders met behind closed doors today to exhort each other to work together with the Clinton Administration and to avoid repeating the conflicts of Jimmy Carter's Presidency.
In the first of three regional meetings with their freshman class of 63 or 64 (depending on the outcome of a vote count in one district) the leaders heard two California newcomers, Jane Harman and Lynn Schenk, recall their frustrating days working for the Carter Administration. Those difficulties, they said, had to be avoided. 
 And Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader who strongly opposed Mr. Carter's proposal to contain hospital costs, told the group: "Now we've got a quarterback on the field. We've got to follow his plays." He said he had urged the new members to offer their ideas to the Clinton Administration as soon as it was organized, but then to be loyal to what it later proposed.
 
'A Failed Opportunity'
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley told reporters that the Carter years of 1977 through 1981, the last time the Democrats had controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, were widely acknowledged to be "a failed opportunity."
"We didn't work closely enough together on the legislative agenda" because of failures in personal relationships, he said.
Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a chief deputy whip, said he was optimistic because President-elect Bill Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore had "reached out to members of the House in their campaign."
"We know these two guys," Mr. Lewis said confidently.
Ms. Harman, who worked in the Carter Administration as deputy secretary of the Cabinet, said today's meeting was "fabulous."
"We haven't had this fast start before," she said. "Some of us remember 1976, with a new Democratic President and a Democratic Congress, and things didn't go so well."
Conversations with the traveling leaders and with the newly elected members suggested there was near consensus on legislative priorities: spurring the economy, cutting the deficit and dealing with health care. Jay Inslee, a freshman from Washington, said later of the meeting's mood, "We do realize that we have to act, and we have to act quickly."
There was apparently little talk of Congressional-reform topics like term limits or staff sizes, topics popular with Republicans and talk-show hosts during this fall's campaign.
"We don't have an image problem," said Karen Shepherd of Utah. "We have a substance problem. We're going to go to work on the substance, and the image problem will evaporate."
The tone of the meeting appeared to be generally warm, with neither lectures from the leaders nor ultimatums from the newcomers. "The leadership sat there and listened to every one of us," said an impressed Lucille Roybal-Allard of California.
Maria Cantwell of Washington said: "We weren't asked to go to Washington. The leadership came to us."
 
No Balloons and Lollipops
 Sam Copersmith of Arizona, an advocate of a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, said differences over whether such an amendment was a wise course would not cause serious problems as long as Congress and President Clinton were "on a winning team," with progress being made on the deficit and on a few other key issues like the economy and health care. Mr. Clinton and the House Democratic leaders oppose a balanced-budget amendment.
Anna Eshoo of California, one of the few to stress internal House issues, said she told the group that she expected to be "part of a Congress that is willing to reform itself internally, streamline itself." She said the meeting's tone was "no nonsense," and that the members knew that the tasks they faced would be hard.
"There isn't anyone sitting there saying bring out the balloons and lollipops," Ms. Eshoo said.
Another freshman, Walter R. Tucker 3d, the mayor of Compton, on the edge of the Los Angeles riot area, said he told the meeting that more had to be done for the cities: "We're just one step away from another riot if we don't get our act together."
Mr. Foley said one purpose of the meeting, and of those in Chicago on Monday and in Atlanta on Tuesday, was to acquaint the new members with the accelerated organizational pace planned for this year. In the past, he said, organization of the House had been "somewhat leisurely."
But in 1993, Mr. Foley said, "We'll be ready in every sense of the word before Bill Clinton takes office," and will be able to act on his recommendations immediately.
Mr. Foley told the freshmen, "Without divided Government to be an excuse for failure to act, there is a responsibility on the Democratic Party to act."
 
Committee Wish Lists
 This was not a group of naive or starry-eyed new lawmakers. Dan Hamburg, who defeated an incumbent Republican, Frank Riggs, in a district on the coast north of San Francisco, said he was here to "meet people and angle a little bit for committee assignments."
"I want an influential committee," Mr. Riggs said. With a seat on a powerful committee like Ways and Means, which handles tax legislation, or Appropriations, which doles out money, he added, "you can influence things on other committees."
Those two committees and Energy and Commerce traditionally do not have freshman members, but Mr. Foley has said it is "likely" they will in the next Congress.
Among the 18 freshmen present today was one who may not be a new member after all. Mark A. Takano of Riverside, Calif., came to report that he had just fallen behind by 400 votes in the still incomplete counting of absentee ballots. If he ends up losing to Ken Calvert, the net Democratic losses will be 10 seats, leaving them 258 seats in the House in the 103d Congress.
 Because of an editing error, the article also misattributed a quotation. It was Mr. Hamburg, not his defeated opponent, Frank Riggs, who said, "I want an influential committee" and explained that by sitting on a powerful committee like Ways and Means "you can influence things on other committees."

HEADLINE: Guerrillas Are Imperiling Colombia's Oil Bonanza

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BARRANCABERMEJA, Colombia

 BODY:
A recent series of attacks by two left-wing guerrilla armies is spreading anxiety in the Colombian Government, endangering the economic future of the country and clouding its hopes to become one of the Western Hemisphere's major oil exporters in the 1990's.
Responding to the threat, the Government has strengthened its armed forces and dispatched them to strategic areas to try to stop the violence. 
 [After another spasm of rebel attacks over the weekend, including a raid in which 26 policemen were killed, a 90-day state of emergency was imposed by President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo. The measure enables Mr. Gaviria to impose security measures by decree.]
Of particular concern to the authorities is the country's oil industry, which has been in existence for decades but was catapulted to a new level of importance by the announcement in late October that two oilfields in remote Casanare State contained two billion barrels of oil, the largest find in the Americas since the discovery of the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska in 1969.
 
Home of Rebel Armies
 Even though the Casanare fields, 150 miles southeast of here, are smaller than preliminary estimates, the new oil production is expected to displace coffee as the country's most valuable legal export by 1995, and to propel Colombia into the club of major Latin American oil exporters, after Venezuela and Mexico. But the fields are in a section of the Andean foothills that since the 1960's has sheltered two of the hemisphere's most obscure and most durable guerrilla armies: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the smaller and more radical National Liberation Army.
The oil industry is expected to become a major battleground in a war that already takes 2,000 lives a year, and could force Washington, which focuses almost exclusively on stopping the country's drug traffickers, to reassess its priorities in Colombia.
After nearly three decades of combat against the two Marxist rebel groups, which were founded in the 1960's with help from the Soviet Union and Cuba, the Colombian Government has been able to confine most rebel activity to remote areas, away from the major cities. But the importance of the new-found oilfields, which sit squarely on the guerrillas' turf, makes them an inviting target.
Already, Colombia's 8,000 guerrillas extort at least $200 million a year from rural businesses, according to a recent study by Semana magazine, Colombia's most widely read newsweekly.
Guerrillas levy taxes on coal and gold production and provide paid guard services to cocaine and heroin laboratories. Responsible for about one half of the 900 kidnappings recorded in Colombia so far this year, guerrillas specialize in kidnapping cattle ranchers and managers of banana plantations.
 
State Capital Isolated
 The guerrillas are also increasing their attacks on oil installations. They have recently dynamited the oil pipeline leading from central Colombia to the Caribbean and have temporarily isolated Yopal, the capital of Casanare, by blowing up a telephone installation and blocking a highway with buses.
The campaign was part of a larger offensive that included raids on other oil installations and attacks to enforce a nationwide intercity bus stoppage, and provoked the Government to indefinitely suspend peace talks, which had been scheduled to resume on Oct. 31 in Mexico. Officials said the rebels had carried out 198 major attacks since the last round of peace talks in May.
Vowing to keep guerrillas out of the oilfields, the Government has created an 8,000-man "energy police" force to protect oil and electricity installations. In addition, it plans to station in Casanare a regular army brigade specially trained in counterinsurgency.
"It's a versatile, fast and highly mobile unit," Brig. Gen. Fernando Tapias Stahelin, the commander of the brigade, said here as he watched his men going through a training exercise, clambering on and off an American-made Blackhawk helicopter.
General Tapias is a graduate of counterinsurgency training at the United States Army center at Fort Bragg, N.C., and his helicopters were bought from the United States. But other units of the Colombian armed forces and police receive their helicopters virtually free of charge as part of Washington's antidrug aid to Colombia, which totals $58 million this year.
This allocation of American aid reflects Washington's priority on drug trafficking, which captures the vast majority of the international attention and assistance turned toward Colombia. But the oil discovery could force the United States, the largest buyer of this country's oil, to take more interest in Colombia's domestic war.
"With United States oil production declining, it is in our geopolitical interest to lessen dependence on the Middle East," said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry research group based in New York.
In fact, the drug war and the guerrilla war often intersect. General Tapias said that in a recent raid his men had captured a cocaine laboratory and, alongside it, a guerrilla bomb factory.
Jorge Gomez Lizarazo, head of Barrancabermeja's civil rights group, asserted that most of Washington's anti-narcotics aid was not being used for its intended purpose. "The majority of the police aid is used to combat the armed insurgency," he said in a telephone interview from Washington.
Mr. Gomez left here in September after four co-workers at the Regional Committee for the Defense of Human Rights were killed in 20 months. Since 1988, 48 leaders of the oil workers' union here have been killed. The deaths, attributed to right-wing death squads, which often have links to the military, make this oil center of 250,000 people one of the most violent places in Colombia, where the nationwide homicide rate is seven times that of the United States.
But even though the oil bonanza and the breakdown in peace talks are expected to sharpen Colombia's political violence, few expect the issue to be settled by fighting.
"The Government now marks two years of a continuous and intense military activity against the guerrillas, with all the maximum war power, without succeeding in decimating or even limiting the action of the guerrilla groups," said Voz, the weekly newspaper of the Colombian Communist Party, an orthodox group sympathetic to the guerrillas.
Horacio Serpa Uribe, a former Mayor of this city who resigned in September as the Government's chief negotiator with the guerrillas, also acknowledged the strength of the rebels, but he said it was doing them no good.
"The guerrillas have advanced militarily, but they have lost politically," he said, referring to opinion polls that indicate a hardening of public attitudes against the insurgents. "I told the guerrillas, the more you push, the greater the reaction will be."

HEADLINE: Transit Fares May Rise, M.T.A. Says

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
The transit fare in New York City will increase 25 cents next year unless the state helps close the Transit Authority's projected $266 million budget deficit, city transit officials said yesterday.
The officials called on the legislature to enact a broad range of proposals that would give the Metropolitan Transportation Authority greater control of its government subsidies and a larger portion of state transportation funds. 
 "We're either going to swim together as a region or sink as separate geographic areas," said Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the M.T.A., the Transit Authority's parent agency.
 
$165 Million Shortfall
 The Transit Authority found itself in a similar situation earlier this year, when it appealed to Albany to help close a $165 million shortfall. State legislators responded with a series of accounting adjustments and subsidies that closed the gap, but did nothing to insure that the Transit Authority would avoid the same predicament next year.
In unveiling the proposed 1993 budget of $3.7 billion yesterday, transit officials fired the first salvo in the annual battle over state transportation funds. Mr. Stangl said that while he opposes a fare increase, it may be inevitable if "structural problems" in the way the Transit Authority is financed are not reformed.
Alan F. Kiepper, president of the Transit Authority, said that revenues from real estate taxes and token sales have fallen by almost $250 million in the last three years. During the same period, state and Federal subsidies have remained almost constant, he said.
Mr. Kiepper said the Transit Authority has sought to keep expenses down by freezing management salaries, cutting positions and reducing material purchases. Between 1990 and 1992, the authority's operating expenses rose by $2 million, an amount Mr. Kiepper said was negligible.
 
'Doing More With Less'
 Mr. Stangl said that during the same period, bus and subway service improved, according to surveys of riders. "We're doing more with less," he said.
To close the projected deficit and to help finance the M.T.A.'s $10 billion five-year capital program, Mr. Stangl has asked legislative leaders to give the M.T.A. about $280 million from a state tax on oil companies. The M.T.A. has also asked Albany to change state rules that prevent the authority from transferring surplus money from its commuter railroad lines to the transit system. Earlier this year the Legislature rejected an M.T.A. request to transfer $90 million from the commuter lines to the Transit Authority.
In the past, such proposals have been opposed by suburban and upstate legislators, who have wanted to use state transportation money for highways and commuter railroads instead of city subways and buses.
Yesterday, Mr. Stangl appealed for support from those legislators, particularly state Senator Norman J. Levy, the influential Nassau County Republican who heads the Senate Transportation Committee. In comments clearly directed at Mr. Levy, Mr. Stangl noted that 65 percent of the people who ride the Long Island Rail Road into Manhattan use city subways.
"The economy of Westchester and Long Island is very much linked to the city's," Mr. Stangl said. "We need to look at this broadly."
Mr. Levy did not return phone calls to his office yesterday.
 
$65 Million in Dispute
 The M.T.A. has also asked the city to restore $65 million that was cut from the city's subsidies to the authority in 1988. The $65 million has been a source of dispute: the M.T.A. has said the reduction should have been temporary; the city has said it was permanent.
Barbara J. Fife, deputy mayor for planning and development and a member of the M.T.A. board, said yesterday that the Dinkins administration was prepared to negotiate with the M.T.A. about the $65 million. But she said the city also wants the state to allocate more money to the Transit Authority.
"We have an interest in keeping the fare from rising," she said. "But $65 million alone is not going to put this budget into the black."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 0.81, to 3,240.87, After Rally Fades

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks closed barely higher yesterday after comments about the economy by President-elect Bill Clinton ended a rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.81 point at 3,240.87 after retreating from a high of 3,259.78. 
 In the broad market, advancing issues edged out declines, 992 to 853. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 197.6 million shares, compared with 205.3 million Friday.
The Nasdaq index retained a strong gain of 5.23 points to close at 622.05, buoyed by a rally in biotechnology stocks.
 
Remarks by the President-Elect
 The selloff in blue-chip stocks came when Mr. Clinton told reporters in Little Rock, Ark., that he saw "a lot of very troubling signs in the economy."
Clinton aides announced during the weekend that the President-elect was planning a gathering of business, government and economic leaders to discuss the economy and try to determine what the problems are and identify solutions.
"They're trying to downplay expectations," said John Blair, head trader at County NatWest. He said that the market was generally satisfied so far with the election of Mr. Clinton, but that investors were eager to see his Cabinet choices.
The new President will face not only a ballooning budget deficit but also a looming trade war concerning European Community oilseed subsidies, which Washington wants to be cut along with other farm support.
Analysts said investors were also keeping an eye on this week's Treasury refunding of more than $37 billion. The first leg of the refunding yesterday went through as expected.
 
Biotechnology Stocks Gain
 Storage Technology topped the actives list on the New York Stock Exchange, losing 8 1/8, to 23 5/8, after it announced another delay in its Iceberg disk array product. Testing of Iceberg will now extend into the second half of 1993.
On the Nasdaq, Medco Containment rose 1 3/8, to 33 5/8. It said it might reduce the number of shares offered for Diagnostek, which made a downward revision in its first-quarter results and said it sees a big drop in its second-quarter net. Diagnostek fell 6 3/4, to 9 1/8.
Walt Disney rose 3/4, to 40 7/8. Oppenheimer and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette repeated their buy ratings.
Biotechnology stocks gained on a combination of positive individual company news and analysts' recommendations. Centocor rose 2 1/8, to 15 1/8; Biogen added, 2 1/2 to 44 3/4; Gensia Pharmaceuticals rose 2 1/2, to 28 3/4, and Synergen added 2 7/8, to 55 7/8.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks edged up 1.01 points, to 418.59. The American Stock Exchange index rose 2.10, to 385.36.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.54 point, to 230.63.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of New York, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 4,087.784, up 13.757, or 0.34 percent.

HEADLINE: Jersey City Mayor Warns of Possible Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The 33-year-old investment counselor who was elected Mayor here last week said today that the city could be bankrupt before he completed his seven-month term.
The new Mayor, Bret Schundler, who finished first in a field of 19 candidates, was sworn into office in a 45-minute ceremony in which he held out the promise, or at least the hope, of lower taxes and improved services, but added a warning. 
 "I will ask the state to give Jersey City the help it deserves," Mr. Schundler said, "and I believe state officials will want to go along. If the residents face another property-tax increase and a drop in tax collections in the coming months, the city will be technically bankrupt by the summer, and the state will have to deal with the city's $600 million debt."
The Mayor said he would take a permanent 25 percent cut in his $60,000 salary and a further cut of one-third, which translates to reducing his salary to $30,000, until his plan for a citywide tax cut bears fruit. The announcement drew loud applause from 200 supporters who crowded into the City Council chambers to watch Mr. Schundler be sworn in by his wife, Lynn, a lawyer.
 
Selective Cuts Called For
 Mr. Schundler said he hoped to raise revenues by selling city tax liens and to ease taxes by lowering real estate assessments, which would reduce the taxes the city owes Hudson County.
He also said the city must improve its collection of delinquent taxes. The city is required to maintain a budget reserve to make up for uncollected taxes, and, with 20 percent of property owners unable or unwilling to pay their taxes, the fund is now up to $40 million. The rate of city tax collection has dropped about 18 percentage points in the last five years, to 80 percent.
Mr. Schundler said he would reject the budget presented by the City Council, which he said would require a $6 tax increase for each $1,000 of residential assessment and drive even more people off the tax rolls.
The Mayor promised to work with the Council members on a new spending plan in the next seven weeks. He also said he would not agree to a 10 percent cut in funding for all city departments. "That would cut into the muscle of some departments that have already trimmed down," he said. "We must first attack the waste to avoid service cuts and unnecessary layoffs."
Mr. Schundler said he would keep campaign promises to put more police officers on the streets, this time on motor scooters, and to seek the state Legislature's permission for city residents to receive state education aid in the form of vouchers that could be used to send their children to schools of their choice.
 
Seeks to Form Coalition
 Mr. Schundler was elected with only 10,500 votes, out of more than 50,000 cast, to succeed a series of interim mayors in this city of 228,000. The office became vacant early this year when the incumbent, Gerald McCann, was convicted of Federal fraud charges. He is serving 33 months in prison.
The new Mayor was the beneficiary of splits in a number of recognizable political blocs last week but will face more unified opposition in the next regular election in May. He said he recognized that he must put together a coalition, including a slate of nine Council running mates, to be a viable candidate then.
Jack Finn, the campaign manager for Councilwoman Marilyn Roman, who served for four months this year as interim mayor and finished third in last week's election, shared that assessment. "There were many new voters pulled out by the presidential election who wanted to have nothing to do with anyone connected with the government," Mr. Finn said, "and they ended up supporting Bret. The real question now is can he forge a coalition that can win in May."
Mr. Schundler, who was born in Colonia, graduated from Harvard Unversity with honors in 1981 and then worked as a Congressional aide and a campaign coordinator for Gary Hart's 1984 presidential run. He moved to Jersey City in 1985, when he went to work for Salomon Brothers. He later joined C. J. Lawrence, an economics research company, and in 1990 left to work on his own as a financial manager.
Last year Mr. Schundler registered as a Republican and ran unsuccessfully for the State Senate.

HEADLINE: Swinging the G.M. Ax: Which Plants Are Next?

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
For John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., the new chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, the hard part is just beginning. By the end of the year, G.M. has said it will name four more assembly plants to be closed as part of its strategy to cut its excess capacity.
The four plants will be in addition to the G.M. mini-van plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., and Willow Run in Ypsilanti, Mich., where full-size rear-wheel-drive cars are built. These plants were named earlier in the year when G.M. announced 12 of 21 assembly and parts-making factories it planned to close. These were on top of earlier G.M. closing announcements affecting factories like those in Scarborough, Ontario, and the West plant in Pontiac, Mich. 
 Predicting the new plants likely to be closed has grown increasingly difficult, industry experts said, as the company has shifted production of models in a way that eliminates some options. "One must question how serious G.M. is about closing facilities," said Clifford J. Swenson, manager of production forecasting for Jacobs Automotive, a consulting firm in Little Falls, N.J. "They have not been overly aggressive."
 
Three at Great Risk
 G.M. officials and the United Automobile Workers union declined to comment, but Mr. Swenson pinpointed three plants with the greatest risk of being closed: one of the two plants in Oshawa, Ontario, that build mid-size cars like the Chevrolet Lumina; one of three plants that build full-size pickup trucks in Oshawa, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Pontiac (at the East plant), and a Detroit plant that builds truck and motor-home chassis.
Beyond those three, however, a surprise seems in store, perhaps on the order of the stunning news in February when G.M. abruptly announced it would close its only plant that makes mini-vans and instead build a new version at a plant in Doraville, Ga. The big surprise may be that G.M. will have to drop well-known models.
It labored over consolidating its rear-wheel-drive car production in Arlington, Tex., or Ypsilanti before Arlington won out, but some experts question whether G.M. should continue to build the large sedans at all.
Maryann N. Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York, said the large Chevrolet Caprice and Buick Roadmaster models were not making money for G.M. because many were sold to fleets with little or no profit.
To complicate things, G.M. seems to have eliminated some alternatives. G.M. once had the option of consolidating production of large, front-drive cars from three plants to two.
The ones to stay open under that move, Mr. Swenson had predicted, would be Flint, Mich., and Wentzville, Mo., while the plant in Orion Township, Mich., would be closed. But G.M. has said it will shift Oldsmobile 88 production to Orion, which will also build updated models of the Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado.
Also, its Linden, N.J., and Moraine, Ohio, assembly plants looked like candidates for the padlock but G.M. has signaled that it will reopen the Linden plant to produce a new small pickup truck. Moraine has been promised a new paint system, a hint that it may stay in business.
The willingness of the U.A.W. to be more flexible may also be an important factor as G.M. considers which plants to close.
A nine-day strike in late August by workers at a G.M. parts plant in Lordstown, Ohio, led to costly shutdowns of nine assembly plants, including the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn.
Strikes can wipe out any savings that the company may be able to wring from suppliers as part of its mission to cut costs.
In another possible move, Corvette production might be shifted from a low-volume plant in Bowling Green, Ky. One option might be to move the Corvette to Ste. Therese, Quebec, where G.M. makes other sports cars. But making the Corvette, an American icon, outside the United States is difficult to picture. "But then again," Mr. Swenson said, "a new day may be dawning at G.M."

GRAPHIC: Table/Chart: "G.M.'s Endangered Assembly Plants"
 
SCHEDULED TO CLOSE
 
Scarborough, Ontario (Full-size vans) -- Capacity: 105,000
 Closing in 1993
 
Pontiac, Mich. (West plant) (Smaller pickups, sport-utility vehicles) -- Capacity: 115,000
 Closing in 1994
 
Tarrytown, N.Y. (Chevrolet, Pontiac and Oldsmobile mini-vans) -- Capacity: 225,000
 Closing in 1995
 
Ypsilanti, Mich. (Willow Run plant) (Chevrolet Caprice, Buick Roadmaster) -- Capacity: 245,000
 Closing in 1995
 
MOST VULNERABLE
 
Detroit (Truck and recreational vehicle chassis) -- Capacity: 90,000
 Sales of chassis have softened with the sluggish economy. Production could be consolidated at another truck plant.
 
Oshawa, Ontario. (No. 2 plant) (Buick Regal, Chevrolet Lumina) -- Capacity: 260,000
 These sedans have been weak against the Ford Taurus and the Toyota Camry.
 
Oshawa, Ontario (Truck plant) -- Capacity: 225,000; or
Pantiac, Mich. (East plant) -- Capacity: 225,000; or
Fort Wayne, Ind. -- Capacity: 225,000 (All three plants manufacture GMC and Chevrolet pickups)
 These models face tough competition that will only get tougher, as new pickup models are introduced by Toyota and Chrysler. G.M. can build enough trucks using only two of these three plants.
 
Bowling Green, Ky. (Chevrolet Corvette) -- Capacity: 60,000
 Production of the 25,000 or so Corvettes that G.M. sells each year could be shifted to Ste. Therese, Quebec, where the Firebird and Camaro are built.
 
Flint, Mich. (Buick City plant) (Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile 88) -- Capacity: 280,000
 Sales of these sedans are lagging behind G.M.'s optimistic projections, and more competition from new Chrysler models won't help. Production could be consolidated at another plant.
 
Linden, NJ. (Currently idle) -- Capacity: 170,000
 G.M. is scheduled to use this plant to build light trucks, other than full-size pickups, starting with the 1994 model year. But unless it develops more fast-selling models, the company may find it has too much capacity for these trucks.
 
Plant capacity figures are based on 235 days of 2-shift, 16-hour operation in a year.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Yield of 3-Year Notes Up Sharply

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Treasury auctioned $15.5 billion of three-year notes yesterday at an average yield of 5.17 percent, almost a half percentage point more than at the auction in August. The sharp rise in yield was another sign of how quickly the mood in the bond market can change.
"Its a very strange time," said Mary Rooney, an economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "People can not get positive. People seem to have given up for the rest of the year." 
 It was slightly more than two months ago that yields on the 30-year bond were at a six-year low of 7.25 percent and the discount rates on three- and six-month bills were below 3 percent, their lowest in about 30 years.
The change in mood has several causes, including the uncertainty surrounding the new economic policies of President-elect Bill Clinton. In comments in Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Clinton once again indicated that he was concerned that financial markets not react negatively to his proposals.
 
Apparent Fed Decision
 In addition, the market was undermined by the apparent decision by the Federal Reserve to stop reducing short-term interest rates. There has also been some recent data showing that the economy might be a little stronger than traders and investors had thought.
Patrick Rothstein, managing director at Merrill Lynch Government Securities, also suggested that the investors and dealers might have just pushed the market too far too fast.
"We had priced-in the end of the world," he said, referring to expectations for incredibly slow economic growth. "Now we are back to levels that make more sense. The market may just have gotten ahead of itself."
The rest of the bond market limped though yesterday as the Treasury began its quarterly auction of 30-year bonds and 10- and 3-year notes. The 10-year note auction is today and the 30-year bond auction is Thursday, after the Veterans Day holiday tomorrow.
 
Note to Be Reopened
 Instead of auctioning a new 10-year note, the Treasury announced last week that it would reopen the current 63/8 percent note due in August 2002 because of a severe shortage of the note in the market. The note will have the same 63/8 percent coupon with 9 3/4 years to maturity.
In late trading in the secondary market, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was trading at 9413/32 , up 9/32to yield 7.73 percent, down from 7.76 percent Friday. In the pre-auction, or when-issued, market, the new 30-year bond was trading at a yield of 7.72 percent, down from 7.74 percent Friday.
The prices of notes fell across the board. The two-year note was down 4/32 point to yield 4.53 percent, up from 4.46 percent Friday. The three-year note auctioned yesterday was yielding 5.15 percent in the when-issued market. And the 9 3/4-year noted to be auctioned today was yielding 6.98 percent, down from 6.99 percent Friday.
The small drop in the yield of the three-year note indicated that there was some demand for it after the auction. And the drop in yields on the other two securities to be auctioned may indicate a little more comfort with the two remaining Treasury sales.
The discount rates on three-month and six-month bills rose sharply at the regular weekly Treasury auction yesterday. For the three-month bill, the average discount rate was 3.10 percent, up from 3.05 percent last week and the highest since the 3.17 percent on Aug. 31. The discount rate for the six-month bill was 3.30 percent, up from 3.27 percent last week and the highest since the 3.31 percent of July 13.
The main reason for the decline in the bill market was the disappointment after the Federal Reserve decided not to cut short-term interest rates further in October. But Darwin L. Beck, the director of the economics department at the First Boston Corporation, said the Fed could still move in the future if the economic data became worrisome again.
"Just as the expectation got too high in October that they would ease, the expectation that they will never ease again has gotten too high," he said.
The auction of three-year notes went well because expectations were low, traders said. Dealers had aggressively sold at the end of last week to bring prices down and yields up ahead of the auction. This is a regular tactic before auctions because it can make new securities cheaper for dealers.
Since the details of the auction were announced last week and trading began in the pre-auction market, the yield on the three-year note moved from 5.04 percent to 5.17 percent just before the deadline for bids at noon yesterday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Prices Fall in U.S. Following Plunge Overseas

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Copper futures fell sharply yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York after prices plunged in London.
Several Comex contracts fell to 10-month lows in morning trading in reaction to the heavy liquidation on the London Exchange Market, according to Bernard Savaiko, an analyst at Paine Webber. The turmoil in London came amid speculation that China was a heavy seller of copper. 
 It was the fourth straight session of declines, as supplies continued to outpace demand as a result of the weak global economy. At the London Metal Exchange, copper stocks totaled 320,475 tons, up 2,675 tons as of Nov. 6.
Steady selling by Japan and China, as well as concerns about Russian sales of copper and other base metals, had already chipped at the foundation of the copper market last week, Mr. Savaiko added.
In New York, the December copper contract closed 1.55 cents lower at 94.80 cents a pound, slightly above the five-year low of 90 cents.
In other commodity markets, cotton closed marginally higher ahead of the Agriculture Department's crop report today, while grains ended lower on expectations for large yields in that same report.
Although cotton analysts also expect total United States cotton production in 1992 to loom large in the Agriculture Department's monthly crop report, December edged higher on commission house buying to close up 0.05 of a cent at 55.73 cents a pound.
"We have had some fairly favorable weather in the Southwest during October and parts of the late cotton crop in West Texas look good," said Carl Anderson, a cotton specialist at Texas A & M University. But he also noted crop deterioration in the Delta and Southeast last month.
Experts expect cotton production to range from 15.94 million to 16.261 million bales, up from the Agriculture Department's October estimates of 15.89 million. This estimate was 10 percent lower than last year's production of 17.6 million bales.
On the other hand, expectations for large corn and soybean crops in the Government's report knocked futures prices lower at the Chicago Board of Trade. Analysts expect 1992 corn output of a record 9.2 billion bushels, versus the last Agriculture Department estimate of 8.9 billion, and estimated soybean production at 2.13 billion bushels, up from 2.11 billion.
December corn closed off 1 1/2 cents at $2.06 1/2 a bushel, and November soybeans ended off 2 cents at $5.49 1/4 a bushel. Wheat closed mostly higher on hopes China may buy wheat. December soft red wheat settled up 3 1/2 at $3.62 3/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Helping Marketers Adjust to Mood Swings of Consumers

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
TO some, bungee-jumping is a stunt. To others, it is a sport. But to a growing number of consumers, it is a metaphor for their attitudes and behavior, according to a new study that urges advertisers to consider the phenomenon when plotting marketing strategies.
The study, prepared by the strategic planning and research department at Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc. in New York, is called "The American Consumer's 'Quality of Life:' Perception Versus Reality." It posits that the public has been undergoing a series of "bungee-like" mood shifts that are an overreaction to short-term changes in statistical measures covering important areas like the economy, the environment, health care and crime. 
 Larry Chiagouris, the agency's executive vice president of strategic planning and research, said he had named this "the bungee effect" because, "instead of swings that take place over perhaps a few years, you see more and more volatile swings."
As consumers' self-described perceptions of the overall quality of life swing, he added, between exaggerated levels of optimism and satisfaction on one hand, and pessimism and dissatisfaction on the other, they tend to consistently mismatch whatever the reality might be, either positive or negative.
The study, which analyzed government consumer data from the last 16 years, is the latest in a spate of research reports from large multinational agencies that seek to plumb the mysteries of consumer motivation. The reports stem from a growing realization at agencies that creating campaigns that win the acclaim of the chattering classes is not always sufficient to sell products to the consuming classes.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Chiagouris said the most recent bungee-jumping undertaken by American consumers involved leaping from an overly optimistic view during the 1980's to an overly pessimistic view today.
As a result, he added, the type of advertising so prevalent in the 80's, which emphasized overexuberant, overly materialistic life styles that "consumers might not believe they could realistically achieve," has given way to campaigns meant to woo "more cynical" shoppers by offering product-focused information.
"Think of all the ads you saw in the 80's with someone jogging with a sweatband on his or her head," Mr. Chiagouris said. "If it was advertising for sweatbands, O.K. -- but it wasn't."
Now, he added, "when consumers are more pessimistic than reality should make them feel, they're a little more tough to convince. So when they walk into the store and see your product on the shelf, the brand image had better be associated with something of value to them."
That is why, for instance, advertising that Backer Spielvogel produces for the Miller Brewing Company's Miller Genuine Draft beer is "putting so much emphasis on the cold-filtered process" by which the brand is brewed, he continued, "rather than just relying on pretty faces on a beach."
Mr. Chiagouris said the study was intended as the first in a biannual review comparing consumer perceptions and reality. He offered a preview of what he believed subsequent results might reveal in the wake of Gov. Bill Clinton's defeat of President Bush.
"You'll see even more positive perceptions among consumers," he said, "not just because of the change in Administrations, but because a lot of new people are coming to Washington, and Clinton is saying he'll be tackling the economy first.
"By February or March," he added, "you'll find perceptions much, much more significantly improved over where they are today. Yet reality doesn't change that much, that quickly, because it takes time to move the economy.
"As a result, by the summertime, I think we'll begin to see the first signs that sentiment, already improved, is beginning to ebb."
So Mr. Chiagouris warned marketers to beware of "an eagerness to overreact," by rapidly increasing ad-spending budgets, for instance.
"As much as I, or anyone else, would like to see" those budgets rise, he said, it is important "not to get taken with the euphoria of better times."

HEADLINE: Oilmen Ponder Future Under Clinton

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
More than 1,000 oil executives gathered yesterday in Manhattan at the American Petroleum Institute's annual convention to ponder what the Clinton-Gore Administration holds in store for them.
Bill Clinton's platform included calls for reducing oil imports and improving energy efficiency, ideas the oil industry finds worrisome at best, and replacing oil with natural gas, which most oil companies see as a silver lining in a very large cloud. But many executives see the platform as unlikely to be a threat. 
 Jerry M. Brown, executive vice president of Amoco for domestic oil production, said the oil industry would probably be a large target because of environmental considerations.
 
Emphasis on the Economy
 Still, the environment is probably not the first priority, many people at the convention said with a touch of optimism. The industry has argued for years that new environmental mandates impose costs on the economy and is now arguing that the economy cannot face any additional burdens.
"Clinton has recognized the need for business as an engine to drive this economy and create those jobs he's said so much about," said Ron W. Haddock, president and chief executive of American Petrofina Inc.
While oil executives express anxiety about the Vice President-elect, Al Gore, a prominent advocate of alternative fuels and higher energy efficiency, they are not lamenting the outgoing Administration. President Bush is a former Texas oilman, but the industry believes that it lost most of the battles it faced in Washington during his tenure.
For example, it has yet to achieve its top legislative priority of recent years: access to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. And in a struggle earlier this year with the ethanol industry, a competitor, over providing gasoline to areas with significant air pollution problems, the White House ruled against the oil industry.
That decision may be revisited, said Charles J. DiBona, president of the petroleum institute. "It's hard to see how a candidate who won would necessarily feel obligated to honor all the somewhat politically motivated decisions of the candidate who lost," he said.
Other energy decisions that could be reopened include forcing the auto industry to build more efficient cars, a proposal that the Bush Administration opposed and Congress eventually dropped but that Mr. Gore strongly favored. The idea of a gasoline tax also arose during the campaign, but it belonged to a losing candidate, Ross Perot.
 
Opposition to Import Duties
 A related proposal, also aimed at reducing the trade deficit and dependence on imported oil, is to impose import duties on crude oil, but executives say that policy tool would be as ill advised in a Democratic adminstration as it was in a Republican one, mostly because it invites retaliation by oil exporters. The exporters have complained that the governments of importing countries use taxes to make more profit on oil than the exporting countries do.
On the industry agenda, oil companies want permission to drill in many places on the outer continental shelf and would like new rules on gasoline formulas to be as lenient as possible. The overall argument, as framed by Mr. DiBona, is that "an economic plan that doesn't include the energy industry isn't going to work." The industry has pared 450,000 jobs in the last 10 years, 72,000 of them in the last year, Mr. DiBona said. The figure does not include the 1,500 that Chevron said yesterday that it would cut.
Mr. Haddock, expounding on that theme, said the decision to forgo development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was costing the gross national product $5 billion a year.

HEADLINE: Clearing Firm's Worst Nightmare

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Lee B. Stern was on his way to Florida on Oct. 22, far from the action, when Darrell M. Zimmerman strode onto the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade and fired off a barrage of orders for Treasury bond futures and options that confused and jolted bond markets around the world.
Despite not being there at the time, the 65-year-old Mr. Stern has become the focal point of much of the resulting controversy. Stern & Company, his family firm, had agreed earlier this year to process Mr. Zimmerman's trades and guarantee settlement of resulting debts to other traders. But when the call came at the end of the day's trading demanding millions of dollars to cover Mr. Zimmerman's liabilities, Mr. Stern balked. 
 Mr. Stern says he wanted an exact assessment of the losses and he wanted time to get back to Chicago. Most of all, he wanted some of the burden to fall on the independent brokers who had handled the trades, which he says were obviously suspicious and should never have been accepted.
That stand escalated what might have been a bizarre but quickly contained patch of financial turbulence into a major challenge of the Board of Trade's accepted relationships among traders, brokers and the clearing firms that support them. It also tarnished Mr. Stern's standing in the trading community, as the Board promptly banned him, two associates and his firm from doing any further business at the exchange.
To be reinstated, Mr. Stern put up $8.5 million and withdrew from the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, whose more than 120 members handle trade settlements. In pending arbitration proceedings, he is seeking restitution from Mr. Zimmerman and 11 others, including 9 brokers.
Headlines are nothing new for Mr. Stern, who leveraged the fortune he made in Chicago's agricultural and financial exchanges into local prominence as an investor in the White Sox baseball team and the owner of the Chicago Sting, a money-losing but athletically successful soccer team during the 1970's and 1980's.
But he was unprepared for the first rush of news coverage, which Mr. Stern said made his company look less like a victim than a co-conspirator. "The whole thing defies the imagination," Mr. Stern said recently. Most everyone in the rough, insular world of the trading pits here seems to agree with that assessment, although many also include Mr. Stern's behavior in that indictment.
The confirmed events of Oct. 22 are still hazy as Federal and Board of Trade officials continue investigations that may lead to both civil and criminal charges against Mr. Zimmerman and one or more associates. Those charges may come as early as the end of this month. The Board is also expected to adopt new rules that might, among other things, require independent traders like Mr. Zimmerman to be better capitalized.
Reports to date agree that Mr. Zimmerman sold 12,000 contracts on 30-year Treasury bond futures, each contract obligating him to buy Treasury bonds with a face value of $100,000 at a set price at a specified date. He also bought thousands of related put options, each of which gave him the right but not the obligation to sell options on the bond futures at a specific price on or before the expiration date of the put.
Both types of orders amounted to a bet that bond prices would fall, allowing Mr. Zimmerman to pay less for the contracts that would cancel out his trades and thus profit by pocketing the difference.
To the traders who alerted exchange officials it appeared that Mr. Zimmerman was working in tandem with Anthony Catalfo, a new member who had placed large orders and had just begun trading that week. The unexpected flood of orders temporarily pushed prices down further than traders had expected that morning when a release of unemployment figures had proved only mildly disappointing to the bond market.
 
Forced Off the Floor
 Mr. Zimmerman had never placed such sizable orders before and, in any event, did not have the type of membership authorizing him to trade in the futures pit. Both Mr. Catalfo and Mr. Zimmerman were removed from the floor after 45 minutes by exchange officials, who also removed and turned over to Federal law-enforcement officials two visitors signed in by Mr. Catalfo.
Mr. Zimmerman had a paper profit of $2 million at one point, according to someone familiar with the Stern firm's predicament, but he also had potential liabilities that could have run into tens of millions of dollars.
In Mr. Stern's absence, his son Daniel quickly moved from the soybean trading pits to try to whittle down the exposure by making offsetting trades. Later in the morning, Mr. Stern's eldest son, Jeffrey, began directing from his computer the even more complicated task of unwinding the options positions. By the end of the day Mr. Zimmerman's remaining positions showed a sizable loss, and the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation made its fateful margin call to Mr. Stern's firm.
Mr. Stern says brokers should have realized that Mr. Zimmerman was not authorized to trade futures. He also contends that brokers should have at least checked with the Stern firm upon receiving so many huge orders naming it as clearer. Stern is best known as a grain trading firm and is a small player in the bond pits.
"I think it was a case of sheer greed on the part of the brokers and the perpetrators," Mr. Stern said. No brokers named in the arbitration proceedings could be reached for comment. But other traders and brokers, who insisted on not being identified, said they could recall no precedent for Mr. Stern's suggestions or for a clearer's declining to pay up first and argue later about liability.
 
Covering the Debt
 Mr. Stern was safe in assuming that the clearing corporation would cover the debts. It has more than $100 million in assets and access to credit lines to cover members' obligations.
But exchange officials were clearly in no mood to treat the situation as simply an internal dispute, and their retribution was swift. The next day, the memberships of Mr. Stern and his firm were revoked and held as salable assets, along with those of Daniel Stern and Lester Mouscher, a company vice president.
Mr. Stern says he had already offered to provide the full $8.5 million margin call, but it was not until the following Tuesday, four days later, when he "voluntarily" agreed that Stern & Company would drop out of the clearing business at the Board, that the memberships were restored.
Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. Catalfo dropped from sight immediately. But Mr. Stern's local celebrity and his confrontation with the Board did not give him that option.
"I didn't know the ramifications of not meeting the call," Mr. Stern said.
 
Started at the Bottom
 It was a shattering experience for Mr. Stern, who grew up on Chicago's North Side and came to the Board of Trade as a lowly order runner in 1947. His mother, a millinery buyer for a department store, staked him to the $2,500 he needed to become a member in 1949. He began by brokering orders for Cargill, the grain company, but quickly decided that he preferred trading for his own account. When he fretted to a mentor that he had only $500 to work with, he was told, "Son, if you had more, you'd lose it."
Now, a millionaire many times over, he worries that the Zimmerman affair will bring about his retirement at a pace not entirely of his own choosing. "I have to sort out where to put my resources," he said.
But fears about irreparable harm to his reputation have waned. At a recent Chicago Mercantile Exchange meeting, he received a standing ovation from 700 traders and embraces from officers when he was called to the podium with others to get an award for longtime membership.
"From then on, I felt that things were going to be all right," he said.
Still, he gets indignant remembering the first few days of the incident, especially the Board's flat refusal to consider an interim step to restore Daniel Stern's and Mr. Mouscher's memberships in return for the senior Stern's offer to put up the cash value of their memberships. Mr. Mouscher, who is seriously ill with cancer, had sharply curtailed his activity and had been in the process of transferring the membership to his wife.
"I have yet to hear one word of compassion or understanding from the clearing corporation," Mr. Stern said.
Officials of the clearing corporation, including William Feldman, the chairman, and Roger Rutz, the chief executive, refused to respond to repeated requests to discuss the handling of Mr. Stern's case.
 
Eye on the Regulators
 In the ego-riven world of the Chicago exchanges, there are always suspicions that personal grudges are being settled along with policy decisions. But some traders speculate that such feelings were less important than was a desire to show the regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that longtime insiders do not get favorable treatment. They note that Mr. Stern was chairman of an important administrative committee and a member of the oversight committee; he has been stripped of both positions.
Some traders also suspect that the exchange wanted to re-emphasize the cardinal rule that clearers must know their customers. Other clearers had turned down Mr. Zimmerman's business and he was known to have debts to a clearer at the Mercantile Exchange when Stern & Company signed him up.
Mr. Stern said Mr. Zimmerman had pledged to trade only in small lots and to pay his debts. "And that's all he did for several months before telling us he was going to Europe on vacation," Mr. Stern said. "There was no indication this guy was an accident waiting to happen."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Higher; Gold Declines Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher yesterday in choppy dealings on world currency markets.
Gold prices fell worldwide, with their biggest losses in domestic markets. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery lost $3.10 an ounce to settle at $332.60. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold of $333.25 an ounce, down $2.55 from Friday. 
 The dollar ended mixed in Europe and initially declined when trading shifted to United States markets. Dealers were intent on taking profits after the currency's rise over the last few weeks.
But the dollar ultimately rose because of developments involving other currencies. First, the British pound came under heavy selling pressure. The pound was hurt by speculation that Britain was considering cutting interest rates, said Mike Malpede, an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
Separately, the Japanese yen came under pressure after a steep decline in stock prices on the leading Tokyo exchange. Traders cited growing pessimism over Japan's political turmoil, widely expected to delay Government measures to help the economy.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing of 123.78 Japanese yen, up from 122.95 yen at Friday's close. Later in London, it rose to 123.96 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 124.25 yen, up from 123.40 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5170, from $1.5375 late Friday. In New York, it cost $1.5120 to buy one pound, less expensive than Friday's $1.5295.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.5995 German marks, up from 1.5973; 1.4350 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.4055 French francs, up from 5.4025; 1,367.50 Italian lire, up from 1,267.28, and 1.2569 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2550.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: The President-Elect;
Despite Some Signs of Recovery, Clinton Points to Economic Perils

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 9

 BODY:
Laying groundwork for a pre-Christmas economic conference intended as part shock therapy and part consensus-building, President-elect Bill Clinton today dismissed signs of economic recovery, insisted that the economy remained weak and said the focus must be "on the gravity of the situation."
While acknowledging that the unemployment rate had dipped, Mr. Clinton painted an insistently bleak picture of the overall state of the nation's economic health. 
 "The unemployment rate has held steady, even gone down a little bit, but the underlying reality is that unemployment is up, production is down," Mr. Clinton said in a brief talk with reporters as he left the Statehouse here. "There are a lot of very troubling signs in the economy."
 
Dampening Expectations
 The economic conference, which Mr. Clinton's strategists say will be a two- or three-day meeting of business executives, labor leaders, economists and Congressional figures, is shaping up as the focal point of the transition process.
The tone of the President-elect's statements today reflected a conclusion by his advisers that, after a campaign in which candidate Clinton made many promises of economic betterment, it is essential that President Clinton focus the discussion on what can realistically be achieved in a short time.
The economic conference will be a vehicle for doing that, a three-day cold shower of ill economic tidings. Although the meeting remains largely unplanned -- aides say they expect to hold it before Christmas -- Mr. Clinton's strategists say the essential point will be to focus a heavy burst of national attention on what is wrong with the American economy, a notion that some likened to a "national audit."
The emerging point of the conference seems to be in great measure to frame the discussion of economic revival in such a way that Americans will not expect miracles from Mr. Clinton. His advisers said the state of the economy would be presented in dire terms, suggesting that it is considerably worse than either the voters or Mr. Clinton had previously been aware.
One Clinton transition official, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested that the conference would also be used to build a case that President Bush's economists underestimated the scope of the nation's economic problems.
"There is some concern among economists that the country's economic condition may be somewhat worse than previously reported," the official said.
In making this case, Mr. Clinton would be resuming an argument that was at the center of the campaign, in which he said the economy was doing worse than Mr. Bush cared to admit and the President said the Democrats were painting a dire picture simply to drive him from office.
Other Clinton transition aides hint at the same thing.
"I don't think the summit will be a time of study in terms of prescriptions," said Dee Dee Myers, a spokeswoman for Mr. Clinton. "The idea in calling it an audit is that it will be an honest description of where the country is."
 
Message: 'I Get It'
 She added, "Governor Clinton wants to have an honest accounting as possible of the country's economic situation, and he feels that the best way to do it is to pull together some of the nation's top economists and business leaders to discuss it."
Ms. Myers suggested an additional, more acutely political reason for the conference.
"One of the reason George Bush was not re-elected is that people felt he was not connected to them, to their problems," she said. "One of the first messages Bill Clinton wants to get across is: 'I get it. I understand your needs and fears. I take this seriously and I am going to work on it seriously from the first day of my Administration.' "
George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's director of communications, said the President-elect intended to focus a "tempered" view on the economy that would "keep expectations in check."
 
Gathering His Options
 He added, "The only way you can build a consensus towards solution is to make sure the people understand the scope of the problem and that they feel they are part of the solution from the beginning."
Mr. Clinton, in his brief remarks today, made much the same point. Asked what he hoped to accomplish with the conference, he spoke not of solutions, but of problems.
"I want to bring in some of the brightest people in the country from a broad range of backgrounds to talk to them about the gravity of the situation, deal with what our options are, get as many good ideas as I can," he said. "I just think it would be a very good thing for me and for the country where we have two, three days where we really focus on it, and give some people a chance to have their say to me directly and talk about what out options are."
The planning of the economic conference comes as Mr. Clinton faces two simultaneous transitions, one in which he vacates the office of Governor of Arkansas, and another in which he assumes the Presidency.
 
Working Without Titles
 In the last weeks of his campaign, the candidate said several times that he had not studied anything seriously beyond Election Day, and it now appears that both he and his staff are getting a quick education in how much is involved in a transfer of power.
As the Clinton campaign operation shuts down and the transition effort gears up, lines of authority and information have become blurred.
When Mr. Clinton's transition chiefs, Warren M. Christopher and Vernon E. Jordan, revealed the planning for the economic conference in Sunday television interviews, their disclosures clearly caught Ms. Myers unaware. She is serving without benefit of formal appointment as a press secretary.
Mr. Clinton himself, in a rambling, casual chat with reporters on Sunday, spoke repeatedly of his surprise at how much there was to do.
"There's a slew of things you never think about," he said. "I mean, we've got -- there's an inaugural to organize, there's letters, acknowledgments, record packing."

HEADLINE: Prospects for the Elderly Differ Widely by Sex

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
As life expectancy increases and the time from retirement to old age stretches out, men and women find themselves with markedly different prospects, according to a new report from the Census Bureau.
Men tend to die earlier than women, but if they survive, men are more likely to be healthy, self-sufficient and living with their families rather than alone. 
 The differences are most stark among men and women aged 85 and over. In this group, women are three times as likely as men to be poor. But the pattern starts at retirement.
One reason is that women are more likely to be alone, precisely because men have shorter life expectancies. "A major cause of impoverishment among older women is widowhood," said Richard Suzman, director of the office of the demography of aging at the National Institute on Aging.
In 1990, a quarter of all elderly people living alone were poor, with only their own financial resources, including private pensions and programs like Social Security. But men are far less likely to live alone. About 82 percent of the men aged 65 and over were living with their spouses or other relatives, compared with 58 percent of the women. Only one-third of the men 85 and older were living alone, as against two-thirds of the women.
Another reason for the economic disparity is that men and women reach retirement age with very different work histories, according to the report, which was written by a Census Bureau demographer, Cynthia M. Taeuber, from the 1990 census and a variety of other public and private surveys.
Women over the age of 65, who grew up in an era when it was difficult to work outside the home, are less likely to have access to pension and Social Security income in their own names, the report said.
 
31 Million Over 65
 And although men's life expectancy is 71.8 years, about six and a half years less than women's, those men who live a decade or more into retirement are less likely than women their age to need help -- from a spouse or anyone else -- with basics like eating, dressing, bathing, preparing meals, managing money and getting outside. Of men aged 75 and older, 17.2 percent needed such basic help; 30.2 percent of the women did. "Elderly women are likely to have long-term, chronic disabling diseases," the report said, "while men tend to develop relatively short-term fatal diseases.
"The differences between older men and women include differences in education, differences in occupation, presence in the work force, having pensions in their own name," Ms. Taeuber said. "If their wives should happen to die, they remarry real fast."
According to the 1990 census, about 12.5 percent of the nation's population, or 31.1 million people, were 65 or older. About 18 million were 65 to 74; 10 million were 75 to 84; slightly more than 3 million were 85 or older.
 
Other Trends Found
 The wide-ranging report also highlighted several trends that are causing serious concern to social health and welfare planners, including these:
*By far the fastest growth in the elderly population came among the very old; in 1990, three million people in this country were 85 or older, or 1.2 percent of the population -- twice the proportion of very old people in the population in 1960, and six times as large as in 1900.
*The migration trends of the 1980's left a cluster of Farm Belt and Rust Belt states with higher concentrations of elderly than anywhere except Florida. These are also more likely to be poorer and to be living alone or in a nursing home, although the states involved are some of the least able to afford a high concentration of dependent residents.
*Nine states had more than one million residents aged 65 or over, topped by California, with 3 million, and New York and Florida, with 2.4 million each.
*Men, particularly white men, are retiring earlier; 16.4 percent of men older than 65 were in the work force in 1990, compared to 45.8 percent of men in that age group in 1950.
*The ethnic diversity of the elderly is increasing, a trend that is expected to accelerate in the next three decades. About one elderly person in 10 was nonwhite; that proportion should double in 60 years.
"At the same time as some of the ethnic groups that migrated here from Europe are dying out, you're getting an increased representation of minorities among the elderly," Mr. Suzman said. "These are the group most at risk.
"Looking ahead, you're going to get minority cohorts entering old age with inadequate financial resources in terms of pensions and social security because of a checkered work history. One has to be concerned about what pension wealth and social security wealth they are going to have."
"One of the biggest short-term and long-term demographic currents is the very rapid growth of the oldest old group," he added. "They are the group with the highest needs at the lowest level of physical independence. They are going to grow -- we're getting a forewarning now -- that group's going to grow explosively when the baby boom generation hits very old age."
In 1987, the Health Care Financing Administration estimated that the annual average cost of health care for a person aged 65 to 69 was $3,728, with $2,298 of it coming from public programs, usually Medicare. Private costs, either out-of-pocket or covered by insurance, were $1,430.
For an individual 85 or older, the average annual cost was $9,178, with $5,547 coming from public funds and $3,631 coming from private expenses -- including an average of $2,191 in privately financed nursing home care.
"The increasing size of the oldest old population, and their health situation, which clearly declines with increasing age, suggests that a larger number will seek long-term care as part of the continuum from independent living to assisted living at home to institutional care," the report said.

HEADLINE: From Carter to Clinton, A South in Transition

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PLAINS, Ga., Nov. 6

 BODY:
Sixteen years after Jimmy Carter's Presidency came to symbolize a resurgent South, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have gone him one better, becoming the first all-Southern ticket to win election since Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun in 1828.
But after the Southern pageant of Billy Beer and boiled peanuts, which played out here in the late 1970's, what is most telling in Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore is how little of the stereotyped image of the South they seem to carry with them. 
 The difference reflects different men, different locales and different generations: Mr. Carter's is the last to grow up with segregation, Mr. Clinton's and Mr. Gore's the first to grow up while Southerners, white and black, were being freed from it.
 
A Blend of Two Souths
 But if Mr. Carter symbolized the passing of the old order in the South, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore reflect the complexities of an evolving one that is neither cartoonish Old South nor neutered New South, but a sometimes-baffling blend of the two that is certain to shape the style and the content of the Clinton-Gore Administration.
"The thing about the South is that it's finally multiple rather than singular in almost every respect," said Hodding Carter, the Southern journalist and the State Department spokesman during the Carter Administration. "You've got to say about eight different things about each subject to say what it is, whereas before you could always say just a couple."
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, two Ivy Leaguers steeped in policies and programs, would never be confused with the denizens of William Faulkner's mythical Yoknapatawpha County. But even they bear out Faulkner's famous observation of the South. "The past is not dead," he said of the place. "It isn't even past."
 
Religiosity and Manners
 From their "yes m'am, no m'am" demeanor and their Southern Baptist upbringing to their centrist, eager-to-please campaign, both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore reflect the degree to which the religiosity and manners of Plains, Ga., Hope, Ark., and Carthage, Tenn., still dominate Atlanta, Little Rock and Nashville.
"I'm very skeptical of the notion that the South is disappearing," said Edward L. Ayers, professor of history at the University of Virginia. "People have been saying that for 100 years."
Even if Southerners want to forget their past, it is not likely that the rest of the nation will let them. When Jay Leno joked about the Democrats' "trying to get the all-important 'Hee-Haw' vote," and reporters referred to the Democratic candidates, who studied at Yale Law School and Harvard, as the "double bubba" ticket, it reflected the degree to which the South remains the nation's most caricatured region.
Tom Smith, a social scientist with the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, said the center's 1990 survey of ethnic images found that Americans view Southerners almost like a separate ethnic group, and regard them as "a little less intelligent, a little less hard-working" than whites in general.
 
The Southern 'Catch 22'
 Prof. John Shelton Reed of the University of North Carolina said, "A fellow named Jack Kirby at Miami University in Ohio once wrote about the Southern 'Catch 22', which is that if you're not picturesque or grotesque or conspicuously rustic, people stop thinking of you as Southern."
Professor Reed, a sociologist, added: "The Waltons on television were located in the Virginia mountains, but they weren't the Dukes of Hazzard, so as time went by, they lost their accents. I don't believe that non-Southerners' repertoire of stereotypes really has space for middle-class Southern folks."
The toned-down regional imagery surrounding Mr. Clinton, and particularly Mr. Gore, partly reflects the degree to which the Southern stereotypes do not fit them. It also results in part from Arkansas's being less definably Southern than a Deep South state like Georgia.
But beyond that, the transition from Mr. Carter to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore also mirrors the social and economic evolution of the South.
Although it was not precisely true even then, the Plains of 1976 could serve as a stand-in for the enduring, essential small-town South. But today it is clear that this town, with its economy based on cotton, soybeans, peanuts and Carter tourism, is not what the South is, but what it used to be.
Like the dusty Carter Administration souvenirs and painfully out-of-fashion, segregation-era memorabilia at the antique shop owned by the former President's cousin Hugh, Plains is a reminder that the South's economic progress has largely bypassed the places that are most distinctly "Southern."
"Some people are making a living, but no one's making any money," said Governor Wilson, a retired farmer, as he talked with a friend in front of the Phillips 66 gas station that used to be Billy Carter's forum.
Professor Reed noted that from 1980 to 1985, 90 percent of the new jobs in the South were in Texas, Florida and a dozen metropolitan areas elsewhere.
Shelby Foote, the Memphis novelist and Civil War historian, noted with great regret "the withering away of the small cities and towns throughout the South," and added: "They're dying at the core and their young people are leaving. It's the life I grew up with, and I can't begin to tell you how highly I think of it."
 
Changes in Race Relations
 At least as sweeping have been the changes in race relations since Mr. Carter made it to the White House in 1976. Mr. Carter's history as a moderate on racial matters and his ties to the Atlanta civil rights leadership helped define a new era of race relations in the South.
Since then, however, the South has moved from outgrowing the legacy of segregation to becoming the center of black political power in America. In 1976, 3 of the 17 blacks in Congress were from the South. Now, 17 of 40 are.
According to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research organization specializing in issues affecting blacks, the states that led the nation in the number of black elected officials in 1991 were Alabama with 706, Mississippi with 690 and Louisiana with 551. Alabama and Mississippi alone had 30 percent of the nation's total.
The Rev. Joseph Lowery, head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said there were still pockets of the South with "the smell of the dark ages," when it comes to racial justice.
But from Los Angeles to Howard Beach, the last 16 years have obliterated whatever was left of the idea that the South was unique in its struggles over race.
"I think the race issue is now, more than it's ever been, a national issue," Mr. Lowery said. "The whole country is South. It's down South, up South, over South and out South."
 
Carter Led the Way
 To some people the biggest political difference between Mr. Carter's South and Mr. Clinton's is simply that Mr. Carter came first.
"On Nov. 2 the South is being readmitted to the Union," ran one Carter campaign advertisement in 1976, which called the election "the most important day in our region's history."
In a historic way, Mr. Carter validated for the first time the post-civil-rights South. And having done so, just as John F. Kennedy neutralized the religious issue for Roman Catholics, Mr. Carter rendered the Southern issue less important for those who came after him.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore come to power from a far more national and less parochial base, in terms of votes as well as contacts, than Mr. Carter did. Even so, said Hodding Carter, the journalist, Jimmy Carter's election as a Southerner will make the transition easier for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore.
"The people who will come north with Clinton and Gore are not coming with a chip on their shoulder," he said, referring to the sometimes-rocky adjustment of the Georgians who formed the nucleus of the Carter Presidency. "They don't have to prove anything to anybody in Washington."
Instead, they come at a time when the economic progress of the South, like that of most of the United States, has stalled, when the aggressively pro-growth economics of the South match the national mood and when the South's voting this year was as fractured as it has been in this century.
 
Oozing Toward the South
 Like the popular crossover country music of Garth Brooks or Billy Ray Cyrus -- country, but only vaguely Southern -- it all suggests a new milestone in the South's slow rapprochement with the rest of the United States. Even the media images -- the difference between "Designing Women" and "Deliverance" -- may finally be beginning to catch up.
"What's happened is that middle America has kind of oozed toward the South, and it's put the South closer to the mainstream," said James C. Cobb, a professor of history at the University of Tennessee.
In that sense, Mr. Carter may be seen as a bridge between the unmistakably Southern politicians of an earlier era and the more national Southern politicians who have come to dominate the region -- whether they are Democrats like Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore or Republicans like Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, a Tennessean, and Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina
But if it is another step along the road, few expect it to be the end of the enduring imagery of the South.
"I think it demarcates something new," said Mr. Ayers, the University of Virginia history professor, "but if we think it's the end of the "Deliverance"-"Gone With the Wind"-"Dukes of Hazzard" image of the South, I think we're being very optimistic."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Examine Limits on Commercial Speech

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The Supreme Court heard arguments today in a free-speech case that could help define where advertising fits in the hierarchy of First Amendment protections.
The City of Cincinnati asked the Justices to reinstate a ban on the distribution of advertising brochures from newspaper vending machines that the city licenses for use on public property. 
 Two lower Federal courts ruled that the ban violated the First Amendment rights of the companies that publish the free brochures, one a compilation of local real estate listings and the other a listing of adult education courses and social activities.
Cincinnati's lawyer argued today that the selective ban, which eliminated the brochures from 62 vending machines while permitting newspapers to continue using nearly 2,000 other machines, was justified by an effort to control litter and visual clutter. He said the ban was permissible because the Supreme Court has ruled that speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction has a lower level of First Amendment protection than noncommercial speech.
 
Justices Join the Fray
 The Court has struggled for years over this question without reaching a clear resolution, and some of the strains were evident during the argument today.
The Court had many questions for the lawyers representing each side, and neither lawyer appeared prepared for some of the Justices' most pertinent queries. As often happens when the Justices find an argument less than satisfactory, they jumped into the case themselves, in the process conducting a lively argument that revealed a great deal of their own inclinations.
"Why do you pick on commercial speech?" Justice Antonin Scalia demanded of Mark S. Yurick, Cincinnati's assistant city solicitor. Without giving the lawyer a chance to respond, Justice Scalia continued, "When I think back to the important decisions in my life, buying a house was one of the most important."
Justice Scalia said that for himself and for other home buyers getting information about the real estate market was "much more important than the war in Bosnia," yet Cincinnati was trying to keep the real estate brochures out of the vending machines. "Why is that speech so unimportant that it can be suppressed?" he asked.
Mr. Yurick replied that the Court itself has indicated that commercial speech is entitled to a "lesser degree of protection."
 
Space as a Limiter
 Justice Scalia was not satisfied. He said the Court had allowed government to suppress commercial speech "only for purposes that had something to do with the distinctive nature of commercial speech," as with advertising that was fraudulent. "But commercial speech doesn't clutter up your sidewalks any more than other speech, does it?" Justice Scalia said.
Marc D. Mezibov, a Cincinnati lawyer for the two advertisers, also encountered skeptical responses to his assertion that the Constitution did not permit the city to treat advertisers any differently than newspapers in the context of vending machine access.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that the Supreme Court itself maintains three vending machines for daily newspapers in a small alcove on the ground floor. Would the Court be violating the First Amendment, Justice O'Connor asked, if it refused a request from the publisher of an advertising brochure to add another machine? "Or can we limit it and say we have a very small space and we have to allocate it somehow," she said.
Mr. Mezibov hesitantly answered that the Court might be able to justify a limitation on the basis of limited space.
"Well, in a sense aren't the city streets a finite resource that can get too cluttered?" Justice O'Connor asked.
The argument underscored one difficulty with the Court's commercial-speech doctrine, that of deciding just what commercial speech is. The Cincinnati ordinances that give newspapers a right of access to vending machines while banning the distribution of "commercial handbills" on the streets do not define the two categories.
Several Justices commented that newspapers often carry large amounts of advertising. The real estate advertising brochure in this case, in turn, occasionally carries articles about mortgage interest rates and related subjects.
"Is there a definition that divides the world into two categories, newspapers and commercial speech?" Justice David H. Souter asked Mr. Yurick, the city's lawyer.
Mr. Yurick replied that the two were different and that " 'newspaper' is not such a vague term that it can't be understood by a reasonable person."
Justice Souter asked, "Isn't your problem that the ordinance is inarticulate?" He added: "We have no idea what the city may decide to do next."
The case, Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, No. 91-1200, is an appeal from a 1991 ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which has its headquarters in Cincinnati.
In the decision, written by Judge Danny J. Boggs, the appeals court said that commercial speech "has a high value to the society" and should be presumed to enjoy full First Amendment protection except when it is false, deceptive, or proposes a commercial transaction that is itself illegal or would create some distinctive harmful effect. The distribution of advertising brochures from vending machines fell into none of these categories, Judge Boggs said.
There were these other developments at the Court today:
 
Cap on Damages
 The Court, without comment, refused to hear a constitutional challenge to a cap on damage awards against the state, adopted by the Colorado Legislature. The Colorado Governmental Immunity Act provides that the state's financial liability, in an accident in which the state is at fault, will be no more than $150,000 per person or $400,000 per accident.
The limitation was challenged on behalf of the 9 people who were killed and the 19 people who were injured when a 6.7-ton boulder being moved by a state highway crew fell off a Rocky Mountain highway and hit a Grey Line sightseeing bus in August 1987. Claims against the state are in the millions of dollars, but the $400,000 limit provides only $11,000 for each victim of the accident if the pool of money were to be divided equally. The Colorado Supreme Court upheld the cap as a valid economic regulation. The case was DeFoor v. Pacheco, No. 91-1922.
 
Detroit Car Dealers
 The Court refused to hear a challenge by 94 Detroit automobile dealers to a finding by the Federal Trade Commission that a 20-year agreement among them to limit their showroom hours and to remain closed on Saturdays was a violation of Federal antitrust law.
Detroit is the only metropolitan area in the country in which automobile dealerships are closed on Saturdays. The dealers entered into the agreement as a way of limiting their employees' working hours in order to thwart a labor organizing drive by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The Sixth Circuit upheld the trade commission's findings earlier this year, while sending the case back to the commission for further consideration of the hours the dealers should be required to stay open. The case was Detroit Auto Dealers v. F.T.C., No. 92-333.

HEADLINE: Exhibition Examines Scientists' Complicity In Nazi-Era Atrocities

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It is a question that few have been willing to face or to debate for decades. Why were so many doctors and scientists so intimately involved in some of the greatest atrocities of Nazi Germany?
There is a tendency to see these atrocities, from the deliberate extermination of millions of people to barbaric medical experiments on thousands of innocents, as isolated occurrences during a period of madness more than a half century ago. 
 Many people, including some historians, have attributed these acts to the perversions of a few sadists and madmen who, through coercion, forced others to become unwilling participants in these programs.
But that view, particularly as it pertains to doctors, nurses and other health workers in Germany before and during World War II, is being challenged by medical historians and ethicists who say that there was more at work than people being forced into compromise and crime at the barrel of a gun.
 
Devaluation of Human Life
 A disturbing exhibit that opened here last week at the National Museum of Health and Medicine argues that something happened to German science and medicine after World War I as attempts to expand health care and to improve society were turned into a system that devalued human beings and allowed doctors to abandon their ethical responsibilities.
Modern medicine, which faces such ethical questions as rationing of health care, using genetic engineering to identify or treat disease, testing experimental treatments with human subjects, or doctor-assisted suicide for the terminally ill, must never forget what happened in Germany and how easily ethics can be eaten away by expedience, the exhibit's organizers said.
The exhibit, "The Value of The Human Being: Medicine in Germany, 1918-1945," was commissioned by the Berlin Medical Association and was first shown in 1989. The current exhibit is co-sponsored by the American Medical Association.
Dr. Christian Pross and Dr. Gotz Aly, members of a group of young German doctors and historians who began searching archives in the early 1980's to uncover the role of the medical establishment before and during the war, said doctors in their country had developed a "collective amnesia" when the era was over.
"No one wanted to admit to what extent they profited under the system and how none of this could have happened without the direct complicity of the German medical establishment," Dr. Pross said in a telephone interview. "It was more than just a few doctors who were involved," he said. "The medical establishment knew what was happening and lended a credibility to it through its direct and indirect involvement."
 
Agents of the State
 Dr. Marc Micozzi, the physician who directs the museum that is showing the exhibit through Dec. 9, said many people, including doctors, would like to believe that what happened in Nazi Germany can never happen again. However, he said, the exhibit of 45 panels of text and photos illustrates how changes in how doctors view their relationship with patients can lead to disaster. "If we don't understand how it happened in the first place, how can we assure it won't happen again?," Dr. Micozzi asked.
The groundwork for atrocity was paved with good intentions, said Dr. Pross and other experts. After World War I, Germany's Weimar Republic tried to use scientific principles to build a better, more orderly society, including establishing the first true system of universal access to health care. This system emphasized using the best medical technology for treatment and research into the causes of disease, coupled with a strong emphasis on preventive medicine.
 
Seeking Superior Genes
 This new interest in improving Germany's health, which produced substantial decreases in infant mortality, tuberculosis and venereal disease through expanded use of public clinics and hospitals, shifted the emphasis of medicine from helping each individual to improving the health of the community at large, experts said. Many doctors became agents of the state instead of advocates of the patient, they said, and began viewing people as impersonal statistics instead of individuals.
In addition, theories of genetic inequality among races and the idea that some people had greater value than others to society were gaining popularity worldwide and particularly in Germany. Numerous genetic institutes were established to study racial differences and to prove the superiority of "Caucasians of non-Jewish origin."
When Western economies were hit with the Great Depression in 1929, the Weimar Republic had much less money for health care and began cutting back on services. Limited resources were used to help people of greatest value -- nnon-Jewish whites in the workforce. This cost-benefit approach worked against people who were poor or who were considered an expression of genetic inferiority, and those who suffered from mental illness, deformity and inherited diseases or conditions.
Adolf Hitler and his followers embraced the idea that the right to life must be earned and justified, not assumed, and this became an excuse for eliminating the genetically deficient, who consumed valuable resources. Among those considered deficient were Jews, gypsies, people of mixed blood and those with inherited illnesses.
The exhibit suggests that doctors, more than any other professional group in Germany, accepted the new order. More than 38,000 doctors, almost half of Germany's total, joined the Nazi Party. Being part of this system allowed doctors and scientists to get research grants, receive promotions at universities and take over the jobs and practices of thousands of Jews who were no longer allowed to practice medicine.
It was hard for doctors who did not go along with the system to advance their careers, Dr. Pross said, but he added that there was little evidence that physicians who refused to take part were killed or sent to prisonunless they also actively worked against the party or supported the underground.
Fewer than 100 doctors and scientists were found guilty of war crimes in Allied courts after the war, said Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota. But he said many more had helped to conduct research on prisoners and to organize the death camps by assisting in designing and reviewing the "research" or by offering technical assistance.
Dr. Caplan, who edited the book "When Medicine Went Mad: Bioethics and the Holocaust," (1992, Humana Press), said the role of mainstream medicine and science in the atrocities had been underplayed.
"A relatively small number of doctors and scientists took a direct role in killing and torture," Dr. Caplan said. "But a large number, many in universities and prestigious institutions, provided intellectual and professional support for the policies of the Nazis."
 
'An Awesome Potential'
 Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice-president of the American Medical Association, said there is always a moral hazard when powerful individuals achieve such dominance over ordinary people. Doctors, he said, have a special responsibility because people entrust them with their privacy as well as with with their lives. The museum, which is located on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.
"The great concern of American physicians is the Government increasingly interfering with the doctor-patient relationship," Dr. Todd said. "One of our biggest challenges today is balancing medicine and health against the resources available. But we have to strive to do this without forgetting about the patients we serve."
The issues that faced German doctors still exist, and modern biomedical science has given people the tools to manipulate human genetics in ways the Nazis could never have dreamed of, Dr. Todd said. "Genetic manipulation gives us an awesome potential to use it for good, to detect and treat disease and deformity," he said. "But we must learn to use it morally and ethically, without stepping over the line."
The exhibit, which shows what can happen when doctors stop following the Hippocratic Oath with its admonitions to "give no deadly medicine to any one if asked" and to "abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption," teaches that human beings cannot be devalued below the sum of their parts.
"These were our brothers and sisters," Dr. Todd said of those depicted in the exhibit, "The ones who suffered so, and the ones who inflicted the suffering upon them."

HEADLINE: In Provinces, Artists Learn Self-Sufficiency Is Price of Freedom

SERIES: The Arts in Russia -- Second of three articles: Getting Along Without Moscow

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PERM, Russia

 BODY:
Bouncing along in a used right-hand-drive Toyota on the pothole-ridden streets of this, the capital of the Ural Mountains region, one passes a movie theater playing "Vampires of Beverly Hills" and "Phantom II" as an American rapper boasts from the car radio about how bad he is and warns us not to disrespect his brother.
As in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia's outlying capitals sometimes seem dizzy with change and awash in Western trivia. Yet like the provincial cities themselves, more tightly run and less rampantly chaotic than the centers, the arts in Perm, which is on the borderline between European Russia and Asian Russia, Voronezh in southwestern Russia, and Novosibirsk and Irkutsk in Siberia actually appear steadier and more settled than the anarchic volatility of the western Russian metropolises.
 
Points of Interest Indeed
 Many of these cities have fascinating cultural histories. Voronezh, today a shabby but still picturesque city in the midst of the Russian agricultural heartland, was the first stop for Stalinist exiles in the 1930's. They were detained there while evidence of further crimes against the state was sought, and if no greater sins turned up, they were allowed to stay. The result was a disproportionate number of lively Moscow and Leningrad artists and intellectuals, who fostered local culture. 
 Perm, which is particularly rundown despite its spectacular perch above the Kama River, has its own Stalinist ghosts as the site of a dense concentration of prisons, some of them political. The city's cultural horizons were broadened during World War II, when the Kirov Opera and Ballet were sent there for safekeeping during the siege of Leningrad. Today, Perm's ballet conservatory is one of the most famous in Russia.
In Novosibirsk, whose broad boulevards and anonymous architecture epitomize the grimness of Soviet urban planning, the principal cultural ornament is the Novosibirsk Philharmonic. Founded in 1956 by the feisty conductor Arnold Katz and sustained by him ever since, it is now one of the premiere Russian orchestras, playing regular concert series in both Novosibirsk and the university and research center of Akademgorodok, 20 miles to the south.
Certainly a visitor to a recent performance of Glazunov's ballet "Raymonda" at the Perm State Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet would have been hard pressed to discern the aura of crisis and despair that pervades so many artists in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The production, a new one, was traditional but fresh and opulent. The dancing was at a high level, in no way "provincial." And the audience, which filled the theater, was well dressed and sophisticated.
Hard-Liners Memories of Past
Shore Up Present
The relative stability of cultural life in the provinces has something to do with simple inertia. And it owes something to the prevalence in regional parliaments of ex-Communist hard-liners and Russian nationalists (the two are often the same) eager to perpetuate Soviet artistic values and institutions.
With the overthrow of Communism, the West was captivated by pictures of giant statues of Lenin, leveled by blowtorches and cranes, lying helplessly on the ground. Mighty Lenin statues still dominate the provinces. One stands in the square in front of the Voronezh State Opera and Ballet Theater, and the comparable theater in Perm not only has a nearly identical statue, but also boasts Communist Street as its address. Igor M. Nepomnyashchy, the director of the Voronezh theater, greets visitors with a formal Lenin portrait on the wall behind him (Tchaikovsky is on the opposite wall).
The differences between the big western Russian cities and the provinces also stem from President Boris N. Yeltsin's reforms, and especially from a profound change in government financing. This was meant to break down inefficient centralization and to restore autonomy and self-determination to the regions.
 
Central Budgets Slashed
 The budget of the central Russian Ministry of Culture was sharply reduced. Given runaway inflation -- 300 percent over the summer alone -- meaningful dollar figures are almost impossible to adduce. Yevgeny Y. Sidorov, the Russian Minister of Culture, said that under the Soviet system, culture received between 3 and 4 percent of the national budget -- his ultimate goal for his ministry -- but that now the share was below 1 percent. To accomplish anything, he must wheedle for state funds and private support like the manager of the smallest theater. "I have to beg and solicit money," he said.
With its diminished state funds, Moscow still directly supports some institutions of national importance, particularly in Moscow and St. Petersburg. But much of the financing of major institutions elsewhere has been turned over to provincial administrators, who are usually Yeltsin appointees but who may not heed guidelines from the central ministry as to financing levels.
In the Soviet system, local governments and administrators found all sorts of ways to circumvent central authority. In Voronezh, the local Communist Party built an opulent puppet theater without informing Moscow that money was being spent for that purpose. "There were lots of ways of cheating Moscow before perestroika," recalled Yuri Pchelkin, the head of the Voronezh regional Arts Department, with sly pride.
But now, decentralization represents state policy, even if President Yeltsin and his team are still concerned that local authorities sometimes insist on looking to Moscow for handouts rather than developing their own local support systems. "People are still accustomed to central planning," Mr. Sidorov said. "They should do it themselves; things should be handled locally."
In most provincial cities, grumbling aside, they are. And many of them have ample resources on which to draw. Russian regions, or oblasts, correspond to American states, and they can be huge, especially in Siberia. Vladimir M. Lapenkov, the head of culture for the Irkutsk oblast, casually allowed that his region was three times the size of France. They can also contain autonomous ethnic territories, such as the Ust-Ordynsky Buryat National District in the Irkutsk oblast.
 
Rich and Poor
As Money Flows So Go the Arts
 The regions vary widely in economic health, and hence in their ability to support local culture. Voronezh, Perm and Irkutsk, for instance, are all military-industrial centers, but officials in Irkutsk seem more optimistic about the economic health of their industrial base than do arts leaders in Voronezh and Perm. In Voronezh, there is concern that the local politicians slight cultural support in favor of more pressing social concerns, and about what beleaguered officials see as the unfairness of having to underwrite a drama conservatory that provides actors not just for the region, but for the entire country.
Irkutsk officials boast that their region, buoyed by oil and chemical development and forestry, is better off economically than most other Siberian areas. Unlike in Perm, where community performing groups dried up after the fall of Communism, they are thriving in Irkutsk. "There was a decline at first," said Mr. Lapenkov. "The trade unions gave up all support for culture, but we just took it over. The number of amateur groups has actually increased."
 
Optimism in the Hinterlands
 In general, regional cultural administrators seem more optimistic about the present health and future prospects of their cultural activities than officials in Moscow and St. Petersburg. "Culture has the same problems as the country as a whole," said Liana Mekhtardzheva, the manager of the regional cultural administration in Perm. "But much to our advantage, the people -- the local administration, the cultural community and the audiences -- understand these difficulties. It's a great help to us. Together, we're trying to preserve the artistic treasures of Perm."
Optimism is partly inspired by local pride and competitive feeling. The director of the Perm State Art Gallery, Nadezhda Belyayeva, said: "Ours is the main museum in the Urals, and it will continue to be that. Perm has always been the cultural center of this region, and we are not going to give up the lead."
Miss Mekhtardzheva, the head of regional culture in Perm, fiercely defended regional prerogatives against claims from Moscow. "We are not going to give back our Perm theaters to Moscow," she said. "Whoever provides the money can do whatever they want with the theaters." Mr. Katz, the conductor of the Novosibirsk Philharmonic, boasted that he needed no sponsors and still paid his musicians two to three times the going rate in the country as a whole.
 
Neighbors
Pride and Support For Local Culture
 Optimism reflects the close-knit cultural, political and economic forces that run these cities. Although they are not small -- from 600,000 for Irkutsk to 1.8 million for Novosibirsk -- they are less cosmopolitan and more manageable than St. Petersburg (5 million) and Moscow (9 million).
The synergy within provincial life can be seen in various ways. In Irkutsk, local authorities are trying to upgrade the dismal quality of films at commercial movie theaters by subsidizing the showing of quality pictures. In Perm, Miss Mekhtardzheva helped the choreographer Yevgeny Panfilov set up his modern-dance company.
Regional and municipal cultural commissions are eager to act as clearing houses for potential private sponsors. In Voronezh, where former Communists were recently voted into power in the regional parliament, the House of Culture has been refurbished as a "business center" complete with slinky hostesses in mini-dresses, all intended to to lubricate proto-capitalist communication and encourage cultural philanthropy. Such coordination can prove mightily successful: Ninel G. Pidemskaya, the administrative director of the ballet conservatory in Perm, said her budget had actually increased in real terms because of private sponsorship.
Even with decentralization, resentment runs high against the national tax system. "The law doesn't help -- not in any way," complained Ivan P. Chukhnov, the head of the Voronezh municipal Culture Department. "Last Christmas, a company donated 100,000 rubles for the holiday festival, and in three weeks they were taxed 30,000 rubles. That's against logic and common sense."
In the rush to privatization, and given the readiness of former Communist managers to seize ownership of state-run industries, a curious blending of public and private is taking place. A new, supposedly private television station will often list local public officials and former Party leaders as stockholders. While this blurs the line between state ownership and capitalist enterprise, it does facilitate a station's access to public airwaves and financial backing.
Local authorities also help arts institutions evade Moscow guidelines. Ideal budgetary levels are generally set, for instance, in relation to the number of an institution's employees. That number tended to be larger than needed under the Soviet system, which guaranteed employment no matter how useless. Now, institutional leaders are letting their work forces decline through attrition, yet are retaining their old subsidies pegged to the official employee levels. Officially, the Voronezh Theater for Youth has 33 actors, but there are 7 vacancies and no plans to fill them. "The money goes to the other actors," explained Mikhail V. Bychkov, the artistic director of the theater.
 
Preservation
Tradition Over Trends
 Large performing-arts institutions in the Russian provinces generally lag behind the innovative tendencies of such companies as the two St. Petersburg operas, the Kirov and the Maly. In Voronezh, the director of the opera theater explained the limited repertory, with little Wagner or Italian opera or 20th-century opera, on what he called "technical" grounds. In Perm, however, repertory seems livelier -- there was a triple bill of 20th-century operas this spring -- and attendance has held up to near capacity, despite unemployment and inflation.
The emphasis on 19th-century Russian operas, plays and ballets may simply reflect local taste and a desire for reassurance in an unsettling period. But it may also indicate a determination to reinforce Russian values in a "time of troubles" -- a phrase that echoes the turbulent 16th century as captured in such operas as Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov" and "Khovanshchina." The emphasis on Russian patriotic and religious values has become a veritable fad, dismissed as such by cynics and progressives.
Even the much feared cultural diaspora, or artistic brain drain, seems to have less impact on the provinces than on Moscow and St. Petersburg. There is a periodic turnover of artists, and in some cases a palpable loss has been felt. Mr. Katz, the Novosibirsk conductor, said he missed three musicians who had departed for higher German wages. Vladimir Verbitsky, the conductor of the Voronezh Philharmonic, has been on leave for two years in the West, and that has indeed disrupted local musical life, said Mr. Nepomnyashchy, the opera director.
 
New Blood for Old
 But mostly the losses have either been welcome or perceived as part of a normal pattern in which ambitious performers move upward within the Russian system itself. "The situation is stable here," said Mr. Lapenkov in Irkutsk. Mr. Katz said the departure of six older players to Israel was no great loss, since they were past their prime. Of course, there have been more vacancies recently in Moscow and St. Petersburg as artists there gravitate west. But often, as with two new actors in Irkutsk, local cultural life has been invigorated by Russian artists fleeing unrest in the former Soviet republics.
Progressive artists, with or without affiliations to the old state-theater system, have a harder time in the provincial capitals, and a sense of detachment from the West can be felt. "Because of the isolation of the Russian provinces, our collections are not known in the world," lamented Miss Belyayeva of the Perm State Art Gallery, which has particularly rich holdings of wooden religious sculptures, many taken from churches destroyed during the Stalin years.
The one modern-dance company in Novosibirsk recently disbanded, and there is no private gallery scene in Perm, largely because of high rents. Yet the museum helps make up the gap by sponsoring a commercial gallery within its walls, exercising a certain selectivity in the artists it allows to display there.
More radical money-making schemes are not confined to the provinces. These can range from museum gift shops, a commonplace in the West, to more bizarre ventures such as the toothpaste for sale at the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, the home of the Kirov Opera and Ballet, or part of the lobby of the Voronezh Theater for Youth's being rented out to a Chinese clothing store. AIST-TV in Irkutsk supplements its income by printing business newspapers and tourist guides.
 
Space Instead of Money
 In Perm, which seems less well off economically than either Voronezh or Irkutsk, Mr. Panfilov is popular with audiences and admired by the local cultural authorities. Although they have been unable to provide him a regular subsidy or to arrange for sponsorship support, they did manage this fall to gain him access every Friday to the Perm Drama Theater for performances, and are working to obtain an unused movie theater as his permanent base.
Mr. Bychkov, the progressive Voronezh theater director in whose state-owned building the Chinese venture flourishes, has been applauded locally and internationally. But he must work within the confines of the old Soviet system, and local officials -- who in this case include proud former Communists -- try to make him devote more of his energies to youth performances.
He dreams of establishing his own, privately supported Chamber Theater, but he cannot find adequate sponsorship and he has no idea where to get a theater to match the one he has now. "I keep my ideal of a Chamber Theater inside," he said. "When it's time, it will come out. In the meantime, I can do something here, and that's why I don't quit."
 
Minorities
Ethnic Differences Are Recognized
 Despite the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia has many officially recognized ethnic minorities, and their cultural relations with the Russian mainstream remain problematic, especially in Siberia, with its huge ethnic districts and autonomous ethnic republics.
For Mr. Lapenkov of the Irkutsk regional administration, multi-cultural relativity on the Western model is not yet an issue. "High culture," by which he meant European culture, "is international," he said. "We cannot speak of it in terms of Siberian or Russian: it belongs to the whole world." Yet he also said that in the newly decentralized regional cultural scheme, the subsidy of such minority cultures as the Buryats and the Tofalars was actually more generous than before.
In the end, local pride and a tenuous economic self-sufficiency seem to have blunted the pessimism endemic to Moscow and St. Petersburg. "The people of Perm did not get their wages for three months," said Miss Mekhtardzheva. "Yet the theaters were still sold out."
Mr. Nepomnyashchy of the Voronezh State Opera and Ballet Theater agreed. "People have to find time for everything in life, including the theater," he said. "You can't always go to demonstrations."

HEADLINE: PERSONAL COMPUTERS;
The Case of the Frustrated Shopper

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS

 BODY:
A COLLEAGUE went to the local computer store and ordered a Macintosh Powerbook 145. The store took his money and said delivery would be in three to four weeks. Five weeks passed, then six. He complained, and was told the Model 145's were "seriously backordered." He got the same story from a couple of other computer stores.
And it's not just Powerbooks. Shoppers trying to find Compaq Prolinea machines, I.B.M. Valuepoints, Dell Dimensions or any other popular computers often find that they must wait weeks, and sometimes months, for their orders to be filled. Supplies of color monitors, hard disk drives and power supplies are also "constrained," as salesmen like to say when the elves have not been working fast enough. 
 If it is any consolation, the big corporate buyers are waiting right along with somebody who wants a single machine.
"Everybody's got short supplies," said Bobby Orbach, president of Orbach Inc., a computer industry consulting concern in New York City.
For thousands of computer buyers and sellers, frustration over short supplies is growing. And it appears that no relief is imminent, because computer companies are forecasting continued high demand for the next six months.
"Business is hot, and nobody expected it," said Seymour Merrin, president of Merrin Information Services Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.
Benjamin Rosen, chairman of the Compaq Computer Corporation, said last week that even if his company could obtain all the parts it wanted, it would still not be able to meet demand for Compaq's Prolineas.
The short supplies are the result of several factors, foremost among them the PC price war that started in June. Computer companies grossly underestimated demand for new, lower-cost computers. As a result they did not order enough components to make the machines. Once they realized the magnitude of the demand, factories were put on double or even triple shifts, but the companies that supply the computer makers with key parts could not keep up.
When economic indicators suggest that the country is mired in a stubborn recession, why are so many computer companies overwhelmed with demand?
"It's a phenomenon," Mr. Merrin suggested, and it is fueled by three converging groups of buyers.
Owners of older XT and AT-class computers are discovering that they have to buy newer and more powerful machines to run today's software, especially Microsoft Windows 3.1.
Companies that had planned to add computers anyway are snapping up bargain-priced PC's, especially those built around the i486 microprocessor, at a rapid pace. "What we're getting today in terms of value for the dollar is unbelieveable," said Mr. Merrin, who was one of the country's first personal computer dealers.
Last, Mr. Merrin said, are "the new buyers, who may have been computerphobes." Small businesses are discovering that they cannot afford not to have a PC, since all their competitors and suppliers and accountants are using them. And, after a decade of seeing advertisements and listening to boring cocktail party chatter about bits and bytes, many individuals are finally confident enough to take the plunge, using the "If my idiot brother-in-law can learn to use a PC, then I can too" rationale.
All these shoppers are converging on an industry that is famous for periods of feast and famine. The advice from Mr. Orbach is to keep looking. "The smart retailers have already boosted orders to get larger allocations," he said. "If you really hunt and know where to buy, you may pay a little more but at least you'll find what you want."
"The retailers who are less fortunate can always, if they're good, move people to different brands," Mr. Orbach added. It is not quite bait and switch, but it means persuading a customer that one computer is pretty much like another.
Experienced computer buyers learned long ago that despite all the braying by computer companies, there are really very few important differences among major brands. So, switching to Brand X is less upsetting to them.
But for novice computer users, who often investigate a potential purchase for weeks or months and count each byte being offered, it is discouraging to be told that their first-choice machine will not be available until after the holidays.
Apple Computer Inc. customers are in different straits. Our Powerbook 145 shopper could not switch to Brand X because there are no non-Apple Powerbooks. Industry analysts suggest that Apple has taken orders for 50,000 more Model 145's than it has been able to produce, and that there are even 30,000 back orders for Model 170's, which Apple discontinued in September.
So rather than wait indefinitely, the shopper decided to spend a few hundred dollars more for a Powerbook 160, which the store had in stock. He will be happy with it because it is a better machine, and the dealer is happy to make the sale.
While Mr. Merrin expects the shortages to last several more months, he does see a change ahead. "Our industry has a classic pattern," he said. "Like politicians, we never learn from history. First we underproduce, and then to meet demand we overproduce."

HEADLINE: TV SPORTS;
Now Duva Takes a Risk In Pay-Per-View Ring

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
The $2.75 million loss incurred by TVKO for last June's Evander Holyfield-Larry Holmes heavyweight title fight took more than just a stash of cash out of Time Warner's pay-per-view boxing service. It took the risk out, too.
The risk-free TVKO debuts Friday night with the Holyfield-Riddick Bowe championship bout. This time, TVKO is paid a fee to market, distribute and produce the TV telecast of the fight, unlike other events when it bought the rights to the fight, guaranteed the fighters' purses and took what profits it could, which, unfortunately, were not many. 
 "We've opted for less gain and less glory," said Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner Sports. "We think it's a terrific fight, but we simply could not agree on a buyout license fee."
Taking the risk usually assumed by TVKO is promoter Dan Duva, who would like to prove Abraham dead wrong. According to Duva, they parted ways on selling the fight to TVKO when he projected it would draw 800,000 to 1 million pay-per-view buyers and Abraham estimated it wouldn't exceed 600,000.
Abraham said his pessimism grew out of the fight vying for attention with basketball, football, hockey and the overriding interest in the Presidential election. Said Duva: "We'll be happy to take all the money. We're very happy to do it."
Duva's financing comes from the usual sources: domestic and foreign pay-per-view and closed-circuit sales, corporate sponsorships, the site fee from the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas and the gate receipts. Duva projects that Holyfield, who has a percentage of the pay-per-view sales, will probably take home between $15 million and $18 million. Bowe is guaranteed $7 million.
Because Duva is in charge, he's altered a few things from the TVKO model. Most notable will be a change in analyst. For this fight, Joe Goossen is, thankfully, out and ESPN's Al Bernstein is out. Host Khambrel Marshall is out and Jim Hill is in. Len Berman remains as the blow-by-blow announcer.
If Duva's gamble succeeds, this financial format may become a regular at TVKO, which doesn't want any more financial debacles like Holyfield-Holmes, which, with about 735,000 buyers, fell short of expectations, or the Mike McCallum-James Toney fight last December that lost nearly $1 million.
Fiscal prudence -- compounded by the recession, the absence of Mike Tyson and the shortage of fights and fighters worth a $40 pay-per-viewing -- reigns at TVKO, which laid off 12 workers in the summer and will stage six fights next year, down from 12 in its first year.
The Holyfield-Bowe pay-per-view performance, of course, will determine how urgently Duva takes on future financial burdens in order to snare upside bonanzas. It may also alter TVKO's structure because both Duva and promoter Bob Arum receive 20 percent of profits from fights they license to TVKO.
"We'll look at deals fight-by-fight," said Abraham. "What Dan brings to us in the future will determine whether we roll the dice. And I've talked to Arum about one or two distribution deals with him."
If TVKO mixes risk-averse distribution deals with equity participation arrangements, the service would look like SET, Showtime's pay-per-view arm. SET is a partner with Don King, who generally raises the money for pay-per-view cards while SET markets, distributes and produces them. SET has no regular schedule, as TVKO originally did, but stages fights as they come.
"Having not done so well in its first year," said Shelly Finkel, Holyfield's manager, "I think TVKO sometimes will do some deals like this one with Dan and some like they usually do."
 
AIRWAVES
 Any hubbub about WNBC-TV/ Channel 4's LEN BERMAN jumping to WCBS-TV/Channel 2 must be viewed in light of WCBS's desire to pay whomever replaces the long-departed WARNER WOLF a lot less than the estimated $1 million Berman now gets. . . . Oh, What A Relief Dept.: Going from Sunday night football on TNT with ClicheLand monarchs GARY BENDER and PAT HADEN to ESPN with pre- and post-game king CHRIS BERMAN and announcers MIKE PATRICK and JOE THEISMANN. . . . The use of GoalpostCam Sunday on Chicago Bear DARREN LEWIS's 35-yard touchdown run made a case for use of the camera on every telecast. . . . The CBS football analyst RANDY CROSS is very good, and getting better with each telecast; rookie MATT MILLEN, who has an amusing, quirky way of saying things, has star potential. . . . I'm still recovering from weekly exposure to the most awkward sponsored feature on pro football telecasts: NBC's Hagger Wrinkle-Free Cottons Super Play of the Game.

HEADLINE: National Security, Redefined

 BODY:
High-tech weapons proliferate. Dictators flout international law and opinion. And ethnic strife sunders a galaxy of post-Communist states. The world, Bill Clinton rightly affirms, remains a dangerous place.
But at least for Americans, the danger has greatly diminished. For the first time since Pearl Harbor, a new Administration takes power with no global strategic threat hanging over it. Economic issues like European protectionism, North American free trade and competitiveness with Asia have moved to the center of foreign policy debate. Mr. Clinton would be wise to seize this opportunity to change the national security agenda. 
 Foreign policy involves far more than secret arms deals, late night calls to world leaders and military showdowns. As Bill Clinton and Al Gore well appreciate, America's international influence ultimately depends on the strength of its economy, and how well it adjusts to the demands of the global marketplace.
There's no longer any excuse for allowing America's foreign initiatives and aid programs to be driven by anxieties about what rival military powers might be up to. Absent a compelling military threat, foreign policy ideas will have to compete for public support on the basis of their consistency with American values, like democracy, human rights and environmental protection.
Mr. Clinton pointed the way on the campaign trail, giving priority to his plans for rebuilding U.S. economic strength, repudiating protectionism and urging that American influence be used to promote higher labor and environmental standards abroad.
Still, Pentagon spending could be slashed far more boldly than Mr. Clinton has proposed. That would free resources for such real national security challenges as urban decay and educational neglect. Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton must tend to an inherited agenda of trade negotiations, arms control with former Soviet republics, Middle East peace talks and cease-fire enforcement with Iraq.
Prospects for a Uruguay Round global trade agreement hinge for now on the success of President Bush's threat of retaliatory duties against European white wine. But the North American Free Trade Agreement can be ratified in Mr. Clinton's first month.
Political and financial support for former Communist nations struggling with reform offers the best insurance against renewed confrontation. To maintain the momentum of Middle East peace, Mr. Bush might invite Mr. Clinton to send a representative to the negotiations now. Mr. Clinton must somehow signal sufficient evenhandedness between Israelis and Arabs to keep this genuine triumph of Mr. Bush's from dribbling away.
Iraq needs to be held strictly to the arms control and other provisions of Security Council resolutions. But Mr. Clinton ought to heed the advice of the chief U.N. arms inspector, Rolf Ekeus, and encourage Baghdad's cooperation by pledging that full compliance would bring an end to the international oil embargo.
The new Administration also needs to ease America out of the costly role of world policeman by helping to transform the United Nations and regional groups into credible instruments for enforcing collective security.
Mr. Clinton cannot afford to lapse into national security business as usual, carrying forward cold war spending levels and rhetoric into an era of strategic peace. The nation's real security needs won't allow it.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Clinton And the Mideast

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
In the icy days of Polish Communism, an editor in Warsaw slipped past the censors a little drawing that told exactly what Poles felt about their rulers and their Soviet and German neighbors, and the whole hard world.
"The dream of the Polish nation," said the caption. The drawing was just of the moon in space. But on the moon was a tiny map of Poland -- high, away, deliciously alone. 
 During the Presidential campaign, the candidates went along with Americans' own moon dream. They acted as if they really thought the American economic navel could live separate from the rest of the world's body and pains.
But sometimes, almost as a forbidden luxury, they delivered reminders that the world still turned, somewhere down there.
President Bush showed no recovery from the professional distortion of so many American foreign policy bureaucrats. Like them, he suffers from the inability to grasp that dictators are inherently dangerous because no amount of appeasement can remove their survival instinct to solve problems by oppression at home and war abroad.
President-elect Clinton, to my ear and mind, understands that American power and American democratic idealism have to be combined to create American effectiveness, and that without one the other is crippled.
He cannot rid the world of dictatorships. But throughout his comments about the world runs a pledge not to use American knowledge and strength to help them.
That policy, carried out, would be the strongest barrier against war. Mr. Bush did not understand that.
Saddam Hussein showed that appeasing dictators and encouraging or permitting their military buildup creates the powder of war. Mr. Clinton inherits the still-vivid dangers of those policies:
Saddam Hussein in power after military defeat. Syria ruling Lebanon. Expansion of Syrian military strength. Economic and military explosion of Iranian power and the drive toward Iran's nuclear capacity.
Just yesterday some Americans of influence told us the way to deal with Saddam Hussein was to embrace him. Today similar seers warn us not to upset his neighbor dictator, Hafez al-Assad.
Evans and Novak, ever obsessed by Israel, are for the moment hugging the Labor Government, apparently in the hope it will obediently diminish Israeli power. But to show they have not lost their talent for comic journalism, they solemnly deliver a warning. They tell us that Labor is upset that some pro-Israel Democrats are trying to "stigmatize" Hafez al-Assad of Syria as a "missile-toting terrorist."
My word, those boys sure can write. Couldn't think of a better description myself.
Mr. Assad is not only a terrorist against foreigners and his own people but the landlord, paymaster and political pimp for the largest collection of terrorist killers ever gathered in one country: Iranian, Palestinian, Libyan, Lebanese, fundamentalist and of course Syrian. So large in fact that Syria has been officially listed as a terrorist nation by the United States, year after year.
That did not prevent Bushbaker from acceding -- polite word -- to the Syrian takeover of Lebanon, a bit of perfidy Americans barely note.
Missiles? Yes indeed, boys, all he can tote -- from Communist China, North Korea and other suppliers. He bought them with the money the Arabs gave him from sending his troops to watch the gulf war.
Iran: On Oct. 9 I wrote about Iran's military buildup, and its determination to become a nuclear military power. Stout denials flowed from Teheran's embassies. Since then news stories have provided more details about Iran's unrelenting, and increasingly successful, march to make oil, and military technology, the road to fundamentalist supremacy throughout the Middle East.
Mr. Clinton knows what is needed: a tough, single, unified international anti-proliferation mechanism buttressed by punitive national laws and international sanctions against violators.
We've known that for years. But we also knew it might lower profits of arms and technology manufacturers -- perhaps including American.
That will be Mr. Clinton's duty -- to choose. For all American Presidents and all American voters, foreign affairs have a way of becoming very American affairs, and the moon gets closer and closer.

HEADLINE: Capitalism Thins the Ranks of China's Rulers;
Radio Redundancy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"An Asian Voice for Democracy" (editorial, Oct. 20) states that a new broadcast service to Asia should be "independent of Voice of America, thus assuring a diversity of voices."
This proposal comes under the heading of expensive redundancy. There are more than 300 hours of foreign broadcasting a week into China by the Americans, British, French, Germans, Russians and others. Millions of Chinese listen to the Voice of America's broadcasts in Mandarin, Cantonese, Tibetan and English. During the terrible days of Tiananmen Square, Voice of America news was broadcast from loudspeakers into the square to the students, who knew that the world was watching. 
 Voice of America broadcasts 10 hours of world news and information each day in Mandarin, with emphasis on developments in China. In April, Voice of America established a news and research office in Hong Kong, and last September began "China Focus," a program dedicated to events inside China. Voice of America plans to target broadcasts throughout East and Southeast Asia under the name V.O.A. Asia.
There's another reason V.O.A. Asia makes sense, and Radio Free Asia, the concept you support, doesn't. Radio Free Asia would cost $69 million to start up and $39 million a year to run. Those estimates are from the special Congressional commission you cite, which many consider unrealistically low. The new system could take years to become fully operational and many more to achieve Voice of America's credibility and listening audience.

HEADLINE: Black Caucus in Congress Gains in Diversity and Experience

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 9

 BODY:
All but one of the 16 new black members of Congress brings a wealth of political or legislative experience to their jobs, a development that many say will mean a significant qualitative difference in Congress as well as a record number of black voices.
Of the 16 new members, 13 are from largely black districts that were created through reapportionment. Three others are replacing retiring or defeated black incumbents, making the net increase in the number of black members 13, the largest single increase since Reconstruction. 
 For some, the term "freshman" will seem strange indeed, since they will be giving up senior committee posts in their state legislatures when they move to Washington.
 
'They Aren't Newcomers'
 From the youngest, 29-year-old Cleo Fields of Louisiana, who served as chairman of the committee that passes on all major state appointments, to 66-year-old Carrie Meek of Florida, who was chairwoman of a major appropriations subcommittee in her State Senate, the move will mean a big change in the prerogatives of office.
Only 11 of the current 26 black members of Congress entered office with elective experience, said a spokesman for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. Representative John Lewis, a Democrat who has been a member from Georgia since 1987, said: "They aren't newcomers to the job like a lot of us were. They have command of issues and will be able to hit the ground running."
There will be a total of 39 blacks in the new House. David Bositis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, a political research organization specializing black issues, said that in addition to the political savvy that will characterize the new members, there will also be a greater regional diversity.
"There was a time when you talked about the Congressional Black Caucus that you were talking about a handful of people from half a dozen large cities across the country," said Mr. Bositis. "Now they are from all over the country, and some of their districts are whiter than those of their predecessors. It is too early to tell what impact all of this will have, but you do have people from different places with very different characteristics."
Many from this freshman class will gather in Atlanta on Tuesday for the first Black Congressional Leadership Institute, sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. Faith Edwards, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said the session would deal with some of the nuts and bolts of Congress, special workshops on ethics and efforts to establish connections between experienced Capitol Hill staff members and the aides that the new members will be hiring.
With the addition of Carol Moseley Braun, the only black member of the Senate and the first black woman to be elected to that body, the Congressional Black Caucus will have 40 members.
Of the group, only Mel Reynolds, who takes over the Chicago Congressional seat that had been held by Gus Savage, has never held elective office. Ten others are or were once members of state legislatures, often holding crucial committee or leadership posts, and three others held municipal or county elective offices. Of the remaining new black House members, Alcee Hastings of Florida was a Federal judge before his impeachment and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina has for the last 17 years been the state's human affairs commissioner, an appointive post.
In all, the group exhibits a confidence perhaps best typified by Earl F. Hilliard, 50, a former state Senator who represents Alabama's mostly agricultural black areas as well as much of its largest city, Birmingham. He said that as an 18-year veteran of the Alabama Senate "it won't take me long to adapt because I won't be wide-eyed and mystified."
Mr. Hilliard said that perhaps the most overriding concern of the new members, both black and white, would be to get something done quickly about things like cuts defense spending and foreign aid -- and therein may lie the chance for conflict with the Congressional leadership carried over from what President Bush described as the "gridlock Congress."
"I think we will all want to see some things done quickly because we don't want to be seen by the people back home as being part of the problems that we were elected to solve," Mr. Hilliard said. "We'll be pushing hard for what the people back home are saying."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the Congressional Black Caucus referred imprecisely to blacks in the new House of Representatives. There are 38 representatives, not 39. The delegate from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, is black but does not vote.

To Aid Those Most in Need, Clinton Wants to Help the Middle Class First

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The last time a Democrat lived in the White House, 29 million Americans (13 percent of the population) lived in poverty. Now 35 million Americans (14.2 percent) do, and their place on Bill Clinton's list of priorities remains unclear.
Mr. Clinton takes office with a mandate for domestic change. But he created it with incessant talk about the middle class and relative quiet on topics like inner cities, the homeless and the underclass. 
 With a few notable exceptions, the President-elect's domestic proposals are intended to help the poor while helping others, rather than singling them out for special initiatives.
That is certainly the case with the centerpieces of his campaign, his call for a reinvigorated economy and national health care. And it is also true of many other policy initiatives that have won his most enthusiastic support: calls for retraining workers, expanding college aid and strengthening enforcement of child-support laws.
His advisers say this approach is in line with efforts like Social Security and the G.I. Bill, Government programs that have done much to alleviate poverty while offering benefits to all Americans.
"The most successful opportunity programs this society's ever had have all been broad-based," said Bruce Reed, an issues adviser to Mr. Clinton.
But skeptics contend Mr. Clinton's approach will reach only the most fortunate of the poor and do little for Americans locked in the worst circumstances. Perhaps only 10 percent of the country's poor live in areas of concentrated, long-term poverty. But the violence and suffering of such areas has a disproportionate effect on American life, driving people from cities and poisoning the nation's racial atmosphere.
"You have to face it head-on," said Roger Wilkins, a historian at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who contends that the problems of the people with the biggest disadvantages cannot be solved with programs aimed at the middle class.
Mr. Wilkins went as far as likening Mr. Clinton's approach to the trickle-down economics that the candidate ridiculed. "He says he'll help the middle class and the benefits will trickle down to the poor," the professor said.
By contrast, other prominent blacks who had called the Clinton campaign insensitive to the needs of minorities and the poor have been adopting a more conciliatory tone since the Arkansas Governor's resounding victory. The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Mr. Clinton's proposals could "make a significant impact" on poverty and do so "early on."
Whatever his priorities, Mr. Clinton also faces external constraints. Chief among them is the need to control the Federal deficit, which severely limits his spending options. Mr. Clinton has also tied his success to changing the health-care system and getting the economy growing, which is necessary to help the poor but not enough by itself. The inner cities, which have little political power, will have to settle for whatever time, willpower and money remains.
Mr. Clinton's proposals do include some aimed directly at the poor. He has called for a large expansion in the Head Start pre-school program and in the Women, Infants and Children program that gives food supplements to poor families. After the riots in Los Angeles this spring, he voiced his support for enterprise zones, which give tax breaks in the inner cities, community development banks and escrow accounts to help poor Americans save money without losing public benefits.
Most notably, he has called for what sound like sweeping changes in the welfare system. Mr. Clinton has pledged to quintuple, to $5 billion a year, what the Government spends on job training for welfare mothers. He has said he will make them perform community service after two years, or face reductions in their grants.
But reality will lie in the details, which are yet to be spelled out, and many analysts doubt that his approach will be as sweeping as it sounds. The history of welfare reform is one of bold talk followed by much compromise.
Most of Mr. Clinton's other domestic proposals are aimed at a broader audience than the poor. His pledge to collect more child-support payments from absent fathers, for instance, is certainly of interest to poor mothers living on welfare. But the Government will have problems collecting from jobless fathers who have no money. A bigger payoff may come to single mothers whose former partners are a notch or two up the economic ladder.
An important part of Mr. Clinton's philosophy is revealed in a phrase he has gleaned from David T. Ellwood, a professor of public policy at Harvard University. Pledging to "make work pay," both men have said people with jobs should not be poor.
 
Talking of 'Values'
 Correspondingly, Mr. Clinton has called for a $2 billion expansion in tax credits that provide an annual boost to low-paid workers, aiming to lift them from poverty. Most of the impact is concentrated on workers making $7,500 to $12,000.
Of course, this does not help those without jobs. Similarly, Mr. Clinton's calls for expanded worker training, high school apprenticeship programs and expanded college aid all help those most willing or able to help themselves.
Mr. Reed, the domestic adviser, said this was part of an intent to encourage responsibility. "I wouldn't avoid the word 'values,' " he said, referring to talk about causes and cures to poverty.
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, thinks Mr. Clinton's proposals would make a modest difference in the poorest neighborhoods. "Would they make a drastic difference?" he said. "Probably not."
Mr. Greenstein said more ambitious plans were thwarted by a lack of consensus. Some experts, for instance, call for a big Federal jobs program, which others say would be prohibitively expensive. Some call for intensified social services, while others argue that such programs have made only modest differences.
Last week, Mr. Reed was talking most enthusiastically about helping the working poor, and avoiding the war-on-poverty oratory that once infused hope about the most downtrodden Americans.
"Clearly, these problems have been so long in the making," he said, "that it will take at least a generation to overcome them."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a news analysis article on Tuesday about the antipoverty policies expounded by Gov. Bill Clinton referred incorrectly to a comment by Robert Greenstein, a researcher. He predicted that Mr. Clinton's domestic proposals would probably have a significant effect on the poor generally, but only a modest impact in the most blighted neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Promote High Technology, With Gore in Charge

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
IF the promises of the Clinton campaign for science and technology now come to pass, America is headed for a new era in which the Government's focus on making armaments will shift to fostering a host of new civilian technologies and industries. No financial midget, the civil initiative would spend money twice as fast as the Pentagon's Star Wars anti-missile program, one of the biggest research efforts of all time.
The aim, outlined in campaign documents and by advisers to President-elect Bill Clinton and Vice-President-elect Al Gore, is a new wave of research discoveries and applications that will flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry for the international trade wars of the 1990's and beyond. 
 "This is a watershed," Kent H. Hughes, president of the Council on Competitiveness, a private group based in Washington that advised the Clinton campaign, said in an interview. "We're now going to develop an economic strategy much in the way we developed a national security strategy to fight the cold war."
"It's a paradigm shift in terms of the Government's role in technology," said Erich Bloch, a distinguished fellow of the council who is a former director of the National Science Foundation, the top Federal agency for the support of general research.
At the heart of the Clinton plan is a change of focus in Government research priorities from military to civilian endeavors.
As a peace dividend from the cold war's end, a minimum of $30 billion over four years is to be taken from the Pentagon's research budget and put into advanced work in areas like robotics, smart roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic-levitation trains, fiber-optic communications and national computer networks. Also earmarked are a raft of basic technologies like digital imaging and data storage, which are increasingly seen as the underlying secret of lasting commercial success.
Significantly, the initiative would spend the same amount of money as Star Wars, $30 billion, in half the time.
But skeptics say the initiative is likely to backfire, bloating Congressional pork and creating whole new categories of Federal waste. They argue that Government officials generally lack the knowledge to predict which technologies will succeed in the marketplace and are never frugal with taxpayers' money, unlike entrepreneurs who risk their own. These defects, they say, make industrial policies all too prone to engender white elephants.
But advocates say past failures and painful lessons have increased the odds that the Clinton Administration will avoid such pitfalls to achieve a new kind of success. Most important, they say, business and government in this new era are to be partners, working together in an alliance that takes cognizance of market forces to produce a powerful new engine of technological advance.
The Clinton plan is outlined in an 18-page document, "Technology: The Engine of Economic Growth," issued Sept. 21 by Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters in Little Rock, Ark.
"America cannot continue to rely on trickle-down technology from the military," Mr. Clinton said in the document. "Civilian industry, not the military, is the driving force behind advanced technology today. Only by strengthening our civilian technology base can we solve the twin problems of national security and economic competitiveness."
 
Air of Excitement
 The plan has received little notice in the nation's general news outlets but has been widely read and applauded by the nation's technology experts, many of whom are now giddy with excitement. It is seen as the culmination of a slow shift in Federal priorities that has been grudgingly under way for several years, championed by the Democratic-led Congress but generally resisted by the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
A central question, these experts now say, is whether the Clinton plan can win the major financial backing it seeks.
"It's going to be a real push," said Dr. Roland W. Schmitt, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, N.Y., a former head of corporate research for General Electric. "But the signs, I think, are very good that we may be embarked on a fundamental change."
Charles F. Larson, executive director of the Industrial Research Institute, a trade group in Washington, praised the plan but expressed doubt on its chances of being fully carried out.
"It's not going to be as easy to reduce the military budget as they think," he said. "There are going to be military tensions. Warfare is not over. We're looking forward to some positive changes in research funding, but with some skepticism as to whether they can pull off the whole plan."
Other experts said the Pentagon knows it ultimately has no choice but to go along with this type of initiative, since the technological strides needed for new weaponry are increasingly made by industry, and usually when unfettered by red tape and arcane Government regulations.
"It's in everybody's best interest," said Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, who is chairman of the technology and national security subcommittee of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee and has pushed hard for Federal-industry research alliances.
The fate of the technology plan also will benefit from the fact that the Democrats now control both Congress and the White House, giving them great political leverage -- and accountability. "The Democrats know if there isn't quick movement in the right direction, they're going to get clobbered," said a Senate aide who is working on putting the Clinton-Gore technology plan into effect.
 
Former Official Is Skeptical
 One skeptic is Murray L. Weidenbaum, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis who advocated free-market mechanisms as chairman President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. In an interview, he said much of the money that did materialize would probably be squandered in pork-barrel projects meant to appease Congressional interests, not those of American industry.
"Judging from past performance," he said, "a lot of it will go for boondoggles."
For more than half a century, the Government's research policy in general has been to finance basic science heavily and trust that this will automatically lead to practical innovations and social betterment. Washington made little effort to translate discoveries about nature and nature's laws into devices and technologies, leaving that job to industry.
The exceptions to this policy mainly had to do with the military and aerospace, which were viewed as critical to fighting the cold war. The Government over the decades put trillions of dollars into building industries and doing research that could aid the development of new kinds of bombs, ships, guns, missiles, radars, aircraft and spy satellites.
A few times Government went further to direct the development of purely civilian technologies. But its record was mixed, with as many failures as successes. Photovoltaic cells, which turn sunlight into electricity, are now entering the big time after decades of modest Government financing. But the $30 billion space shuttle program is still largely a technology in search of a mission. Synthetic fuels and the breeder reactor, which was to have made its own fuel, suffered similar fates.
The Reagan and Bush Administrations, awed by the power of laissez-faire economics and market forces, disdained Federal involvement in industry research, although the Bush Administration has recently softened its ideological opposition. And while economists are highly critical of so-called industrial policy, many policy makers now embrace it.
One reason for the reversal is the example set by Europe and Japan in using Government research to spur industrial innovation, the programs having had mixed success. Another reason is that in the American economy, the seemingly endless stream of military "spinoffs" that long buoyed the civil sector (computer chips, jet engines, communications satellites) are beginning to dry up. Instead, the military increasingly seeks to "spin in" advances from private industry, which in turn is rapidly falling behind foreign competitors.
Beginning in the mid-1980's, Democrats on Capitol Hill, fearing that America was losing its technical edge, began to fight for increased Federal money and attention for industrial renewal. Among the leaders were Senator Bingaman, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina and Senator Gore of Tennessee.
For instance, they led a charge to pump billions of dollars into the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, and broadened its mandate to spurring many advanced technologies with both military and civilian uses, such as high-definition television, computer chips and fiber optics.
On another front, Senator Gore for years pushed hard for a national high-speed computer network that could link computers in Government, universities, industry and libraries. Last December his High-Performance Computing Act, which seeks to spend $2.9 billion over five years, was signed into law. Mr. Gore calls the network a "information superhighway" meant to be a catalyst to cultural and industrial progress.
In his September policy statement, Mr. Clinton said he would give Mr. Gore, the Vice-President-elect, "the responsibility and the authority to coordinate the Administration's vision for technology" and to lead all Government agencies and research groups in meeting the new goals. "This is a real job," Mr. Clinton emphasized, rejecting the ceremonial presumption for much Vice-Presidential work.
One of Mr. Gore's first tasks, Mr. Clinton said, will be to "create a forum for systematic private sector input into U.S. government deliberations about technology policy and competitiveness."
The Clinton technology plan itself, among other things, would spearhead research on advanced materials and industrial processes, would create 170 manufacturing extension centers around nation modeled on the highly successful agricultural ones and would redouble the push for information superhighways.
"Such a network," Mr. Clinton said, "could do for the productivity of individuals at their places of work and learning what the interstate highway of the 1950's did for the productivity of the nation's travel and distribution system."
Perhaps most important, the Clinton plan pledges to increase sharply Federal financing of research into the so-called critical technologies. These include ceramics, computer programs, sensors, photonics, electronics, robotics, computer-aided manufacturing, biotechnology, advanced composites, artificial intelligence, waste management and pollution reduction.
The Clinton Administration, the plan says, "will view the support of generic industrial technologies as a priority mission."
 
Shift to Civil Efforts
 To this end, it proposes "at the very least" that 10 percent of the $76 billion that the Government now spends each year on research, or $7.6 billion, should be redirected from the Pentagon's research budget to civil efforts. Over four years this would add up to more than $30 billion.
This shift, the plan notes, would bring the Pentagon's share of the Federal research budget down to 50 percent from 60 percent. "Having achieved this balance," it says, "the Government should examine whether national security considerations and economic conditions warrant further shifts."
The plan would also direct the nation's 726 Federal laboratories, many of which were spawned by the cold war and do military work, to designate 10 to 20 percent of their existing budgets for joint ventures with industry.
The plan also lauds cooperative ventures like Sematech, an industry consortium that uses Federal and private funds to advance computer-chip manufacturing, and calls for similar ventures in other high-technology industries.
Advisers to the Clinton-Gore transition team say many details of the technology plan are only now being worked out, including whether to form new agencies, departments and initiatives or to work within existing Government structures. The leaning of the moment, said a Senate aide, is to create "nothing out of whole cloth." But Mr. Clinton himself, during the campaign, promised that he would create a civilian equivalent of Darpa to help encourage industrial innovation across the nation.
Senator Bingaman, who is helping to refine technology proposals for the new Administration, said a secret to avoiding the pitfalls of the past was to develop a new partnership with industry in which Federal funds would be matched with private ones, so market forces help shape and direct Federal largess and reduce the odds of technological waste.
 
Sharing the Costs
 "We'll sit down and say, 'What do you think is important?' and require them to spend their own money too," he said. "Cost sharing has to be a requirement."
Mr. Bloch of the Council on Competitiveness noted that many of the planned Clinton initiatives were expansions, albeit dramatic ones, of existing programs.
"It's not that the Bush Administration did nothing," he said. "But they did it reluctantly and there were ideological handicaps. The new Administration doesn't have those handicaps. That's a major change."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 14, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Tuesday about Bill Clinton's probable policy toward science and technology misstated the time he said it would take to move $7.6 billion in annual Federal spending on scientific research from military to civil projects. He said the move would occur gradually, taking three years to reach $7.6 billion; thus, the total funds shifted over four years would be somewhat less than $30 billion.

GRAPHIC: Drawing: "Revving up innovation"
 
President-elect Clinton proposes to redirect $76 billion or so in annual Federal research spending so it spurs industrial innovation. Areas likely to get stimulus include robotics, batteries, computer chips, 'smart' roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic-levitation trains, fiber-optic communications, computer networks, digital imaging, data storage, software, sensors, computer-aided manufacturing, advanced composite materials and artificial intelligence.

HEADLINE: Chip Index Up For October

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Orders for chips in the United States market set a record in October, and the semiconductor industry's leading indicator rose for the first time in four months, a trade group reported today.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.10 for the three months ended October, up from a revised figure of 1.07 in September and 1.09 in August. The book-to-bill compares orders with shipments. A ratio of 1.10 indicates that for every $100 worth of product shipped, $110 was ordered. A ratio above 1.0 indicates rising demand. 
 At $1.77 billion, three-month orders for October were up 5.4 percent from $1.68 billion for the three months ended September, and 41.1 percent higher than the comparable figure a year ago. At $1.53 billion, actual American market shipments for October were down 16.5 percent from the $1.83 billion shipped in September.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Political Memo;
Change of Tone for Clinton: High Energy to Low Profile

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 10

 BODY:
The most striking thing about Gov. Bill Clinton since the election has been the intriguing contrast between Bill Clinton the candidate and Bill Clinton the President-elect.
The Bill Clinton the public saw during the campaign was decisive, vigorous and remarkably open, a candidate who spent up to 18 hours a day talking up his ideas in public. But President-elect Bill Clinton has been seen only rarely. He has been conspicuously deliberate in making decisions and as obsessed with holding information close to the vest as any President. 
 The question is, Which style will characterize his Presidency?
Advisers and friends of the Governor say both: he will try to be an agent of change, but he will go about it slowly, carefully controlling information given to the public and using the cover of committees and economic conferences to make the politically tough choices.
A week after Election Day the Clinton transition operation still consists of Mr. Clinton, his wife, Hillary, Vice President-elect Al Gore Jr., a few intimate friends and advisers from the campaign and a skeletal transiTion board that has met only twice and is still trying to work out a timetable to present to Mr. Clinton for his most important transition decisions.
George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's director of communications and one of the very few former campaign officials with any apparent connection to Mr. Clinton these days, presents daily briefings for the public that are portraits in minimalism. Tiny shreds of information about Mr. Clinton's activities and thoughts are padded out and embellished to make the puny sound Presidential.
 
Report of a Phone Call
 Consider today's briefing, where the biggest news was that several members of the transition team had had a telephone conversation. Mr. Stephanopoulos was asked what could be expected from Mr. Clinton's transition board, headed by Vernon E. Jordan and Warren M. Christopher.
"I don't think we will have any staff announcements today," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "I think this is the first time they will meet as a group in a week and they will be going over the progress in the last week and setting the agenda for the next."
Reporters then asked Mr. Stephanopoulos to define what he meant by progress. He chuckled.
"Obviously we have appointed Vernon Jordan as chairman and Warren Christopher as director, and they have started to present Governor Clinton with options and set up a background-check operation," he said. "It is my understanding that they have reached memorandums of understanding with the F.B.I. and the G.S.A. to talk about how this process will proceed. They will be presenting options for the timetable that President Clinton will make appointments, the timetable for the economic summit, and for when they will discuss filling out the transition team."
Mr. Stephanopoulos said Mr. Clinton was making final preparations on new ethics rules that include requiring political appointees to sign a pledge barring lobbying of their Government agencies for five years after they leave office, compared with one year now.
"We hope to have them very soon, hopefully this week," he said.
There seems to be a combination of two things. One is Mr. Clinton's long-standing style of governance, which has always been characterized by a deliberate, committee-driven approach, in contrast to his aggressively open style of campaigning. The other is the natural state of confusion that follows any Presidential campaign: a state of confusion, though, which a number of Clinton aides say is going on just a bit too long.
Mr. Clinton's campaign organization was the envy of his opponents for its speed and efficiency. A high-octane 24-hour-a-day war room insured that no charge by an enemy, or question by a reporter, went unanswered for more than an hour or two.
 
Ambiguity and Awkwardness
 Now, the scene around what is left of Mr. Clinton's campaign headquarters evokes ambiguity and awkwardness. Apart from Mr. Gore, not one of Mr. Clinton's campaign employees appears to know what job he or she will have in the new Administration.
"The reason that it seems like very little is happening is because very little is happening," said one longtime Clinton friend, who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified. "Very few decisions have been made. This is very much Bill's style: being extremely deliberate if not slow. He wants to do things carefully and right."
Mr. Clinton and his aides have said they would like to have at least some of the main economic appointments in place before Christmas, which would not be far off the pace of many of his recent predecessors.
In 1960, John F. Kennedy made his first cabinet appointments on Dec. 1; in 1968, Richard Nixon appointed his entire cabinet on Dec. 11. In 1976 Jimmy Carter made his first appointment on Dec. 3, and in 1980, Ronald Reagan his on Dec. 11.
But Mr. Reagan formed a plethora of transition committees within days of his election, and George Bush chose a Secretary of State almost immediately after Election Day.
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Institute for International Economics issued a recommendation today urging Mr. Clinton to go slowly in picking his top cabinet, and to wait until he has "made fundamental decisions about priorities and organization."
But the idea that Mr. Clinton has not made such decisions may seem odd for a candidate whose whole campaign was based on the notion that he had a more detailed plan for economic renewal than his opponents.
Although Mr. Clinton ran for office with a 200-page economic plan that he said had been endorsed by 10 Nobel prize-winning economists, promising that he would begin putting that plan into into effect on Day 1, his first policy announcement here was that he was convening an economic conference before Christmas to get the views of the best minds in the country on the economy.
But this too is in keeping with the Clinton style. After Mr. Clinton was defeated at the end of his first term as Governor of Arkansas, a term marked by bold policy initiatives and radical departures from traditional Arkansas politics, he developed a far more cautious style to governing.
In his four subsequent administrations, Mr. Clinton was careful to limit himself to pushing one large reform idea each term and often used appointed committees of outside experts to provide political cover -- both for his agenda and for the more controversial initiatives, like raising taxes to pay for education reform.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: The F.B.I.;
F.B.I. Head Says He'll Keep Job, But Faces Doubt

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
On election night, as Bill Clinton's lead built toward certain victory, William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, sent a teletype message to all F.B.I. employees announcing that he had reached the midpoint of his 10-year term and intended to stay on.
In calmer times his message would have stirred less notice, advising employees, as it did, that reaching the halfway mark "was an occasion for me to reflect on events of the past five years and to focus on my vision of the F.B.I. for the future." But these are not normal times at the bureau.
 
Interpreting the Message
 Some agents perceived the message as a move by the Director, a Republican who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, to head off speculation about whether he would depart under the incoming Democratic Administration. 
 The question of whether Mr. Sessions will survive has been under discussion in law-enforcement and political circles for several weeks, with doubts fueled by an ethics investigation against him, criticism over some recent investigations involving prominent Republican officials and complaints that Mr. Sessions has not provided strong direction, allowing the bureau to drift.
Aides to Mr. Sessions insisted his comments were not intended to be delivered at the end of Election Day, nor were they meant as a political statement. But in an interview today Mr. Sessions reaffirmed his message to the bureau's employees, insisting that he was determined to complete his term and did not anticipate being forced by the incoming Administration to step aside. He also said the accusations swirling around him and his management of the F.B.I. in recent weeks had been personally painful.
"It is a difficult time to get through," he said, adding: "Hundreds and hundreds of friends have come forward. It's something that just happened. I just have to live through it and go on."
 
First Response to Inquiry
 Responding for the first time to questions about the Justice Department's inquiry into his travel and administrative practices, Mr. Sessions said: "I am confident those will all be cleared. I feel certain they will be."
Dismissing complaints about the the bureau's role in a politically delicate cases before the election, Mr. Sessions said: "The bureau strives mightily to be sure that the world and the media and the public know we are apolitical. When investigations come in we have to take them where we find them, where a crime may have been committed. But it's painful."
Urged by friends and his wife, Alice, to confront his critics more aggressively, Mr. Sessions rejected complaints about his performance as Director, saying, "A person should be judged by the quality of the product they produce, and the bureau continues to produce an excellent product in every single area."
So far Mr. Clinton has said nothing about Mr. Sessions, nor have the Clinton transition planners appeared to focus on the F.B.I. But some Democrats involved in the process said the question would probably be debated as the President-elect shifted from appointments in economic affairs to domestic agencies.
Associates of Mr. Sessions are hoping that he can keep his job with the backing of Democrats in Congress, who have supported his affirmative action initiatives at the bureau and his mild displays of independence from the Bush and Reagan Administrations on issues involving criminal justice.
But if Mr. Clinton decides he wants a change it could be a politically costly fight. The Director's friends have warned that any move against him runs the risk of appearing to be making the top job at the F.B.I. a political prize to be bestowed on a supporter by the new President.
The Director is a Presidential appointee, but the 10-year term instituted by Congress after the death of J. Edgar Hoover in 1972 was intended to insulate the office from partisan political pressure and impose a time limit after Mr. Hoover's nearly five decades in office created a climate that many lawmakers said led to abuses at the bureau.
The law does not clearly spell out how a President can remove an F.B.I. Director. But the Senate Judiciary Committee, in its debate over the statute, said the President should have reasonable grounds for such a step and explain it to the committee, which would consider it in evaluating the President's next nominee.
The Director's difficulties result from a confluence of events, some coming as recently as last weekend with the arrest of Judge Sol Wachtler, the Chief Judge of New York State's highest court, to complaints dating to the start of his tenure, when Mr. Sessions seemed to some agents to be more attentive to the ceremonial aspects of the job than to the bureau's law-enforcement priorities.
In interviews in which they spoke on condition of anonymity, and in discussions with Justice Department officials and members of Congress, former and current F.B.I. agents have also accused Mr. Sessions of failing to take firm control of the bureau's criminal investigative program. Others say he has shown little interest in defining a post-cold war agenda for the counterintelligence division, whose direction has seemed unfocused since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 
Gains in Affirmative Action
 Mr. Sessions seems most proud of his efforts to combat the lingering effects of a legacy of racism left from the Hoover era, negotiating ground-breaking agreements with black and Hispanic agents over issues like promotions and training procedures.
The Director's counterparts at the Justice Department have seemed largely unimpressed with his efforts in affirmative action, but those activities have solidified his support in Congress.
Lately, however, it has been the F.B.I.'s investigations that have led to complaints. The most recent was the inquiry involving Judge Wachtler of the New York State Court of Appeals. The case began when Joy A. Silverman, a wealthy Republican fund-raiser who had broken off an affair with Judge Wachtler, brought her complaints in person to Mr. Sessions, who turned her charges over to the bureau's criminal investigative division.
Today some Democrats in Congress said there appeared to be nothing wrong with the Director's actions but expressed uneasiness over the impression that a major Republican donor had used direct access to the nation's top law-enforcement official to start a criminal investigation.
The Wachtler case came after F.B.I. agents conducted searches here and in Atlanta late last month in an inquiry into influence-peddling involving Catalina Vasquez Villalpando, the United States Treasurer. She has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but the searches rankled some Republicans officials, who complained that the inquiry became publicly known so close to Election Day.
The bureau has also been criticized by reports that it responded to Ross Perot's accusations of Republican spying by setting up an undercover operation in which an F.B.I. agent offered to sell an audio tape and documents from Mr. Perot's office to Jim Oberwetter, the chairman of President Bush's Texas campaign.
The tactics outraged Mr. Oberwetter, who rejected the agent's offer but accused the F.B.I. of trying to entrap him in a crime.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeking Tighter U.N. Sanctions on Serbia

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
In an effort to tighten sanctions against Serbia, the United States is pressing to ban the shipment of goods through Serbian-controlled territory to other countries, senior Administration officials said today.
A resolution under discussion at the United Nations would also require countries bordering the Danube River, particularly Romania and Bulgaria, to stop and inspect ships suspected of carrying goods to Serbia. 
 The decision to press for a new resolution comes amid increasing evidence that sanctions imposed by the United Nations five months ago have had only a limited effect on the Serbian nationalist Government of President Slobodan Milosevic.
Intelligence reports in recent weeks have concluded that the sanctions are so porous that, for example, Serbia has been able to import about half the oil it did before, allowing it to continue to run major industries and limiting any effect on Serbian policy in Bosnia.
 
The Little People Get Hurt
 In fact, the sanctions' major consequence thus far has been to hurt ordinary Serbs who have suffered from soaring inflation while enriching smugglers who operate with the approval of the Belgrade Government.
Some analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency argued a few months ago that because of the way the sanctions were structured, they were doomed to fail. Even now, intelligence officials at the C.I.A. and the Pentagon do not believe that squeezing the Serbs economically will necessarily change their actions in Bosnia, where it is felt they already have what they need to sustain an indefinite war.
Until now, the sanctions -- which include a ban on most trade -- have allowed exporters to ship their goods overland across Serbia to other destinations in Europe.
This has allowed trucks carrying goods marked "transit" to enter the country, unload and leave without accounting for where the cargo went. Similarly, goods moving up and down the Danube have easily been diverted to Serbia, and countries along the river have done little to stop the illicit trade.
The American plan does not yet have the backing of the British and French in the Security Council. Even if this should change, a tighter regimen of sanctions, as now envisioned, would still be imperfect because it would rely largely on the good will of Serbia's neighbors, rather than the threat of force to assure compliance.
A senior State Department official said, "We are working in the Security Council to secure a resolution that would address a number of issues, including the tightening of sanctions enforcement and a ban on trans-shipments of commodities."
The official added that while the United States favored a total ban on shipments, it would settle for one limited to important commodities like oil, chemicals, tires, vehicles and industrial equipment. "We don't want to promise too much," he said.
Another senior official conceded that the sanctions at most would serve as "a deterrent factor."
"Sanctions worked in Iraq because they were enforced," he said. "They don't work in Yugoslavia because they depend on good will."
The decision to press for a new resolution comes as there is increasing concern within the Bush Administration that the war in the former Yugoslav republics will spread to other Balkan countries.
Senior officials today confirmed United Nations reports that Serbs in Bosnia have repeatedly violated the Security Council ban on military flights there, raising the question of whether the United States will push for a second resolution authorizing United Nations members to use force to prevent such overflights.
President Bush said last month that the United States was ready to use force to impose a ban on combat flights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the British and French Governments have resisted such a move.
American intelligence reports indicate that there have been at least two dozen violations of the ban, including the use of MI-8 helicopters to bring in reinforcements and supplies during attacks on towns, and the use of anti-tank Gazelle attack helicopters in combat.

HEADLINE: Cooper Companies and Former Head Are Indicted

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The Cooper Companies, once a leading producer of eye-care products, was charged yesterday in a Federal indictment with participating, along with its former chairman, Gary A. Singer, in an extensive criminal scheme to profit from insider tips on junk bond trades.
In announcing the charges in Manhattan, Otto G. Obermaier, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Mr. Singer was "central to the scheme," which was said to involve bribing a Boston mutual fund analyst to get tips about the fund's proposed junk bond purchases and then trading in advance of the fund, both through the company and through family accounts. 
 The fund analyst, G. Albert Griggs Jr., and an accomplice, John D. Collins 2d, both pleaded guilty on May 21 to related charges and have been cooperating with the investigation.
 
 
'Done Little'
 But Mr. Obermaier said the company, whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, also bore criminal responsibility for the insider trading scheme because it "has done little, if anything to rectify" the actions of its chairman.
Mr. Singer, 37 years old, a resident of Cresskill, N.J., was charged with 24 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering and fraud. The company was charged with 10 counts of conspiracy and fraud. Potential penalties range from 20-year jail terms for the racketeering charges against Mr. Singer to fines of at least $500,000 for each allegation against the corporation.
In a statement last night, Arthur C. Bass, the acting chairman of Cooper, said he was disappointed that the company had not been able to "avoid these charges or settle them on a reasonable basis." Richard Weinberg, a lawyer for the company, said Cooper "intends vigorously to defend itself" against the allegations.
Charles A. Stillman, Mr. Singer's lawyer, said that his client "denies each and every claim of wrongdoing" and "fully expects to be vindicated."
In tandem with the criminal indictment yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a civil complaint against the company, Gary Singer and his brother, Steven G. Singer, the Cooper Companies' chief operating officer, of participating in the junk bond trading scheme. The commission is also seeking to recover trading profits from various Singer relatives who the S.E.C. said benefited from the trades.
In addition, the S.E.C. accused the company and Gary Singer of manipulating the price of a publicly traded Cooper note issue to avoid a required interest-rate increase owed to note holders. And it accused Gary Singer individually of fraudulently shifting the company's junk bond trading profits into family accounts.
William R. McLucas, the director of enforcement at the S.E.C., joined Mr. Obermaier at a news conference yesterday. "The level of deceit and audacity of the defendants in this case was quite remarkable," Mr. McLucas said after detailing the commission's charges. He said that many of the junk bond trades cited in the Federal indictment occurred after the Singers knew the company was already under S.E.C. scrutiny for suspicion of manipulating the price of its notes.
The S.E.C. complaint seeks to permanently bar Gary and Steven Singer from serving as officers or directors of a public company. It also seeks to recover more than $3.6 million in trading profits.
Mr. Singer became co-chairman of Cooper in 1988, when his family and an allied group of investors took control of the company and ousted its founder, Parker G. Montgomery. Mr. Singer remained co-chairman until May 29, when he took a leave of absence in the wake of the guilty pleas by Mr. Griggs and Mr. Collins.
The charges brought yesterday are the latest dismal development for public shareholders of the Cooper Companies, once a booming medical products conglomerate with bright prospects.
The company's stock traded for more than $25 a share in the mid-80's, but has fallen steadily ever since. Yesterday, it closed at $1.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, unchanged from Monday's level.

HEADLINE: Jobs Grow In New York State's Small Factories

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
The number of small factories in New York State outside of New York City grew in the 1980's, creating jobs even as plunging employment at larger companies resulted in an overall drop in manufacturing jobs, according to a study released yesterday.
The gains at establishments with 99 or fewer workers was one of the few encouraging facts to be found in the study of New York State manufacturing by the regional office of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's regional Commissioner, said it was "an oasis of hope in a desert of despair." 
 "This does have public policy implications," he said. "When you see some are making it, you have to wonder if there is a way to build on these sectors of potential."
The study's good news came from an analysis of manufacturing establishments -- defined as a single physical site with predominantly one type of activity. From 1979 until the end 0f 1991, such businesses declined by 5,239, or 15.9 percent, throughout the state. Much of the decline was in New York City, where the number of establishments fell by 6,195, or 32.1 percent. Jobs in manufacturing dropped by 40.7 percent to 308,000 over the 12 years studied. The number of jobs has since fallen to 291,000.
In the rest of the state, the number of manufacturing establishments rose by 956, or 7 percent. But over all, manufacturing employment fell by 23.1 percent to 750,000 at the end of 1991. The latest total is 715,000.
Of the state's 62 counties, all but 10 lost manufacturing jobs in the 1980's. The exceptions were the downstate counties of Putnam and Suffolk, Ulster in the mid-Hudson region, Saratoga in the Capital District, Clinton and Warren in the Lake George-Lake Champlain region, Franklin in the Black River-St. Lawrence region, Otsego in the East Southern Tier, Cortland in central New York, and Ontario County in the Genesee-Finger Lakes region. Suffolk led in creation of new establishments with a net increase of 565 in the 1980's.
Most of the jobs lost outside New York City were at larger manufacturing establishments. From March 1979 through 1988, the number of people employed by establishments with 1,000 or more workers fell by 103,111, or 26.1 percent, while it fell by 35,709, or 9.7 percent, at those with 100 to as many as 999 workers.
In contrast, employment at smaller establishments, with as many as 99 workers, grew by 6,137, to 213,536, in 1988. While the rise is slight, it is remarkable given the general manufacturing trend. Mr. Ehrenhalt added that these smaller establishments were not concentrated in a handful of industries. "While the overall picture is bleak," he said, "there is a significant part of New York manufacturing that has demonstrated substantial staying power."
While the overall number of manufacturing jobs in New Jersey and Connecticut plunged in the last 12 years, as they did in New York State, Mr. Ehrenhalt said he did not know of a similar pattern of growth in the number of smaller factories and their job levels in those two states.
With an employed work force of 7.8 million in September, New York now has slightly more than one million manufacturing jobs, which include nonproduction jobs at companies classified as manufacturers.
From 1979 until the end of 1991, New York lost 444,000 manufacturing jobs, an unexpectedly sharp decline. If employment in New York's 18 industries had followed the national pattern for those groups, the state would have lost only 165,000 manufacturing jobs, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
In the last 12 years, rubber and plastic products was the only state industry in which employment rose, by 9.9 percent. But the industry is tiny so this amounted to just 3,200 jobs. In the state's biggest industries, jobs in electrical and electronic equipment and instruments fell by 82,600, printing and publishing by 11,700, nonelectrical machinery by 60,100, and apparel and textiles by 67,100.
In the booming 1980's, when New York had its highest job growth since World War II, jobs in nonmanufacturing sectors, led by services, grew by 1.4 million. That more than offset the 312,000 lost in manufacturing.
But since payroll employment in New York peaked in June 1989 at 8.3 million, the state has lost about 550,000 jobs, with manufacturing accounting for the most -- 174,000.
Other than stating the obvious -- that "New York has clearly become a less attractive place globally for the conduct of manufacturing activities" -- Mr. Ehrenhalt offered no specific reasons for the decline, saying it was not something he had studied or could derive from the bureau's data.
Other economists and business executives have speculated that the reasons include high taxes, fiscal problems, inadequate infrastructure like transportation and high-cost labor.
Alan C. Sullivan, executive deputy commissioner at the State Economic Development Department, tried to take comfort in the findings of the Federal study. "Manufacturing is alive and well" outside of New York City, he proclaimed.
Many executives complain that the state has not done enough to create a friendly environment for manufacturers. But Mr. Sullivan said the Cuomo administration has put in place a variety of programs to help small and medium-sized manufacturers.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senators Fight Over '94 Races

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
In a shaky first volley of his expected 1996 Presidential campaign, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas was re-elected today by one vote to lead the effort to elect more Republicans to the Senate.
Mr. Gramm put the best face on his narrow re-election as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, saying the race "was very close because my opponent worked hard for two years." 
 But some Republican Senators said the 20-to-19 vote showed that some had reservations about the Texas Republican, and that some feared supporters of other Presidential candidates would hold back campaign contributions to the organization.
His opponent, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, argued for weeks that Mr. Gramm was using the post solely to advance his bid for the Presidential nomination in 1996, and that he would give more attention to raising money for his own campaign than for the campaigns of others.
"The principal issue of the race was whether running for President and being chairman of the Senatorial committee are compatible activities," Mr. McConnell said in an interview after the vote. "I argued they were not."
 
Year of Opportunity
 Republican strategists view 1994 as a year of opportunity for Republicans to improve on their current Senate membership of 42 or 43, depending on the outcome of a runoff in Georgia.
Of the 33 Senate races that November, the Democrats will have to defend 20 or 21 seats, depending on the results of a special election in North Dakota to complete the term of the late Senator Quentin N. Burdick. And with a Democrat, Bill Clinton, in the White House in 1994, the opposition party can expect to follow a historical trend and do well in the off-year elections.
Mr. Gramm is widely regarded for his knowledge of economic affairs, but his propensity to drive a hard bargain and to mix his debating points with cutting remarks have sometimes upset Republican as well as Democratic colleagues.
This year he also came under criticism from some Republican Senate campaign aides, who felt uncomfortable by requests from the National Republican Senatorial Committee to share their individual contributor lists. Critics of Mr. Gramm said they suspected the lists would be used to further his Presidential aspirations. A spokeswoman for the committee said the lists had been compiled strictly for party purposes.
 
D'Amato a Supporter
 But several Republican committee members said Mr. Gramm had generally been highly successful in raising money for Republican candidates. They said the recent comeback victories of Republicans like Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania helped Mr. Gramm's cause.
Mr. D'Amato and Senator Connie Mack of Florida, who is running for re-election in 1994, gave the nominating speeches for Mr. Gramm at the caucus in which he was re-elected by secret ballot to head the Senatorial committee.
Mr. D'Amato offered what his colleagues described as a spirited speech for Mr. Gramm, during which he noted that the Texas Republican had come to New York three times to campaign for him. Trying to introduce a dash of levity, one Senator bellowed, "And you still won?"
Mr. Gramm will travel around the country in the next two years recruiting Republican challengers, promoting the re-election of Republicans and raising money. Asked at a news conference after the vote if his job could be helpful to a Presidential candidate, he responded, "Any post is a good post to have if you're interested in promoting ideas."
Mr. Gramm has said he will not make a decision to run until after the 1994 elections.
Republican Senators said that in the committee balloting that gave him his narrow re-election victory, Mr. Gramm had assembled his majority from conservative loyalists and the four freshmen Senators who wanted to show their gratitude for his help in electing them last week. Senators Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Hank Brown of Colorado and William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware were absent and did not vote.
Two years ago, Mr. Gramm defeated Mr. McConnell for the same job by a vote of 26 to 17.
"Those who supported Gramm felt he had funded their campaigns in an excellent fashion and worked hard for them regardless of their ideological orientation," said Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island. "Those who opposed him felt that Phil has Presidential ambitions. One view expressed was that this job is extremely time consuming and could produce conflicts over time and money solicitations."
Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, said several lawmakers did not vote for Mr. Gramm because they did not want to break the precedent that chairmen do not keep the job for more than two years.
 
Other Contests
 At the meeting, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming also withstood a challenge for his position as Republican whip by Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, winning a comfortable 25 to 14 majority. In the race for secretary of the Republican Conference, the official record keeper of floor votes, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, defeated Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri and Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska in a three-way race, 20 to 14 to 5. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas was re-elected as minority leader without a contest.
The Democrats also elected their leaders today, but no positions were contested. Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana succeeded Senator Alan J. Dixon of Illinois as chief deputy majority whip. Mr. Dixon lost his bid for re-election in a primary to Senator-elect Carol Moseley Braun.

HEADLINE: Borough President Declares War on Rats in Downtown Brooklyn

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Progress inevitably has its downside. In downtown Brooklyn these days, it comes in the form of rats.
Driven out of their homes by the recent rush of redevelopment, the rodents have moved unchecked into the courthouses, the busy Fulton Mall, the brownstone streets of Brooklyn Heights, and even the Metrotech office complex. 
 Not to worry, says the Borough President, Howard Golden. Backed by a veritable Who's Who of downtown Brooklyn, Mr. Golden yesterday announced "a concerted, one-week rat-cleanup campaign" to begin on Monday, with follow-up scourges over the next few months.
Rat problems are nothing new in New York City, which is said to be home to as many rodents as residents. Nor are highly publicized efforts to get rid of them.
Mr. Golden is clearly following in a grand tradition.
 
'Rat Extermination Kickoff'
 In a statement titled "Golden Announces Rat Extermination Kickoff in Downtown Brooklyn," the Borough President refers to an increase in rodent sightings, and says, "The redevelopment of downtown Brooklyn, however beneficial, does not preclude certain quality of life concerns." Then he adds: "The rat-extermination campaign represents an example of our commitment on behalf of all the people of Brooklyn to respond to their concerns as quickly and efficiently as possible."
The Borough President's rat "task force," which has already met twice, is made up of representatives from the city's Departments of Health, Sanitation, Parks and Recreation, General Services, Transportation as well as representatives from the Transit Authority, Federal and state courts, Metrotech, the Joshua Muss Development Corporation, the Fulton Mall and the Brooklyn Heights Association.
The one-week cleanup will include an extensive web of poison traps to be set in and around Cadman Park Plaza, Columbus Park, the Walt Whitman Park and the Brooklyn War Memorial, as well as near shops and buildings where the bands of rats have been sighted. The poisons -- put around garbage sites or inserted into the ground near rat tunnels -- will not seriously harm dogs or cats, said Julius Spiegel, Brooklyn's Parks Commissioner, who is participating in the campaign. "With more businesses opening downtown," he said, "there is just more opportunity for rats. More people. More garbage. So more rats."
Signs will also be posted at the poison sites. Officials are asking parents with young children to be particularly mindful of the notices.
Residents and workers in downtown Brooklyn, who talk of sighting rats running up and down the steps of the State Supreme Court and through Cadman Park Plaza, say the effort comes none too soon.
 
'Big as Cats'
 "You see those two bushes over there?" asked Edward Joseph Webb, a senior court clerk who pointed to Columbus Park as he stood outside the Supreme Court yesterday, "the rats run regular paths in between there, and they are big as cats."
Fifty yards away, William J. Kahaly, a 43-year-old senior court officer stood guard over one of several new parking lots, whose construction left dozens of rats homeless. Though he has spotted only a few rats in recent weeks, he has seen them in full force outside the courthouse.
"Last year, it was ridiculous," he said. "They were jumping in and out of garbage cans, running in and out of the ground cover, and up on the courthouse steps at night, two or three would be running back and forth."
He lowered his voice. "I killed one," he said. "He'd been poisoned and was walking kind of funny, so I hit him with my nightstick."
He paused, and said, "Actually, I killed two."

HEADLINE: London Cheers Yeltsin After His Vow to Use Power to Thwart Foes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told the BritishParliament today that he was willing to assume emergency powers, if necessary, to thwart a cabal of militant nationalists and former Communist officials he says are plotting to oust him.
Ending a high-profile, two-day state visit to Britain intended to demonstrate Western support for his beleaguered Government, Mr. Yeltsin won a standing ovation after his speech before members of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. 
 "We must directly recognize: there are in our country forces interested in a revanchist coup," declared Mr. Yeltsin, loosely describing his opponents as remnants of the former Communist Party, nationalists and "political adventurers."
At the same time that he warned he was ready to use "the power granted me by the people" to block any attempt at overthrowing his Government, he derided the threat posed by his political opposition. He described it as "nothing but a theater of shadows, in which the ghosts of the past are giving their farewell performance."
 
Lunch With the Queen
 In his final day in London, Mr. Yeltsin plunged into a crowd to shake hands with office workers in London's financial district, and traveled to Buckingham Palace to have lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, whom he invited to visit him in Moscow. A spokeswoman at Buckingham Palace said the Queen accepted the invitation "in principle," but no decision has yet been when, or if, she would be traveling to Russia.
Mr. Yeltsin's 36-hour swing through London, the first state visit by a freely elected Russian leader, produced a flurry of political and economic agreements between the two countries, nearly all of them more symbolic than substantive, as well as ringing declarations affirming the two countries as democratic allies.
Senior British officials regarded the visit as an opportunity to affirm, at least symbolically, Western support for the Russian President, who is facing mounting economic and political challenges at home.
 
'Will Not Turn Back'
 But in an editorial today, The Daily Telegraph, a newspaper that often reflects Conservative Party thinking, was sharply critical of the Government's high-profile program for the Yeltsin visit, arguing it was "inappropriate."
"It was as if the Government wanted to believe that he has already become what, in fact, he has yet to prove himself to be -- a man capable of turning his country into a capitalist democracy," the newspaper wrote.
For his part, Mr. Yeltsin reiterated his commitment to economic and democratic change. "Despite the hysterics of the opponents of reforms, Russia will not stop and will not turn back," he told Parliament today.
But he also reminded the West that he needs more help, particularly in deferring payment of Moscow's huge debts to the West, and appealed for sympathy and support for the civil and human rights of ethnic Russians who are residents of former Soviet republics.
Without naming the Governments, Mr. Yeltsin was apparently referring to Estonia and Lativa, which he has described in the past as relegating Russians into a second-class citizenship.
He also strongly defended his decision to use Russian troops to deal with ethnic rebellion in southern Russia. "Timidity and delay in taking decisions lead to chaos and turns against the peaceful population," Mr. Yeltsin said.

HEADLINE: France's Choice on Trade

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 10

 BODY:
With pressure on him growing to conclude a world trade agreement, President Francois Mitterrand of France is confronted by a tough choice: incur the anger of France's most important ally, Germany, by continuing to resist a deal, or enrage the powerful and vociferous French farmers' lobby by signing an accord.
The current signs are that President Mitterrand is leaning toward concessions that would once again cement the German alliance, avoid the imposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on white wine and other European products next month and help conclude a trade agreement to revive the world's sagging economy. 
 "I want to reach an agreement," he said this week in a television address. "I want it even more so because the isolation of a country like France, if it were to occur, would be very dangerous for France. We must not get to this point."
 
Pressure From Germany
 It was the first time that the President had referred to the possibility of France's being isolated, and his tone appeared to reflect growing German pressure.
German irritation with France over the stalled General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks has risen markedly this month. Economics Minister Jurgen Mollemann chided France for delaying an agreement for domestic reasons, and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said today that "compromises will be needed and France will, in the end, have to join in." German industrialists have accused Jacques Delors, the French President of the European Community Commission, of chauvinism and selfishness.
This open German criticism amounts to a startling departure. The French-German alliance lies at the heart of Europe's ambitious plans for unity, and the countries tend to paper over any differences quickly. When Germany angered France last year by recognizing Croatia without consulting its European partners, the French Government decided reluctantly to go along with the Germans, effectively sacrificing its old ally Serbia.
"In the end, the overriding need to safeguard our friendship with Germany was stronger than our profound irritation at the Croatian decision," said one senior official, who insisted on anonymity.
President Mitterrand must again decide whether to give in to German impatience, which in this case is shared by several other European Community members, especially Britain. He knows that France is increasingly isolated in the six-year-old GATT talks, whose successful outcome could eventually add $100 billion to world output. On the other hand, there are big temptations in a course of continued obstruction.
In March, it is almost inevitable that centrist and right-wing opposition parties will triumph over President Mitterrand's Socialists in parliamentary elections. If the GATT issue is still unresolved, it will fall to a center-right government to make the uncomfortable concessions, which, in turn, could dent the popularity of the right with farmers before the 1995 presidential election.
The farmers are already angry over this year's reform of the European Community's agricultural policy, which will lead to cuts in the $40 billion annually that the community now pays farmers and the removal of some land from cultivation. France has Europe's largest agricultural sector.
Still, Mr. Mitterrand has not been alone in moderating his tone. The top French official in Brussels, Mr. Delors, has up to now been notably apathetic on GATT questions, to avoid being blamed by French farmers for what they are sure to regard as a bad deal. This would damage Mr. Delors's thinly disguised French presidential ambitions.
But today, Mr. Delors said he hoped that an agreement could be reached before the European Community summit meeting beginning on Dec. 11. The Secretary General of GATT, Arthur Dunkel, was formally mandated by trade negotiators today to travel to Brussels and Washington to seek to revive talks.
Some of these signals appear to have reached Washington. One United States official said that he suddenly perceived a new European willingness to negotiate. Apparently reflecting such a mood, Ray MacSharry, the European Community's Agriculture Commissioner, has tentatively agreed to rejoin the GATT talks with the United States, The Associated Press and the British Broadcasting Corporation reported tonight from Brussels. Mr. MacSharry stepped down from his role as farm negotiator last week, charging that Mr. Delors had interfered in oilseed talks with the United States.
 
Waiting for a Sign
 The community's executive commission will confirm Mr. MacSharry's return on Wednesday, the BBC said. Community officials had no comment tonight. American officials have been waiting for his return as a sign that the Europeans may be willing to strike a compromise.
Still, big problems remain. United States officials described the latest European offer on cutting the community's oilseed production and subsidies -- the immediate cause of the threatened imposition of punitive tariffs -- as inadequate.
The community has said it will hold oilseed production to about 9.5 million tons from an annual average of 13 million, but has offered no guarantees and no means of compliance.
"It's not an enforceable offer and we don't believe that production will fall that low," said one United States official.

HEADLINE: House Democrats Proclaiming Unity

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 10

 BODY:
House Democratic leaders said today that they were sure the freshmen in their party would join them in working with the Clinton Administration on jobs, health care and deficit reduction.
"All of us saw very strong support for the principal objectives of the Clinton campaign and the Clinton Administration," House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said. He spoke after a third meeting with the newcomers here, following sessions in Los Angeles and Chicago. 
 Mr. Foley said he had found little interest in procedural issues like term limits or House rules. There was "more unanimity on that than I expected," he said.
Cynthia McKinney, a newcomer from Georgia, offered similar optimism after today's meeting. "We have a unique opportunity to be a part of the reshaping of our national priorities and our national values," she said, "hand-in-hand and arm-in-arm with the Democratic leadership and with President Clinton."
The 18 freshmen who met here with party leaders defined themselves as agents of change because of their support for those goals, which they said had been ignored by Republican Administrations. But there were occasional voices, including those of Tom Barlow of Kentucky and Sanford Bishop of Georgia, urging greater attention to the goal of a balanced budget.
 
'I'm a Tugboat'
 As their colleagues urged in different accents and cadences in the earlier meetings, the lawmakers-to-be here insisted that they were interested in accomplishments, not fame.
"I'm a tugboat, not a showboat," said Corinne Brown of Florida. "I'm here to work and get it on."
Although the 63 Democratic freshmen in the House will amount to the biggest group of newcomers in many years and to almost one-fourth of the 258 Democrats in the House, they showed little enthusiasm at these meetings for making themselves a distinct entity.
That idea came up in Chicago on Monday, when Louis Gutierrez of Chicago urged his newly elected colleagues to convene a meeting soon where they could assess the leadership and its policy plans.
But other freshmen at the meeting, including fellow Chicagoan Bobby Rush, roundly ridiculed his idea, telling him that legislative success was their only real interest. Later, at a news conference, Mr. Rush said, "We don't anticipate organizing a separate agenda." And Mr. Gutierrez acknowledged that a consensus did not want to divide the freshmen from other Democrats.
Bobby Scott of Virginia was blunt about the subject here today, saying: "I think people are not interested in who the leader is. They want to know when we're going to get some health care and jobs."
Before meeting with 18 newcomers today, the Democratic leaders told reporters that they thought more senior Democrats would show the same spirit of cooperation with the incoming Administration. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a chief deputy whip, said, "The rank and file are convinced that Bill Clinton is the leader of our party and we must produce."
Mr. Foley said, "I can't quite recall -- except the enthusiasm of the early Johnson and Kennedy years -- anything that matches the sense that this group and the Congress now has."
And Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader who led battles against President Bush, said of the Congress: "It is not set up to lead. It is set up to follow. What we're hearing from our members is let's get it done."
 
Possible G.O.P. Support
 Mr. Gephardt even offered the hope that support for Mr. Clinton could be found among the 47 Republican freshmen. "Bill Clinton is a moderate Democrat," he said. "He will offer proposals that may well attract the support of some moderate Republicans."
In the course of the three days of meetings, with 55 of the 63 newcomers, there were different embellishments to the basic texts of jobs, deficit and health care in different places. The environment came up more often in Los Angeles, although Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky of Pennsylvania said here today that there was agreement that people must "stop using the earth as if we have another one to go to."
The need for public-works spending was the additional chapter at the Chicago meeting. Representative Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan said. "We have to start putting our brains our technology and our money into infrastructure."
Here, if there were few new topics, there was a more constant sense and use of the word urgency. The new lawmakers here who included 11 blacks in newly created districts, represent some of the poorest districts in the country.
 
No Worry About Wine
 Asked about the group's views of the trade dispute with Europe that has led to increased duties on white wine from Europe, Carrie Meek of Florida noted that many of her constituents were still suffering after Hurricane Andrew. "I have difficulty worrying about French wine at this time," she snapped.
There were also efforts by the leaders to influence the Clinton agenda they were promising to support. In Chicago, for example, Mr. Foley said, "I do believe that there will be more emphasis on deficit reduction than has been noted by the press or perhaps the Clinton Administration."
And Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, suggested that tax increases greater than Mr. Clinton has proposed would become necessary. But when asked what his committee would do, he said, "It all depends on what the President suggests."
Here, Melvin Watt of North Carolina said "for the first 100 days, or six months, I sensed an amazing willingness to put aside our individual agendas and get on with a common agenda and break the gridlock."

HEADLINE: Community Colleges Forced To Restrict Access, and Goals

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
With tuition at four-year colleges climbing and a sluggish economy forcing workers back to school to retrain for new jobs, students of all ages have been flocking to the relatively inexpensive classrooms of the nation's community colleges. But they do not always get in.
For the first time since the start of their explosive growth in the 1960's, community colleges -- which now enroll 36 percent of all students in higher education, and more than 50 percent of all freshmen -- are being forced to narrow their open-access policies and deal with fiscal constraints that will determine, to a large extent, whether they offer legitimate opportunity or just second-rate schooling.
 
More Harm for Some
 The colleges have been criticized for failing to keep their promise to America's most economically and academically disadvantaged students. Intellectual rigor can be flabby, classroom discipline loose, academic standards abstract. An associate's degree can be of little help in finding a good job. 
 And yet, for many who are willing to work, these colleges are a genie's lamp that can transform the unlucky, and it is they who are most likely to get hurt by the current squeeze.
In California, for example, the nation's largest community college system is turning away students because the state, for the first time, has refused to provide the financial support for everyone who wants to get in. Until now the state paid the 107 colleges, with an enrollment of over 1.5 million students, a set fee for each student no matter how many enrolled.
The California colleges also have raised their fees and for the first time are charging students who already have a degree $50 a credit more than other students, presumably to discourage them from taking up classroom space.
In Pennsylvania, officials have alerted community college presidents that the state will run short of money and not fully finance the colleges this year for all the students they admit. One of the largest community colleges in the nation, Miami-Dade Community College, capped enrollment earlier this year but was able to lift it two months ago only because voters in that hurricane-damaged region approved a special tax increase to support the school.
Officials of the American Association of Community Colleges say the picture is grim in most states and getting worse. Even where colleges have not limited enrollments they have been unable to schedule enough classes for new students, thus, in effect limiting their access to an education.
"This is a crucial period," said David R. Pierce, president of the association. He said financial imbalances have placed open access, the "centerpiece of our institutions, in very real jeopardy."
Although maligned as "high schools with ashtrays" or safe havens for students who cannot get into real colleges, the nation's 1,158 publicly financed community colleges, private junior colleges, and technical colleges have grown so much that they now enroll about 6.4 million students. For more than half of all entering freshman in higher education, going to college means going to the local community college.
 Without community colleges, many of the 6.4 million would not go to college at all. But half of them are casual students who never earn more than 12 credits, and of the rest, only about a quarter go on to a senior college, down from more than 45 percent in the 1950's.
 
Still Providing Some Opportunity
 The colleges are as unorthodox as their students, and administrators point out that, for many, the goal may not include a traditional academic course leading toward a degree. The students' average age is 29. Almost 65 percent attend part time, going to class at night or on the weekends. On average they take three years to get an associate's degree that used to take two years. Many, however, stretch the schooling to four or five years.
The degree itself is no lock on success. Someone holding an associate's degree can expect to make 29 percent more than a high school graduate, but far less money and social progress than someone with a bachelor's degree. Although occupational training programs can lead to attractive careers in computer science, many students end up in low-paying jobs in a field like cosmetology.
Nonetheless, community colleges in recent years have served as crucial portals for minority students, and the recent cutbacks threaten hard-won advances in that area. While community colleges enroll 37 percent of all white students in higher education, they enroll 38 percent of Asians, 42 percent of blacks and 54 percent of Hispanic students.
Community colleges have long been seen as salvage operations, giving the least advantaged students -- people like Nilda Ortiz of Homestead, Fla., -- a chance to grab the American Dream.
"Andrew didn't stop me and nothing is going to keep me away," said Ms. Ortiz. It was her first day of class at Miami-Dade Community College's battered Homestead campus, and though her home had been badly damaged by Hurricane Andrew, she was determined to begin her college career. "I've been waiting for this for a long, long time," she said.
But for every teary-eyed story of students overcoming adversity, there is a corresponding story of failure, like the student who was finally thrown out of Essex County Community College in Newark in 1980 after officials discovered he had taken 70 credits without getting more than a zero grade in any course.
College officials themselves agree that too few of their students complete their courses, too few get their associate's degrees and too few transfer to four-year colleges and earn the bachelor's degrees that can change their lives.
Critics go further and say community colleges routinely water down academics and allow perennial students to live off financial aid. They also sometimes accuse the colleges of channeling their minority students -- who often need to take remedial courses that cannot be counted for credit at four-year colleges -- into occupational training programs that dampen aspirations and lead to low-paying jobs.
"The rhetoric is terrific, but the reality is in transferring people, and that record is not good," said L. Steven Zwerling, an expert on community colleges with the Ford Foundation, which has been trying for years to improve the colleges. "What's going on in general is that people are coming in and they're getting washed out or directed to low-skill, low-wage kinds of jobs."
 
Original Mission Is Diverted
 The first junior colleges date back to the turn of the century, and even then they were seen as transitions, helping to give less-prepared students a boost toward a four-year college. In the 1970's, when new community colleges were opening at the rate of one a week, they expanded their mission, offering occupational training that led to jobs as a medical technicians or beauticians.
In the 1980's, they expanded again, offering job retraining for older workers who needed new skills.
But with the new focus on jobs, many of the colleges seemed to have lost sight of their original academic mission. Now, just 24 percent of community college students transfer to four-year colleges according to the Center for the Study of Community Colleges at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Even that figure can be misleading because it refers to only those students who accumulate 12 or more credits (about four courses). Nationally, half of all entering community college students never even get that far.
"These colleges are not necessarily transforming anybody," said Valerie E. Lee, an associate professor of education at the University of Michigan who has studied community college education. "The best students tend to transfer, and the weaker students do not."
Community college administrators are wary of making too much of transfer rates because they say it is not fair to expect that every student who enrolls intends to, or should, go on to a four-year college.
But they generally do concede that they have got away from their original purpose and need to move back toward academic preparation, even though the current financial squeeze will make that more difficult.
The colleges' support generally comes from three sources: the state, the local community and tuition. At a college like the Community College of Philadelphia, the financially strapped city has not fully financed the college for six years. Last year, the president, Ronald J. Temple, led students on a march to City Hall to demand greater support.
The city has shorted the college again this year. The state said it would probably not fully finance the college for every student it enrolls. And tuition, now at $61 a credit, is as high as the law allows it to be.
As a result, the library's book acquisition budget has not increased for 10 years, even as book prices have soared. Class size has jumped to 26 from 23 over the last two years. The college cannot offer enough courses to meet the needs of all students.
So Janice St. Clair, who has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, has to take a math course at the main campus, which is an hour's drive from her home, because the Northeast regional campus, which is two minutes away, canceled the course.
Hung Vong, who came from Vietnam six years ago, is not sure when he can take the literature course he needs to transfer next fall to Temple University, where he will pursue a bachelor's degree in education. Next semester the course is only available in the morning, when he is at work.
"It's going to slow me down a little bit," said Mr. Hung with the frontier spirit typical of many community college students.
 
Good and Bad In Diversity
 At Lucy Aghazarian's Humanities 102 class, the 21-year-old Mr. Vong struggles in his new English to explain a stanza from Thomas Hood's 19th-century poem "The Song of the Shirt." A few seats away, Joseph Leone aces it. Mr. Leone, a 20-year-old honors student, had planned to go to Drexel University but could not afford it. He enrolled at the community college three years ago. Next year he will transfer to Temple University and pursue a double degree in pharmacy and medicine.
"I have no regrets," he said of his decision to save money by living at home and attending the community college, where tuition is less than half as much as at Temple. He said he enjoyed the community school's cultural diversity, small class size and the attention of the faculty. "I'm perfectly happy here," he said.
The diversity of community colleges is their strength and their weakness. When open admissions rose out of the idealism of the 1960's, poorly trained students were welcomed; they represented pedagogical challenges just begging to be overcome.
As the number of those students increased, and their academic preparation plummeted, the colleges were overwhelmed. At some, more than 90 percent of students take remedial courses and reading skills can hover around the fifth-grade level.
This is generally attributed to a lack of preparation in high school, not a lack of commitment by the community college faculty. Surveys show they love teaching, do little research and do not rely on graduate assistants.
But surveys also show they often feel dispirited and sometimes they deliberately lower their academic standards to match the skills of their students.
Under current financial conditions, the colleges have been hiring more part-time faculty members. Now more than 65 percent of all community college faculty are part-timers, who cannot devote as much attention to student needs as full-time faculty. Some colleges are experimenting with televised courses or videotape class lecture libraries to fill the need, but teachers' contracts limit the use of such innovations.
Community colleges show other signs of stress. In California, David Mertes, chancellor of the state system, said the colleges have had to clamp down on registration and often are not able to offer students the courses they need.
The president of Miami-Dade Community College, Robert H. McCabe, says he would have been in serious trouble had not voters approved the tax increase that will establish a $100-million endowment for the college.
He said that community colleges are often misunderstood because they do so many different things. But the surprising results of the September vote, he said, testify to the strength of a college that is truly part of its community.
"People decided," he said, "that despite anti-tax sentiments, despite the devastation of the hurricane, that this is an institution that believes in giving everybody an opportunity."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Many community colleges are being forced to deal with fiscal restraints affecting both the number of students who will still be able to attend and the quality of the education. Hung Vong, a student at the Community College of Philadelphia, may not be able to take the one class he needs to transfer next fall to Temple University because the course is only available in the mornings when he is at work; "I have no regrets," said Joseph Leone, a 20-year-old honors student who chose to go to the Community College of Philadelphia to save money.

Pie graph shows the ideal three-way split of the total 1992-93 budget into three equal pieces of $19.6 million each; "The Real World," however, reveals the ideal to be faulted.
 The financially struggling city can pay only $12.5 million.
 The state's share increased to $21.3 million (but it may come up short $3 million).

HEADLINE: Gift of Concern Over California Colleges

 BODY:
Voicing concern about the future of higher education in California, a foundation yesterday announced it would put up $6 million -- its largest gift ever for a single project -- to start an independent policy research center to study the issue.
The James Irvine Foundation, a 55-year-old organization devoted to improving the quality of life in California, said the gift would establish the California Higher Education Policy Center in San Jose. The goal of the center will be to develop strategies for higher education based on the suggestions of educators, government leaders and ordinary citizens in the state. 
 Asserting that California's much-praised system of public colleges and universities had been damaged by recent budget crises, the president of the foundation, Dennis A. Collins, said the center seeks to have a voice in the shaping of the future of higher education. The foundation, Mr. Collins said, "believes the future of California's colleges and universities is too crucial to be decided by default or by budget trimming alone."
"The Center will look beyond the current financial crisis," he said at a news conference in San Francisco. "It will consider core issues, such as who should benefit from higher education and how our institutions can be more accountable to the public."
He said the center would be the first of its kind in the nation, and would be influential because it would be independent of government and the university system. Its director will be Patrick Callan, a former vice president of the Education Commission of the States, a policy and research group.
The foundation, established by James Irvine, a California businessman and farmer, distributes about $30 million in grants a year.

HEADLINE: Companies Cut Research Budgets

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
American industry is pulling back on scientific research and development as it plans its budgets for next year, keeping that critical activity mired in a recession at least through the end of 1993, according to a survey released yesterday.
The survey on expected trends in research expenditures was conducted by Industrial Research Institute, a trade group based in Washington that represents the research centers of major corporations. 
 The results of its annual survey, which this year brought responses from 141 companies, were "more pessimistic" than last year, Dr. Gary E. McGraw, chairman of the institute's research committee, told a Washington symposium yesterday.
 
Few See Larger Staffs
 About 28 percent of the companies responding to the survey expect to cut their total research and development spending, he said, while only 24 percent expect to increase it. Moreover, the proportion of the budgets devoted to "directed basic research" is expected to decrease at 31 percent of the companies, while increasing at 11 percent.
Many more companies expect to cut capital spending on research and development (36 percent) than increase it (20 percent), Dr. McGraw said. And more plan to decrease hiring of new graduates (40 percent) than increase it (10 percent).
Overall, 84 percent of the companies expect their research staffs to remain unchanged or to shrink next year.
The general budgets of the surveyed companies for research and development, when calculated as a percent of sales, are expected to drop next year from 3.4 percent to 3.3 percent, Dr. McGraw said.
In addition to being chairman of the institute's research committee, Dr. McGraw is vice president of development for the Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport, Tenn., a division of Eastman Kodak.
Private experts have worried that a steady erosion of America's industrial edge is undercutting the nation's ability to compete in world markets, and for some time they have recommended tough steps to strengthen industry against foreign rivals.
During the Presidential campaign, Gov. Bill Clinton promised such help, saying he would redirect billions of dollars in Federal research funds from military to civilian endeavors.

HEADLINE: STUDY SEES EXCESS IN X-RAYS OF HEART

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
About half of all special X-ray procedures to examine the heart performed in this country are unnecessary or could be safely put off for long periods, say authors of a study reported today in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
The conclusion about the procedures, called coronary angiograms, was immediately disputed by the head of the leading group of heart specialists in the United States. 
 But, while cautioning against generalizing from one study to the entire population, Dr. Claude J. Lenfant, the head of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md., said the findings "need to be looked at very carefully, and additional studies are needed to confirm the findings."
The authors said theirs was the first systematic study of second opinions on whether the X-ray procedure is necessary. About a million coronary angiograms will be performed in the United States this year, at a cost of about $5,000 each.
 
Outlining the Arteries
 In the procedure, dyes are injected into the coronary arteries that supply blood directly to the heart and X-rays are taken. The dyes outline the contour of the arteries and define the degree of blockage in them. When these arteries become clogged with fatty deposits from arteriosclerosis, they can lead to angina and to heart attacks. The coronary angiograms thus help doctors determine whether patients will benefit from additional procedures like angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery.
Because the study involved patients who were motivated on their own or by an insurance company to seek a second opinion about the procedures, Dr. Thomas B. Graboys of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the senior author of the study, cautioned about extrapolating from the study's results to all patients with coronary heart disease.
Nevertheless, in the article, in a news release from the American Medical Association in Chicago and in an interview, Dr. Graboys said his team believed that about half of the coronary angiograms performed in the United States every year were not needed. He said he hoped the new findings would "chip away" at the soaring number of angiograms, which he described as "the funnel into" other procedures and heart surgery.
 
New York Study Cited
 A rigorously controlled study to address the problem of overuse of coronary angiograms more specifically would have to involve thousands of patients and cost millions of dollars, Dr. Graboys said, and would not provide an answer until the year 2000.
A study of angiograms and other heart procedures in New York hospitals conducted by researchers from the Rand Corporation is being reviewed by a medical journal, said Fran Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health Department, which helped sponsor the study.
Dr. Adolf Hutter, president of the American College of Cardiology, said in an interview that he disputed the conclusions of Dr. Graboys's study.
The criteria used in the study "are too restrictive based on everything we have learned" from other rigorously controlled studies, and the findings "cannot be extrapolated to a larger population," said Dr. Hutter, a staff member of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
 
'Danger of Overextrapolating'
 The cardiology college "is against the inappropriate use of medical procedures," Dr. Hutter said, "but is also against the underuse of appropriate procedures, and that is the danger of overextrapolating from this type of study."
The study's findings emerge from a series of studies of second opinions in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease that Dr. Graybos's team has been working on since the mid-1970's. The latest was aimed at determining the long-term outcome of patients who were advised in a second opinion not to have a coronary angiogram.
The study involved 171 consecutive patients referred to Dr. Graboys's team from 1981 to 1988. Their average age was 60 years, and ranged from 36 to 88. Of the total number of patients, 144 were men.
One hundred and thirty-four patients, or 80 percent, were judged not to require angiography. The decision was deferred pending further studies in 28 patients, or 16 percent of the cases, and recommended in six. The doctors evaluated the patients through questionnaires, telephone calls and examinations after a follow-up period that averaged 46 1/2 months.
Eleven patients died, seven from heart problems, for an annual cardiac death rate of 1.1 percent. Nineteen patients suffered a new heart attack, an annual rate of 2.7 percent annual rate, and 27 patients, or 4.3 percent, developed a worsening of their angina.
"There is much disquiet that if coronary angiography is not undertaken, one gambles on the unpredictabilities of outcome," the report said. But Dr. Graboys said the findings were reassuring on that point.
"It is not in the hospital's or the cardiologist's best interest to reduce the numbers of people coming in" for such studies, he said, "because the fiscal survival of many hospitals is dependent on the high rate of reimbursement procedures."
Dr. Graboys said it was difficult for doctors to spend the time exploring the options with patients. He added, "It is easier to say we will do the angiogram and other invasive studies, and we will get paid five times as much."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up Only 0.1%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Prices received by American producers edged up only one-tenth of 1 percent in October from the month before, as the weak economic recovery continued to keep inflation at bay, Labor Department figures showed today.
Smaller than usual increases for passenger car prices helped offset higher prices for gasoline and other energy components of the Producer Price Index for finished goods, which are products ready for sale to final business and individual users. The index had risen three-tenths of 1 percent in September. 
 The small October increase was cited as an important factor in a solid rally in the bond market today. Long-term Treasury issues were especially strong, with the price of the 30-year bond gaining $7.81 for each $1,000 in face value. [Page D13.]
 
Warning on Stimulus
 Analysts who studied the first price report published since Election Day said there was no immediate threat of revived inflation. But they warned that the interests of President-elect Bill Clinton and the new Democratic Congress in giving the economy a lift with a stimulus program could pose such a risk. The President-elect's economic team has signaled that any stimulus would be short term.
Some also said today's report indicated that the Federal Reserve, which has a policy meeting next Tuesday, has leeway to cut interest rates further. The dominant view, however, was that the Fed would refrain amid some recent signs of a pickup in the economy, the repeated monetary infusions already in the pipeline, and the uncertainty of a new Administration.
Today's report showed even weaker prices at the intermediate and crude stages of production, which both posted one-tenth of 1 percent declines. This means that in the production of, say, a loaf of bread, millers receive lower prices for sacks of flour and farmers get less for bushels of wheat.
When the volatile food and energy components are excluded, finished goods prices themselves eased one-tenth of 1 percent, the third small decline in the last five months.
There has been "a major break in the core rate" of inflation this year, said Joel Popkin, a Washington consultant who specializes in studying prices, likening the current inflation picture to the one inherited by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.
He added that inflation would almost inevitably move higher when the economy picked up speed, but he thought it would be contained by a "cushion" of improved corporate profitability and fiscal inhibitions related to the Government's huge budget deficit.
Mr. Popkin also pointed to the fact that wages and salaries, up 2.7 percent over the 12 months through September, trailed the 3 percent rate of consumer inflation for the same period.
Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, cautioned today that as Mr. Clinton put his policies into effect, prices would "bear careful watching to determine what effect stimulative actions he may take to 'get the economy moving again' will have on inflation."
But Mr. Schreibman added that slack in the economy meant that renewed upward pressure on prices would probably not appear for several months.
Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a monthly consensus of about 50 economic forecasters, reported today that its latest survey projected 1993 consumer inflation at 3.2 percent, unchanged from the projection of last month. The low projection of the survey was 1.8 percent and the high was 3.9 percent.
In October, finished consumer foods edged up one-tenth of 1 percent as a 27 percent jump for fresh and dry vegetables was partly offset by declines for fish, dairy products, eggs, pork, soft drinks and coffee.
Energy climbed 1.4 percent, nearly twice the September increase, because of increases in natural gas and residential electricity that combined with a 3.3 percent jump for gasoline.
New environmental regulations requiring oxygenated gasoline took effect Nov. 1, but analysts said some of this more costly fuel may have been introduced earlier in some areas.
Passenger car prices spurted up 7.1 percent, but after the seasonal adjustment factor was applied, prices fell 2.3 percent, the report showed. Of the $526.47, or 13.7 percent, yearly increase in what auto makers received for cars, the department calculated that $74.70 represented quality improvements.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 15.40, but Smaller Stocks Gain

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell yesterday, but smaller stocks continued to gain ground.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 15.40 points to close at 3,225.47. A late round of computer-related program selling insured that the key index closed at its session lows. 
 But advancing issues actually outnumbered declining ones by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 223.2 million shares as of 4 P.M., up from 197.6 million in the previous session.
The market got an initial boost from a Government report showing wholesale prices edged up a tiny one-tenth of 1 percent in October -- the best performance since August and an indication inflation is well under control.
But equities then wavered, with blue-chip issues giving ground as secondary stocks continued their upward move.
Small-capitalization stocks have been in the spotlight in recent weeks. Analysts said part of the reason was technical -- they had been hit harder than blue chips earlier in the year. But there is also the belief that small businesses may benefit more than their large counterparts under President-elect Bill Clinton.
Analysts said large multinational corporations had suffered in part because of the Clinton factor as well as from the recent run-up in the value of the dollar. As the dollar rises, the value of a company's profits that are earned in a foreign currency declines.
"This is a better-looking market than the Dow itself would suggest," said Dick Hoey, chief economist at Dreyfus Corporation. "The underlying pattern is that strength has been very intense in mid-capitalization and technology growth stocks even in a market that's kind of flat."
Some of the session's best performers were technology-oriented issues, including Motorola, which jumped 4, to 101 3/8, a high for the last year. In addition, the biotechnology leader Genentech added 3/4, to 37 7/8; the pacemaker manufacturer Medtronic jumped 1 1/8, to 108, and Scientific-Atlanta was up 1 at 31 3/4.
Among technology-related over-the-counter issues, Cisco Systems jumped 3 1/2, to 69 7/8; Intel rose 7/8, to 70 1/8; Novel Inc. added 1 1/8, to 33, and MTC Electronic Techology rose 1 3/4, to 16.
Mortgage-oriented stocks also posted strong gains in reaction to a rally in the bond market. Several hit 52-week highs, including North American Mortgage, which rose 1, to 16 3/4; Federal Home Loan, which added 5/8, to 47; First USA, up 1 1/2, to 17 3/8, and Federal National Mortgage, or Fannie Mae, up 3/8, to 72 7/8.
On the downside, gold stocks plunged as the metal's price hit a seven-year low. Among them, Newmont Mining plummeted 2 3/4, to 40 1/2; Homestake Mining lost 7/8, to 10 1/2.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
General Motors Files to Issue $1 Billion in Stock

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Saddled with large capital expenditures at the same time it has racked up losses from operations, the General Motors Corporation registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission today to raise up to $1 billion from a new issue of preference stock.
Added to G.M.'s seven other equity offerings since June 1991, the issue increases to nearly $8 billion the amount raised in equity markets in less than two years. The company said it expected to offer the first shares of the new issue within a few weeks. 
 "I wouldn't want to bet this is the last time" that G.M. raises equity, said David Healy, automotive analyst for S. G. Warburg & Company. The auto maker lost $4.45 billion in 1991 and another $970.7 million through the first nine months of 1992.
 
Heavy Spending
 While G.M. has been absorbing these losses, it has been forced to spend about $7 billion to develop new models and retool its factories. Moreover, the company continues to pay dividends on its common stock that total about $500 million annually.
Because of the tight finances, G.M. said this week that it was canceling the redesign of two of its aging midsize cars: the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and the Buick Century. The two models, first introduced in 1982, are built at a factory in Oklahoma City, whose future is not clear after 1996. As recently as August, G.M. had said that new versions of the cars would be built.
G.M. also postponed for a year, until 1996, the redesign of another midsize car line consisting of the Chevrolet Lumina, Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix, according to Automotive News, a weekly industry publication. A G.M. spokeman declined to confirm the report.
The company could face even more expenses as a result of talks its labor negotiators are having with the United Automobile Workers about buyouts of some employees. "Buyouts and retirements are also going to eat up cash," Mr. Healy said.
Preference stock, which pays a fixed dividend, outranks common stock but is behind preferred stock in the order of dividend payments. By selling preference stock, which is accounted for as equity, G.M. avoids borrowing, which would weaken its balance sheet and threaten its already shaky credit rating. A reduced credit rating would, among other things, make it more difficult for the company's financing subsidiary, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, to continue borrowing in credit markets at favorable interest rates.
 
A Note of Caution
 The preference-stock issue was termed a "short-term positive" by Scott Sprinzen, director of corporate finance for the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit rating agency. But he cautioned that "one way or another the company can't continue to tap the equity market to make up for poor performance."
Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have both said they are monitoring G.M. for a possible downgrading of its credit rating.
G.M. said Lehman Brothers would serve as lead manager for the initial offering. The shares will be issued from time to time, according to market conditions, G.M. said.

Gold Declines to $330.10; Lowest in Nearly 7 Years

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices approached a seven-year low yesterday as expectations for a surge in inflation continued to fade.
Other precious metals also posted losses as traders reassessed the potential economic impact of the Clinton Administration. 
 Gold for December delivery fell $3 on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $330.10 an ounce, the lowest settlement for a near-term gold contract since Jan. 3, 1986.
 
Sixth Consecutive Decline
 The price dipped below $330 during the session, which ended with gold's sixth straight daily decline.
December silver fell 5.7 cents, to $3.645 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum for January delivery plunged $11.90, to $345.90 an ounce.
This week's weakness in precious metal prices largely reflects a change in perceptions about how President-elect Bill Clinton will try to stimulate the sluggish economy when he takes office in January.
In the weeks before the election, the betting was that his plans would include an immediate tax cut for the middle class and tax incentives to industry that could ignite a sharp rise in wholesale and consumer prices along with increased economic activity.
Higher inflation typically means higher gold prices, because investors view gold as a hedge against rising prices.
But Mr. Clinton and his advisers have said they want to hear from all sides on how to help the economy, indicating that they will take a more deliberate approach.
"The reality is that it's going to be a long-term thing, so a lot of investors are getting out of precious metals," said Ian MacDonald, manager of precious metal trading for the New York branch of the large Swiss bank Credit Suisse.
Inflation has been held nearly in check this year. Yesterday, the Government reported that inflation at the wholesale level had inched up a slight one-tenth of 1 percent in October, making for a 1.9 percent annual rate so far this year.
In other markets, natural gas futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid predictions for record cold temperatures this weekend in the Midwest. Oil futures weakened as traders took profits after a strong rally on Monday.
December natural gas deliveries rose 6.3 cents, to $2.417 for 1,000 cubic feet; December light sweet crude oil fell 15 cents, to $20.47 a barrel; December heating oil fell 0.26 cent, to 58.10 cents a gallon; December unleaded gasoline fell 1.03 cents, to 55.20 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: ON THE SET WITH: Bryant Gumbel;
Steady in Storm or Calm

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
IN recent years, the ride on NBC's "Today" show has been like an adventure on the high seas -- down, then up, then down, now up again. But the guy at the wheel still shows no signs of losing his equilibrium.
After 11 years as host of the program, the longest tenure in the history of "Today," Bryant Gumbel, now 44 years old, remains secure, self-assured, and just a bit inscrutable. 
 Mr. Gumbel is the most visible African-American in the world of network news. And starting Friday, he will accomplish a goal he freely admits has been "an obsession" for the last five years: bringing "Today" to sub-Sahara Africa for a week of special broadcasts.
But to Mr. Gumbel a connection between these two facts, while perhaps logical, is much too facile, and thus inaccurate.
"Frankly, there are a lot of reasons for making the trip," Mr. Gumbel said, enumerating them quickly and articulately, exactly the way he does just about everything on television:
Africa is a continent too long ignored by Western news media; it is full of arresting, entertaining and important stories, as well as spectacular pictures for television; and besides, it is the only continent, other than Antarctica, that "Today" has never visited.
Those are the true reasons, Mr. Gumbel said, that he pressed a penurious NBC management repeatedly -- submitting proposal after proposal and budget after budget -- to broadcast "Today" from Africa. Those are the reasons he met time and again with African diplomats, corresponded with various embassies, and made courtesy calls on important African officials as well as members of the United States State Department.
"I was already taken to task by someone who seemed upset that I don't say, well, I wanted to go to Africa because I'm an African-American," Mr. Gumbel said. "While I think that played a part, to suggest that played a major part is to suggest I've been derelict for 10 years because we didn't go to Africa."
Mr. Gumbel doesn't make this point in anger. He just wants it to be clear. "I have strived mightily to make sure this week is not 'Bryant Goes to Africa,' " he added. "Because that's not what it is."
Anger is hardly what Bryant Gumbel said he is feeling these days anyway. A week and half before the Africa shows, Mr. Gumbel relaxed on the "Today" set in NBC's studio 3B on his hourlong break between the end of the program at 9 A.M. Eastern time and the new opening he and his co-host, Katie Couric, would do for the West Coast edition.
Mr. Gumbel has not changed much physically in recent years, though he wears his glasses more often on the air. He is still squarely built but surprisingly light on his feet. He still golfs avidly, and commutes to Manhattan daily (well before rush hour; his day begins around 4 A.M.) from the Westchester home he shares with his wife, June, son, Bradley, and daughter, Jillian.
Moving across the set to the main "Today" interview area, Mr. Gumbel talked comfortably about the trip, the program, his years as host, the two years remaining on his contract, and even the marathon he faced beginning the next morning, when he would serve as co-anchor for the "Today" show, do six hours of election-night coverage, and another "Today" show, all in 26 sleepless hours.
It could not have been easy to be comfortable, not sitting on the "Today" couch. Designed as it is to discourage relaxation -- and thus slouching -- the "Today" couch could double as a bench in a bus depot.
And after all, the show itself hasn't exactly been the most cushy place to recline. Upheaval, discord, convulsion and change have swept through "Today," with Mr. Gumbel in the middle of most of the action.
But now the program has rebounded, using its strength in hard-news coverage to charge back up in the last two months to the top of the Nielsen ratings for network morning shows.
"It's very satisfying that the Africa trip is coming at a time when we've got our house back in order," Mr. Gumbel said.
The days of disorder began three years ago in the wake of a much-publicized memo by Mr. Gumbel in which he evaluated, often harshly, many of the "Today" staff members. A serial drama involving Mr. Gumbel's co-hosts ensued, starting with the perils of Jane Pauley, followed by the short, unhappy morning life of Deborah Norville, and culminating in the glory days of Katie Couric.
The comeback for "Today" has been so convincing that a new storm with potential for further Drang -- a book, "Inside Today," by Judy Kessler, an ex-staff member, filled with aspersions on Mr. Gumbel's character, especially his alleged abuse of women -- blew over quickly last month. TV Guide splashed the book's charges over two issues, but it received little attention after that.
"I never even took the time to say anything about the people who were part of that story," Mr. Gumbel said. "I think most people recognized it for what it was: rantings that didn't have an awful lot of substance and not a bit of merit."
The charge that he is insensitive to women is an old one, and indeed some women formerly on the "Today" staff have been critical of him in the past. Ms. Pauley once called him a Neanderthal when it came to women, but she and other women who have worked on "Today" wrote responses to TV Guide supporting Mr. Gumbel. For the record, he said, his relations with the women on "Today" are fine.
He has his own ideas about why "Today" has rebounded lately, starting with his belief that it was never "that terribly broken anyway." The fix came, Mr. Gumbel said, in defining what the program does best -- news -- and having the discipline to stay within a news definition.
Of course, he acknowledged that it has helped to have an aggressive young executive producer in Jeff Zucker and a co-host who is spending a lot of her free time on magazine covers and being identified as one of "the intriguing people of the year."
"I kind of sit back amused by it all," Mr. Gumbel said of the frenzy of attention that has greeted Katie Couric. "It doesn't bother me. A few years ago I was one of the intriguing people. I've told Katie to go ahead and enjoy it because it isn't going to last. Pretty soon somebody else will be the flavor of the month."
On the set, he and Ms. Couric have the kind of respectful working relationship and camaraderie Mr. Gumbel clearly likes.
"We have a great time together," Mr. Gumbel said. "We yell at each other sometimes. We commiserate with each other a lot. We have a lot of the same interests and we have the same sense of humor."
A sports fan to his core, Mr. Gumbel sees the two of them in baseball terms, with him playing Goose Gossage to Ms. Couric's Ron Davis.
Those two men were pitchers with the New York Yankees more than a decade ago, with Gossage the star as a ferocious "closer," the man who finished off a game, while Davis was the "set-up" man, the guy who took care of the late innings so the closer could get the save.
"I had become a closer without a set-up man," Mr. Gumbel said, referring to the need for him to conduct every big interview on the program. "Instead of pitching one inning I had to pitch three. Does that take a toll and limit your effectiveness? I think it does."
But Ms. Couric's contribution can't be summed up completely by a reference to a few solid innings of work. "It's a fun place to come to work now," Mr. Gumbel said.
He had an unusual amount of fun last July while Ms. Couric was off doing the Olympics. Mr. Gumbel traveled -- accompanied by NBC News crews as well as 13-year-old Bradley -- to Africa to tape stories for the coverage that begins Friday.
It was the culmination of an enormous personal effort to research the continent and find stories that would be both informative enough and entertaining enough to make the week exciting for American viewers, and worth the cost for NBC.
The pieces range from news-oriented reports on economics and government to social-trend pieces, a study of the tourist industry and a lot about African wildlife. The programs will be broadcast from three locations in Zimbabwe, using the spectacular Victoria Falls as a backdrop twice.
Mr. Gumbel said he hoped the week would counter the "terrible images" most Americans have of Africa as mostly jungle with wild animals roaming around. "Africa is a land of 2,000 languages and great religious diversity," Mr. Gumbel said. "You'll find Africans who say they've never seen an animal outside a cage. Americans view Africa as this monolithic land, as if it were France."
The anachronistic images are a product mainly of ignorance, Mr. Gumbel said. "If you dismiss reports on either famine or apartheid, you'd be hard pressed to come up with an hour's worth of coverage on Africa in the past two years."
But he also admitted that he went to Africa with his insensitivities intact. "We were going to do a piece about the vanishing tribes of Africa," he said. "A young African asked me why we can talk about the struggle in Yugoslavia between ethnic cultures, and when we come to Africa we call them tribes."
Though Mr. Gumbel agreed that racism may be at the root of why American television viewers have not demanded more coverage of Africa, he added that African-Americans have not pushed the issue strongly themselves, a fact he tied to differences in accessibility to heritage.
"However strained someone of European background's lines of heritage may be, they at least have the possibility of straightening them out," he said. "By contrast, most African-Americans are descended from the blood of slaves. So even if I was of a mind to spend millions to trace my heritage, I probably couldn't. And until African-Americans are in a position that their own fate here is comfortable enough that it allows them to be concerned with people outside themselves, they're not going to be concerned with Africa."
Mr. Gumbel said he was not sure how much difference one week of television programs can make. "I don't want to say we're shining a light here," he said. "That would sound presumptuous. But I do hope we can at least build a small constituency."
Having accomplished his goal of helping "Today" re-establish its claim to the top of the morning in television, and finally seeing his desire to bring the program to Africa fulfilled, Mr. Gumbel may temporarily be out of goals. When he reflected on that, his face clouded over a bit.
"Are there great challenges for me?" he said. "Maybe when I'm done in Africa I'll stop and think about that, and maybe the answers I'll come up with aren't real terrific. When I used to do sports, I'd say I didn't envision myself saying 'Dodgers 3, Giants 2' my whole life. Now I don't know what to say about the future."
Then he brightened again. "But I'm not the least bit unhappy doing this job. Matter of fact, I'm really happy doing it."

HEADLINE: Russia's New Culture Begins to Emerge From Soviet Rubble

SERIES: The Arts in Russia -- Last of three articles: Up From the Underground

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IRKUTSK, Russia

 BODY:
It was still morning at the cramped studios of AIST-TV in Irkutsk, a park-filled city on the Angara River best known as a stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway and for its proximity to mighty Lake Baikal. The television station wouldn't even go on the air until 9 that night. Yet already producers and technicians were swarming about, tending to the shiny Japanese equipment and preparing programs for future broadcast.
AIST -- the call letters stand for Alternative Irkutsk Studio Television -- is one of hundreds of new, private television stations in Russia, and a leader among them: during the Russian coup of August 1991, AIST, which happened to have a crew in Moscow, was the only station in the country to telecast fresh images of the drama in the capital. Station officials almost arrested for their pains, an action halted by the local authorities and ultimately made moot by the failure of the coup. But that scoop helped make AIST-TV the most popular station by far in a region that spans vast tracts of south central Siberia. 
 Like most such stations, AIST broadcasts its share of third-rate American films obtained on the cheap from Moscow distributors who are often indifferent to quality and the niceties of international copyright conventions. And like most such stations, it does not yet own its own transmitter, having instead to buy time on a state channel.
 
Some Signs of Change
 But AIST is also a good example of the innovative tendrils pushing their way up through the debris of the collapsed Soviet system. It and other innovators, full of lively new ideas or attuned to survival in the new Russian world of faltering government support and erratic private sponsorship, offer hope for a renewal of Russian cultural life. And in the chaos and confusion of their efforts, they lend the Russian cultural scene an aura of unpredictable excitement that recalls Europe and the United States between the world wars.
There are many other examples of such innovation, ranging from big, long-established institutions like the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg to feisty provincial dreamers like the theater director Mikhail V. Bychkov in Voronezh and the modern dancer Yevgeny Panfilov in Perm to hustling vanguard entrepreneurs like the gallery director Oleg Kulik in Moscow.
The Avant-Garde Bunny Costumes
And Doomed Hogs
In late October in Moscow at the Shkola Gallery, which is normally devoted to photography, grown men in bunny costumes, complete with fluffy white ears and tails, led earnest art lovers through a garden environment, evoked by video monitors and gauzy drapes, all meant to suggest a "universal space of action."
Mr. Kulik and the Regina Gallery, seem particularly emblematic of the new Russian arts, not least because Mr. Kulik, who is Ukrainian-born, speaks so fervently about the need for a renewal rooted in Russian traditions. Of course, the renewal he actually represents is far from the stolid traditionalism of self-styled Russian conservatives.
"The Regina Gallery has set itself the task of forming new standards of reality," Mr. Kulik proclaimed. "Peter the Great, Rasputin, Stalin, they transformed reality. But the Soviets alienated the Soviet artist from reality, and Russian artists must reinvent it."
 
A Talent for Promotion
 Although he is himself a painter, Mr. Kulik's real talent would seem to lie in the organizing of exhibitions, and especially of the trendy openings, really performance art, that bring out Moscow's nouveau-riche beau monde. So boldly does he squeeze fellow artists' paintings and sculptures into his concepts that some have angrily withdrawn their work.
Examples of his openings include a ceremonial slaughtering of live pigs. "We wanted pain, screaming, blood," he explained cheerfully. That the slaughterers were licensed butchers did not assuage the animal-rights protesters out front, whose presence, to be sure, pleased Mr. Kulik enormously and insured live television coverage of the occasion.
In June, there was the opening in which 50 paintings were held for display by 100 bare arms reaching through holes in plasterboard walls. Or one with paintings swinging back and forth on ropes, threatening constantly to decapitate unwary art watchers. However much some of these ideas may recall Western happenings of the 1960's, they have served to make the Regina Gallery into a Moscow symbol of the very latest in artistic derring-do. This fall Regina activity is on hold while its fancy new downtown quarters are being renovated.
Some vanguard artistic activity in Russia today floats defiantly free of patronage both public and private. In Moscow, a performance artist and social organizer who calls himself Petlyura has holed up in an abandoned building with some 20 fellow anarchists. He has named his community Independent Territory, claims to rehabilitate outcasts through art and resists all efforts to oust him from his headquarters. A three-day Independent Territory party in late September attracted a wide range of the Moscow artistic underground.
 
Echoes of Warhol
 But the majority of the country's small-scale artistic innovators have more conventional forms of artistic communication in mind. Most speak to a new social class in Russia, one buoyed by the profits of nascent capitalism and eager to emulate a flamboyant Western life style they have until now only been able to view from afar. Videotapes of Regina openings look like historical film clips from Andy Warhol's Factory in Manhattan, minus some of the more extreme 60's fashion and makeup: a young, attractive social set with seemingly ample resources and a determination to make a splash in attire, conversation and sexual display.
Alla Sigalova, who has her own Moscow company in which actors untrained in dance perform modern-dance dramas, cuts a dashingly fashionable figure, the clothes stylish and impeccable in a way that looks French yet is enlivened by an inescapably Russian intensity. She calls her public "an elite audience."
 
The Bankrollers
Monied Gangsters And Other Angels
 The ostentation with which Russia's newly successful have flaunted their good fortune has aroused resentment. After 70 years of inculcation in the evils of capitalism, the average Russian, let alone the convinced Communist, finds it difficult to accept sudden new wealth as anything but criminal. Even when -- or especially when -- the wealth has been won by former Communists. Businesses, usually vaguely defined "stock companies" or "commodities exchanges" often partly owned by former Communists, are routinely called "mafia" whether or not they actually involve organized crime. Employees rationalize theft from store owners by their belief that the owners must somehow be stealing from the public.
Even if the term mafia is too loosely and broadly applied in Russia today, criminal behavior would scarcely seem an innovation born of capitalism. "Gangster money is hardly new in Russia," argued John Cripton of Satra Arts International, a Connecticut-based arts management firm that imports Russian companies to North America. "There was always money being paid under the table."
If artistic innovators speak to a new social class, they also survive by it. With national, regional and municipal governments struggling to sustain traditional institutions, the innovators must fall back on private sponsorship. Unless, of course, they resist it on principle and have the wherewithal to support that stance. AIST in Irkutsk has refused sponsorship since its first backer went bankrupt, surviving on commercials and side ventures.
 
The Importance of Sponsors
 The Regina Gallery is named for the wife of Vladimir Ovcharenko, a Moscow businessman and scene-maker who bankrolled the gallery with Michel Litvak, who is based in Paris but keeps an apartment in Moscow. Mr. Kulik said he liked Mr. Ovcharenko -- "the man has taste" -- and would dread trying to find a new sponsor. "When your wife walks out on you, you can ultimately find a new one, but it wouldn't be the same," he explained.
Miss Sigalova owes her company's existence to her sole sponsor, Anis Investment Inc., a stock company. She said hers was "a miraculous situation, not typical at all." When a sponsor suddenly reneges, as happened to Mr. Panfilov, local authorities may be sympathetic and offer short-term aid, but often the only solution is to suspend activities and regroup when money becomes available.
It is possible to come very close to actual commercial success in the arts. While many of the older state drama theaters seem locked in stale repertory, leaden acting and a financial miasma that forces them to rent out their buildings, newer directors have scored popular successes on the model of Broadway and the West End. Roman Viktyuk, for instance, has had hits at several Moscow theaters, and last spring took his version of "Two for the Seesaw," starring the former ballerina Natalia Makarova, to her hometown, St. Petersburg.
Mr. Viktyuk's seasonal opening in late October at the Mossovet Theater in downtown Moscow was an event. The production was his biggest hit from last season, David Henry Hwang's "M. Butterfly." The staging is full of flashy disco dancing, doubles for the title figure and riveting performances by the two central characters (the Butterfly, Erik Kurmangaliyev from Tadzhikistan, even manages a very creditable falsetto rendition of Puccini's "Un bel di").
 
A Russian Hit-Maker
 Mr. Viktyuk said that although his tickets cost 10 to 20 times the Moscow norm (but less than $1.50 at the current exchange rate), he needed sponsorship to break even. Still, his lavish productions of modern and classic Russian plays and Western hits almost always seem to sell out, and he is seeking his own permanent theater.
His actors, he said, are paid eight times the going rate at the state theaters, which naturally assures him his pick of the lot. He stages eight productions a year, four in Moscow and four in the West, and is negotiating with Circle in the Square to take Miss Makarova to New York in the spring in Turgenev's "Month in the Country."
Even this aggressive and successful theatrical innovator has his problems, however. Russia's refusal to adhere to international copyright conventions means that affordable rights to Western shows -- like Edward Albee's "Lolita," which Mr. Viktyuk opened on Nov. 1 -- are not easily available. His solution is to go ahead and produce the shows without permission and then to hope that their success will persuade Western authors to sell him the rights inexpensively and retroactively. The director said Mr. Hwang -- "a generous, kind man" -- did just that.
"Nothing has changed," Mr. Viktyuk intoned theatrically. "The same trenches, the same forests, the same guerrillas. The previous Government banned all foreign plays. Today's ruling powers are trickier. They don't pay and so nobody can stage them."
 
The Popular Arts
Western Influence, Russian Tradition
 In the overtly popular arts, while most of the old dissident rock bands like Brigada S complain about an onslaught of trivial pop music, clubs are opening and records are being sold. "It's still a small scene," said Garik Sukachev, the lead singer of Brigada S. "We all know one another, and there is lots of overlap with theater and film." Mr. Sukachev has acted in six films.
Even in the film industry, which seems particularly depressed, the odd film does get made, and not just in Moscow: a detective thriller and a comedy were produced and shot in Perm last year, and international film festivals still show the occasional Russian film, even if those films may not be widely distributed at home.
The new wave of Russian films is no longer obsessed with gloom and angst: showing in Moscow right now is a film by Vladimir Khotinenko called "Patriotic Comedy." It stars Sergei Makovyetsky, the other principal in Mr. Viktyuk's "M. Butterfly," and it has been called "optimistic and life-affirming."
Some artists manage to do innovative work within the old state system. Mr. Bychkov, who runs the Theater for Youth in Voronezh, has devised a style that blends painterly references (he often designs his own sets) and modernist music to enlivening effect. His adaptation of a Chekhov short story, "Rotshield's Violin," which he brought to Moscow this fall, aptly recalls Chagall's art and such folk fables of Igor Stravinsky as "Les Noces" or "Renard."
 
Innovations Become Dogma
 Much Russian performing art seems still indebted to the Russian tradition -- shaped by pioneers like Stanislavsky and Meyerhold and then hammered into Soviet dogma -- of psychological verisimilitude and broadly emotional expressionism. Mr. Panfilov, who leads the modern-dance company in Perm, has made contact with Western dancers, above all at the summer American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C. He concedes openly that he is still finding his way, stylistically. Yet his work has a theatricality and an intensity that makes it very much part of the Russian tradition, for all its originality.
Russian tradition seems to fuel everyone from gallery owners to novelists to film makers to rock bands, which almost by definition ape Western models yet also struggle to retain some Russian identity in their lyrics and arrangements. It certainly fuels Russian folk groups, which Elvira Kunina, the director of the Russian Scientific and Methodical Folk Art Center, said were now being supported more generously than before, since Moscow no longer had to give equal time to the many ethnic cultures in the former Soviet republics.
 
Isolation's Amber
Soviet System Preserved a Past
 An inadvertent advantage of the political and economic isolation of the Soviet era was the artificial preservation of older forms of artistic organization and tradition. While critics in the West complain about a bland internationalization of film, ballet, concert life and operatic production styles, in Russia those arts have been maintained in sometimes splendid estate. What often looks dowdy can also seem preserved in a kind of innocent purity lost in the bustle of the modern Western world.
That is one reason even some of the grandest old state theaters can adapt successfully, as with the Kirov Opera, which toured to the Metropolitan Opera House this summer, along with the rather less well-received Kirov Ballet. Under the artistic direction of the conductor Valery Gergiyev, the Kirov Opera has infused historically important old productions with life, begun a needed revitalization of production styles and repertory and retained the loyalty of important singers and orchestral musicians. But its main value for the West is as an enlightened guardian of Russian operatic tradition.
 
A Penny Earned Is a Penny Kept
 Once a company like the Kirov catches on with the international press and public, it has little difficulty attracting Western sponsorship and recording and video contracts. Once it has those, it actually finds itself in a far better position than before, since hard currency earned abroad no longer has to be remitted to the central authorities.
Some arts leaders even suggest that the skimming off of top Russian artists by Western impresarios makes room for a talented younger generation that otherwise would either stagnate or be forced to emigrate. Given the depredations on Russian cultural life by the absence of so many great Russian artists, that seems close to wishful thinking.
In nearly every case, artistic distinction in Russia today -- or indeed accomplishment in any field -- can be traced to the talents and perseverance of one strong person. "You see that mess over there," said Mr. Gergiyev, pointing to a collapsed and abandoned construction site near the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. "It's been there for years. All it would take would be one call from the head of the post office across the street -- if he were strong -- and that would be cleaned up in three days."
What remains palpable, right alongside the despair of so many Russian artists and arts administrators and the placid pride of the provinces, is an undercurrent of innovation and excitement, an excitement that, said Mr. Viktyuk, has not yet been dampened by the AIDS epidemic.
 
An Unfortunate Precedent
 As in the country itself, rapid change has brought displacement and despair, but also the possibility of heretofore undreamed achievement. To the extent that such ferment recalls Berlin and the Weimar Republic between the wars, it can be a cause for concern, given how that renaissance came to its end in 1933.
But optimism persists, certainly as an official tenet among President Boris N. Yeltsin's appointees, but also among those who prize the novelties all around them.
"I have no choice," said Mr. Sidorov, the Minister of Culture, who in perhaps typically Russian fashion managed to introduce the gloom of mortality into a credo of hope. "Culture is optimism itself. It is always the last to die; it will die only with human beings. So one cannot possibly be pessimistic."

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Cuomo Remains Bench Jockey of New York Racing

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
Officials of the New York Racing Association testified yesterday before the Governor's Commission on Racing in the 21st Century and made three proposals: Reduce the state tax on bets, cut six weeks off the winter racing season and allow the race tracks to take over off-track betting.
The proposals came in response to a call from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who created the commission in an attempt to recast the structure of racing in the state. The Governor's chief target was the association, the private nonprofit organization that is empowered to run racing at Belmont Park, Aqueduct and Saratoga until the year 2000. 
 The Governor, during a news conference in Albany later in the day that was unrelated to the commission hearings, indicated that his earlier confrontations with N.Y.R.A. had not ended. He did not respond to the proposals, but in a sharp attack on executives of the association he said that data from his commission showed that combined annual salaries and bonuses on the N.Y.R.A. were way too high, with the highest being the $261,000 for Gerard J. McKeon, the president of the association.
"These are not salaries we can afford to pay," he said. "This is an absurdity, and it's going to change. A lot of us are in the wrong line of work."
 
Speaking of Salaries
 The governor himself draws a $130,000 salary, $30,000 of which he returns to the state. Hazel Dukes, president of the New York City Offtrack Betting Corporation, is paid $104,500 in salary.
Earlier this year, Cuomo demanded that the N.Y.R.A. come up with $50 million through a sale of land to help balance the state budget. Under threat of an investigation and special legislation, the racing board relented and produced the money.
McKeon and Allan R. Dragone, the chairman of the association's board of trustees, attended the hearing, which was held in the Manhattan office of the New York State Urban Development Corporation. They appeared before Vincent Tese, the state's director of economic development, and other members of Cuomo's commission.
"The state must rearrange its priorities," McKeon said. "It must put racing first. Since 1941, when parimutuel betting was made legal in New York State, you have overtaxed us. You have viewed us as a tax source."
McKeon outlined "three categories where we think the industry is in trouble."
"The first," he said, "is the institutional competition that is stifling the growth of racing: the six Offtrack Betting Corporations in the state that are marketing easy wagering. We think racing is a lot more than that. We propose to put OTB under the auspices of the race tracks, namely the N.Y.R.A."
The association's second proposal was to reduce the state's 17 percent "takeout" on bets.
"OTB even imposes a surcharge on bets," McKeon said. "Our takeout is the highest in the country. So we have difficulty attracting and retaining customers. New York will have to reduce its taxes on bets and give it to the players, the horsemen for purses and the tracks for capital improvement."
In the third major proposal, N.Y.R.A. called for an end to year-round racing.
"We operate perpetually," McKeon said. "The customer never gets a rest, and the quality of racing goes down in the winter. We suggest no racing from the beginning of January to the middle of February."

HEADLINE: Priorities, Priorities

 BODY:
Take a look at the list below. It includes only some of the promises President-elect Clinton made in his 13-month campaign. Many are sparklingly good and could, if carried out, make America a better, more productive country. But like politicians generally, he's offered something to everyone -- welfare mothers, high-tech entrepreneurs, chronically ill retirees -- and created frighteningly expensive expectations.
Mr. Clinton says he can institute his program while gradually cutting the deficit in half. It's a dubious proposition. Even if he could do that, he'd be reckless to try. By pushing too fast on too many fronts, Mr. Clinton would risk repeating Jimmy Carter's mortal error, drowning Congress in a sea of policies and insuring that he brings none to shore. 
 President-elect Clinton now needs to embrace priorities every bit as urgently as Candidate Clinton was quick to make promises. The task is to concentrate Congress's attention on the highest priorities and leave the rest for later.
Jobs and Investment. In the Presidential debate in St. Louis, Mr. Clinton said: ". . . my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated." He was right, then and now. The best way to jump-start the economy would be to accelerate his plan to invest $80 billion in infrastructure. Another way would be to pass a temporary tax credit for businesses willing to increase investment in plant and equipment. Accelerated spending and temporary tax cuts would be self-liquidating; Wall Street need not fear increasing long-term deficits.
Health Care. Responding to voter anxiety, Mr. Clinton put health care reform at the center of his campaign. His proposed answer -- managed competition -- is the best solution known for the dual challenge of too few people covered and too many billions spent.
Education and Training. What distinguished the Clinton program was its forward-looking emphasis on educating and training workers -- the surest ticket to vigorous growth. To fulfill this pledge, the President-elect could take the first steps toward apprenticeship training for non-college-bound students and on-the-job training for low-skilled workers.
Campaign Finance Reform. Mr. Clinton owes voters an overhaul of the political process, awash in corrupting campaign contributions, no matter what some wary advisers warn. The risks of disgusting the public outweigh the risks of irritating party leaders.
For all his promises, promises, if Mr. Clinton can advance these priorities he could rightly claim success, success.
 
PROMISES, PROMISES: BUT WHICH ONES?
Here are some Clinton campaign proposals that would have significant impact on the Federal budget.
 
Training and Education
 Impose a 1.5 percent payroll tax on large employers to finance training and education for low-skilled workers.
Increase Federal spending on education and training generally by $10 billion a year starting in 1993 and $20 billion a year by 1996.
Create a national service trust fund to give every American the right to borrow money for college
Guaranteed apprenticeships for half of all students not going to college.
 
Health Care
Create a new system of universal health care for all.
Extend Medicare to cover long-term care.
 
Infrastructure and Technology
 Inject $20 billion a year in transportation, communications and environment, to stimulate growth and to revitalize essential systems.
Create a civilian advanced technology agency.
Establish 170 manufacturing extension centers to help smaller businesses choose equipment and learn cutting-edge techniques.
 
Urban Development
Create 100 commnity development banks and 1000 micro-enterprise programs to help small businesses and revitalize communities.
Establish from 75 to 125 urban enterprise zones.
Increase community devlopment block grants.
 
Tax Cuts
Create a targeted investment tax credit.
Reduce personal income taxes for some number of middle Americans, costing $22 billion over four years.
Raise the earned income tax credit for the working poor.
Create tax incentives and credits for recycling and pollution reduction.
 
Crime
 Establish a Police Corps to train 10,000 new officers a year for ten years.
Help states create and operate boot camp prisons.
 
Social Policy
 Boost poor children by fully funding Head Start and the WIC health program
Make permanent the low-income housing tax credit.
 
International
Increase contributions to the World Bank.
Increase assistance to Russia.
Pay overdue U.S. dues to the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Why Increased Gasoline Prices Mean Inflation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Unfair Shots at a Fair Tax," your Oct. 13 endorsement of Ross Perot's proposed gasoline tax of 50 cents a gallon only proves once again that some of the American people, and you with them, have a 10-minute memory. 
 Your back issues for 1978 and 1979, when the country was faced with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gas crisis, will show you that gasoline soared from 79 cents to $1.40 a gallon and thereby caused the greatest period of inflation in the 20th century. It took the failed Presidency of Jimmy Carter, the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and also the Presidency of George Bush to bring inflation and interest rates down.
If you look at some of the prices of the 70's you will understand that the $10,000 Cadillac of 1978 now costs $35,000. Better yet, the 39-cent can of tuna fish now costs $1.39, and that translates into a 356 percent increase over 14 years.
Nothing in this country moves without transportation of some kind, and it is all dependent upon gasoline or other fossil fuels. Raising gasoline prices is the biggest cause of inflation because every product large or small contains 20 percent or more of built-in transportation costs.
Figure it out for yourself. Wouldn't you have to raise the price of your newspaper 20 percent to account for it in the final tally? Wouldn't that be inflationary?

HEADLINE: Why Increased Gasoline Prices Mean Inflation;
Urban Aid and Yachts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "An Urban Aid Bill That Doesn't" (editorial, Oct. 26): While I don't disagree that as a response to the events of last April in Los Angeles, H.R. 11, the "urban aid bill," falls short of what our urban areas need, I must take exception to your condemnation of "tax breaks for yacht buyers" in the bill. 
 Unfortunately, any tax bill introduced in Congress is subject to having many items added to the original intent of the bill. This is the way the system is set up.
I have worked in the boating industry for 14 years. The 10 percent excise (luxury) tax on pleasure boats priced above $100,000 has all but wiped out more than 30,000 direct manufacturing jobs and countless more indirect industry jobs, while adding to the Federal budget deficit. The excise or luxury tax on boats has been costing every taxpayer money for almost two years because it costs more to collect than it brings in.
Several times in our history it has been proved that luxury taxes do not hit their intended target, yet Congress made the mistake of trying them again during the drawn-out budget process in the fall of 1990.
The boating industry has been crippled by the luxury tax, with sales of boats in the affected price range down about 80 percent. Why anyone would want to do anything to interrupt or alter the economic process that takes place when a person buys a large boat is beyond me. Boating may be one of the best methods to distribute wealth ever devised. Jobs are created, and money passes from those that have it to spend to those that need it. Even after purchase, the process continues for as long as the person owns the boat.
The boating industry has put forth in H.R. 11 a method for the Government to collect the revenue that was supposed to come from the luxury tax: diesel fuel sold to the boating public would be subject to a 20.1 cent a gallon tax effective next Jan. 1.
In defense of Senator George Mitchell, if there are subsidies to shipbuilders in Maine contained in H.R. 11, they are not going to those who build boats affected by the luxury tax.

HEADLINE: Why Increased Gasoline Prices Mean Inflation;
Fairness to Donors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to "An Urban Aid Bill That Doesn't" (editorial, Oct. 26), the President should approve, not veto, the tax law Congress has passed. You overlook many positive features. 
 The new law would reverse the harmful measure in the 1986 tax law that denies charitable donors their full deduction on gifts of appreciated property. Such gifts transfer private assets to public benefit and represent a true loss for the donor. When universities, museums, hospitals and other not-for-profit organizations serving the public interest depend on increased private gifts to balance their budgets, this sensible reform should be approved.
The bill would also restore the access, lost in 1986, of independent universities to tax-exempt bond financing. Public universities continue to enjoy this help; private institutions should too. The new facilities and renovations it makes possible represent a fruitful and cost-effective investment for the public.
Further, if the bill is not signed into law, beneficiaries under expired provisions of the current law would suffer tax increases. For example, employees who receive tuition benefits would have to pay taxes on them. What could be more counterproductive than asking an employee who goes to school after work to pay more taxes solely because his or her employer is paying the tuition for that instruction?
While we too would like to see larger and more focused efforts on urban enterprise zones in the bill, we see no reason not to start with the first wave of overdue relief. This legislation is not a "budget buster," as you suggest, but revenue neutral: provisions decreasing Federal revenues by $27 billion over the next five years are paid for by compensating measures to replace the forgone revenues.
The need for the new law in its present form is urgent. It should be signed now.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: The Republicans;
Looking to the Future, Party Sifts Through Past

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
There is something theological to the process now beginning in the Republican Party, as all the factions begin addressing the question that will drive dozens of conferences and political fights in the months ahead: What are the doctrinal foundations of Republicanism beyond Bush and Reagan?
Any Republican who watched the defection of working women, suburbanites, young people, moderates, Reagan Democrats and independents last Tuesday felt something more than simple queasiness. 
 The quest to redefine the Republican Party will play out in a variety of ways: It will be the subtext for the election of the next chairman of the Republican National Committee, a vote that will be held in January. It will be brewing when Republican Governors meet in Wisconsin this weekend, and it will be the backdrop for all the early maneuvering for 1996.
The debate begins with the question of why President Bush lost. Did he lose simply because the economy was bad and his campaign lackluster (the minimalist explanation), or because Republicanism itself had fallen out of sync with the times? Did he lose because he had broken with conservative dogma, or because he had been co-opted by it?
 
Conservatives' Reasoning
 Some conservatives contend that Bill Clinton's victory last Tuesday was in many ways testimony to the enduring strength of conservatism; he won, they assert, as the candidate of welfare reform and economic growth, breaking with the old "tax-and-spend" image of his party's past and recalling traditional values like hard work and personal responsibility. Ronald Reagan was similarly accused by the Democrats of appropriating their populism in the 1980's.
At the same time, these conservatives say, Mr. Bush muted his ideology by breaking his "no new taxes" pledge with the budget agreement of 1990. They assert that the promise was both bad politics and bad policy.
Losing its advantage as the party of lower taxes and economic growth was simply more than the Republicans could take, they say, particularly when its strength on foreign policy was less and less important to an electorate focused on domestic needs. "The core of the Republican Party always has been, and always will be, a limited-government, low-tax, economic-conservatism message," said David Keene, a conservative political consultant.
 
Broader Problems Are Seen
 But there are many in the party who contend that the problems go deeper. The social agenda of the religious right, these analysts assert, has simply gained too much prominence in the party, particularly on abortion. The "family values" appeal simply became too rough, too exclusionary, too out of step with the middle-of-the-road suburban voters who were an important part of the Reagan coalition, they argue.
"The ultimate betrayal of George Bush by the right-wing extremists is that they now blame him for his defeat because he wasn't conservative enough," said Peter Smith, the former Congressman from Vermont who heads the Ripon Society, a group of moderate Republicans. "Whereas in fact, the record shows the country finally got a look at them in the Republican convention and the country turned its back on them."
Even before the election, many Republicans urged the party to soften its stance on abortion; the 1992 platform recommitted the party to a constitutional amendment outlawing it. Those pleas are likely to escalate in the months ahead. "We need to bring the 'big tent' back on abortion," said Jim Pinkerton, a leading young theoretician in the party, alluding to the effort by Lee Atwater to signal tolerance ofo differing views on the issue.
But the Christian Coalition and other groups on the religious right assert that these issues were not the source of Mr. Bush's defeat. "The pro-life plank of the Republican Party platform was identical to the platform Ronald Reagan ran on in 1984 and George Bush ran on in 1988," said Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition. "What did change was that in '84 and '88 we had a robust economy that was producing jobs and in '92 we did not."
Mr. Reed also says that a poll conducted for his group after the election showed that evangelical Christians and those who oppose legalized abortion delivered their votes to Mr. Bush. "If everybody else had delivered their votes the way we delivered ours, George Bush would be getting measured for a tuxedo right now," he said.
 
Weld to Work for Moderation
 Mr. Reed said that evangelicals do not "seek to rule at the exclusion of any other group or wing," but many Republicans are carefully watching the religious right's activities at the grass roots. Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a supporter of abortion rights who is often mentioned as a potential Presidential contender in 1996, spoke of those efforts last week.
"I think there is the likelihood the fundamentalist movement is so well organized that it can capture the machinery of the party," Mr. Weld said. "I'm going to do what I can to make sure that's not the only machinery represented at the '96 convention."
Some Republicans argue that the party badly needs a new set of "social issues" that will unite rather than divide. One possibility: the set of ideas spun off most notably by the Jack F. Kemp wing of the party. This is an effort to articulate a new post-Reagan domestic policy, one that Mr. Pinkerton, whose ideas were only fitfully embraced by the Bush Administration, describes as "the new paradigm."
Its philosophy emphasizes "empowering" the poor through programs like tenant ownership of public housing; establishing enterprise zones and tax incentives for investment in the inner cities, and providing more "individual choice" to citizens through measures such as education vouchers that could be used in public or religious schools.
The job of party rebuilding, of course, is not confined to intellectuals. Now that the Republicans no longer have the ultimate bully pulpit, much of the party's message will have to be carried and framed by Republicans on Capitol Hill like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader.
 
Governors' Post-Mortem
 The governors will conduct their own post-election post-mortem Saturday to Tuesday at a conference at Lake Geneva, Wis. "I see the governors playing a very large role," said Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina. "We're the people who can bring forward some ideas, some solutions to problems."
Also ahead is the selection of a new chairman for the Republican National Committee, which will be done at its meeting Jan. 28 and 29 in St. Louis. This race is just beginning, but among the many names talked about in Republican circles are Pete du Pont, the former Governor of Delaware; Haley Barbour, a longtime Mississippi strategist; Charles Black, a former senior adviser to the Bush campaign; Lynn Martin, the Secretary of Labor; Vin Weber, the retiring Congressman from Minnesota; Spence Abraham, the co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, and Howard Callaway, a party official.
The passions in the Republican Party these days are summed up by two memorandums circulating. One, from the departing Republican National Committee chairman, Richard N. Bond, to the members of the committee, announces that he will not seek re-election and takes note of Mr. du Pont, accusing him of "absolute political treachery" by "campaigning for the R.N.C. chairmanship several weeks before Election Day."
A spokesman for Mr. du Pont said tonight that the former Governor had not been campaigning for the chairmanship in recent weeks but merely talking about the future of the party.
The other memo, signed by the chairman of the Texas State Republican Party, Fred Meyer, and five other R.N.C. members, mostly from the South, asserts that it is time for the national committee to get back to basics and emphasize "building the Republican Party at the precinct, county and state levels so that many more Republicans can be elected to Congress, to state government offices and to local government."
"We've become too big and too bureaucratic," the letter declares. "Our strategic decisions have too often rested not on what makes the most political sense, but on what makes the most dollars and cents for favored vendors and consultants."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the future of the Republican Party misstated conservatives' views on President Bush's pledge of "no new taxes." They contend that breaking that pledge by joining a budget agreement in 1990 was bad politics and bad policy, not that the promise itself was.

Citibank Alters Account Fee Rules

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citibank revamped its price list for consumer accounts at its New York branches yesterday to require larger deposits to qualify for free checking. But customers will be given incentives to use the bank to buy securities, which will be counted toward minimum balances required for free checking.
The adjustments, effective Jan. 1, come as Citibank is battling Chemical Bank for the leading position in the New York consumer market. In eschewing a price war in the battle for consumers, Citibank will require higher balances than Chemical for free checking. 
 The new prices also come as Citibank is fending off inroads from securities firms and mutual fund companies. With deposit interest rates at 20-year lows, stocks, bonds and mutual funds have become increasingly attractive to bank customers seeking higher yields on their funds.
 
First With Link
 Citibank has been the most active bank in the city in selling securities, and part of yesterday's changes make it the first to link the price of its checking and savings accounts to newer investment products it offers.
"Research shows that people would prefer to invest with their bank rather than a securities broker," said Les Dinkin, a managing principal at NBW Consulting, a New York adviser to banks. "By giving consumers an incentive to buy securities through the bank, Citibank is moving in a new direction where many other banks will follow."
Citibank will count the securities bought and held by the bank toward the minimum balances required for free checking. Citibank is planning to increase the 185 branch workers who are now licensed to sell securities at its 216 branches.
Pamela P. Flaherty, a Citibank executive in charge of its branch businesses in the Eastern United States, said the changes would result in higher fees for about 20 percent, or 300,000, of Citibank's 1.5 million New York-area customers.
About half of those affected can avoid higher fees by consolidating small accounts at Citibank into their checking accounts, Ms. Flaherty said. But even if customers continue to avoid checking fees, the changes can be costly by requiring them to hold more money in checking accounts that do not earn interest, or in other low-interest deposits.
To avoid a monthly change of $9.50 for checking and an additional charge of 35 cents a check (raised from 25 cents effective Jan. 1) a customer must keep $2,000 in a checking account, $6,000 in all accounts, or $20,000 in combined balances and securities. Previously, Citibank offered free checking to customers with $3,000 in combined accounts.
 
Some Fees Unchanged
 Citibank's "budget" checking account will be unchanged, with a monthly fee of $4, six free checks a month and a 75-cent charge for each additional check. Miscellaneous fees, like those for bounced checks and wire transfers, are not part of the changes announced yesterday.
To avoid fees on checking accounts that pay interest, customers must have an average checking balance of $5,000, combined accounts of $10,000, or $20,000 in balances and securities. Previously, interest-bearing checking accounts were free with $5,000 in combined accounts.
Citibank has never tried to be the lowest-priced bank in the New York area and has relied on its services and convenience to maintain a leading position. Lately, however, competition has grown tougher, and Citibank's share of consumer deposits in New york has fallen to 11.7 percent, from 14.7 percent a year ago, while Chemical Bank has increased to 15.3 percent from 13.9 percent.

Using Spin to Power Electric Cars

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
When General Motors introduces its battery-powered Impact in the middle of this decade, the electric automobile will be powered by a souped-up version of a conventional lead-acid battery. But even though G.M. believes this energy source can make the Impact a viable alternative to gasoline-powered cars, the auto maker concedes that the lead-acid battery may not be the long-term answer for electric vehicles.
California has given G.M. and the other auto makers a powerful incentive to develop practical electric cars by requiring the companies to insure that 2 percent of their vehicles have zero emissions by 1998. The auto industry's principal focus is on improving the conventional battery, which has a limited power storage in relation to its weight and takes several hours to recharge. 
 Yet even as some scientists and engineers are rethinking the way energy is stored in electric vehicles, others are updating the ancient concept of a mechanical whirling dervish: the flywheel.
 
Testing New Materials
 Small groups of university and national laboratory researchers, along with a start-up company in Bellevue, Wash., hope that a flywheel built of new materials will be able to store enough energy to make practical the long-sought ideal of an electric car with a range and acceleration competitive with conventional cars.
"Technically, nothing holds us back today," says Richard F. Post, a researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., who is seeking industrial partners to build a flywheel system. "The materials and the design principles are available. What holds us back? There is a huge battery industry but there is no flywheel industry."
The principle of the flywheel is based on kinetic energy, which is the energy of a moving object. Because a flywheel has a heavy rim, once a force sets it spinning, the wheel tends to keep spinning -- a property that makes a flywheel a reservoir of energy. As power is added, the flywheel speeds up; as energy is drawn off in the form of useful work and wasted friction, it gradually slows.
A potter's wheel, propelled by the occasional spin of its axle by the potter's foot, is a time-tested version of the flywheel. And most combustion engines, including auto engines, use flywheels to convert the jerky motion of the engine's exploding cylinders into a smooth and continuous source of power for the drive train.
The concept of using flywheels to power electric vehicles has been around for decades. Buses in Switzerland were powered by giant steel flywheels 40 years ago, but the buses had to be recharged at each stop. Today, flywheel enthusiasts say, advances in technology and materials make the idea more feasible.
In theory, a flywheel for producing electricity for an electric car would be made of extremely strong composite materials that could spin up to 200,000 revolutions a minute without breaking apart, and would be mounted on special bearings to reduce the friction-caused slowing to a negligible amount. At such speeds even a lightweight flywheel is capable of storing enough energy and producing enough power to run an electric car.
The flywheel's energy would be tapped through electromagnetic means. Magnets spinning on the flywheel would be placed so they passed near coils of wire in a battery housing. This would induce an electric current in the coils. The power would be sent to an electric motor that would drive the axle.
American Flywheel Systems Inc., the Bellevue, Wash., company that received patents last June for its flywheel design, contends its device could power an electric car for 300 to 600 miles on each charge compared with the current 100 miles per charge for G.M.'s Impact.
The company says its device could produce 60 to 90 watt-hours a pound. The battery in the Impact stores 12 to 15 watt-hours a pound, which is only enough energy to keep a night light burning about two hours.
By plugging into a standard household electrical outlet, the flywheel could be "spun up," or recharged, overnight -- or as fast as 15 minutes at a special high-powered "flywheel filling station." Proponents say the cost of the electricity would be competitive with that of gasoline.
 
Other Projects
 Flywheel research is also being conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Uniq Mobility, a Denver company, is working on a flywheel that would be integrated with an extremely dense motor to form a hybrid vehicle for urban driving. Ray A. Geddes, Uniq's chairman, says Ford, BMW and Fiat have expressed interest.
But flywheel technology still faces many hurdles set by nature and public confidence. The American Flywheel Systems design has yet to be turned into a prototype, and skeptics say that until one is working, the device is just another unproved idea.
The Energy Department has joined Ford Motor, G.M. and Chrysler in the United States Advanced Battery Consortium. John R. Wallace, the chairman of the consortium and the director of Ford's electric vehicles program, said the consortium had not ruled out sponsoring flywheel research. But he acknowledged that the consortium was concentrating on improving conventional batteries.
One concern about flywheels is that the rapidly spinning large wheel, like a gyroscope, would have an inertia of its own. A driver might turn a corner, but the car's flywheel would want to proceed straight ahead.
A second hurdle, which flywheel designers say they have already overcome, is the possibility that the extremely high speeds would cause the flywheel to break apart, sending shrapnel-like pieces in all directions.
 
Benefits Are Foreseen
 Should the current bugs be ironed out, flywheels have advantages that make them attractive, at least to theorists. They can produce great acceleration, eight times the horsepower per pound of a V-8 engine. And a concept called regenerative braking would allow energy to be recaptured as the vehicle decelerates instead of being dissipated as heat.
Even better, the flywheel could conceivably last for 200,000 miles or more and is nontoxic, while the lead- acid battery in the Impact must be replaced every two years.
Based on some of Dr. Post's original concepts, Jack G. Bitterly, an aerospace scientist, and his son Steven set to work on flywheels. In 1990, they founded American Flywheel Systems. Mr. Bitterly, a former engineer with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, created balancing techniques for high-velocity spinning masses used in developing the space shuttle. He envisioned three main flywheel developments.
The first was to increase the structural integrity of the flywheel's rim, which is reinforced with carbon-composite fibers, through a special filament winding technique. He then developed spoke-like connectors that could expand with the rim at high speeds and still provide overall stability. The third idea was an efficient means of spinning the rim to store energy and of extracting useful power while slowing it down.
The Bitterlys built the rims and tested them to destruction. They discovered that when a flywheel made of composite fibers broke apart, it produced a fluff of "cotton candy" material rather than the high-velocity shrapnel that steel flywheels produced when they disintegrated.
 
Seeking Support
 Edward W. Furia, the president of American Flywheel and a former official of the Environmental Protection Agency, has found some backing from a Dutch bank and is also seeking support from auto makers and the Federal Government.
He is seeking $10 million to build a prototype, which he says can be ready in 12 months, with a production model to follow in another 12 months. He said economies of scale achieved by mass production would bring the price of the flywheel device near to that of a gasoline engine.
"It's the nature of innovation that when a new technology is proposed, there is always institutional inertia," Mr. Furia said. "It's a knee-jerk reaction to say it won't work."

Kinetic energy, or the energy of a moving object, is the principle behind the flywheel battery, proposed as a power source for electric cars. As the wheels rotate, magnets placed on the spoke tubes produce current that provides power to the electric automobile motor.

HEADLINE: State Protection in Insurance Failures Put to Test

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Although 47 states have now approved a plan to resolve the biggest American life insurance company failure in history, New York State officials are threatening to reject it, saying it treats consumers unfairly.
The dispute raises a host of questions not only about the savings and insurance of 700,000 customers of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of Newark, but also about the promise of a state-run system designed to protect consumers when life insurers fail. 
 In the 1980's, life insurance companies became part of the financial services industry, competing aggressively for consumers' dollars with assurances to make money grow fast. While life insurers could not promise that consumers' savings would be protected by the Federal Government if a company failed, as could banks, they pointed to a state guarantee fund system. If a life insurance company failed, other life insurance companies would chip in money so no customers would lose their savings or benefits.
Now, 16 months after Mutual Benefit failed, that system of protection is being put to the test.
In July 1991, New Jersey took over the management of Mutual Benefit and froze its assets. If the state had chosen to liquidate the company, the company's assets would have been worth 55 cents on the dollar and guarantee funds would have had to make up the difference for many, but not all, customers.
But New Jersey decided to rehabilitate the company, avoiding immediate payouts by state guarantee funds and, if successful, letting customers' savings return to their full value over time, although death benefits would be paid promptly.
The rehabilitation plan, which is subject to approval by all states in which the company has policyholders, drastically disappoints consumers who had put their faith in the guarantee system, New York State officials have argued. The plan promises most customers access to their savings seven years after approval and possibly after a 12-year wait. And the plan promises interest on their investments of only 3.5 percent.
In New York, where more than 70,000 Mutual Benefit customers live, Insurance Commissioner Salvatore R. Curiale was so disturbed in recent weeks by the settlement terms that he began intense negotiations with industry representatives and threatened to reject the plan. The negotiations could result in a settlement as early as this week.
If New York does not participate in the plan, New York customers would receive 55 cents for every dollar of their savings at Mutual Benefit and the New York guarantee fund would be obligated to make up the rest, experts say. But New York customers in 401(k) employee savings plans would probably get no protection from the New York guarantee fund because those savings are generally not covered by such funds.
Although Mutual Benefit's new managers say they could pay off New York policyholders and still go ahead with the plan in other states, experts say a rejection could prompt other states to follow New York's lead, and cause the plan to unravel. In any case, a decision by New York officials not to take part would probably cause years of litigation.
In New Jersey, an organized group of New Jersey customers with annuities are outraged that it is the customers, not the insurance industry, whose money will be tied up while Mutual Benefit's management waits for its deeply troubled real estate investments to rebound.
"The industry can't have it both ways," said Robert Hunter, the president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization in Alexandria, Va., and a bitter critic of the industry. "You can't say to people, 'Don't worry, we have a guarantee association, everything is going to be fine,' and then produce this sort of result."
The retirement savings of people like Josephine Davis, the personnel director at Wallkill Hospital in Franklin, N.J., are bound up in Mutual Benefit annuities. Sometime in the next few years, Ms. Davis says, she hopes to retire and had planned to take out her money in one lump sum as she had always been told her contract allowed. Now, she worries about when she will be able to go ahead with plans for life after she leaves work.
"People my age want the security that they have always depended on," Ms. Davis said. "It's your money and you can't do anything with it. They are telling you what to do with it. And who is going to fight this? It is like fighting city hall."
But spokesmen for the industry and officials who worked out the plan say they have salvaged the best possible solution from what they regard as the industry's Chernobyl.
 
Death Benefits Safe
 Despite the fact that an unprecedented 63 percent of Mutual Benefit's assets are in real estate -- at a time of a desperately depressed market -- they point out that the rehabilitation plan at least guarantees that all death benefits will be paid out.
In addition, all people who retire will receive some retirement payments, although they will not be able to take out all of their savings for 10 years. And people facing emergencies will have access to their savings.
Another victory for consumers, they say, involves tens of thousands of customers whose money was invested in Mutual through 401(k) plans and guaranteed investment contracts, or G.I.C.'s, that the guarantee funds in most states did not even cover. Pension funds and corporations often buy G.I.C.'s to invest retirement money of employees.
In the case of Mutual Benefit, other large life insurance companies, including Prudential and Metropolitan Life, have agreed to guarantee that people with money in those programs will receive retirement payments and will have full access to their funds after seven years as well.
"It is the story of the dancing bear: it is not that the bear dances badly, it is that the bear dances at all," said Victor H. Palmieri, who was appointed last year as chief executive of Mutual Benefit and is the plan's deputy rehabilitator.
 
Tiffany of Industry
 "The lack of liquidity of the company was so massive and the real estate market was so immobilized that you could not expect to liquidate this company for years," he added. "We had to assure death benefits and retirement benefits. What else could we do?"
Mutual Benefit, founded in 1845, was one of the nation's old-line life insurance companies, known as the Tiffany of the industry until it abandoned its conservative traditions in the late 1970's and 80's.
Like many major companies, Mutual Benefit began to sell its insurance and pension products as investment vehicles in direct competition with banks and brokers.
Mutual Benefit doubled its assets. But to pay out high-interest-paying annuities and investment products, it invested more than $5 billion in the nation's real estate markets as well as in leveraged buyout deals. After the real estate market tumbled, and worried customers began to withdraw their cash, the State of New Jersey took over the company.
Under the guarantee system, customers of a failed insurance company are protected by the guarantee fund that exists in the state where the customer lives. Each state's guarantee fund laws are different, but all money paid out by a fund is immediately charged to all insurers who do business in that state.
 
Plan Needs Court Approval
 Thus, when an insurer like Mutual Benefit fails, the insurance commissioner in the state where the company has its headquarters must get approval from states all across the country and general agreement from the industry at large.
In August 1992, Insurance Commissioner Samuel F. Fortunato of New Jersey, Mr. Palmieri, representatives of the state guarantee funds and of other major insurance companies reached agreement on a plan to rehabilitate Mutual Benefit. That plan must still be approved by a superior court in New Jersey, which has scheduled a hearing for January.
New York, where residents made up 16.8 percent of Mutual Benefit's clientele, or $1.4 billion in liabilities, has argued that the plan is not fair to consumers.
Although no one at the department was willing to comment on negotiations, one person familiar with the discussions said that New York officials were particularly disturbed by the length of the moratorium. If the plan is approved by the New Jersey courts in January and is extended to its full length of 12 years, Mutual Benefit customers may wind up waiting nearly 14 years after the state takeover to get their money.
New York officials are also said to be troubled by the minimum guarantee of 3.5 percent interest, over years when interest rates and inflation could make that amount devastating to policyholders.
Since insurance companies benefit from the sense of security the guarantee fund system provides when they make their sales, the department has argued that insurance companies should agree to provide customers with higher rates of return or a shorter waiting period. During the negotiations, the New York commissioner said he wanted customers to have access to their money in two to three years.
Michael Trofino, a tax accountant in Holmdel, N.J., who has formed a group that has reached out to more than 5,000 Mutual Benefit customers in the state, said that the group planned to petition the court in New Jersey to argue that individual consumers were treated unfairly.
"We should have gotten paid off immediately, and the New Jersey guarantee association, if there was a shortfall, should have made it up," Mr. Trofino said. "Let them sit on the real estate for seven years if they are positive this is going to turn around."
While expressing sympathy for policyholders, a representative of one company that had a major role in developing the plan, Neil Jasey, vice president and associate general counsel of Prudential Insurance, said the industry was going far beyond what state laws require by extending guarantees to 401(k) and other customers.
Mr. Palmieri, the deputy rehabilitator, added that if other companies were asked to pay out large sums now, the price would be paid by the stockholders and the policyholders of other companies, many of which have their own real estate and investment problems.
"It just depends on how far you want to socialize the costs of this thing," Mr. Palmieri said.
The experience in New Jersey, state regulators say, is likely to give ammunition to critics in Congress. Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, has called for a greater Federal role in insurance regulation but the prospects for such initiatives are unclear. "The states say we are taking care of everything, don't worry," Mr. Dingell said in a recent interview about the Mutual Benefit case. "We are increasingly apprehensive that they don't have that capability."
