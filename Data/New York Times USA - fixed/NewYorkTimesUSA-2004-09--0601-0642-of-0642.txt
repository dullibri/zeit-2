HEADLINE: Iraqi Judge Closes Case Against Ahmad Chalabi

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; An Iraqi employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Mosul for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
A senior Iraqi judge said Monday that he had closed a case brought against Ahmad Chalabi, the former exile leader once backed by the Pentagon, for suspected involvement in a counterfeiting operation. 
 The judge, Zuhair al-Maliky, said in a telephone interview that he decided about a week and a half ago that ''the evidence was not enough to bring the case to trial.'' If more evidence emerges, he said, the case will be reopened.
 The move appears to be a minor victory by Mr. Chalabi over the interim government led by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, a longtime rival of Mr. Chalabi's. The government announced the counterfeiting charge against Mr. Chalabi in August, while he was on vacation at a summer home in Iran. At the time, it appeared to many that the charge was a move by Mr. Allawi to dissuade him from re-entering the country. 
 But Mr. Chalabi did return to Iraq and proceeded to denounce the government, meeting with reporters to proclaim his innocence and vow to return to political life. He aligned himself with Shiite religious leaders here, recasting himself as a champion of Shiite rights.
 It was the latest twist in Mr. Chalabi's fortunes since he returned to Iraq in the spring of 2003 after decades in exile. Once favored by the Bush administration to be Iraq's first leader after Saddam Hussein's fall, he has spent the last few months fighting for his political future.
 American and Iraqi forces raided his house here in May on suspicion that he had leaked secrets to Iran. His fortunes sank further when the Americans anointed Dr. Allawi as interim prime minister. Soon afterward, Judge Maliky issued arrest warrants for Mr. Chalabi in the counterfeiting case and for his nephew, Salem Chalabi, in a murder case.
 At the time, Salem Chalabi was the head of the special Iraqi tribunal set up to try Mr. Hussein and his associates, putting him in a potentially powerful position to command public support. He has accused Judge Maliky and Dr. Allawi of using the charges to dismiss him just five months into his three-year term and win control of the tribunal; Dr. Allawi has said he resigned. 
 Judge Maliky said Monday that the murder investigation, in the killing of a Finance Ministry official involved in an investigation of the Chalabi family's business dealings, was still in force against Salem Chalabi. 
 A seemingly unrelenting string of car bombings continued Monday, when seven Iraqi national guardsmen were killed by a suicide car bomber who rammed into their convoy in the northern city of Mosul, health officials in the city said. Eight people were wounded. 
 In Baghdad, the American military carried out airstrikes on Sunday night and early Monday against residents of Sadr City, the vast and impoverished Shiite district in northeastern Baghdad. The area is home to the Mahdi Army, the militia led by the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr. The overnight strikes killed at least six people and wounded at least 46 others, said Qasim Saddam, director of Chewadir Hospital. A Mahdi Army official said all the people in the hospital were civilians because ''we do not admit our casualties into hospitals fearing they might be arrested by the Americans.''
 The American military released a statement on Monday evening that disputed the reports of civilian casualties. ''Early indications are that injuries to a large group of people as a result of this engagement did not occur as is being reported,'' it said, adding that officers had begun an internal investigation ''to determine the full set of facts on this matter.''
 Late Monday night, an AC-130 gunship and other aircraft fired into the streets of Sadr City, and loud explosions could be heard for miles. One witness said soldiers in armored vehicles had formed a perimeter along some of the outer streets. 
 Two soldiers with the First Infantry Division died near the town of Balad on Tuesday, one in an automobile accident and the other in an ambush while riding in a patrol that was returning from the scene of the accident, the American military said.
 The military also said it was charging two First Cavalry Division soldiers, Staff Sgt. Johnny Horne Jr. and Staff Sgt. Cardenas Alban, with murder. The military said the Army's criminal investigation division was still looking into the accusations and declined to give details. The soldiers are in Company C, First Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment.
 Last Wednesday, the military said it was charging two other soldiers from the same unit with murder. The latest murder charges are unrelated to the ones brought last week, the military said Monday. On Saturday, the military said it had sentenced a soldier from the First Infantry Division to 25 years in prison for the death of a member of the Iraqi National Guard in May. In that case, the soldier, Specialist Federico Merida, pleaded guilty to murder.
 Also on Monday, an Egyptian telecommunications worker and two Iraqi engineers kidnapped in Iraq last week were released, Reuters reported, citing Al Jazeera television. Egyptian officials in Baghdad said five more Egyptian hostages would be freed, but did not indicate when. 
 The Iranian Embassy in Baghdad said Monday that an Iranian consul taken hostage last month had been freed, The Associated Press reported.

Iraq Pays I.M.F. $81 Million
 WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (Reuters) -- Iraq cleared about $81 million in debt it owed the International Monetary Fund late last week, fund sources said Monday, opening the way for new aid to flow from the global lender to Iraq. They said the fund's board was expected to approve $800 million in financing for Iraq under a program for nations beset by conflict. The aid typically comes with less stringent economic policy terms than regular programs.

HEADLINE: Iraq's Gloom Overshadows Yearly Meeting Of Blair's Party

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: BRIGHTON, England, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
The annual conference of the Labor Party of Prime Minister Tony Blair opened here on Monday under the pall of the war in Iraq as the fate of a British hostage, Ken Bigley, remained uncertain, and family members and British Muslims made new appeals for his release.
 Mr. Blair had hoped to use the Labor gathering at this seaside resort on Britain's south coast as the platform from which to lead the party into a record-setting third term when elections are called as early as next May. He had hoped to shift the national debate away from the war and onto domestic goals for education, national health care and jobs. 
 But 11 days of hostage coverage -- now centered on Mr. Bigley after the two American colleagues kidnapped with him were killed -- has proved politically corrosive for Mr. Blair and his party. 
 Even the Conservative Party opposition leader, Michael Howard, observed in a BBC interview last week, ''I feel for Mr. Blair.'' 
 Tory-leaning newspapers, however, were less sympathetic.
 Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Matthew d'Ancona pointed out that ''for the third successive year, the war and the resentments it has sown will curl through the conference chamber like the smell of cordite.'' 
 The commentary added that while most Britons believe that Mr. Blair cannot surrender to the demands of kidnappers, Mr. Bigley's plight nevertheless highlights a deepening sense of national discontent.
 ''When they see Mr. Bigley, bowed, broken and lost, they see a British civilian who -- in their eyes -- has paid a terrible price for the prime minister's'' alliance with President Bush, it said.
 Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer and the Labor Party politician most likely to succeed Mr. Blair, opened his speech to the party assembly on Monday with a sober acknowledgment that British politics is still in the thrall of Iraq. Mr. Blair is scheduled to speak Tuesday.
 ''The thoughts of everyone at this conference are with Ken Bigley and all his brave family,'' Mr. Brown said. He extolled Labor's achievements during his seven years as chancellor, a record he hopes will propel him into Mr. Blair's job if they can ever come to an agreement on when Mr. Blair will step aside. 
 The present thinking in the party leadership is that Mr. Blair will lead Labor into a third term, but it is far less clear whether he would serve a full term or step down in favor of his long persevering partner, Mr. Brown. Once a strong ideological alliance of soul mates, the relationship has frayed over policy and staff rivalries and the critical question of succession.
 In his speech to the conference, Mr. Brown also struck a more independent posture toward the United States -- something Mr. Blair too often avoids, his critics say -- when he faulted America for lacking ''social justice.'' 
 Mr. Brown said he admired America for ''its enterprise,'' but with ''45 million without health insurance, great economic success is not matched by great social justice,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Kerry Pins Hopes in Iowa on Big Vote From Absentees

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
They're off and voting in Iowa, even before all the corn has been harvested.
 In the state's 20 most populous counties, which account for about 60 percent of the vote, more than 140,345 absentee ballots had been applied for as of last Wednesday, according to a survey of county auditors by The Des Moines Register. Under Iowa law, anyone can request an absentee ballot, no questions asked, and roughly three times as many Democrats as Republicans did so in the counties studied by The Register. Early voting began on Thursday, 40 days before Election Day.
 Which is one reason Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat, is optimistic about John Kerry's chances of carrying the state. Four years ago, Al Gore was outvoted at the polls; his entire 4,144-vote margin of victory in Iowa was from absentee voters. 
 If he is to win, Mr. Kerry can ill afford to lose states that Mr. Gore won, like Iowa and Wisconsin, two Midwestern battlegrounds.
 Most polls show President Bush with a small advantage here (a Mason-Dixon survey, reported last week, had him up, 48 percent to 42 percent, with a margin of error of four percentage points), and both parties are still pressing hard. 
 On Thursday, John Edwards, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, spoke in Cedar Rapids in close-fought eastern Iowa, and two surrogates for Mr. Bush spoke in the same area last week, his wife, Laura Bush on Friday in Eldridge and Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, on Saturday in Davenport. 
 ''At the end of the day, it's a very simple thing -- Iraq,'' Mr. Edwards said, perhaps mindful of Iowa's long tradition of supporting antiwar politicians. ''George Bush made this mess, and he can't fix it.''
 Mr. Vilsack said in an interview at the Governor's Mansion that that was the right approach -- ''a nice, tight strategy, with the candidates focusing on Iraq and their message reinforced by television ads and the daily pounding of the news from Iraq'' -- because ''everyone knows what a disaster Iraq is.'' 
 Unlike the case with many other ranking Democrats, he argued that Mr. Kerry's timing was perfect.
 ''This campaign is like one of those classic John Elway games,'' the governor said. ''The team with the ball at the end of the game wins. You can't surge too early, or you give the ball back, and you can't do that with Karl Rove and George Bush. They're too sharp. If you give them the ball back, they'll go down the field and score.''
 Normally, Iowa's seven electoral votes are not enough to attract the candidates' attention. This state's usual time in the political spotlight comes at the beginning of the campaign year, in midwinter, not toward the end.
 Once the caucuses, Iowa's version of a primary, are completed in January, the state falls off the political map. But this is no normal year, and even small packets of electoral votes are very precious.
 ''It feels like ground zero here, and it has felt like that for nine months,'' said Kenneth M. Quinn, a retired diplomat who is president of the World Food Prize Foundation, based in Des Moines. ''Both parties are clearly putting an enormous premium on the state, with a visit from someone or other almost every day and an endless barrage of TV ads. It's only seven electoral votes, but it could well be the decisive seven.''
 Mr. Kerry won the caucuses this year after Howard Dean faltered and Representative Richard A. Gephardt's broad labor support proved insufficient to carry him to victory. So Mr. Kerry is well known to Iowa's electorate, perhaps as well known as Mr. Bush.
 But Dennis J. Goldford, an associate professor in the politics and international relations department at Drake University, said the Democrat had ''run a remarkably incoherent campaign, which raises grave doubts about his ability to mount a comeback.'' 
 As for Mr. Kerry's emphasis on Iraq, Iowans are dovish enough, Professor Goldford said, but in the polls taken to date, ''Kerry doesn't get the support of all the people here who think Iraq is a mess.''
 ''To oust an incumbent,'' he added, ''you have to make the point that he has created a mess. But you also have to show that you have the ideas and the gravitas to clean it up, and so far Kerry hasn't done that.''
 David Yepsen, longtime political expert for The Register, said he sensed another problem for Mr. Kerry, rural voters. Mr. Bush has been gaining support in the countryside, Mr. Yepsen said, ''because there's a cultural disconnect between the chainsaw gang and the windsurfer,'' meaning Mr. Kerry, on religious issues, as well as social ones.
 The number of farm families is declining precipitously, even in Iowa, but the number of rural voters, some retired and some with jobs in the city, remains highly significant.
 So the Democrats' efforts to promote absentee voting could be crucial to Mr. Kerry. For months, they have been sending young canvassers door to door to interview people who otherwise might not vote. They have been searching, Mr. Vilsack said, for potential voters who have children serving in Iraq or who have lost jobs or feel trapped on an economic treadmill or who are worried about the mounting cost of health care.
 ''There are tens of thousands of people like that,'' the governor continued. ''When the interviewer finds them, he encourages them to apply for an absentee ballot, helps them if they need help and punches their names and their concerns into a Palm Pilot. Then at the end of the day he transmits the information back to our database.''
 Phyllis Peters, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state, said that as of Thursday, 199,593 absentee ballots had been applied for through the 99 counties.
 No one doubts the efficiency of the operation. Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa City Republican who described the presidential outlook here as ''murky, fractionally favoring the president,'' said the Democrats' absentee effort was ''the one thing that gives Kerry a better chance than the polls give him.'' 
 The Iowa Democratic Party, Mr. Leach said, ''has now become the single best organized political party in the entire country.''
 The question is whether the Democrats will actually succeed in attracting voters to the polls who otherwise would have stayed at home, thus increasing their overall total, or whether they are simply churning the same pool of voters, persuading people to vote absentee who would otherwise have showed up to vote.
 Some Republicans speculate that the Democrats want to lock up as many of their votes as possible before the televised debates begin on Thursday, in the event that Mr. Kerry does not do well against Mr. Bush. 
 One reason Mr. Gore may have run better among absentee voters, Mr. Vilsack speculated, was that most of them did not witness what were widely considered lackluster showings by the vice president in that year's debates.
 David Roederer, the Bush chairman in Iowa, asserted that the absentee campaign ''won't mean a thing'' in the end.
 ''If you vote them early, you can't vote them late, because you only have so many supporters,'' Mr. Roederer said, expressing doubt that the Democrats could encourage many new voters signed up. ''We're concentrating on Election Day, and we'll beat them there.
 ''If they get 40,000 more absentees, it won't be decisive. If the spread goes up to 100,000, of course, that would be a different story.''

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Prices Hit a Record, and Shares Decline Broadly

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as oil prices climbed to a record, spurring concern that rising energy costs will hamper earnings growth. The Dow Jones industrial average closed below 10,000 for the first time in six weeks.
 The Dow average lost 58.70 points, or 0.6 percent, to 9,988.54. The Nasdaq composite index declined 19.60 points, or 1 percent, to 1,859.88. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 6.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,103.52, its lowest close this month. 
 The S.&P. 500 has declined 3.3 percent this quarter amid a 34 percent jump in oil prices. Oil rose yesterday on concern that rebel attacks in Nigeria will reduce production and that United States refiners will have to struggle to replenish supplies disrupted by Hurricane Ivan. Crude oil for November delivery gained 1.6 percent to $49.64 a barrel in New York after earlier climbing to a record $49.74.
 Airlines, including Delta, dropped on concern that higher jet fuel prices will add to the industry's losses. Delta Air Lines, the nation's third-largest carrier, declined 32 cents to $2.94. Its 9.8 percent drop was the biggest in the S.&P. 500. Continental Airlines, the No. 5 United States airline, slid 47 cents to $8.30. 
 JetBlue Airways declined $1.31 to $20.56, AirTran Holdings lost 55 cents to $9.73 and Frontier Airlines slipped 22 cents to $7.35. Jamie Baker, a J.P. Morgan Chase & Company analyst, lowered his rating on the three low-fare airlines to underweight from neutral. Their cost advantage could erode as airlines operating under bankruptcy protection negotiate a reduction in employee salaries and benefits, Mr. Baker said in a report.
 The Amex Airline Index retreated 4 percent for its steepest loss since July 21. 
 United Technologies, which makes the Pratt & Whitney jet engines, and the 3M Company, the maker of Scotch tape, contributed the most to the decline in the Dow average. United Technologies slipped 87 cents to $91.27, while 3M lost 99 cents to $77.69.
 The St. Paul Travelers Companies, the insurer, dropped $1.59 to $32.73. Policy sales are lower than the company had predicted as price competition increases, the company's chief executive, Jay S. Fishman, said.
 Shares of the Allstate Corporation, the second-largest home insurer in Florida, lost 84 cents to $47.41. Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., another property insurer, lost $1.35 to $61.75. Hurricane Jeanne, which slammed into Florida's coast over the weekend, is expected to caused billions in insured damages in addition to those from three other hurricanes that have hit the Southeast in the past seven weeks.
 Semiconductor shares declined after Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the industry to ''in-line'' from ''attractive,'' citing a sharp deceleration in revenue growth and weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings forecasts.
 Texas Instruments Inc., the maker of chips for mobile phones, slipped 55 cents to $21.14. The Broadcom Corporation, a maker of microchips for computer networks, declined 75 cents to $27.03.
 Shares of homebuilders rose as a government report showed that sales of new homes rose 9.4 percent in August to an annual rate of 1.184 million. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey expected a 1.155 million annual rate.
 KB Home, the No. 7 homebuilder by market value, added $2.02 to $85.54. Its 2.4 percent gain was the second-biggest in the S.&P. 500. Hovnanian Enterprises, the largest homebuilder in New Jersey, advanced 80 cents to $41.35.
 Almost two stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.26 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 10 percent less than this year's daily average.
 Treasury securities rose on speculation that a surge in oil prices may curb economic growth more than the Federal Reserve expects, leading to a slower pace of increases in the central bank's benchmark interest rate next year. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32 to 102 4/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.99 percent, from 4.03 percent on Friday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.567	99.014	High Rate	1.710	1.950	Investment Rate	1.741	1.997	Low Rate	1.680	1.845	Median Rate	1.700	1.940	Total applied for	$43,695,911	$35,506,652	Accepted	$25,715,999	$23,227,372	Noncompetitive	$1,481.049	$1,085,824	

Both issues are dated Sept. 30, 2004. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 30, 2004 and the six-month bills mature on March 31, 2005.

HEADLINE: Victim of Domestic Abuse Gets City Job Back

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
A State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan has ruled that a woman who said she was unfairly fired from her job as a probation officer with the City Department of Correction must be reinstated. The decision came in the first case using a city law passed in 2000 that protects domestic violence victims from discrimination at work.
 Although the department ''may not have intentionally acted in bad faith'' in firing the employee, the result was ''exactly the kind of fallout'' that the law was intended to prevent, Justice Louis B. York wrote in his decision, which lawyers received on Monday.
 The woman, Gina Reynolds, had been on extended sick leave and living at Safe Horizon, a shelter from domestic violence, in June 2002, when she was fired. Ms. Reynolds and her lawyer contend that the department dismissed her for not giving a valid home address. 
 A department spokesman declined to comment and said that the commissioner had not reviewed the case.
 Workers from the Correction Department's Health Management Division routinely visit officers on sick leave at home, to make sure that employees are, in fact, ill. Ms. Reynolds had given officials the address for Safe Horizon's headquarters, not the shelter where she was staying.
 A health division inspector who went to the headquarters would not sign a confidentiality agreement, so Safe Horizon officials would not tell the inspector where Ms. Reynolds was staying, Ms. Reynolds said.
 Ms. Reynolds said that when she was asked to turn in her badge, department officials gave her no reason. But a letter rejecting Ms. Reynolds's request for unemployment benefits said that she had been fired for violating sick leave rules.
 ''They knew what was going on,'' Ms. Reynolds said. ''They knew I had a domestic problem and I was looking for a place to live.''
 Ms. Reynolds's lawyer, Mercedes M. Maldonado, said the problem could have easily been prevented had Correction officials made an exception to their home visit policy.
 ''This is a classic case of a bureaucratic rule,'' Ms. Maldonado said. ''Nobody was able to bend that rule.''
 Laurel W. Eisner, a lawyer who helped write the part of the city human rights law that includes domestic violence, said she was thrilled at the decision and the precedent it set.
 ''It's extremely important they are using this law,'' said Ms. Eisner, now executive director of Sanctuary for Families, which provides shelter and legal services. ''There is so much shame coming forward telling employers. For domestic violence victims, economic independence is essential and that's what this was meant to protect.''
 Ms. Reynolds's struggle with the Department of Correction began in March 2002, when she and her two teenage children were evicted from their apartment in Far Rockaway, Queens. She received vacation time so that she could find a place to live, but instead had to spend two months at friends' homes and hotels or in shelter and her car.
 ''I was really scared,'' Ms. Reynolds said. ''I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I was going through this whole thing not knowing what would happen anywhere.''
 When Ms. Reynolds initially told department officials she could not give them a home address, they told her she could not continue to work without one. Eventually, she gave them her ex-husband's address. But when she went to his home, he would abuse her and she would then call the police, she said.
 ''I kept telling them that,'' Ms. Reynolds said, referring to her bosses. ''But nobody wanted to talk about something like this.''
 Ms. Reynolds, who began working for the department in June 2002, had a record of excessive tardiness and absenteeism, which, Justice York noted in the decision, could have been a byproduct of domestic violence. Under the judge's ruling, Ms. Reynolds will receive full back pay.

HEADLINE: Agency decides to break into the New York market after years of trying -- and failing -- to buy into it.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AFTER years of seeking to acquire an agency in New York to get a foothold in the biggest, most challenging advertising market in America, Cramer-Krasselt has decided, in effect, that if you can't buy 'em, start 'em.
 Cramer-Krasselt, one of the largest independent agencies, has long sought a New York outpost to add to its offices in Chicago, the headquarters; Milwaukee; Orlando, Fla.; and Phoenix. Peter G. Krivkovich, the president and chief executive, has had on-and-off discussions with several agencies, with the goal of using an acquisition as the nucleus of a New York operation.
 Now, having determined there is little worth buying -- or available at an attractive price -- Mr. Krivkovich is starting a New York office, effective this week. And to mitigate the risks in coming into New York as an outsider, he is hiring two executives with extensive experience in the market, Larry Hampel and Dean Stefanides, to lead the office, which is being named Cramer-Krasselt/Hampel Stefanides. 
 ''I've been looking and looking and I finally decided, the heck with it,'' said Mr. Krivkovich, who is expected to announce the opening of the office today. ''We'll hire our way in,'' he added, ''as we've done in other markets'' like Orlando and Phoenix.
 New York offers Cramer-Krasselt a better chance of landing accounts from marketers based in the East and New England, Mr. Krivkovich said, as part of its goal to reach $1 billion in billings ''in the next three or four years,'' with the New York office contributing ''over $100 million in a year to a year and a half.''
 Current billings are $524 million, Mr. Krivkovich said, from clients like AirTran Airways, Corona beer, Heinz, Hyatt Hotels, Master Lock, ServiceMaster and Ski-Doo. He said that he expected the total to reach ''close to $600 million'' by year's end.
 One fast way for Cramer-Krasselt to grow would be to assume the creative account of Kia Motors America, part of the Hyundai Motor Company, which has billings estimated at $260 million to $270 million. Cramer-Krasselt is one of four finalists in a review for the Kia assignment along with the incumbent, David and Goliath in Los Angeles; GSD&M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group; and Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, part of the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network division of MDC Partners. A decision is expected in November.
 Although Cramer-Krasselt/Hampel Stefanides is opening without clients, Mr. Krivkovich said he expected to hire a dozen or so employees in the next two weeks to four weeks to work with Mr. Hampel and Mr. Stefanides.
 Cramer-Krasselt is the nation's fourth-largest independent agency, according to the trade publication Advertising Age, with revenue last year estimated at $79.1 million. The rankings showed Doner in Southfield, Mich., at $122.7 million; the Richards Group in Dallas at $114.5 million; and RPA, formerly Rubin Postaer & Associates, in Santa Monica, Calif., at $92.6 million. Cramer-Krasselt will become the largest independent with an outpost in New York.
 ''We saw this as an opportunity to join the hottest agency in the United States that nobody in New York has heard of,'' said Mr. Hampel, referring to account gains by Cramer-Krasselt in the last year that include Cellular South, with billings estimated at $12 million; the GNC retail chain, with billings estimated at $20 million; and Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits, also with billings estimated at $20 million.
 Mr. Hampel, 45, and Mr. Stefanides, 48, will serve as the executive creative directors of Cramer-Krasselt/Hampel Stefanides. They are moving from Tucker Hampel Stefanides & Partners in New York, where they had held similar posts since February 2003.
 Mr. Hampel, a copywriter, and Mr. Stefanides, an art director, worked as a creative team at Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York from 1986 to 1993, then left to open an agency as the New York outpost of a Boston agency, Houston, Effler & Partners. Houston, Effler, Hampel & Stefanides became Hampel/Stefanides in 1996 and was acquired by the Envoy Communications Group in Toronto two years later.
 Early last year, Envoy closed Hampel/Stefanides as part of measures to cut costs, then subsequently went out of business. During Envoy's financial woes, Mr. Stefanides said, Cramer-Krasselt ''was a potential suitor'' for Hampel/Stefanides, and although a deal could not be worked out, ''we kept in touch.''
 After Hampel/Stefanides was closed, Mr. Hampel and Mr. Stefanides joined the Tucker Partnership, which became Tucker Hampel Stefanides & Partners. William Tucker, the chief executive, said yesterday that with the departures of the two executives, the agency would revert to the Tucker Partnership name.
 The opening of the New York office is the second expansion in the city in a year for Cramer-Krasselt. Last September, the agency acquired a New York public relations shop, Nichol & Company, which became the New York office of CKPR, the Cramer-Krasselt public relations division. Cramer-Krasselt/Hampel Stefanides will, for now, share space with the CKPR New York office, at 245 Fifth Avenue at 28th Street.
 As for further expansion, Mr. Krivkovich said he wanted to open offices on the West Coast, in either Los Angeles or San Francisco, then London, ''and after that, who knows?''
 ''It's taken me a long time to get here,'' Mr. Krivkovich, 57, said, smiling. ''I look at all this and wish I was 10 years younger.''

HEADLINE: A Bad August Worsens Airline Financial Woes 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The nation's airlines are seeing their hopes of a decent fall season blow away like a lawn chair on an Orlando patio. Record oil prices, on top of four hurricanes in six weeks that snarled traffic in the all-important Florida market, and a seemingly unending stream of bad financial news are prompting trade groups and analysts to predict that industry losses will approach $5 billion this year.
 That would extend a series of losses that began in 2000 and was amplified by the terrorist attacks of September 2001, reaching $30 billion by the end of 2003. And it is further bad news for an industry that once expected that 2004 could be a break-even year. 
 ''It's sobering to look out at the tarmac and realize that almost every aircraft that takes off is losing money,'' said Kevin P. Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy group for corporate travel departments and business travelers.
 The International Air Transport Association predicted on Monday that airlines worldwide would lose $4 billion in 2004, the bulk of that accounted for by United States carriers. 
 August financial results for the domestic airlines, reported last week, dashed enthusiasm that a strong end to the summer might help the airlines ride out the autumn, which is customarily one of the weaker periods of the year. 
 While passenger loads rose 7.4 percent, the amount of money that the airlines collected for each ticket fell, after flattening out earlier in the year.
 In the past, the airlines have counted on August business to help them get through the cooler months, when planes are not so full. 
 But this year, price pressure has not let up. On Monday, American Airlines rescinded most of the increases of $5 to $10 a ticket it imposed late last week, citing ''competitive reasons.'' It had hoped to recoup some of the extra $1 billion it is spending on fuel in 2004, in the face of fuel prices up more than 40 percent, but it could not get all its competitors to go along. 
 The inability to raise fares has created a conundrum for the airlines.
 ''We're carrying more people, but they're not paying as much, and it's more expensive to carry them because of fuel prices,'' said John P. Heimlich, chief economist with the Air Transport Association, the domestic industry trade group.
 The dismal picture worries analysts, who say that the economy is otherwise strong, suggesting that the airlines are missing an opportunity to take advantage of the business cycle.
 ''Disappointing is perhaps the best way to put it,'' said Phillip A. Baggaley, the airline industry analyst with Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating agency. ''They're not pulling out of this quite as well as they had hoped.''
 That does not mean that the airlines are giving up on fall or winter, for that matter. Since midsummer they have been offering deals on autumn fares, and have accelerated the offers in recent days.
 Southwest Airlines, which began its fall fare sale in July, last week extended the deals through Jan. 14, with prices as low as $39 one way between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Also last week, JetBlue Airways began offering a promotion allowing a paying passenger to take a companion along free from Washington to three California cities. 
 Robert W. Mann, Jr., an industry consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y., said JetBlue, Southwest and other airlines would have to divert customers' attention, at least in the short term, from Florida and other warm-weather destinations on what he called the ''hurricane superhighway.'' 
 That is a blow to the airlines' plans to expand southbound during fall and winter. JetBlue advertises Florida as ''the sixth borough'' of New York, given its 21 flights a day to Fort Lauderdale alone from Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports; it began flying from LaGuardia on Sept. 17.
 But, Mr. Mann said, ''nobody wants to look at broken palm trees.''
 JetBlue will introduce a new service from New York to Phoenix on Friday, which it announced before the storms began. Even so, it has warned analysts that its third-quarter results will be hurt by the hurricane-induced interruptions to its Florida routes.
 On Monday, Jamie Baker, airline analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase, lowered his recommendations on JetBlue and two other low-fare carriers, AirTran and Frontier, to underperform from neutral, sending the share prices tumbling. Mr. Baker predicts that the major domestic airlines will lose $4.5 billion this year.
 The situation is perhaps most troublesome for corporate travel managers, who are about to sign 2005 contracts with the airlines. Mr. Mitchell of the Business Travel Coalition said the managers would be considering a series of fundamental questions as they decide whether to sign new agreements, many of them to run for two years.
 The questions, Mr. Mitchell said, include, ''Will they continue to meet the needs of my passengers'' when flights are being trimmed and cities eliminated from company route maps? And ''Will they be there?'' -- meaning survive down the road, he said.

HEADLINE: A Peach . . . No, a Honey Of a Farmers' Market

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis. 

 BODY:
ON Saturday, Sept. 30, 1972, 11 produce vendors set up shop in a street near Wisconsin's majestic white granite capitol. Customers quickly exhausted their meager stocks. A week later 85 fruit and vegetable sellers turned up, their stalls filling much of Capitol Square, to be mobbed by several thousand eager consumers.
 Such were the modest beginnings of the Dane County Farmers' Market, now recognized as the largest in the nation by the North American Farmers' Direct Marketing Association, and still growing. This year, as the harvest in this fertile state neared a climax on Sept. 18, more than 20,000 people made their way from stall to colorful stall, from tomatoes to bison to apples to cheese, in an almost uninterrupted river of humanity. Counterclockwise along the sidewalks beneath the imposing dome they walked, towing wagons, pushing baby carriages and lugging bulging canvas or paper bags.
 This is a farmers' market for farmers, run by the farmers themselves. 
 Everything sold must be grown in Wisconsin, and the sellers must actually have participated in the production of the goods. On this glorious late-summer day, with the sky a soaring canopy of robin's-egg blue, more than 300 farmers from 30-odd counties came to town, many of them driving through the night to get here by 6 a.m. (By comparison the Union Square Greenmarket in New York has only about 70 farmers in peak season, but it is part of a network of 47 such markets in 33 locations in the city.)
 The last of summer's bounty was mingled on the stands with fall fruits and the first tender root crops of winter. The growers said it had been a wet summer, bad for tomatoes, but you couldn't tell from those offered by Thomas M. Eugster of Old Stage Vegetable Gardens in Brooklyn, Wis., south of Madison. The tiny yellow Sungolds and the scarlet Goliaths, big as softballs, could not possibly have been sweeter.
 ''Look at them,'' said a shopper to his wife. ''With those gigantic T's you could make a BLT without any B or L.''
 I walked around with my wife, Betsey, accompanied part of the time by Odessa Piper, the chef and proprietor of L'Etoile, a prize-winning restaurant on the square. A Midwestern Alice Waters, she introduced us to some of the farmers whose produce she uses in her kitchen, like Anne Topham of Fantome Farm in Ridgeway, who makes a delectably creamy fresh French-style goat cheese; the Weston family, who grow more than 100 antique apple varieties on 16 acres near New Berlin, including hard-to-find English delights like Cox's Orange Pippin and Pitmaston Pineapple, as well as Esopus Spitzenberg, Thomas Jefferson's favorite; and Chuck and Jenny Anderson of Artesian Trout Farm, whose fish, raised in pure, icy water, have a much firmer texture than those reared in warmer water, which tends to make the trout sluggish and flabby.
 Much of the produce was organic, and nearly all the vendors, Wisconsin being Wisconsin, were friendly, obliging people, a pleasure to talk with.
 On one stand onions were carefully labeled with their varietal names, like Burgermeister and Stuttgarter. On another, a photographer's Kodachrome dream, were piles of peppers hot and sweet, round and elongated, red, yellow, green and orange. At a third Ms. Piper lovingly rolled a spectacular purple cauliflower in her hand and pointed out a head of broccoli romanesco whose mass of pale-green spirals resembled coral. ''Broccoli on acid,'' she called it.
 Terry Romeo of Oxford had three enormous, fleshy, multilobed mushrooms on his table, each the size of a serving platter. He finds them growing on oak tree roots every two or three years, he said, always in the first three weeks of September. ''We call them cauliflower mushrooms,'' he said, ''$20 each.'' Ms. Piper bought one.
 Great tubs of cosmos and sunflowers stood behind the fruits and vegetables, and at the dozen or so stands run by Hmong families, members of mountain tribes who settled in Wisconsin (and neighboring Minnesota) after the Vietnam War, fruits and vegetables were so scrubbed, carefully trimmed and artistically displayed, they might have been taken for flowers.
 The Hmong farmers displayed bitter melons, pea sprouts, squash leaves, holy basil, little Thai eggplants and gnarled purple eggplants shaped like a witch's hand. One Hmong woman showed me some sword-shaped leaves and asked me what they were; she said a friend had given the seeds to her mother without identifying them.
 Thanks to years covering Southeast Asian wars, I was able to identify them as convolvulus, or water spinach, a vegetable much appreciated in the region.
 We started the day, not long after dawn, at the cafe that occupies the ground floor of Ms. Piper's restaurant. She bustled in a few minutes after 7, uncharacteristically late, shirtsleeves rolled, light-brown hair pulled back by a scarf serving as a headband. With my coffee I was eating one of the house's flaky, delectable breakfast rolls, flavored with vanilla, coriander, allspice, clove and plenty of cinnamon. Ms. Piper told us she called them spice girls rather than spice swirls because she often puts a song by the British pop group of that name on the stereo to fire herself up in the morning.
 ''I have to work hard to keep my concepts from getting too cluttered,'' she said, ''especially this time of the year, when there is so much good produce.''
 Ms. Piper, who started L'Etoile 28 years ago, comes naturally to her love of natural ingredients. She left high school in Hanover, N.H., a year early to live on a commune, gardening, cooking and preserving food starting at the age of 17, then moving to Wisconsin to live and work on an organic farm. Largely self-taught, she admits to harboring a certain suspicion of cooking schools, describing herself unconvincingly as ''an idiot savant'' in the kitchen.
 Her culinary hero, she said as she pored over a list of items to buy at the market that morning, is Michel Bras, whose Michelin three-star restaurant outside Laguoile on the windswept Aubrac plateau in south-central France features spit-roasted local beef and ''forgotten vegetables'' on a glass plate decorated with herbs and flowers.
 After checking the list, she slipped it onto a clipboard and handed it to Nina Camic, a wiry, Polish-born law professor at the University of Wisconsin who moonlights as the restaurant's ''forager'' or farmers' market purchasing agent, filling a little red wagon as she works the stalls. 
 The farmers are credited twice on the restaurant's menu, in the description of the dishes on the front and in an honor roll of producers on the back. Other local eating places have emulated Ms. Piper's farm-to-market-to-table style, including Lombardino's, for generations a straightforward red-sauce Italian restaurant, but now, under new ownership, a showcase for local produce like tomatoes, fennel and leeks.
 A dazzling array of vegetables appear in L'Etoile's first courses at this time of the year, in a ''sampler'' of burstingly ripe heirloom tomatoes, including red Ping-Pong, orange Flame, Green Zebra, yellow Mattina and brownish Black Prince, all from Rink Da Vee's Shooting Star Farm near Mineral Point, and a salad of mostly wild funghi, including shiitakes, trumpets, cremini, oyster mushrooms and lobster mushrooms.
 The menu's vegetarian slot was filled by a crunchy, deep-fried polenta fritter, given a flavor supercharge by sweet corn from Heck's Market in Arena.
 Betsey flipped over her chicken breast with Napa cabbage, both from JenEhr Family Farm in Sun Prairie, which puts its poultry out to pasture. ''Great skin, delicious meat,'' she said. ''Real chicken flavor, which is rare in the United States.'' 
 One of our dinner guests, Iowa-born Sam Brown, ordered a pork chop, cut from Berkshire hogs that had been raised on grass by Tony and Sue Renger near Loganville, then brined for three days by L'Etoile's chef de cuisine, Tory Miller, a protege of the New York chef Bill Telepan. The chop was served with potato pancakes, Gravenstein apple rings and spicy pork jus.
 ''The best pork I've ever tasted,'' Mr. Brown commented happily.
 Me, I was too busy eating to talk, devouring a rib of grass-fed, dry-aged longhorn Highland beef from Fountain Prairie Farm in Fall River, which was edged by an incredibly flavorful (if dietetically dubious) ring of old-fashioned ivory-colored fat. I got through most of the mashed potatoes with blue cheese compound butter, too.
 SO why Wisconsin? An early, well-developed environmental movement for one thing. A liberal political environment favoring economic cooperatives. And the soil itself, especially in the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin. The glaciers that covered surrounding zones did not touch this one, which is blanketed with well-drained alluvial soil. Because it was an important lead-mining center, the federal government prohibited agriculture in the region until the 1840's, when it was settled by European immigrants with farming traditions.
 New growers come into the market every year, and the 2004 rookie of the year, Ms. Piper told us, is one of her waitresses, Kristen Kordet, who grows tomatoes, Chioggia beets and rainbow chard with dazzlingly colored veins and stems.
 Many stalls have been fixtures for years, however, like those that specialize in that most typical of Wisconsin products, cheese. Swimming upstream against the tides of mass production, dozens of Wisconsin farmers and farm wives produce superb artisan cheeses in the European tradition, such as Fantome's chevre, Hook's sharp 10-year-old cheddar and Bleu Mont Dairy's firm, tome-shaped wheels reminiscent of the cheeses of Switzerland, where the family of the proprietor, Willi Lehner, originated.
 But the king of this particular mountain is Richard deWilde of the all-organic Harmony Valley Farms near the pretty town of Viroqua, who loads a 20-foot truck every Friday night and leaves for Madison at 2:30 Saturday morning, arriving about 5:30. On a beautiful day, he might sell $6,000 worth of vegetables or more, but cold, rainy weather cuts that in half, he said, ''and the food pantry'' -- a charity -- ''loves us.''
 A bearded, keen-eyed, third-generation farmer whose grandfather was a buddy of J. I. Rodale, the pioneer organic farmer and publisher, Mr. deWilde grew up in South Dakota. He and his partner, Linda Halley, farm 90 acres planted in more than 60 kinds of vegetables with the help of their two sons and a number of hired hands. The farmers' market, he said, is his ''show window,'' which has made the operation's name in the region and has enabled him to sell to restaurants in Madison, Chicago and Minneapolis, and also to run a Community Supported Agriculture plan, in which 450 local households pay for weekly delivery of three-quarter bushel boxes of assorted produce.
 Harmony Valley Farms has even broken into big-time mainstream commerce. Mr. deWilde sells several cool-climate specialties -- burdock, celeriac, daikon and three kinds of turnips -- to Albert's Organics, a wholesaler in Bridgeport, N.J., and a broader range of vegetables to 18 Whole Food supermarkets in the Chicago area.
 ''Some of my friends at the farmers' market complain about that,'' he said, ''but they help to keep me going. They pay on time, and above market price.''

HEADLINE: Engineers Studying Vanderbilt (Amy, Not the Commodore)

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Not too long ago, in the stories of John Cheever or maybe television's ''Bewitched,'' the business meal seemed easy. Everyone knew the rules, and spontaneity had its time and its place.
 Today, long after the era of Darrin Stephens, the business lunch can be vexing. A global economy and a tight job market can make anyone worry about where to put the knife and the fork at the end of the meal. 
 Yesterday, 30 or so engineering students from Cooper Union gathered to find out about handshakes, cutlery and thank you notes at an etiquette seminar disguised as a cocktail hour and business lunch. Cooper Union has held such a seminar for its graduating seniors for six years.
 The students were steeling themselves for job interviews that begin in earnest next week. Armored in coats and ties, blouses and dresses, they convened at the National Arts Club, the Victorian-style mansion next to Gramercy Park, to be scared polite.
 Two business consultants lobbed etiquette hand grenades at the undergraduates, who laughed nervously.
 ''When do you start talking business?'' asked one, James Edwards, who is with the Madison Consulting Group. ''During the appetizers, the entree, or dessert?''
 A shy young woman ventured, entree? Wrong, said Mr. Edwards, wait until dessert. (But if the potential employer wants to talk over appetizers, notice the cue and talk, he said.)
 Michael Yurchak, the other consultant, said, ''The purpose of the dinner is not to eat, but to do business.'' 
 For many students at Cooper Union, more than a third of whom come from immigrant families, what passes for American social graces can seem baffling. 
 Min Kuo, 21, of Parsippany, N.J., majors in chemical engineering and plans to apply to ExxonMobil or Merck. Born in Taiwan, she asked no questions, written or oral, throughout the two-hour seminar.
 ''This is my first exposure to all this,'' said Ms. Kuo, giggling. ''I guess I have a lot to work on.''
 Jeffrey Bernstein, 22, of Yonkers, majors in civil engineering and hopes to apply to Parsons Brinkerhoff or the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He asked a lot of questions.
 When ordering a special kosher meal, he asked, is it proper etiquette to transfer the food from the plastic tray to the china plate? (Yes, it is.)
 What was the most surprising thing Mr. Bernstein learned at the seminar?
 That's easy, he said. At the end of the meal, position your knife and fork at the 5 o'clock position, fork tines (the pointy part) down.
 Why do that? Mr. Bernstein smiled and looked helpless.
 Mr. Edwards passed by and offered the correct answer: to signal the waiter to take your plate.

HEADLINE: Oil Passes $50, Then Pulls Back; Analysts Expect Market to Seek New Level

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Oil prices, which have been rising for the last two years, briefly broke through the $50-a-barrel mark on Tuesday, reaching a new milestone, as some analysts warned that there is nothing to stop them from going higher.
 But crude oil for November delivery slipped back late in the day on the New York Mercantile Exchange and settled at $49.90, up 26 cents. Earlier in the session, the futures contract rose as high as $50.47 a barrel, setting another record. Oil prices, up nearly 55 percent this year, have doubled in two years. 
 Fueling the run-up recently is an exceptional alignment of events: record demand, extremely low spare capacity and potentially destabilizing events in important oil-producing nations including Iraq, Russia, Venezuela and Nigeria.
 ''The market is looking for a new equilibrium point and no one knows where that will be,'' said Jamal Qureshi, an analyst at PFC Energy, an oil consultant based in Washington. ''We still have a way to go. I wouldn't be surprised to see $60 a barrel.''
 This week, the market has been roiled by demands from a rebel group in Nigeria to halt oil production. [A Nigerian government military spokesman, quoted by The Associated Press on Tuesday, called the threats ''empty.'' Major oil companies played the warnings down, and in Washington, the State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said the United States was in close contact with Nigeria and with American companies that operate there.
 [''We've made clear to the Nigerian authorities they have a responsibility to keep the peace in that area,'' Mr. Boucher said, ''for the sake of the people as well as for the safety of American citizens and property.''] 
 The oil market is also dealing with losses from Hurricane Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico, a region that accounts for one-fourth of domestic oil production. Output was down nearly one-third from levels before the storm. 
 At the same time, the demand for oil is running at a pace not seen since 1978. The world is expected to consume nearly one billion more barrels of oil this year than last year, led by strong and sustained demand from China, India and the United States.
 Saudi Arabia, the world's leading producer, responded again on Tuesday with a pledge that it would increase its production capacity to 11 million barrels a day. The Saudis are currently pumping 9.5 million barrels daily. 
 Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, had mentioned the increase in capacity earlier this month while meeting with fellow OPEC ministers in Vienna. ''The kingdom is ready and capable of making up for production shortfall occurring anywhere in the world,'' Mr. Naimi was quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency as saying on Monday.
 This is the second time that oil prices have reached record highs in recent weeks. On Aug. 20, crude oil futures touched $49.40 but within days fell back to around $43 a barrel. 
 Still, Eric Bolling, an independent oil trader on the New York Mercantile Exchange, cited the confluence of negative events and questioned whether the outcome would again be moderate. ''There's underlying strength to $50 this time,'' Mr. Bolling said. ''A lot of things have happened since $40.''
 To make up for the loss of more than 11 million barrels so far from the Gulf of Mexico, oil companies in the United States have been drawing on their supplies, now near 29-year lows. That, in turn, leaves less oil to refine into gasoline or into heating oil to meet winter demand.
 ''I'm going to wait till the market gives me a signal we've reached a ceiling'' before betting that oil contract prices will fall, Mr. Bolling said. ''We're not there yet.'' 
 Since most oil producers are pumping all out to meet demand, there is little spare capacity left in the system. High prices, analysts said, reflect that there is no substitute for any interruptions in production.
 OPEC's spare capacity -- idle production that can be brought on when needed -- has sunk to around one million to 1.5 million barrels a day from about 15 million barrels in the mid-1980's. 
 ''The market is much tighter today than it's been since 1973,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''Unlike 1973, 1979 or 1990, the market today is going through a demand shock, not a political shock. Also, the market is not thinking long term. It's thinking day to day.''
 There has been no lack of news to keep market participants attentive. Last month, traders were concerned that the fighting in Iraq would intensify and hurt oil exports there. The continuing tussle between the Russian government and Yukos, the country's top oil producer, has kept the markets on edge. Before that, bombings in Saudi Arabia reminded traders that the country, which holds a quarter of the world's known oil reserves, is a terrorist target.
 ''What's unnerving the markets is that significant disruptions could come from a number of sources,'' said Steve Turner, an oil analyst with Commerzbank. ''It's possible that prices could go substantially higher, given the right set of circumstances.'' 
 Even the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cannot do much more to bring down prices. The group's 11 members, which account for roughly a third of the world's oil production, are already pumping about 30 million barrels a day, the highest output in a quarter-century.
 And the latest Saudi statement on increasing capacity may not have much of an impact either, analysts said, since most of the additional crude oil would be of a heavy type that is less favored by refiners. 
 Still, with the Qatif field nearing production, Saudi Arabian light crude oil, prized because it is well suited for gasoline refining, is expected to increase by 500,000 barrels a day. ''That should help on the margins,'' Mr. Qureshi of PFC Energy said.
 So far, high oil prices do not seem to have much hurt global economic growth. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have each said recently that oil prices have not slowed economic recovery or contributed to inflation. Part of the reason may be that modern economies are larger and less dependent on oil than in the 1970's. And oil prices, adjusted for inflation, are lower than at their peak in March 1981, when crude oil sold for around $40 a barrel, or nearly $80 in today's dollars. 
 Even so, higher energy costs over a sustained period would hurt company earnings, and could be expected to depress stock markets, curtail consumer spending and eventually slow growth. Analysts usually expect a $10-a-barrel increase in oil prices to shave growth in the gross domestic product by 0.3 to 0.5 percentage point.
 Not everyone is convinced that oil prices can stay high for too long. ''Oil prices don't exist in a vacuum,'' Mr. Yergin said. ''People generally underestimate the feedback effect on the economy. Markets adjust. The question is do they do it smoothly or painfully.''

HEADLINE: Condominiums for Businesses Fill a Niche in California

BYLINE: By JOHN McCLOUD

DATELINE: ALAMEDA, Calif. 

 BODY:
The dot-com collapse in Silicon Valley and beyond has given new prominence to a previously obscure class of office building: commercial condominiums. These are multi-user developments divided into small units where occupants buy their spaces, rather than renting them. 
 A company in the fore of developing commercial condominium projects, the Venture Commerce Corporation, recently broke ground here on its 11th such project. The complex in Alameda, an island city across the Oakland Estuary, will cover 41,000 square feet, broken into 15 units selling for more than $200 a square foot.
 At 1,500 to 3,000 square feet, the units are tiny by commercial real estate standards. But they fill a niche in the San Jose area that hardly anyone realized existed before Venture Commerce opened its first condominium in 2002 in Morgan Hill, a suburb. 
 Today, the company has a portfolio of some 2.5 million square feet of completed or approved commercial condos in eight Northern California and three Southern California communities. From its headquarters 15 miles north of San Francisco in Mill Valley, an affluent suburb, Venture Commerce is scouting sites in Oregon and Washington.
 It also has competition from at least four other companies in the Bay Area, and additional developers are preparing to jump on the bandwagon.
 ''There is a wave here, but we don't know how big it is,'' admitted Robert Eves, Venture Commerce's chief executive. ''Small businesses have always wanted to own, but nobody knew it. Now that a product is available, interest is high.''
 Mr. Eves discovered the market by accident while he was trying to resume development at Morgan Hill Ranch, a 350-acre business park that his company started in the early 1990's. The park was approximately half-built when the dot-com crash and the high-tech slowdown brought new construction to a standstill in 2001.
 ''Suddenly, we stopped receiving phone calls,'' Mr. Eves recounted. ''Vacancies were above 20 percent in Silicon Valley, and nobody wanted to build. Then one day a fellow calls us up who ran a dental laboratory with his dad. He said his dad had been paying rent for 27 years with nothing to show for it. They decided it was time to buy something, and he asked if we would build them a small building. I said, 'We absolutely will.'''
 But where small to Mr. Eves meant 25,000 square feet, the caller wanted something a tenth that size. ''I had to tell him it wasn't feasible,'' he continued. ''Cities won't allow business parks to subdivide into tiny lots. He'd have to buy a full acre of land, and the building's total cost would be so high it wouldn't make sense economically.''
 But subsequent calls from other small businesses seeking similar spaces convinced Mr. Eves that there was a solid market for offices under 3,000 square feet. Condominiums appeared to be the best way to meet the need.
 ''A condominium project could be large enough to meet zoning requirements but divided into small enough units to satisfy buyers' requirements,'' Mr. Eves said.
 Initially, Venture Commerce planned a 20,000-square-foot building with six units, but the announcement of the project generated so many prospective buyers that the company ultimately built seven buildings, with 44 units. The project quickly sold out, prompting the firm to plan more centers.
 Business owners, meanwhile, were approaching other Bay Area developers and brokers with similar requests. Memories of skyrocketing rents and space shortages during the dot-com boom of the late 1990's apparently provided the initial motivation.
 ''As rents rose during the boom, smaller users started getting squeezed out,'' said Cliff Miller, vice president of Lennar Partners Mare Island L.L.C., which oversees development of a former naval base in Vallejo, Calif. ''While that's not the case now, a lot of businesses decided they'd like to have more control of their own destiny in case it happens again.'' 
 Mr. Miller's company is exploring the possibility of reconfiguring several structures on the naval base for use as commercial condos. ''There's a shortage of small buildings for sale right now, and there's a wide group of businesses creating a lot of demand,'' he said. ''A lot of people have jumped into creating condos.'' 
 According to Mark Levin, president of Cypress Bay Ventures in Larkspur, Calif., low interest rates, investment potential and the tax advantages of ownership also play major roles in the rapidly growing market. 
 Mr. Levin and his partners are converting a building they developed in Petaluma, Calif., into condominiums after failing to lease any of the 43,000 square feet of offices.
 ''People can get financing for about what they're paying for rent,'' said Mr. Levin, who estimated that the after-tax carrying costs for units in his building would be equivalent to a monthly rent of about $2 a square foot.
 Commercial condo prices vary considerably, depending on a project's quality, level of finishing and location. Mr. Levin quoted rates of $185 to $200 a square foot for unfinished offices in his project, with interior improvements costing $40 a square foot on average.
 The developer John Lovewell, a partner in Keenan/Lovewell Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif., said that a 72,000-square-foot project that his firm is developing in neighboring Mountain View might command up to $475 a square foot for fully finished units.
 ''It's a cut above most of these projects,'' he said. ''We're aiming for top-level professionals.''
 Industrial condos sell for much less than office condos, said James Manley, a broker with the Keegan & Coppin Company, a commercial real estate firm in Santa Rosa, Calif. He is marketing a 40,000-square-foot industrial project in Petaluma, where units sell for $100 to $150 a square foot. The developer is the Radius Development Group, based in Larkspur.
 According to the various developers, condo buyers run the gamut from lawyers, architects and engineers to caterers, pathology labs and plumbing suppliers.
 ''There are so many interesting stories from people who wanted to own their own property,'' Mr. Eves related. ''I had no idea how widespread the desire was.''
 Nonetheless, Mr. Manley says the market may be too narrow to sustain much more development. He also says that rising interest rates will make purchasing a much less attractive option.
 Mr. Eves disagrees, saying that Small Business Administration figures show that 78 percent of businesses in the United States have fewer than 20 employees, making them ideal candidates for these kinds of projects.
 ''There are tens of thousands of small businesses near our sites,'' he said. ''Even if only a small percentage want to own, that's a lot of buyers.''
 As for interest rates, he said: ''They go up when the economy improves, and when the economy improves, rents also go up. So while it will cost more to buy, it will also cost more to rent.'' 
 Business is brisk at commercial condominium projects. According to Mr. Lovewell, the response has been exceptionally strong at a 130,000-square-foot project that his firm is completing in San Rafael, 20 miles north of San Francisco. Units, which can be finished for either office or warehouse use, sell for $175 to $275 a square foot.
 ''We've been deluged with interest,'' he reported recently. ''On Monday alone my broker received 35 calls from prospective buyers. I think we're going to sell out quickly.''

HEADLINE: Justices Will Hear a Property Rights Case Contesting the Limits of Eminent Domain

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court added an important property rights case to its docket on Tuesday, beating the calendar to fill in its schedule for the new term that begins Oct. 4, the traditional first Monday in October.
 The case is an appeal by seven property owners in a neighborhood in New London, Conn., that the city has designated for economic development. The Connecticut Supreme Court upheld the city's right to exercise its power of eminent domain to take the parcels, pay compensation to the owners and turn the land over to a private developer.
 While eminent domain in the past was generally limited to government projects, like roads or public buildings, or to what used to be known as slum clearance, local governments are increasingly finding it convenient to use eminent domain to clear land for private development that will enhance the tax base. 
 New London's plans for the 90-acre neighborhood of small homes include a waterfront hotel and conference center, office space for high technology research and development, retail space and 80 new homes. The city has offered the property to a private developer under a 99-year lease at $1 a year. The property owners rejected the city's offer of compensation and filed a lawsuit to block the plan.
 The question for the Supreme Court in Kelo v. City of New London, No. 04-108, is whether private development of this sort amounts to the kind of public use for which eminent domain is authorized by the Constitution. The so-called Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides: ''nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.''
 Dana Berliner, a senior attorney with the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm with a libertarian orientation that is representing the New London homeowners, said in an interview that the case had ''nationwide implications that will define eminent domain and public-use law for decades to come.'' 
 ''The framers put 'public use' in the Constitution for a reason,'' Ms. Berliner said. ''A private corporation making a profit is not a public use. Developers should purchase private property voluntarily like the rest of us.''
 Wesley Horton, the lawyer representing New London, said that ''the economic revitalization of New London is a valid public use,'' as the Connecticut Supreme Court found in its 4-to-3 decision last spring. In a statement issued by his law firm, Horton, Shields & Knox, of Hartford, Mr. Horton said New London's plan was ''motivated entirely by concern for the economic welfare of New London and its citizens.'' The city has been declining for years and has been designated a ''distressed municipality'' by Connecticut's Office of Planning and Management.
 Although the case clearly caught the justices' attention sufficiently to induce them to select it from among the roughly 1,000 new appeals that accumulated over the summer recess, it is not clear how the court will decide it. The Supreme Court has traditionally been quite deferential toward the government's use of eminent domain. The case, which the court will hear in January, is likely to attract a large number of briefs and to spark a lively debate over whether New London's economic development proposal is different in kind from the uses the court has authorized for eminent domain in the past.
 In other action on Tuesday, the court announced a step toward increased transparency in the official record of its arguments. For the first time, the argument transcripts will identify the justices asking questions, rather than simply using the word ''Question.'' The court's press office said the change was made ''in the interest of accuracy and completeness.'' Transcripts are available on the court's Web site, www.supremecourtus.gov, about two weeks after each argument.
 The justices granted eight new cases on Tuesday. These were among the others:

Party Primary
 In the latest of a series of cases on state regulation of party primaries, the court agreed to review an Oklahoma election law that prohibits parties from opening their primaries to voters registered in another party.
 The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, ruled in April that the law violated the First Amendment rights of the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma, which wanted to permit Republicans and Democrats to vote in its primary to raise the party's profile and attract new support.
 The Libertarians, along with individual Democratic and Republican voters, went to court to challenge Oklahoma's ''semiclosed'' primary, under which independents may vote in any primary that a party chooses to open to them, but those registered with other parties may not. The Oklahoma State Election Board brought the Supreme Court appeal, Clingman v. Beaver, No. 04-37.
 About half the states have semiclosed or completely closed primaries, restricting the ability of parties to organize their primaries as they wish. The Supreme Court's precedents have established that political parties enjoy a right of free association, protected by the First Amendment, and have limited the states' ability to restrict the parties' options to conduct their own affairs.
 The Oklahoma election officials are arguing that the court should defer to the state's judgment that opening a primary at a party's discretion would lead to instability and create, for example, a ''potential to alter primary elections of another political party, either purposefully or accidentally.'' The appeal said that ''while the right to vote is a most fundamental right, neither the right to vote in any manner or the right to associate for political purposes are absolute.''

Speech Limit
 In a different kind of First Amendment case, the court accepted an appeal from a man who was barred by a California state court order from continuing to picket and demonstrate outside the Los Angeles office of the lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran as well as from ''orally uttering statements about Cochran and/or Cochran's law firm.''
 The man, Ulysses Tory, who has been engaged in a long-running dispute with Mr. Cochran and has demanded money from him, is challenging the injunction as an unconstitutional prior restraint on his future speech. But the California Court of Appeal found the injunction justified because, it said in its opinion last October, ''uncontroverted evidence establishes that Cochran did not owe any money to Tory, that Tory knew his statements were all false, and that he nevertheless set out to harass Cochran by hiring picketers to carry outrageous placards.'' Further, the court noted, Mr. Tory had vowed to the trial judge to keep up his activities ''unless you order us not to.''
 The appeal is Tory v. Cochran, No. 03-1488.

HEADLINE: In Florida, Officials Are Hoping For One Final Storm Recovery

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Carl Hulse contributed reporting from Washington for this article, Terry Aguayo from Miami and Dennis Blank from Kissimmee , Fla.

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Schools and courts have closed for weeks on end. Roads, bridges, restaurants and hotels are in tatters, crops laid to waste and polling places for the coming election destroyed. Four back-to-back hurricanes have made normalcy ever more elusive in Florida, where intensive relief efforts cannot get traction helping people and whole industries cope.
 The logistical and financial hurdles are staggering: the Federal Emergency Management Agency has received more than 611,000 applications for assistance, and has been screening them at more than 60 recovery centers around the state. Though the agency delivered more than $330 million to individuals and businesses before Hurricane Jeanne blew through last weekend, thousands of applicants are still waiting. 
 The agency's phone lines were inundated even before the latest storm, which dealt a second or even third blow to many homes, farms and businesses in Central Florida. On Monday alone, it received 19,000 initial requests from Hurricane Jeanne victims, 3,200 from Hurricane Ivan victims, 3,954 from Hurricane Frances victims and 809 from Hurricane Charley victims, officials said. The storms struck on Sept. 26, Sept. 16, Sept. 4 and Aug. 13.
 At FEMA's main operations center here, postings remind workers how to recognize ''stress overload'' in themselves and count down the days until hurricane season ends (62 as of Tuesday). Many callers have found the agency's toll-free line busy in recent weeks, and many more are waiting to hear back from overwhelmed insurance companies.
 ''FEMA said, 'We'll have to get back to you after your insurance company helps you,''' said Charles Sweeney, 71, whose home in Barefoot Bay, near Vero Beach, was battered by two storms. ''But the insurance company said, 'You'll have to wait.' I've been real nice about it, but I ain't going to be nice no more.'' 
 Every time the state has dragged itself out from under a storm, another has hit within weeks, thwarting efforts to restore power, remove debris, repair infrastructure and mend the economy, until now one of the nation's healthiest. 
 ''We need to get back to the recovery phase of this and get out of preparation and relief,'' an exasperated Gov. Jeb Bush told reporters in Brevard County, parts of which were ravaged by Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne, on Monday. ''With a little bit of time, we can start developing strategies to recover. Which is to get visitors back in our state who don't come in big utility trucks, instead they come and rent cars and they stay in hotels and go to attractions. To jump-start our economy, which will have been hurt significantly by this.''
 Time and again, Mr. Bush and other officials also find themselves trying to jump-start the morale of people who feel flattened by the disruptions, and to reason with them. School superintendents have asked Mr. Bush to cancel the FCAT, the state's main standardized test, because so much instruction time has been lost. Schools in about 30 of the state's 67 counties were closed Tuesday; Pensacola schools, which have been out since Sept. 14, may not reopen until Oct. 11. Mr. Bush has agreed to delay the test in some counties, but has so far rejected the idea of skipping it this year.
 Another angry group, farmers, found some comfort last week when the federal government announced it would provide $500 million in agricultural relief aid. Hurricanes Charley and Frances inflicted about $2 billion worth of damage on crucial crops like citrus and nursery plants, officials say; damage from the more recent storms is still being tallied. 
 Tourism, the state's most lucrative industry, has been hobbled, with officials wondering how to persuade convention and other group planners to continue booking events here during the six-month hurricane season. Some businesses might reconsider the wisdom of having field offices in Florida, like American Express, which warned customers last week that payments might not be processed promptly. 
 Yet Mr. Bush and some economists have predicted that Florida's fiscal health will not suffer for long, partly because rebuilding often helps economies.
 ''Natural disasters have permanent effects only in stagnant economies,'' said Antonio Jorge, an economics professor at Florida International University in Miami, ''and certainly Florida's isn't one of them.''
 Residents have fumed not only about the pace of federal assistance, but also about power restoration, provided mostly by Florida Power and Light but also several smaller companies. As of Tuesday morning, power had been returned to 44 percent of the 2.8 million customers who lost it during Hurricane Jeanne and 92 percent of the 443,500 who lost it during Hurricane Ivan. Utility companies, all too aware of the resentment aimed their way, scrambled to recruit crews from as far away as California for the latest restoration effort, which is moving somewhat faster than earlier ones. 
 Perhaps because its operation is so large, FEMA appears the target of the most complaints, even as it continues to dole out ice, water, food, tarps and checks. President Bush asked Congress on Monday for an additional $7.1 billion for relief in the wake of Hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne, bringing the total sought so far to more than $12 billion. The money would go not only to Florida, but also to other states hit by the storms. Congress has so far approved only the initial $2 billion that the White House requested after Hurricane Charley. A second request for $3.1 billion is tied up in talks between the House and Senate and is entangled with more than $3 billion in drought relief sought by farm-state lawmakers of both parties.
 In a sign of how many homes the storms left uninhabitable, about 800 families are living in ''travel trailers'' provided by FEMA and more than 10,000 people remained in shelters as of Tuesday morning. At FEMA's disaster recovery center in Kissimmee, near Orlando, Terry Newby, a high school teacher whose roof was pummeled by three storms, said some of the agency's policies baffled him. ''They tell me to get two contractors' proposals, but you can't get any contractors to come out,'' said Mr. Newby, 53, of Kissimmee. ''I am feeling very frustrated, not knowing where to go.''
 Claire Sheaffer, a single mother who works for the state health department, said roof damage forced her to move out of her house after Hurricane Frances, but that she was still waiting for FEMA representatives to visit. They told her to keep the air-conditioning on to prevent mold, a luxury she cannot afford given the circumstances, she said.
 ''I applied to FEMA four days after Charley and they still have not come out to my house,'' Ms. Sheaffer said. ''After the first storm I was handing out food and forms for FEMA, but now I am on the other side of the desk.''

HEADLINE: Sudan Official Calls Darfur a 'Smoke Screen' for Plotters

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
A senior Sudanese official on Tuesday called the Darfur crisis a ''smoke screen'' to hoodwink the international community into aiding political opponents who seek to overthrow the government. He warned that disarming pro-government militias, if done hastily and carelessly, could cause a violent ethnic war.
 The government is faced with the prospect of United Nations Security Council sanctions and growing calls from abroad to rein in the notorious pro-government Arab militias operating in Darfur, a large region in western Sudan. 
 Turning the tables, the senior official, Najib el-Kheir Abdelwahab, the minister of state for foreign affairs, demanded international assistance in distinguishing troublemakers from legitimate tribal leaders. 
 ''You identify them,'' he told reporters after a meeting with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Ruud Lubbers, and other diplomats. ''Who are they? By pointing to some tribal leaders, I think, if we are not cautious on that we will be igniting ethnic and tribal conflagration in the country. And this can lead very swiftly to the dismemberment of Sudan.''
 His comments underscored what for the government has emerged as a formidable political challenge: how to rein in the militia forces that have served as its allies in the war against rebels in Darfur and have become notorious for leaving a trail of killing, rape and wanton destruction. 
 Independent human rights reports have argued that the militias have been armed and on occasion trained by the government.
 The Bush administration has demanded that the militias, known in Arabic as the Janjaweed, be disarmed. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the killings, rape and destruction in Darfur amounted to genocide. 
 A State Department official said Tuesday night that the Sudanese government needed no help in identifying those responsible. ''The international community doesn't need to tell them who is who,'' the official said. ''They know the elements they are communicating with.''
 Mr. Abdelwahab said the Bush administration's interest in Sudan reflected its desire to corral American black and Jewish voters in the November election -- black voters prompted by sympathy for African victims, and Jewish groups who Mr. Abdelwahab said were ''duty bound to support black Africans in Sudan against Arab hegemony.''
 The government has said it has already arrested some Janjaweed whom it considers outlaws and incorporated other militia members into its own security forces -- a fact that has given little solace to people who have been attacked.
 The war in western Sudan began in early 2003 with a rebellion led by black Africans protesting the economic and political marginalization of Darfur. It has caused a stark crisis of human suffering, pushing 1.2 million people from their homes, sending nearly 200,000 across the border to Chad and cutting a deep divide between Arab and black African tribes that have lived for centuries in the country's arid west.
 Disarmament remains one of the most sensitive issues in a round of peace talks to open on Oct. 22 in Abuja, Nigeria. The rebels have refused to disarm before the pro-government militias are disbanded. 
 The government has argued that disarmament cannot be one-sided. United Nations officials have suggested a large expansion of an African Union peacekeeping force to supervise any disarmament.
 Mr. Lubbers, after a five-day tour of Sudan and visit to its refugees across the border in Chad, applauded the government for offering access to aid agencies and agreeing to resume negotiations with rebels. 
 And yet, he said, sporadic attacks continue even today, and civilians have virtually no confidence in their government. ''The level of trust among uprooted people for the authorities has gone to almost zero,'' Mr. Lubbers said.
 At a news briefing on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Lubbers said Sudan had agreed to an expanded role for United Nations agencies to help restore confidence in Darfur. For one thing, he said, United Nations refugee agency officials will verify that civilians returning home to Darfur are doing so voluntarily. Mr. Lubbers said government officials had told him that 190,000 people had gone back to Darfur.
 Even with widespread international condemnation of the violence, the only international troops in Darfur now are those sent by the African Union -- and those are there only to monitor cease-fire violations. The Sudanese government has maintained that it alone is responsible for protecting its territory and has refused any enforcement by foreign peacekeepers.
 Mr. Lubbers was to have met with President Omar Hassan el-Bashir on Tuesday, but met instead, for undisclosed reasons, with his first vice president, Ali Osman Taha. Last Friday, Mr. Lubbers suggested that the government in Khartoum share power with its rebel foes. 
 His comments came as the government announced a failed coup plot and extra soldiers fanned across the capital. Government officials have attributed the reported coup attempt to an opposition party linked to one of the two Darfur rebel groups, known as the Justice and Equality Movement. 
 Drawing international attention to the plight of Darfurians, Mr. Abdelwahab argued, is part of a campaign by the opposition to intensify outside pressure on the government.
 ''They would like to use the suffering of the people of Darfur as a smoke screen to conduct certain partisan operations,'' he said. ''One of them is the overthrow of the government in Khartoum.''

HEADLINE: Control That Was Maybe Too Remote

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Testifying two years ago about the debacle at Enron, Franklin D. Raines, the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, told lawmakers that one of the biggest lessons he had learned was that it was unacceptable to hide behind claims of ignorance. 
 ''It is wholly irresponsible and unacceptable for corporate leaders to say they did not know -- or suggest it is not their duty to know -- about the operations and activities of their company, particularly when it comes to risks that threaten the fundamental viability of their company,'' Mr. Raines told a House panel as it prepared landmark revisions to the nation's corporate laws.
 Now Mr. Raines finds himself at the center of his own corporate crisis, precipitated by accusations that accounting irregularities were carried out at Fannie Mae on his watch. 
 The accusations, which have raised questions among outsiders about how much Mr. Raines knew about what his subordinates were doing, have left him struggling to maintain control over Fannie Mae, the nation's largest backer of home mortgages, and maneuver it through a thicket of regulatory and political shoals. 
 For Mr. Raines -- whose first taste of Washington power occurred in 1969, when as a Harvard student he got an internship at the White House and delivered a carefully drafted report to President Richard M. Nixon and his cabinet about unrest on college campuses -- the events of recent weeks have been particularly painful, friends say.
 Both he and his predecessor, James A. Johnson, are prominent Democratic fixtures in the highest ranks of Washington society, playing significant roles here among the elite policy makers and political figures of both parties.
 The problems that have surfaced so far at Fannie Mae fall far short of the level of corporate abuse at Enron -- and it is still possible that the Securities and Exchange Commission will find that the officials did nothing wrong.
 But Mr. Raines, 55, and Mr. Johnson, 60, were at the helm of the company when, according to the company's direct regulators, it engaged in sloppy and misleading accounting practices. Among other things, regulators concluded that the company manipulated its figures in a way that enabled top executives to earn fatter management bonuses. Some experts expect that the report will lead to significant restatements of the company's financial statements.
 According to the report issued last week by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the bonuses awarded in 1998 after the accounting changes enabled Mr. Johnson to receive an additional $1.9 million and Mr. Raines an additional $1.1 million.
 In the three years ended last December, Mr. Raines received a total of about $14 million in compensation and another $25.6 million in payouts under a long-term compensation incentive plan. 
 Mr. Raines, who declined a request to discuss the report or his strategy for moving the company through its crisis, has already lost some control over Fannie Mae. On Monday, Fannie reached an agreement to raise its level of capital, forfeit significant oversight to its main regulator, and put ''at least one person'' on the audit committee ''with sufficient technical expertise to understand the implications of accounting policies to financial statements.''
 While the report is explicitly critical of their subordinates, it is silent about the precise role played by Mr. Raines and Mr. Johnson in the accounting principles at issue. But some experts say that even if they were not directly involved, the two must bear responsibility for any ultimate finding of systemic wrongdoing.
 ''I think it's very questionable that he survives this,'' Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Clinton administration, said of Mr. Raines. ''There is enough in the report that calls into question both his abilities to manage the company and his ability to put the right people in place around him.''
 James D. Cox, a securities law and accounting expert at Duke University School of Law, agreed.
 ''My sense is that these were policies that were pursued systematically, and I don't think that happens without senior management being involved,'' said Professor Cox, who noted that he holds stock in the company. ''The history of restatements at this level is that people at the most senior level don't survive.'' 
 Before the problems surfaced at Fannie Mae, both men were considered to be high on the short lists for top administration jobs should Senator John Kerry prevail in the November presidential election.
 Publicly, both have continued to enjoy the support of Democrats. 
 ''Both Frank and Jim are pillars of the Washington community and both have impeccable reputations,'' said Gene Sperling, a senior economic adviser to President Bill Clinton who is now a top adviser to Mr. Kerry. ''I don't see anything that would diminish their potential to contribute to a Kerry administration if either is so inclined. Both men have long public and visible records of integrity.''
 Mary Beth Cahill, Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, said Mr. Johnson ''is a highly valued and respected adviser to Senator Kerry and the campaign and we would expect his role to be the same in the future as it is today.''
 She did not discuss Mr. Raines, who as the leader of a company that courts the support of both Republicans and Democrats, has studiously maintained a lower profile in the presidential campaign. 
 But privately, Washington is awash in speculation that the problems of Fannie Mae could overshadow any chance of either man's returning to government.
 Mr. Raines is the son of a Seattle janitor who spent five years building his house with the scraps of one that was being torn down. He is credited with playing a pivotal role in reaching a crucial budget deal with Congressional Republicans in 1997 when he served as director of the White House budget office under President Clinton. 
 After returning to Fannie Mae and then taking control in 1999, he became the first African-American to run a Fortune 500 company. 
 Leon Panetta, who served as chief of staff to President Clinton after being in charge of the budget office, recalled that Mr. Raines had a reputation for probity and was cautious with numbers when he led the budget office.
 ''I always found him to be extremely careful about anything he's managed,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''My first reaction to the recent news is that Frank Raines is not someone who will play games with Fannie or play accounting games but someone who, whatever the decisions are, made them with some basis in law and facts.''
 Mr. Raines has had a string of important assignments. He was formerly the president of the board of overseers at Harvard, where he earned his undergraduate and law degrees.
 He is now co-chairman of the Business Roundtable, an elite group of chief executives from the nation's largest companies, and he serves on the boards of Pfizer, Pepsi and TIAA-CREF. 
 Mr. Johnson first emerged as a political figure in Washington when he was chief of staff to Vice President Walter Mondale. He is a major fund-raiser for Mr. Kerry's presidential campaign, and a close confidant who led the candidate's search for a running mate.
 Before that, Mr. Johnson was chairman of both the Brookings Institution and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts while operating as Fannie Mae's chief executive. This week he did not return telephone messages seeking comment.

HEADLINE: Warnings on Warming

 BODY:
One wonders what it will take to bestir the Bush administration on the subject of global warming. Everywhere one looks nowadays -- London, Moscow, even the odd precinct on Capitol Hill -- there is evidence of mounting impatience with Washington's refusal to face up to the threat. While the links between global warming and Florida's serial hurricanes are largely theoretical, even the weather seems to be telling the politicians that it is time to start paying attention.
 Certainly Tony Blair thinks so. In a forceful recent speech before business leaders in London, Mr. Blair, in many other respects a Bush loyalist, called global warming ''the world's greatest environmental challenge,'' implicitly rebuking the administration for its repudiation of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. Mr. Blair said he would put the issue near the top of the agenda at next year's G-8 meeting of industrialized nations, over which Britain will preside. 
 In Moscow, a hitherto skeptical Russian government has set in motion legislative action that could lead to Russia's approval of the Kyoto agreement. That would bring the treaty into force and enlist Moscow in a global effort to reduce greenhouse gases. It would also isolate the United States from the various mechanisms, including an emissions trading system, envisioned by Kyoto.
 Meanwhile, in the Senate, John McCain -- last seen rhetorically embracing President Bush at the Republican convention -- reminded the White House that he remains, at least on this issue, an implacable critic. In hearings last week, Mr. McCain called the administration's generally passive approach ''disgraceful'' and warned that future generations would pay a heavy price for continued inaction now.
 Mr. McCain, a co-sponsor with Senator Joseph Lieberman of a bill to impose mandatory caps on industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, also ventured where few politicians have dared to go, drawing a link between this calamitous hurricane season and climate change. This is not farfetched: because hurricanes draw their intensity from the heat in ocean waters, and because the oceans (like the rest of the world) are gradually getting warmer, a growing number of reputable scientists say hurricanes are likely to grow in intensity and destructive power, if not frequency. 
 Of all the signs of impatience, the most important came from California, where state regulators last week approved the first rule in the United States limiting automobile emissions of carbon dioxide. The rule seeks a reduction in these gases of about 30 percent by 2016. It could have enormous ramifications for industry and consumers because California is the country's biggest automobile market and because New York and six other Northeastern states have indicated a willingness to follow suit.
 Because most of an automobile's carbon dioxide emissions come from burning fuel, the California rule will require automakers to increase sharply the fuel efficiency of millions of vehicles. As technological challenges go, this is a big one, but history suggests that the industry can meet it.
 A 30 percent reduction in emissions in roughly a decade is less daunting than the 50 percent reduction required by the fuel economy standards imposed by Congress nearly 30 years ago -- the last time the automakers were forced to pay serious attention to efficiency. And much of the technology needed to meet the target is either already on the road -- in the form of gas-electric hybrid cars -- or on the shelf. 
 In a sense, of course, Mr. Blair, the Russians, Mr. McCain, California and maybe even the hurricanes are sending the same message: that Mr. Bush is bringing up the rear of a parade he really ought to be leading. It would help, too, if Senator John Kerry, whose record on this issue has been strong, sent the same message in a more public and compelling venue than his campaign Web site.

HEADLINE: Anti-Bush Billionaire Plans to Give More

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who has given $18 million to Democratic advocacy groups to defeat President Bush, is preparing to spend millions more because he fears that Senator John Kerry might lose. 
 Mr. Soros announced on Tuesday that he was sending himself on a $3million 12-city tour to argue that keeping Mr. Bush in the White House would endanger the nation's security, economy and values and continue ''the vicious circle of escalating violence in Iraq.'' 
 By mid-August, Mr. Soros had given more than $15 million to advocacy groups like America Coming Together. At that time, he said in an interview on Monday, he fully expected Mr. Kerry to win the election. But recently, Mr. Soros saw what he called the outrageous and slanderous Swift boat commercials against Mr. Kerry and how they had damaged his standing in the polls. 
 Since then, the Hungarian-born Mr. Soros said, he has become so worried that Mr. Bush will win the election that he increased his giving, to $18.2 million, and has scrapped a trip in October to Russia to work against the president's re-election. 
 ''America has gone off the rails,'' he lamented in the interview over a lunch of Dover sole at his home in suburban New York. ''I've been accused of messianic fantasies, and I will own up to them. To the extent that I can contribute to improving the world in which we live, I want to do it, and I'm in a better position than a lot of other people.''
 In the last 25 years, Mr. Soros, 74, has given hundreds of millions of dollars to philanthropies overseas like helping blacks go to college in South Africa, building a system to filter water in war-torn Sarajevo and shipping hundreds of photocopying machines to Hungary to advance an independent press. He also spent more than $500 million in Russia on health and educational programs.
 Mr. Soros has now set his sights on the United States. ''If I could contribute to repudiating the Bush policies, I think it would be the greatest good deed I could do for the world,'' he said as he announced his tour at the National Press Club here.
 Such ambitions have given Mr. Soros the status of whipping boy for Republicans. They find that mention of his name helps them raise money.
 Even before Mr. Soros spoke Tuesday, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, ''The only explanation for the Daddy Warbucks of the Democratic Party, George Soros, to step out from behind the curtain 35 days before the election is his obvious concern for his investment in John Kerry.''
 Mr. Soros, whose $7.2 billion fortune makes him the 24th richest person in the United States, has become the biggest donor to the 527 advocacy groups, a category named for the section of the tax code that covers them. He pledged $10 million to America Coming Together for a registration and get-out-the-vote drive, but gave a total of $14.5 million.
 His other contributions to Democratic 527's are $2.5 million to MoveOn.org Voter Fund; $325,000 to Young Voter Alliance; $325,000 to 21st Century Democrats; $300,000 to the Real Economy Group; and $250,000 to Democracy for America.
 He has also pledged $3 million to the Center for American Progress, a research group led by John Podesta, President Bill Clinton's chief of staff. Mr. Soros has given $1.5 million to the center.
 He said that in this election year he had had minimal contact with Mr. Kerry, largely because campaign finance laws bar coordination between candidates and 527's, and he is such a large donor to the 527's that such contact would be not be correct. 
 The two men are neighbors in Sun Valley, Idaho. 
 ''We used to have dinners as a foursome,'' Mr. Soros said, ''and I got to know him quite well. We spent a whole afternoon over Christmas in 2001 talking about foreign policy.'' 
 Although he said he did not necessarily share all of Mr. Kerry's views, he added, ''I'm very confident he would make a very good president.''
 Asked what kind of bang he was getting for his buck in the campaign, Mr. Soros did not criticize the Democrats but said, ''I'm anxious that reality is being sufficiently distorted by the Bush campaign that he may actually be re-elected, otherwise I wouldn't go on this campaign.''
 Mr. Soros stopped short of saying the Democrats had run an ineffective campaign, saying he knew nothing of political strategy.
 Despite his contributions, Mr. Soros said he thought money in politics should be reduced. He gave $18 million last year to overhauling the finance system, but said he saw no contradiction between that and the millions he is giving this year.
 ''I play by the rules that prevail,'' he said. ''I've got a bevy of lawyers making sure that I do. At the same time, I'm in favor of improving the rules.''

HEADLINE: Where Did All the Jobs Go? Nowhere

BYLINE: By Daniel W. Drezner. 
Daniel W. Drezner is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
John Kerry is making the outsourcing of jobs by American companies a centerpiece of his campaign, telling audiences that ''because of George Bush's wrong choices, this country is continuing to ship good jobs overseas.'' President Bush's team has in turn accused the senator of hypocrisy, noting that many of Mr. Kerry's supporters in the business world run companies that are sending jobs offshore. Yet as each side angles for votes, neither is addressing the real issue: is the outsourcing of jobs a problem? The answer, surprisingly, is no.
 For about a year now, Americans have become fixated on the idea that the Internet had enabled firms to easily subcontract business services -- including call centers and software development -- overseas. I've read countless newspaper articles with anecdotes about American computer programmers who trained their Indian replacements and were then let go. The phenomenon landed simultaneously on the covers of Time, The Economist and BusinessWeek. 
 Politicians have been equally interested. On this page in January, Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, suggested that outsourcing rendered the law of comparative advantage null and void. When I.B.M. announced plans that month to fire up to 5,000 American workers and ''offshore'' their jobs to low-wage countries, politicians and pundits fell all over each other to denounce the company. When N. Gregory Mankiw, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said that outsourcing was simply another form of trade, Republicans and Democrats alike blasted him for his naivete. 
 Not surprisingly, all this coverage had an effect on public opinion. This month a poll by Zogby International for the Foreign Policy Association found that 71 percent of Americans believed outsourcing was hurting the economy. It also found that 62 percent of American workers believed the federal government should penalize companies that send work offshore. 
 Now, however, we can add some actual figures to the overheated debate. The Government Accountability Office has issued its first review of the data, and one undeniable conclusion to be drawn from it is that outsourcing is not quite the job-destroying tsunami it's been made out to be. Of the 1.5 million jobs lost last year in ''mass layoffs'' -- that is, when 50 or more workers are let go at once -- less than 1 percent were attributed to overseas relocation; that was a decline from the previous year. In 2002, only about 4 percent of the money directly invested by American companies overseas went to the developing countries that are most likely to account for outsourced jobs -- and most of that money was concentrated in manufacturing. 
 The data did show that from 1997 to 2002, annual imports of business, technical and professional services increased by $16.3 billion. However, during that same half-decade, exports of those services increased by $20.5 billion a year. In 2002 alone, the United States ran a $27 billion trade surplus in business services, the sector in which jobs are most likely to be outsourced. The G.A.O. correctly stressed that it is impossible to compute exactly how many jobs are lost because of outsourcing, but unless its figures are off by several orders of magnitude, there's no crisis here. 
 Many companies moving jobs overseas have also received a bum rap. Lost in all the clamor about I.B.M.'s outsourcing plan was the company's simultaneous announcement that it would add 5,000 American jobs to its payroll. For the second quarter of this year, the company reported a 17 percent increase in earnings, allowing it to trim its outsourcing plan by a third and raise its overall hiring plans by 20 percent. The conclusion is obvious: I.B.M.'s outsourcing of some jobs helped it reduce costs, increase earnings and hire more American-based workers. 
 None of this is to dismiss the pain endured by those who lose their jobs to lower-paid workers abroad. But the magnitude of these job losses must be placed in the proper perspective. Technological innovation is responsible for a far greater number of lost jobs than outsourcing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that in the first quarter of this year 4,633 workers were laid off because of offshoring. In the same period Kodak, for example, announced layoffs of 15,000 workers because the growth of digital photography reduced demand for film. Few Americans suggest technological innovation be stifled for the sake of preserving old jobs. Yet during election years, restrictions on outsourcing are considered fair game. 
 This is not to say there aren't steps we can take to help those who lose their jobs. For example, Trade Adjustment Assistance, a federal program to compensate and retrain workers displaced by import competition, at present covers only those in manufacturing. It should be expanded to include service employees. 
 The American economy has some formidable challenges in the coming decades -- rising health care costs, a ballooning federal budget deficit, failing schools and the need for greater investment in new technology and innovation. The voters should concentrate on the candidates' plans to overcome those obstacles, not on needless hoopla over outsourcing.

HEADLINE: A Fast Finisher's Reputation Now Faces the Ultimate Test

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In 1996, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts was struggling to keep his job in the face of a stiff challenge by his state's popular, aw-shucks Republican governor, William F. Weld, when midway through a series of televised debates, he began a confession that suddenly became a boast.
 ''I'm very well aware that when God made me, one of the debits he gave was sort of an overlevel of intensity, maybe an overlevel of earnestness,'' Mr. Kerry said that August in the fourth of eight debates. ''I don't sort of wear every part of me on my sleeve as easily as some people do, and I know that. On the other hand, what I do know about myself is that when you have a fight, I'm a good person to be in a foxhole with, and I know that we're in a fight right now.''
 Eight years later, Mr. Kerry is in the fight of his political life, against President Bush, and he and his supporters are counting on the reputation he cemented in that 1996 campaign and again in the Democratic primaries this year as a candidate who runs best from behind, a political Seabiscuit who pulls ahead after from his anxiety-producing slow starts. 
 ''If this were a boxing match, he might be losing on the cards for the first five or six rounds,'' said Dan Payne, a media consultant in Boston and a veteran of several Kerry campaigns. ''And then when he realizes, 'I could lose this if I don't do something more forceful,' then he comes to life and is able to finish off an opponent.''
 Mr. Payne added: ''It's the times leading up to those moments that get him in trouble. He puts it on automatic pilot.''
 As Mr. Kerry approaches this campaign's home stretch, with the first debate tomorrow night, there is much in his past to suggest that he believes elections are won in the endgame, that he holds back on purpose and begins concentrating intently on the race only when he believes the voters are, too. It remains to be seen whether an approach that has worked in Mr. Kerry's liberal home state or with Democratic primary voters eager to anoint a consensus candidate will be effective in a national election, but Mr. Kerry has little choice but to perform at his peak now.
 He clearly is trying. Over the past month, he has retooled his campaign staff, sharpened his attacks on Mr. Bush and set aside a planned focus on the economy in favor of a steady critique of the president's handling of the war in Iraq that has produced blunt headlines and more prominent news coverage.
 Mr. Kerry has been in similar spots before. By most accounts, he did not come alive in his 1996 race against Mr. Weld until their fifth debate, in mid-September. In that encounter, he unleashed a string of one-liners and ripostes, attacking Mr. Weld as an equivocator by invoking the name of the governor's sometime adviser, who had just resigned from President Bill Clinton's re-election campaign after disclosure of an affair with a prostitute. ''Governor,'' Mr. Kerry said, ''you switch your positions faster than your friend Dick Morris.'' Mr. Weld's only rebuttal was a blush.
 Afterward, Mr. Kerry told The Boston Herald: ''It's time to rock and roll. This is the time when people are listening. I've got to focus.'' Seven weeks later, Mr. Kerry won by seven percentage points, in a state where Mr. Clinton beat Bob Dole by 33 points.
 At least one candidate who has faced Mr. Kerry says his approach is fully as much strategy as it is alchemy. James Shannon, who worked on Mr. Kerry's only failed race, in 1972, and lost to him in the Democratic Senate primary in 1984, said Mr. Kerry's reputation as a good closer was deserved but oversimplified. Mr. Shannon said he thought Mr. Kerry's approach derived from that 1972 Congressional race in suburban Lowell, Mass., in which a poll several weeks before the election showed him ahead of his Republican opponent by nearly 30 points. Instead, Mr. Kerry wound up losing, after badly misjudging the impact of last-minute attacks by his opponent and the hostile local newspaper.
 Mr. Kerry ''seemed to be sailing into victory and had the thing snatched away from him,'' Mr. Shannon said. ''You can talk about 'the closer,' yeah, but I think that does him a disservice, as if he can pull a rabbit out of the hat. It has to do with the importance of sharpening your focus at the end, and the fact that the race is defined at the end.''
 It is not entirely clear just how defined the current contest is. For much of the past year, polls have shown Mr. Bush with approval ratings that few incumbents would envy but Mr. Kerry having trouble capitalizing on that. Recent polls have shown Mr. Bush holding an edge, though there is volatility in the electorate that Mr. Kerry might yet exploit.
 Many of Mr. Kerry's oldest friends express exasperation at his willingness to drift at times in his campaigns. His tendency to focus best in the crunch is a longtime habit, dating at least to his days as a champion debater at Yale, and one that cannot be explained as a result of mere procrastination or inattention.
 ''He was so incredibly overcommitted to activities, it was hard getting him together,'' said Bradford Snell, one of his debate partners in those days. ''At 11 or 12 midnight the day before, I'd finally be able to corral him. When his back is up against the wall, the adrenaline starts flowing and he just does phenomenal things. It's a last-minute, rush-type operation.''
 In debates, Mr. Snell said, Mr. Kerry was ''able to fully comprehend the other side and find the flaw and pull it apart. One of the worst things you can do is get too programmed. You must listen to the other side in order to really prevail. I remember a couple of times, I'd make some suggestions and he'd just say, 'I've got this one.' It seemed as if he'd prepared for months.''
 Mr. Bush's aides have gone out of their way in recent weeks to talk up Mr. Kerry's prowess as a debater, with the president's strategist Matthew Dowd calling Mr. Kerry ''the best debater ever to run for president,'' and ''better than Cicero.'' In fact, the record shows that Mr. Kerry, so often windy in prepared speeches, can be succinct in spontaneous exchanges.
 In his second debate against Mr. Weld in 1996, Mr. Kerry interrupted him at one point by saying, ''There you go again,'' Ronald Reagan's famous line against Jimmy Carter in 1980.
 ''I knew Ronald Reagan,'' Mr. Weld replied, echoing Lloyd Bentsen's invocation of his acquaintance with John F. Kennedy in putting down Dan Quayle in 1988, only to have Mr. Kerry shoot back, ''So did I, and we don't need another Ronald Reagan type in Washington.''
 In their first debate, with the mother of a police officer who had been killed in the line of duty sitting in the audience, Mr. Weld demanded that Mr. Kerry defend his opposition to the death penalty and explain ''why the life of the man who murdered her son is worth more than the life of her son.''
 Mr. Kerry, a former prosecutor, replied quietly: ''It's not worth more. It's not worth anything. It's scum that ought to be thrown in jail for the rest of its life.'' But, he added, in an unmistakable reference to his service in Vietnam (a war that Mr. Weld had avoided on account of a bad back), ''I've been opposed to the death penalty. I know something about killing. I don't like killing. I don't think a state honors life by turning around and sanctioning killing.'' 
 In 32 years, Mr. Kerry has lost only one campaign -- that first race for Congress -- and has seldom lost a debate. He hates to lose.
 Forty years ago this fall, The Yale Daily News reported that Mr. Kerry's team had lost a debate with Cambridge University, conducted by trans-Atlantic telephone cable, in which Mr. Kerry's side argued against the proposition that ''Red China should be admitted to the United Nations.'' Days later, Mr. Kerry wrote a letter to the editor, protesting that description on the grounds that the audiences were lopsided, with the Cambridge group consisting almost entirely of United Nations supporters.
 ''For this reason,'' Mr. Kerry wrote then, ''the vote was merely a token one'' and he added, ''The debate was neither won nor lost by either side.'' 
 But from his next debate till Nov. 2, Mr. Kerry cannot be content with a draw.

HEADLINE: Some Swing States Appear to Be Swinging to President

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Days before the presidential debates begin, President Bush appears to be gaining in several swing states he lost in 2000.
 Experts caution that the race is highly fluid, but Mr. Bush, for now at least, is surging ahead in several crucial states. Polls show Mr. Bush making headway in Iowa and Wisconsin, both of which he lost last time. He was also building leads in Ohio and West Virginia, states he won in 2000. 
 All four states have been hotly contested this year. And Senator John Kerry seems to have ceded Missouri to Mr. Bush. 
 The shocker in the last week was New Jersey, where three polls showed Mr. Bush pulling even with Mr. Kerry. The state, never on the battleground list, has voted Democratic since 1988 and comes with a sizable chunk of electoral votes, 15. Mr. Bush's strength there was a source of concern to Democrats.
 Experts said New Jersey would in the end almost certainly go Democratic, but a snapshot of polls last week put it as a tossup.
 Mr. Kerry led in Maine and was solidifying leads in Michigan and Washington, states that Al Gore won in 2000 but that Mr. Bush is contesting this year. Polls also showed the candidates nearly even in Colorado.
 An analysis of state polls by The New York Times showed that the race in the last six days has been most competitive in nine states, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon and Pennsylvania. They have a total of 105 electoral votes.
 These polls show that if the election had been held in the last week, Mr. Kerry would have been able to count on 10 states plus the District of Columbia, for a total of 153 electoral votes, and that Mr. Bush would have been able to count on 18 states with 144 electoral votes. Three other states -- Maine, Michigan and Washington -- were leaning toward Mr. Kerry, and if they vote that way will provide Mr. Kerry an additional 32 electoral votes, for a total of 177.
 Ten others -- Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin and West Virginia -- were leaning toward Mr. Bush and would provide him with an additional 104 electoral votes, for a total of 248.
 A total of 270 electoral votes is needed to win.
 The first of the three debates is scheduled for Thursday. Then, the campaigns will start examining the responses of swing voters and independents and redirect money, commercials and candidates' time to where they think they can be most effective.
 Last week, Mr. Kerry pulled back advertising time he had bought in Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana and Missouri. He has made little effort in North Carolina, even though it is the home of his running mate, Senator John Edwards.
 The hope in the Bush camp, aides said, is that his debate performance will help nail down the swing states where he is leading and let him move more vigorously to contest other states that Mr. Gore won in 2000.
 A senior strategist for Mr. Kerry, Tad Devine, conceded Mr. Bush had made gains in Iowa and Wisconsin.
 ''They will be competitive all the way to the end, without a doubt,'' Mr. Devine said.
 He predicted that those states would repeat their 2000 dynamic, when late polls showed Mr. Bush ahead but Mr. Gore narrowly won both. Mr. Devine also pointed to recent national polls to say Mr. Bush was on shaky ground. 
 National polls show Mr. Bush opening up a lead of several percentage points over Mr. Kerry. A Pew poll released on Tuesday gave him an eight-point lead, and a Washington Post/ABC News poll on Tuesday showed a six-point edge. The polls did offer some comfort to Mr. Kerry, with voters in the Pew poll, expressing less confidence in the president on Iraq and saying Mr. Kerry would be better for the economy. 
 ''It's on its way back toward a dead heat,'' Mr. Devine said. ''Bush got a big bounce out of his convention. But the bounce is coming down, and the situation is not favorable to him. He's an incumbent president who can't gain a decisive advantage.''
 A strategist for Mr. Bush, Matthew Dowd, said that the electoral map had ''tilted'' to Mr. Bush's favor and that the Kerry camp had to spend money trying to cement leads in states that voted Democratic in 2000.
 ''They're spending a lot of their resources just keeping the Gore states,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''They are increasing their buys in Maine and Michigan and they're trying to get Wisconsin back.''


CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about gains President Bush is making in swing states that he lost in 2000 gave an erroneous total for the electoral votes Senator John Kerry might win based on states that are now supporting him or leaning his way. It is 185, not 177.

Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the tightening presidential race in New Jersey misidentified the party that won there in 1988. (The error was repeated in an article on Wednesday about President Bush's gains in polls taken in several swing states.) The winner was the Republicans; the Democrats have won the state in the three presidential elections since then. 


GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: ''Snapshot of a Narrowing Electoral Map''An analysis of state polls by The New York Times finds that President Bush has made gains in some highly contested states, though political analysts say the race remains highly fluid.

HEADLINE: A Request to Partisans: Don't Shoot the Pollster

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
There has been no shortage of targets for partisans of all persuasions this election season. But one group has come under fire from all sides: pollsters, who in these polarized times have become the political equivalent of lawyers.
 The latest attack came Tuesday from the liberal activist group MoveOn.org, which ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times criticizing the Gallup Organization for polling that showed President Bush comfortably ahead of Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee. Saying that the polling is biased toward Republicans, the advertisement implies the reason is that George Gallup Jr., the son of the poll's founder, is an evangelical Christian. 
 Several other organizations, including The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, had come under criticism earlier when one campaign or the other has been displeased with the results of their polls.
 Those making the charges say they are simply trying to counter the powerful news media when they believe it is presenting inaccurate pictures of the electorate that could demoralize -- or galvanize -- voters.
 But pollsters, many of whom see themselves as above-the-fray numbers crunchers, say the attacks are a product of intense national partisanship in the age of the Weblog and 24-hour cable news channels.
 Many pollsters interviewed Tuesday, while not claiming to be perfect, said their more vociferous critics were often trying to shout down messengers delivering news that runs counter to the version of reality they want to see presented. 
 The criticism, many pollsters said, has been particularly personal and vicious.
 ''I can never remember an election where we've had such contentious responses to what we've found,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. ''People really have their guns drawn, and they shoot the messenger with them.''
 Mr. Kohut added, ''The nasty mail we've gotten this month has been from Republicans,'' because of a recent Pew poll that showed the race to be closer than many others showing Mr. Bush comfortably ahead. Pew released a poll on Tuesday showing Mr. Bush with an eight-point lead.
 Susan Pinkus, director of polling for The Los Angeles Times, said she was deluged with angry calls and e-mail messages after her newspaper produced a poll in June showing Mr. Kerry with a comfortable lead over Mr. Bush. ''It's really, really bad out there,'' Ms. Pinkus said. ''They say these horrible things about you: that I'm in the pocket of the Democrats, that I'm lying, that I have no clue what I'm doing.''
 The criticisms of Ms. Pinkus originated in a very prominent place -- Mr. Bush's campaign headquarters, where the chief campaign strategist, Matthew Dowd, called the poll ''a mess.'' Mr. Dowd said at the time he was particularly peeved that the poll was taken among a considerably higher number of people who identified themselves as Democrats than Republicans, a complaint he had about several other polls as well. But other polls that followed in the summer showed Mr. Kerry ahead by a similar margin.
 Now, with most polls showing his man ahead, Mr. Dowd is a much less vocal critic. Many of the complaints now are coming from liberals and Democrats who say many polls include a disproportionate number of Republicans. 
 In both cases, pollsters said, the differences reflected shifts in how people identify themselves, shifts that are inevitable and not necessarily meaningful. When Mr. Bush gains in popularity, for instance, more people are likely to identify themselves as Republicans. 
 MoveOn.org said there were too many Republicans surveyed in the Gallup poll, which showed Mr. Bush with a 13-point lead over Mr. Kerry among likely voters the week before last, when other polls taken around the same time, including those of the Pew Center and Harris Interactive, showed the race to be a tie. The most recent Gallup poll showed Mr. Bush with an eight-point lead.
 The group's advertisement said that George Gallup Jr., whose father, George Gallup Sr., founded Gallup, ''is a devout evangelical Christian'' who recently said, ''The most profound purpose of polls is to see how people are responding to God.''
 What the advertisement did not say was that Mr. Gallup, who retired in May, is not involved in the company's political polling and made those comments in reference to his specialty and main interest -- polling people on their religious beliefs.
 ''We're simply pointing out that there are problems with Gallup's methodology,'' said Peter Schurman, executive director of MoveOn, ''that their numbers can't be relied on and it's coincidentally also the case that George Gallup Jr. has said some things that could raise questions.''
 Frank Newport, the editor in chief of the Gallup Organization, said of MoveOn.org, ''We have a group that doesn't like that their candidate is behind in most polling, if not all polling, and therefore they're shooting out at the messenger.''
 Mr. Newport said that the newspaper advertisement incorrectly asserted that Gallup had stated that its findings were predictive of what would happen on Election Day, when the organization actually takes pains to make it clear that its findings only reflect the electorate's mood at the time the poll was taken. He rejected the contention that Gallup had any methodological flaws.

HEADLINE: A 3-Decade Campaign Is Over: Baseball Is Back in Washington

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Back in the days when the Washington Senators were losers, which was often, there was a saying: ''First in war, first in peace, and last in the American League.''
 Now, the city has a chance to change that karma.
 It is getting a National League team, specifically the moribund Montreal Expos.
 The Expos have been owned by Major League Baseball since early 2002, and they have fared about as well as some of those old Senators clubs, which won only one World Series from 1901 to 1971.
 But at least there are some good historic vibes: word that baseball was dispatching the Expos to the nation's capital came on the 80th anniversary of the original Senators' clinching the American League pennant in the only season in which they went on to win the World Series. 
 There has been no formal approval of the Expos' move, but then, baseball has nowhere else to send the Expos. The move still needs the approval of three-quarters of the other 29 teams. Owners will assemble for their vote in November.
 The relocation is also contingent upon the sale of the team and passage by the District of Columbia City Council of a $440 million financing package. 
 That package would renovate R.F.K. Stadium (designed for football as well as baseball), which is earmarked as the former Expos' home for the next three seasons, and would be used to build a new ballpark on the Anacostia River waterfront in an area scheduled for economic development.
 ''This was a team that had to be moved,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said in a teleconference in which he announced that he had authorized the Expos' move to Washington. ''We knew it had to relocate. Baseball didn't want to own it anymore. This was a team owned by baseball that we were anxious to get rid of.''
 A name for the team has not yet been chosen.
 ''Happy days are here again!'' exulted Charlie Brotman, a former public-address announcer for the Senators, at a news conference at the City Museum, where fans wore Senators, and Expos regalia, and cheered public officials jammed onto a stage with the type of bunting seen at World Series games.
 ''Thanks for making us a major league city,'' shouted one fan.
 None of the great Senators of the past -- to be honest, there were not that many -- were in the crowd. But Fred Valentine was there. So was Chuck Hinton.
 Frank Howard, Harmon Killebrew and Camilo Pascual were elsewhere.
 But Brotman seemed to be certain that he will be part of a tradition for the Senators dating to William Howard Taft in 1910: having the president of the United States throw out the first ball of the season.
 So this is major news for Washington and for Major League Baseball.
 ''This is a great day for Washington,'' Mayor Anthony A. Williams said at the news conference. ''After 30 years of waiting and waiting, lots of hard work, and more than a few prayers, there will be baseball in Washington in 2005.''
 This is the first relocation of a major league team since last time the Senators left, after the 1971 season. These were the expansion Senators, who were taken to Arlington, Tex., by their owner, Bob Short. Those Senators replaced the original Senators, whose owner, the penurious Calvin Griffith, moved them after the 1960 season to Minneapolis, where they survive quite nicely as the Minnesota Twins.
 The Twins, those born-again Senators, were not long ago designated for elimination from the major leagues by Selig, as were the Expos, who would not have been available for Washington's warm embrace if not for baseball's scotching the plan.
 Eventually, baseball purchased the Expos for $120 million from Jeffrey Loria, who then acquired the Florida Marlins. But the Expos kept losing key players because of baseball's budgetary limitations.
 Now baseball will auction the new Washington team to the highest bidder. Among the prospective owners are the Washington Baseball Club, a group of investors that has been part of the lobbying to bring a team back to the city, and Mark Broxmeyer, a real estate developer based in Commack, N.Y.
 The prospect of the Expos' arrival has displeased Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, who are only 35 miles away.
 Angelos and Bob DuPuy, baseball's president and chief operating officer, have negotiated a compensation package over the past few weeks that would avert the prospect of the Orioles' owner suing baseball for letting another team encroach on what he believes is his territory.
 A deal with Angelos has not been completed, but The Baltimore Sun and The Washington Post have reported that it includes an equity stake in a new regional sports network that would exceed the Washington team's and an assurance from baseball that the value of the Orioles will not be reduced through competition with the new team. The newspapers also said that baseball will make up any shortfall in Orioles revenue if attendance falls below a certain figure.
 ''I believe Peter has been treated fairly,'' said Selig, who refused to disclose the status of the talks with Angelos. Selig has said he did not want to do anything in the process to anger Angelos, a longtime ally.
 ''We came to a conclusion that there has to be equity on all sides,'' Selig said. ''I'm confident with what has been done.'' 
 Angelos said in a statement Wednesday night: ''Our negotiations with Major League Baseball are continuing. We have made substantial progress but have not yet reached an agreement. Our aim has been to protect and preserve the Orioles franchise and the economic benefits it has generated for Baltimore for the past 50 years. Equally important have been our efforts to protect Maryland's investment in Camden Yards.''
 Washington's city government is making things very affordable for the future owner of the Expos, who have been playing in the ugly Olympic Stadium and in Puerto Rico.
 The city plans to pay off the bonds on its large investment in baseball with rent from the team and a combination of taxes on tickets, concessions and souvenirs and taxes on businesses with annual revenue of more than $3 million.
 Public officials on Wednesday were sensitive to criticism that tax money would be better spent on schools, hospitals and other social services.
 ''This is not financed with any citywide tax,'' said Linda Cropp, chairman of the District of Columbia City Council. ''The cost of the stadium will be financed with new money. If it wasn't for baseball, these tax dollars wouldn't be coming into the city.''
 Marc Ganis, a leading sports business consultant, said in a telephone interview that Cropp is partly correct. But regarding the tax on businesses, he said: ''The same tax revenues could go to schools or hospitals. Who's to say it couldn't be? When governmental entities want to promote something like a stadium, they say the money they're using couldn't be used for general purposes.'' 
 The council needed baseball's approval for the Expos to move by Friday to have time to submit and pass legislation required for financing.
 Asked what will happen if the legislation does not pass, Selig said he is not expecting failure. ''The people in Washington are optimists, and so I'm very hopeful,'' he said. 
 Such high spirits might exorcise the sad-sack history of the Senators.

HEADLINE: Dallas Publisher to Cut 3% of Its Workers

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Continuing its efforts to restore the confidence of investors and advertisers after the discovery of exaggerated circulation figures at The Dallas Morning News, the Belo Corporation said yesterday that it would pare the company's work force by about 3 percent before year's end.
 The company also said it would consider canceling up to $2.1 million in future bonuses for senior executives, including those ultimately responsible for circulation.
 In announcing what it described as a revised operating strategy, the company, which is based in Dallas, said that the staff cuts would have been imposed regardless of the paper's circulation woes, because of the struggling economy in Dallas. About 250 jobs will be eliminated, the bulk of them at The Morning News. 
 But in an indication that the scandal continues to weigh on the company's immediate financial prospects, Belo chose yesterday to also release the results of its investigation of the practices that had resulted in the circulation overstatements, which the company disclosed in early August. 
 The investigation, which was conducted by an outside law firm and supervised by a committee of the board, revealed that the problems stemmed from the corporate culture within The Morning News's circulation department. It said that senior managers there pressured their subordinates to achieve ambitious increases in readership, dangled trips and cash before outside contractors as inducements to meet those goals and used insufficient procedures to monitor the returns of newspapers.
 Of particular relevance, said Robert W. Decherd, the chairman, president and chief executive of Belo, was a circulation policy adopted in 1999 at The Morning News, which stopped giving credits to independent contractors for single-copy newspapers that were unsold at newsstands or at other retail outlets. While Belo has yet to restate circulation figures that far back, it said that the overstatements probably began then as a result of a policy that effectively discouraged reporting unsold papers, and grew gradually each year thereafter.
 ''This has been a disappointing and embarrassing incident,'' Mr. Decherd said in a conference call with reporters. ''It's the most disappointing event in my almost 18 years as chief executive.''
 Belo -- which owns The Providence Journal and two other daily newspapers, as well as 19 television stations -- is one of three companies that have announced since early June that at least one of their papers had overstated its readership. The disclosures have jolted an industry that has struggled in recent years to hold readers and advertisers.
 Belo said yesterday that in October, when The Morning News reports its average circulation for the six months ending today, those figures will have fallen by 5.1 percent on a daily basis and 11.9 percent on Sunday as compared with those reported for the same period a year ago.
 The company said yesterday that it had reviewed the circulation practices at its other papers and found no improprieties.
 Last month, Belo said it had set aside $23 million to repay Morning News advertisers, who had been led to believe that their ads were being seen by more readers than they actually were. The company said yesterday that it had mailed or delivered 19,000 checks to those advertisers in recent weeks, and that nearly three-quarters of those checks had cleared.
 William Drewry, a media analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, who participated in a conference call Mr. Decherd held for analysts, said he remained wary about the company's prospects for moving forward any time soon, particularly in terms of what it is able to charge advertisers.
 ''Any newspaper or TV or radio station depends on price increases to grow revenue,'' Mr. Drewry said. ''This has limited the newspaper's ability to raise prices at the historic rate they've usually been able to.
 ''From a growth rate perspective, which is what investors care about,'' he added, ''they may be stuck with this problem for a while.''
 Shares of Belo, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed yesterday at $22, down 9 cents.

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth Tops First Estimate

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
The United States economy grew at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the spring, the government reported on Wednesday, better than a previous estimate but still the weakest showing in more than a year.
 The Commerce Department said the April-to-June increase in the gross domestic product was revised upward by half a percentage point from its estimate, made just a month ago, that the economy expanded at a 2.8 percent pace. 
 Even with the revision, the 3.3 percent growth rate was down significantly from the 4.5 percent rate of increase during the January-March quarter, as consumers, buffeted by rising energy prices, cut back sharply on their spending in other areas. It was the slowest growth rate since a 1.9 percent increase in the first three months of 2003.
 The biggest factor contributing to the upward revision in second-quarter growth came from a reduction in the amount of imports coming into the country. Other factors were an upward revision in the estimates of United States exports and a larger buildup of inventories.
 The 3.3 percent overall growth rate in the second quarter followed four quarters of extraordinary growth as the economy expanded at rates of 4.1 percent in the spring of 2003 and then 7.4 percent in the summer, the largest surge in 20 years. The economy grew 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter last year and 4.5 percent in the first quarter this year.
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has called the early summer slowdown a ''soft patch'' and has predicted that the economy will rebound to stronger growth rates, a prediction that private economists worry could turn out to be overly optimistic.
 This week, the price of crude oil topped the $50-a-barrel mark, a record. Analysts saw surging oil prices as a threat to the expansion.

HEADLINE: Asian Immigrants Become Political Force in Flushing

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Dr. Kent Chin, a Chinese immigrant who lives in Flushing, Queens, became an American citizen last year and on Sept. 14 voted in his first American election: the Democratic primary for State Assembly.
 His vote helped Jimmy K. Meng, a partner in a Flushing lumber company, defeat Barry S. Grodenchik, an incumbent backed by the powerful Queens County Democratic machine. Mr. Meng is now on a near-certain path to be the first Asian-American state legislator in New York. 
 But the reasons that Mr. Chin favored Mr. Meng have less to do with the candidate's politics than with his background: Mr. Meng is a Chinese immigrant, just like Mr. Chin.
 ''I'm proud that the first time I voted I was part of a milestone for Asian-Americans,'' said Mr. Chin, 50, an economist for Citibank, comparing it to the 2001 election of Councilman John Liu, a Flushing Democrat who became the first Asian-American elected to public office in the city. ''We're finally seeing the Asian political strength here in Flushing, and it is increasing very quickly.''
 There have been allegations of hundreds of questionable voter registrations in the race, and they are being investigated by the city's Board of Elections. The board, however, certified Mr. Meng as the winner on Tuesday, saying the contested votes would not have changed the outcome.
 It is clear, though, that Mr. Meng's campaign did succeed in drawing many first-time Asian-American voters like Mr. Chin to the polls, and Mr. Meng's aides say those voters were the key to their victory. They concentrated on signing up unregistered Asian residents -- about 1,000, they claim -- and not all were Chinese. Mr. Meng won by about 600 votes out of some 5,500 votes cast.
 ''The key thing was that the Koreans and the Chinese were together on this,'' said Gary Tilzer, Mr. Meng's campaign consultant. ''That's never happened before.''
 The unusual combined force of several ethnic groups in the race has cheered those who have long hoped for a stronger Asian voice in local politics. Uma Sengupta, a Democratic district leader for the 25th Assembly District, which is adjacent to the 22nd, said that what happened this month in Flushing would become a pattern in future elections. As fledgling immigrant enclaves grow and gain political awareness, she said, they will form united voting blocs and threaten entrenched politicians, whether it is Colombians in Jackson Heights, Guyanese in Richmond Hill or Bukharans in Forest Hills.
 ''What happened to Jimmy Meng, you are going to see all over Queens,'' said Ms. Sengupta, the first South Asian woman to become a Democratic district leader in the city. ''Asians are saying we want our own representatives, and other political scenes are changing too. Within 10 years, you will see a completely different political environment.''
 Rupa Parekh, of the Asian Pacific American Voters Alliance, said that the future of Queens politics would largely be shaped by similar situations in other immigrant communities.
 ''In Flushing, Jackson Heights and all over Queens, new immigrants are really picking up that voting is part of the assimilation process,'' she said. ''We're voting, and people are suddenly realizing that we're not invisible any more. It's happening faster than other ethnic communities in the past.''
 The 22nd Assembly District, which lies east of the Van Wyck Expressway, from the Long Island Expressway to several blocks north of Northern Boulevard, was redrawn in 2001 so that it encompassed more completely the Asian-American community and united the Asian vote.
 It was once dominated by Irish, Italian, German and Jewish immigrants, but the number of Asian-Americans, mostly Chinese and Koreans, in Flushing has quadrupled over the past two decades. The district is now just more than half Asian-American and has more Asians than Manhattan's Chinatown.
 All over the district, diners that once served matzo ball soup have been transformed into noodle shops. Irish bars with faded facades drown in a sea of storefronts bearing signs in Chinese and Korean. Flushing Library has books in some 50 different languages, and newspaper racks are covered with The World Journal and other Chinese and Korean papers.
 Veronica S. Jung, executive director for the Korean American League for Civic Action, said that it was difficult to tell exactly how many Korean-Americans voted for Mr. Meng, but that his candidacy was certainly well known throughout Flushing's large Korean community, in part because he was an Asian candidate and because he bought campaign advertisements in the local Korean papers.
 Officials from Mr. Grodenchik's campaign complain that Mr. Meng ignored the issues in Albany and simply made his ethnicity his platform.
 ''His campaign was heavily based on racial appeal,'' said Mr. Liu, who helped run Mr. Grodenchik's campaign. ''Their literature was basically, 'Vote for me because I'm Chinese.'''
 Mr. Liu said that although he favored having more Asian-American elected officials, he supported Mr. Grodenchik, who is Jewish, because of their long friendship and working relationship and political agreement.
 Mr. Meng's campaign manager, his daughter Grace, said that during the campaign, officials worked from voter rolls listing voters by ethnicity. Mr. Meng, who speaks Mandarin, always kept Korean- and Spanish-speaking workers alongside him on the campaign trail.
 ''Even while phone banking in the office, we always had those three languages covered,'' Ms. Meng said. Mr. Tilzer added that the campaign approached voters with a simple two-pronged message: Mr. Meng could fix the broken legislative system in Albany, and being Asian, he could truly understand the voters' needs.

HEADLINE: 3 Weeks After Hurricane, Grenada's Life Is Still in Ruins

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Alfred Morain could hardly summon the words to describe what he experiences when he looks at his land filled with dead nutmeg trees, which Hurricane Ivan felled as it swept over this island three weeks ago, blowing away Mr. Morain's livelihood with it. 
 ''There is real devastation in my heart,'' he said Tuesday, surrounded by his wife and four children outside the 10-by-12-foot wooden shack he calls home. 
 Like thousands of other Grenadians, Mr. Morain is struggling to rebuild amid the wreckage left behind by Ivan, one of the most powerful storms to hit the Caribbean and the United States in decades. 
 Perhaps no island suffered more damage than Grenada, a relatively prosperous former British colony where tourism and the spice trade are the mainstays of the economy. At least 39 people were killed.
 Now it is an island where the houses have no roofs and the streets are lined with debris. The winds ripped the tops off of most buildings, destroyed churches and schools, knocked down most of the island's power lines and left corrugated steel roofing littered along the streets like used tissue paper. 
 Looting broke out on the island, twice the size of Washington, D.C., after the storm hit on Sept. 7, damaging at least 90 percent of the buildings and leaving several thousand of the 100,000 residents homeless. 
 To complicate security, the warden of the island's only prison let all the inmates out during the storm. About 200 troops from neighboring countries were shipped in to help the local police quell the looters and track down convicts who did not return voluntarily to prison. Only about a dozen convicts are still at large, said a police spokesman, Troy Garvey. But a dusk-to-dawn curfew remains in place, and troops with automatic weapons still guard banks in St. George's downtown.
 Government officials and aid workers said clean drinking water and food were still scarce on much of the island, despite deliveries of aid coordinated by the National Emergency Relief Organization. Most residents still lack electricity and telephone lines, they said.
 All over the island this week, people could be seen putting tarps up to replace lost roofs and hammering together small frame houses that had collapsed in the storm. The high winds and tornadoes spawned by Ivan destroyed the roof and stained-glass windows of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, as well as the prime minister's residence and the governor general's mansion. 
 Several yachts capsized or ran aground in St. George's harbor, a popular destination for avid sailors. Schools are closed indefinitely. 
 Prime Minister Keith C. Mitchell estimated the damage at more than $1 billion. The island's two main crops, cocoa and nutmeg, have been wiped out, and it will take at least a decade to regrow the nutmeg groves. Most of the major tourist hotels were badly damaged as well. Several large airlines, among them Virgin Atlantic, have suspended flights to the island indefinitely. 
 It has been a devastating psychological blow for the residents of this country, where a United States-led invasion in 1983 toppled a military-installed Marxist government. Grenada has seen an average 7 percent growth in its economy for the last nine years and has not been through a major hurricane in more than four decades, Mr. Mitchell said.
 ''The devastation caused by Ivan was almost total, and as I have indicated to people, the devastation is even worse from a psychological standpoint,'' he said in an interview on Tuesday. ''People have never gone through anything like this, and I think most people had certain plans for their own lives, certain calculations about when they want to retire, when they want to do certain things, what additional things they want to do, the education of their children. And all of a sudden, they see everything that they have just thrown in pieces on the ground.''
 Hotel owners and others in the tourist trade were some of the hardest hit. Andre Cherman, a 52-year-old hotelier, woke up after the storm to find Ivan had demolished more than half the rooms in the Coyaba Beach Resort, the three-star hotel that is his pride and joy. The roof is gone. Rubble fills his office and the courtyard. There is still no power or safe water. 
 Mr. Cherman estimates that it will take $6.5 million and at least a year of work to restore his hotel. In the meantime, he has laid off all but a handful of his 95 employees. He is not alone. Most of the tourist hotels on the long, white beach south of St. George's are shuttered indefinitely.
 ''Everybody's in a state of shock on the island,'' Mr. Cherman said, sitting in his hotel's lobby, surrounded by wreckage. While Mr. Cherman had insurance, many of the 7,500 farmers who depend on nutmeg for a living did not. They have no hope of replanting the trees anytime soon, and it takes a decade for a nutmeg tree to become fruitful. The island normally produces about six million pounds of nutmeg a year. Mr. Morain, the nutmeg farmer, said he would start planting vegetables, bananas and other subsistence crops to feed his children. About three-quarters of his income used to come from the 16 acres of nutmeg trees he tended and harvested every year. It brought in about $3,500 a year, which was just enough to survive on, with some odd jobs to help make ends meet, he said. 
 ''We will have to go back to the land and plant up,'' said the 43-year-old Mr. Morain, surveying piles of brown nutmeg trees behind his house. ''It's the land you understand. That's where the food must come from. Back to square one, man.'' Other nutmeg farmers in the Apres Tout area said they were not sure they would be able to start over. One was Harris Phillip, a 73-year-old farmer who has lived off his nutmeg trees for 50 years. He said he was too old to begin anew, too crippled from arthritis. He has no savings. He has no idea how to survive the coming year. 
 ''It's a bad disaster,'' he says, sitting on a hillside, looking over his ruined lands and the Caribbean's deep blue beyond. ''I don't know where to put me hand now. I don't know what to do.''

HEADLINE: Newark Mayor Proposes Panel To Oversee Housing Agency

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Mayor Sharpe James said on Wednesday that he would appoint a nine-member committee to monitor the Newark Housing Authority's role in the proposed $310 million downtown arena if the project wins approval by the Newark City Council.
 The mayor cited recent allegations of questionable spending at the authority, which has come under fire for nepotism and for starting a $1 million renovation of its offices just before laying off 84 people earlier this month. As the city's redevelopment entity, the authority will be technically responsible for managing the arena's financing and construction. 
 ''We checked ourselves like a quarterback at the line,'' the mayor said Wednesday after a public hearing on the arena project. ''We immediately saw that the Housing Authority could not handle the ball.'' 
 Supporters of the arena see the overall project as the city's biggest downtown overhaul in decades -- a 32.9-acre project that would include an 18,500-seat arena for the New Jersey Devils and a mix of retail shopping, a community center, parks and a hotel. 
 The Devils have offered to contribute $110 million for the arena, and the Housing Authority has issued $200 million in bonds. The bonds are secured by guaranteed annual payments of $12.5 million a year from a supplement to the annual rent the city receives from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to operate Newark Liberty International Airport. Funds for the rest of the downtown development have not been secured.
 Richard Monteilh, the city's business administrator, has said for months that the Housing Authority would simply be a conduit, not a major player, and he reiterated that yesterday. The bond payments are covered by the Port Authority, he said, and major financial and construction decisions ''will come through me.'' 
 However, under an outline of the deal given to reporters yesterday, the Housing Authority would be contractually responsible for negotiating contracts involving the project. Mr. Monteilh said the oversight committee had been created to ease citizens' concerns about the agency's role and to involve City Council members. A vote by the Council is scheduled for Monday. 
 The Housing Authority provides 32,000 citizens with apartments or vouchers to pay their rent, and has built more than 1,000 apartments in the past decade. 
 It came under fire earlier this month for its hiring practices and for renovations to its headquarters, which included the purchase of a $2,850 plasma television. Federal housing officials sent a letter to the agency's board of commissioners on Sept. 16, asking why four direct relatives of Harold Lucas, the agency's executive director, were employed by the agency, and why a $25,000 contract was given to a nonprofit organization run by his daughter.
 Mr. Lucas has denied doing anything improper. But Mayor James said on Wednesday that the commission would be created to ''send a strong message that we're watching what's going on.'' 
 The mayor said he planned to appoint all nine members: three from the City Council, three from his administration and three from outside the government, including at least one from a commission that was set up this year to evaluate the arena proposal. 
 Critics of the city's redevelopment plan said yesterday that they doubted the commission would work.
 Richard Cammarieri, a lifelong Newark resident and activist, said oversight commissions in Newark had a long history of inactivity. Councilman Luis Quintana challenged the mayor to put his plan for the commission in writing, and questioned who would be chosen.
 ''The mayor will select the same people as always,'' he said. ''If you're not a 'yes person' you won't be on the committee.''

HEADLINE: Decrease in Oil Prices Helps Send Share Prices Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as the price of oil declined and a government report showed that the economy grew faster in the second quarter than previously reported.
 Technology companies, including Intel and Texas Instruments, led the advance as investors shifted from energy shares to the market's worst performers this year.
 ''We are very near a top in oil prices and we're very near a bottom in equity prices,'' said Richard Campagna, who helps manage $700 million at Shaker Investments Inc. in Cleveland. The economy is ''still strong'' and will accelerate in 2005, he said. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 58.84 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,136.24. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 4.74 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,114.80, erasing its loss for the year. The Nasdaq composite index, which gets 41 percent of its value from computer-related shares, added 24.07 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,893.94.
 Intel led gains among semiconductor stocks. A gauge of chip and chip-equipment makers increased 2 percent, for the biggest rally among the S.&P. 500's 24 industry groups. The semiconductor index has declined 31 percent this year, the worst performance in the benchmark, amid lower sales forecasts.
 Computer-related shares may rebound because profit estimates have been lowered too much, Mr. Campagna said.
 Intel rose 39 cents, to $20.07. 
 Texas Instruments, the maker of the chips that ran more than half the mobile phones sold last year, gained 62 cents, to $21.40.
 Oil prices slipped yesterday after the Energy Department reported an unexpected increase in United States stockpiles last week and concern eased that Nigerian rebels would attack oil operations. Crude for November delivery fell 39 cents, to $49.51 a barrel in New York trading, after rising above $50 a barrel on Tuesday.
 A measure of oil producers and refiners in the S.&P. 500 fell 1 percent as a drop in oil prices prompted investors to move out of the sector, this year's best performer. Energy stocks as a group have jumped 23 percent in 2004.
 Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, fell 38 cents, to $48.15. ChevronTexaco, the No.2 U.S. oil company, declined 44 cents, to $53.63.
 ConocoPhillips lost $1.64, to $81.57. The company said that it would pay $1.99 billion for Russia's 7.6 percent stake in Lukoil, the nation's largest oil producer. 
 The Commerce Department said yesterday that the economy expanded at an annual pace of 3.3 percent last quarter, faster than an estimate of 2.8 percent in August. 
 Industrial stocks gained as the government said spending on software, equipment and machinery rose at an annual pace of 14.2 percent. That is faster than the 13.6 percent rate estimated last month and the 8 percent growth pace reported in the first quarter.
 Caterpillar, the maker of earthmoving equipment, gained $3.60, to $80.50; it raised its 2004 sales forecast. Alcoa jumped 55 cents, to $33.25.
 Boeing, the best performer in the Dow average this year, fell $1.31, to $51.01. A Banc of America Securities analyst, Nick Fothergill, said sales of the company's 7E7 aircraft had been weaker than expected and demand for new planes might drop further as American and European airlines struggle with rising oil prices. Mr. Fothergill cut his rating on Boeing to neutral from buy.
 Orbitz jumped $6.40, to $27.17. Cendant agreed to buy the company for $1.25 billion, becoming the second-biggest competitor in the online travel market. Cendant, a hotel franchiser, will pay $27.50 a share, a 32 percent premium over Tuesday's closing price. Shares of Cendant fell 9 cents, to $21.93.
 Shares of IAC/InterActiveCorp, which owns the travel Internet sites Expedia.com and Hotels.com, rose $1.27, to $22.07. 
 Priceline.com, a seller of discount travel services on the Internet, rallied $2.15, to $22.13.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note had its biggest price decline in almost a month after the government said that the economy grew at a faster pace in the spring than was reported earlier. The price of the 10-year note fell 24/32, to 101 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.09 percent, from 4 percent on Tuesday. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes and 14-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Asks China to Free Its Currency From Dollar

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund added its voice on Wednesday to the growing calls for China to float its currency immediately, a move that supporters say would help reduce the United States trade deficit and strengthen the global economy.
 On the eve of annual meetings here with the World Bank, Rodrigo de Rato, the managing director of the I.M.F., said that it would be to China's advantage to uncouple the yuan from the dollar. 
 The tight link to the United States currency has been blamed for making foreign goods too costly in China and Chinese exports unfairly inexpensive.
 ''There should be more flexible currencies, not only for China but the whole of Asia,'' Mr. de Rato said to a group of 10 journalists at his headquarters. 
 China is expected to make some concession on currency when its finance minister and central bank governor attend their first meeting with representatives of the Group of 7 wealthy industrialized countries at a dinner here on Friday. 
 The meeting is a sign of China's growing economic power, and with that acknowledgement has come even stronger pressure to float or revalue the currency, which is pegged at 8.28 yuan to the dollar.
 In its World Economic Outlook released on Wednesday, the I.M.F. argued that a more flexible currency would not only help the world economy but would also help tame inflation in China and cool its fast-growing economy. ''Risks of overheating have not yet abated,'' said the report, which said that further monetary tightening would be aided ''by greater exchange flexibility.''
 The United States Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, has promised to use the dinner on Friday to press China on its currency. But a group of Democratic lawmakers, with the encouragement of American manufacturers and labor unions, have said they do not trust the administration to win concessions from China and have said they will file a petition on Thursday, seeking to force China to alter its currency.
 The petition will ask the administration to sue China at the World Trade Organization, saying it has violated trade laws by failing to revalue its currency. At least five senators and a dozen members of the House signed the measure because they said that they saw no evidence that China was planning any immediate change in its currency rate.
 ''One year ago Treasury Secretary John Snow said he was encouraged China was moving towards a flexible rate,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan. ''Today he's still encouraged. But I'm just so tired of the administration thinking that this rhetoric is a substitute for real action.''
 On another critical matter, Mr. de Rato has joined with James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, in support of debt relief for the world's poorest nations, as long as rich countries promise an increase in aid for all programs.
 In an interview in his office before the beginning of this week's meetings, Mr. Wolfensohn said he worried that the poor who did not live in Iraq or Afghanistan were being forgotten.
 ''There is more than the war on terror,'' he said. ''The imbalance in the world is greater than ever before; it is more obscured and permanent, and that leads to despair, hopelessness, a lack of development.''
 Support for debt relief has grown since Britain announced on Sunday that it would pay off 10 percent of the total owed by poor countries to international agencies and challenged other wealthy nations to follow suit. Governments, aid agencies and relief groups have long asserted that developing countries would never climb out of their poverty if they were required to pay more to service debts incurred by irresponsible former governments than they can spend to improve health, education and other basic services.
 Both debt relief and currency exchange rates will be important issues at the meetings to be held throughout the weekend.
 In a departure from previous meetings, few demonstrators are expected this year. Protestors seem far more concerned about the war in Iraq and the American presidential campaign than loan conditions and debt relief. Security will still be tight outside the two agencies' headquarters, which are near the White House. About 100 people are expected at an all-night vigil on Friday to promote debt relief.
 The United States has its own plan for debt relief, drawn up after the administration was unable to persuade the rest of the Group of 7 to agree on debt relief for Iraq, a country that is too wealthy for standard debt forgiveness. 
 Britain has argued that the debt owed to the I.M.F. could be cut by revaluation of the fund's gold stocks. At the current value of $40 an ounce, the stocks are worth $8.5 billion, but the market price for gold is now over $400 an ounce.
 Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, praised Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, and said in a statement that ''the massive gold reserve of the I.M.F. can comfortably finance the cancellation of debt without affecting the financial status of any government or institution.
 ''After years of devastation,'' he added, ''the boards of these institutions can give people in impoverished countries something to celebrate.''
 In Zambia, for instance, the government is spending more on debt repayments than on education, according to a report to be released on Friday by Oxfam International and V.S.O., an international charity. In order to meet conditions imposed by the I.M.F. to keep inflation down, the government has put a ceiling on hiring new teachers, the report said.
 Roy Mwaba, the general secretary of the Zambian National Union of Teachers, traveled here to use the report to try to persuade the I.M.F. to provide debt relief. He said in an interview ''that the scenario is quite gloomy without debt relief.''
 ''All of this is having adverse impact on education in Zambia,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Finds Vietnam

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HANOI 

 BODY:
With a portrait of Ho Chi Minh gazing down benevolently opposite the doorway and fan blades making leisurely orbits above, the long green room looks as if it could still belong to officials from the Communist-controlled legislature here, its former occupants.
 Instead, the room holds one of the more unusual outposts in the shift of clerical jobs to ever-poorer countries in the developing world.
 Rows of young university graduates working for World'Vest Base, a company based in Chicago, scan the Internet for everything from emerging market stock prices to corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States. They copy data into spreadsheets and e-mail it to clients around the world.
 Vietnam is making a big push to turn itself into an outsourcing powerhouse. Mathematics instruction has long been the strong suit of Vietnam's educational system, and now the country's government is trying to train people across the country in computer skills. 
 At the same time, wages remain extremely low: World'Vest Base hires recent graduates with accounting or finance degrees, but no experience, for a starting salary of $100 a month, little more than an unskilled factory worker earns in neighboring China.
 Very low wages and strong math skills are a combination that has made believers of some experts. ''You're going to see Vietnam competing with India and some of the other countries doing this within the next five years,'' said Pete Peterson, a prisoner of war here for six years during the Vietnam War who went on to become the first United States ambassador after President Clinton normalized relations.
 Yet Vietnam still faces considerable obstacles in its pursuit of the kind of low-skill jobs that now employ hundreds of thousands of people in India, Malaysia and the Philippines, let alone the higher-paid computer programming jobs that have helped turn Indian cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad into prosperous models of economic development.
 With the approach of the 30th anniversary of the fall of Saigon next spring, Vietnam remains one of the poorest countries on Earth. It still struggles under a Communist government that has moved more slowly than China's to embrace capitalism.
 Government bureaucracy and regulations remain pervasive, especially here in northern Vietnam. Skills in spoken and written English, a prerequisite for a lot of outsourcing work, remain weak, although skills in French, a legacy of colonial rule, remain fairly strong.
 The road system is in poor shape, especially in comparison with China, and Vietnam lacks the tidal wave of foreign investment that has helped China build so many modern buildings and factories. Multinationals have built some factories in Vietnam, including small auto assembly plants to supply the local market, but have refrained from setting up big telephone call centers, computer programming operations or other service-sector outsourcing.
 ''You're not seeing the I.B.M.'s, H.P.'s or Infosyses of this world charging in there,'' said Philip Hassey, the associate director for Asia and the Pacific at the International Data Corporation.
 Yet a handful of companies have set up shop here. A growing number of Vietnamese who fled the country at the end of the war and afterward have begun to return.
 Atlas Industries Ltd. has 100 people in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, performing the technical tasks of turning architectural drawings from Britain into detailed blueprints that can be used by British construction companies. Joseph Woolf, the company's chief executive and founder, said that he preferred Vietnam to India because Vietnamese employees were more loyal and less inclined to change jobs repeatedly or seek work overseas, two problems some companies have encountered in India.
 ''People are more committed to the company, the country and the family,'' he said.
 At the same time, Mr. Woolf, a former project manager for a succession of British oil companies, said that he was sensitive to concerns that his operation might be taking work from British architects. All his customers in Britain are successful architectural firms that are expanding and adding staff, not laying them off, he insisted. 
 Job losses may be occurring, however, at other firms that are losing market share.
 At the 38-employee operation here of World'Vest Base, young men and women sit at computer terminals with high-speed connections to the Internet. Surfing the Web, they fill spreadsheets with prices from obscure stock markets in places like Kazakhstan and Mauritius, then distribute them to investors specializing in emerging markets.
 For investors seeking gems in bigger stock markets, they glean financial data from French annual reports and comb S.E.C. filings. They also gather data from local companies seeking to prove their creditworthiness to international banks.
 Nam Nhat Tran, 28, found the annual report of Groupe Global Graphics in France online and copied the company's cash reserves into a database; her screensaver is a photo of the red wooden footbridge that has long been a symbol of Hanoi and a rendezvous point for lovers.
 Nguyen Cam Nhung, 23, an experienced hand after six months on the job, sat nearby and coached Tran Trong Tuan, 25 and newly hired. He scrolled up and down through an S.E.C. filing from the American company 3M, looking for depreciation figures from last year.
 ''I'm learning new things about finance,'' Mr. Tuan said.
 Jonathan Bloch, the chief executive of Exchange Data International, a company based in London that distributes financial information to big investment banks and other customers, said that data from World'Vest Base was inexpensive and reliable.
 ''We outsource also in India and the Czech Republic,'' he said. ''Vietnam compares very favorably; I think they're on a par.''
 In coming to Vietnam, Philippe O. Piette, the chief executive of World'Vest, who was born in Antwerp, the Netherlands, has followed an odyssey that says much about how far some companies are willing to look these days for cheap labor.
 Trying four years ago to expand overseas, he initially considered Dubai because he wanted to sell market data from Arabic-speaking countries. But he found costs in Dubai were too high, and that few Arabs were available anyway.
 ''The labor pool was all Indians, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis and Filipinos -- no Arabs,'' he said.
 Mr. Piette considered India, but was discouraged by what he saw as sloppiness and poor quality in data-entry operations there. So he ended up opening an operation three years ago in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a polyglot nation with many linguistic groups that were brought together before it gained independence from Britain in stages, beginning in 1957. But wages in Kuala Lumpur are still fairly high: $450 a month for a new graduate and as much as $800 a month for someone with a few months of experience. Even worse for Mr. Piette was the job-hopping.
 ''We lost a whole slew of people -- we're the perfect training ground for the investment banks and brokerage houses,'' he said.
 Mr. Piette, a naturalized American, wanted to offer more data from French-speaking countries and looked to former French colonies in Indochina. He called a diplomat to inquire about Cambodia, was told it was hopeless, and flew to Hanoi late last year instead.
 Five decades after independence from France, Hanoi is still poor, with practically no skyscrapers and streets still filled with motorcycles and bicycles. When Mr. Piette tried to place an overseas call from his hotel, it took him nine hours to get an international phone line.
 Dismayed but not deterred by the delay, he kept investigating.
 He found that Vietnam had not only plenty of French speakers and some English speakers, but also lots of people who spoke Russian and German, having worked in the former Soviet Union and the former East Germany. While World'Vest Base still has 56 employees in Kuala Lumpur, its biggest expansion now is in Vietnam, where Mr. Piette now pays up to $400 a month to some of his first hires who are especially productive and have stuck with the company.
 Being a native French speaker has helped in navigating the government bureaucracy.
 ''The whole country runs on who you know, not what you know,'' Mr. Piette said. ''It's true of most countries, but it's particularly true here.''


CORRECTION-DATE: October 2, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in World Business on Thursday about Vietnam's efforts to attract outsourcing jobs misstated the location of Antwerp, birthplace of Philippe O. Piette, the chief executive of World'Vest Base, which has offices in Vietnam. The city is in Belgium, not the Netherlands.

To the Editor:
 Re ''School Cellphone Bans Topple (You Can't Suspend Everyone)'' (front page, Sept. 29):
 When both of my children were in New York City public high schools in 2001, I was wholeheartedly against their owning cellphones. My son was a senior at the High School of Economics and Finance, a block south of the World Trade Center.
 Because we had no way to reach each other, I did not know that he was alive until the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The next Saturday, both children and I went to a phone store and bought phones. 
 From that day on, it has been of utmost importance to me to know that I can call my kids and find out where they are and, most important, to know that they are all right.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New Jersey: Trenton: Number Of Poor Children Rises

BYLINE: By Jessica Bruder (NYT); Compiled by George James

 BODY:
The number of poor children living in New Jersey's cities is rising, while state efforts to support them are falling, according to a report released by the Association for Children of New Jersey, a child advocacy organization. The report found that the 535,000 children living in New Jersey's 25 largest cities fell well below statewide averages in 20 of 26 indicators. Children in urban areas, who made up 26 percent of the state's total child population in the 2000 census, were more likely to suffer from health problems, abuse and neglect. Jessica Bruder (NYT)

HEADLINE: A New-Style Indian Village Rises From the Dust

BYLINE: By BRADFORD McKEE

DATELINE: WINNEBAGO, Neb. 

 BODY:
PROGRESS has a way of backfiring on the Winnebago tribe of Nebraska. Over the past decade tribal businesses have flourished where poverty had long been the rule. Many of the 2,600 people living amid the rolling green and tan fields of the 120,000-acre Winnebago Indian Reservation have found jobs and begun to make decent money. But some of those same people, finding that their higher incomes made them ineligible for public housing, ended up leaving the reservation because there was no place else there for them to live.
 The tribe's most prominent business leader, Lance Morgan, figured it would literally take a new village to bring the tribe together again. 
 So far, Ho-Chunk Village, just north of town, is a mostly blank slate on which the tribe maps its destiny. A grid of chalk-colored streets is forming on a 38-acre slope of oat grass. Besides an office building and a new Dollar General store near the main road, there are 4 houses at the property's back edge, the first of 110 planned. 
 ''Our original theory was, hey, let's fight the poverty in this community,'' said Mr. Morgan, a thickset 36-year-old with an adolescent brightness about him. ''If we fought poverty, then everything would take care of itself.'' It did not work out that way.
 Since 1994 Mr. Morgan has been chief executive of Ho-Chunk Inc., which the tribe chartered to diversify its economy beyond a modest casino. Today the company includes construction, retail and banking businesses. Tribal unemployment has dropped to 24 percent, from 66 percent in 1998. But a severe housing shortage began to splinter the tribe.
 ''I thought we were about to suffer from our own success,'' Mr. Morgan said.
 Grass-roots housing development is relatively new to Indian tribes, most of which depend on government housing, said Gary L. Gordon, executive director of the housing council. ''Overcrowding is more of an issue in Indian country than homelessness,'' he said, adding that commonly on reservations 20 to 25 people share one house. 
 But with help from federal agencies and foundations, single family homes, a symbol of prosperity most Americans take for granted, are being developed on reservations throughout the country. 
 In all, about 120 tribes are building new housing to ease shortages. This summer the Catawba tribe of South Carolina completed a 124-unit housing development near Rock Hill for $11.3 million. In Montana, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes are finishing redevelopment of a derelict mobile home park on the Flathead Reservation.
 In mid-September the National American Indian Housing Council released a report on the health risks that overcrowded housing on reservations poses to children, including infectious diseases and breathing problems from tobacco smoke. A report last year by the federal Commission on Civil Rights cited an immediate need for 200,000 housing units for Indian families.
 In Winnebago about one-third of households are overcrowded, including the home of David and Robin Redhorn. They live in town with their three children in a house they share with Mrs. Redhorn's sister, her husband and their child. ''There's about eight of us,'' Mr. Redhorn said. ''It's kind of crowded, but we're managing.''
 In October the Redhorn family will become the second to move to Ho-Chunk Village. With guidance from a 40-hour home buyer course offered by the housing authority, Mr. Redhorn, who works at the Heritage Food Store in town, paid off overdue debts to improve his credit record, which qualified him for financial assistance. 
 All Winnebago families are eligible for $15,000 in down payment assistance from Ho-Chunk Inc.'s nonprofit arm for houses on the reservation if they complete the course. Families earning $45,200 or less may qualify for an additional $5,000 from the housing authority. 
 ''We'll have a three-bedroom house, a full basement with a two-car garage, central air and central heat,'' Mr. Redhorn said. ''And a fireplace so we can have a real Christmas. I'm kind of fired up about this.''
 Ho-Chunk Village represents one of the more ambitious ways American Indian tribes are reaching for the workaday prosperity that has eluded them over decades of poverty, disease and political alienation. The sophisticated strategy springs from the tribe's sense that to get ahead it must start from scratch. Until recently, few people here knew about mortgages or the advantages of owning a house.
 Kiva Harden, her three children and her brother, William, are the first residents of Ho-Chunk Village. (''Ho-Chunk'' is a modernized form of Hochungra, the Winnebago tribe's traditional name.) To leave behind a three-bedroom trailer on blocks, Ms. Harden attended the 40-hour home buyer course. She learned to budget, fix broken plumbing and landscape her lot, among other things. In return, Ho-Chunk Inc.'s nonprofit arm and the housing authority gave her down payment grants totaling $20,000. She bought a six-bedroom house with a three-car garage valued at $158,000.
 ''I was pleasantly surprised'' by the house, said Ms. Harden, 30, who works in purchasing at the tribe's WinnaVegas Casino. ''They had it chalked off where they would start digging, and it looked really small.'' Then the house arrived, in modules. ''I couldn't believe how big the rooms were. And once they finished the basement, it's huge.''
 ''I think we're the first in Winnebago to have a three-car garage,'' Ms. Harden added. 
 If the village succeeds, it will hardly be the last of the firsts for the tribe.
 ''The Winnebago are thinking in big terms,'' said Andrew Lee, the executive director of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, based at the Kennedy School of Government. ''They're thinking about how to build a prosperous nation. Housing is part of that process.''
 Housing has become the linchpin in the Winnebago tribe's larger turnaround plan away from welfare subsistence. About 89 percent of the housing in Winnebago, almost 250 units, is publicly financed. Many newly employed tribe members found they were earning more than the threshold -- $36,000 for a family of four -- to qualify for public housing, said Norma Stealer, director of the local housing authority.
 ''And there's nothing else, practically,'' Ms. Stealer said.
 The reservation has no real estate market to speak of. Historically, banks would not lend to prospective borrowers because the federal government holds most tribal lands in trusts, which made them impossible to repossess if borrowers defaulted. In 1992 Congress authorized the Department of Housing and Urban Development to guarantee mortgages on reservations, which began to ease banks' reluctance to lend.
 But other constraints remain. On the Winnebago reservation and others, a ''patchwork'' pattern of land ownership prevails. Large tracts of privately owned land have been handed down as inheritances to many multiple heirs. For someone to use a given parcel, ''you have to get the permission of co-owners -- 100 co-owners,'' said Lisa Whitewing, the chairwoman of Winnebago's planning and zoning commission. ''Most people throw up their hands in disgust,'' she said. ''We call it a teaspoonful of land.''
 As a result, many families have left the reservation. ''My guess is we lose 5 to 10 middle-class families a year,'' Mr. Morgan said. The attrition was at its worst in the 1990's. Now, he said, ''we don't lose them -- they just don't come here.'' Typically families moved to Sioux City, Iowa, 20 miles to the north.
 In 2002 Ho-Chunk Inc. acquired the village site near its headquarters and transferred the property to its nonprofit community development corporation. Mr. Morgan hired an executive director, Judi Meyer, to apply for government and charitable development grants. Ms. Meyer has raised about $6 million to build the village.
 The tribe's first plans to develop the property were not inspired, said Ms. Meyer, a development specialist who is not a member of the tribe. They called for 17 housing units and were drawn up on a home computer.
 ''We were going to have strip malls, and housing in the back,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''We thought that was cool.''
 Mr. Morgan then met Katherine Kraft, a senior program officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, at a development conference. Ms. Kraft suggested the village might capitalize on economies of scale if it were more dense and compact. She also thought that making the place friendlier to pedestrians would promote a more active life among tribe members and help to counter high rates of obesity and diabetes. 
 ''If you're going to build housing, you'd like to think about a walkable, bikeable neighborhood, so you can get some of the health benefits,'' Ms. Kraft said.
 About 70 percent of tribe members are overweight, according to tribal health records, and about 24 percent are obese. As a result rates of diabetes and its precursors have soared among adults and, increasingly, children. Across American Indian populations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in 2003 that 15.3 percent of people over 20 had diabetes, slightly more than twice the rate in the general population.
 In early 2003 Mr. Morgan and Ms. Meyer invited architects from HDR, an Omaha firm, for a series of design workshops open to tribe members. More than 100 people collaborated on the layout.
 Douglas Bisson, an urban planner at HDR who led the workshops, called them ''a record-setting design process.'' The workshops took place in February, ''and by April they had the groundbreaking, and by June they were installing infrastructure, streets and sewers,'' Mr. Bisson said.
 The village's compact design saves the tribe money, Ms. Meyer said. ''We waste our infrastructure dollars here'' by building on scattered rural sites, she said. The village will have a complete utility framework in place, so ''you can just start plopping buildings where they need to go.''
 On the village property recently, Ms. Meyer pointed out sites for a new minimall with apartments on top, for Ho-Chunk Inc.'s office supply company and for its Indian goods business on a commons, near the tribal government offices on a street named Thunder Way.
 Construction proceeds as grant money becomes available, Ms. Meyer said. Before most tribe members can buy houses, they will need the tribe's help with down payments, for which they qualify by completing its home buyer training; about 120 have completed it so far. The course covers basic finance, maintenance and safety for homeowners, ''just real basic stuff that normally people would get a hold of if they lived in the real world,'' said Donna Whitewing-Vandall, who runs the housing authority's education program.
 ''We're trying to re-educate people to do things for themselves,'' she said.
 The village houses are being built by Dynamic Homes, a manufactured-housing plant in Minnesota that Ho-Chunk Inc. bought in 2000. Most of them cost from $70,000 to $130,000 after down payments. The houses, assembled from modules, are typical ranch models, deviating from the bracket-roofed bungalows depicted in the architects' renderings.
 The tribe's general counsel, Danelle Smith, is the type of person Mr. Morgan would like to lure back to the reservation. When she finished law school last year, Ms. Smith, 32, moved with her three young sons to South Sioux City, Neb. ''From a practical standpoint it was just easier for me to get a house in South Sioux City,'' she said. ''It shouldn't be that way. You should be allowed to stay in the community to contribute back.''
 When people like Ms. Smith live away from the reservation, they lose their right to vote in tribal elections. Of about 4,000 Nebraska Winnebago, only about 800 may vote. Mr. Morgan said he feared that the tribe's middle-class diaspora could politically threaten its fragile steps toward self-sufficiency.
 ''As we become wealthier and our people leave, our community becomes poorer,'' he said. ''You have two schools of thought: a kind of enabling, government owes us something; and, hey, you need to take care of yourself and provide for yourself,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''And those kinds of schools of thought are battling here.'' 
 A spectrum of unfamiliar conflicts has arisen in the new Winnebago economy. ''When everybody was poor, our leaders were defined not by money but by their perspective,'' Mr. Morgan said. Now it falls to him, as the tribe's business leader, to make the gospel of self-reliance seem plausible while protecting vulnerable members of the tribe, which has always been at the core of tribal ethics.
 ''You'd think this is just a way to get middle-class housing,'' he said. ''But you have to understand that this really is a struggle for what kind of tribe we're going to be.''

HEADLINE: Venezuela's government seeks to show that its oil riches are well spent.

BYLINE: By Juan Forero

 BODY:
WHEN countries advertise, they usually plug balmy weather or low taxes, all the better to lure tourist dollars or big-spending companies searching for investment opportunities.
 But oil-rich Venezuela, long attractive to American investors though plagued in recent years by political tumult, is now trying a totally different approach: pitching itself as an egalitarian nirvana where petro-dollars are funneled straight to the poor. 
 The idea, say Venezuelan officials, is to show American business executives and policy makers that a happy country is a stable one, even if many in Venezuela would disagree. 
 The ads, placed in recent weeks in The New Yorker, The Economist, The New York Times and other publications, come after weeks of political turmoil that culminated last month in a recall referendum that Venezuela's firebrand populist president, Hugo Chavez, handily won. 
 With Mr. Chavez now more firmly in power than ever, having once again thwarted a fractured opposition movement, his government has stepped up its effort to counter the harsh image painted by his foes on Capitol Hill and Wall Street.
 For three years, the representatives for the opposition have aggressively lobbied American officials to support anti-Chavez efforts, including a 2002 coup that temporarily ousted the left-leaning leader. Modeled on Cuban exile organizations opposed to Fidel Castro, the Venezuelan opposition has largely focused on casting Mr. Chavez's government as a dangerously leftist regime that threatens regional stability.
 The government's new ads, designed by Underground Advertising, a small San Francisco firm that has created ads for nonprofit organizations like Earthjustice and the Breast Cancer Fund, aim to convey quickly the new direction of Venezuela, particularly now that Mr. Chavez's government is feeling comfortable with its new mandate.
 ''We didn't need to get too clever, or too cute in the headlines,'' said Charlie Cardillo, creative director and a partner in the firm. ''We can't tell the whole story, but we can begin with this ad. It's a conversation starter.''
 Typically, ads directed at opinion makers and investors are dry, dense affairs, usually loaded with economic jargon and hagiographic portraits of the elected (or, often, nonelected) officials. But the new Venezuela ads skip any talk of economic opportunities, low taxes, gleaming infrastructure or cost savings. Nor are there photographs of palm-lined beaches and lush jungles, typical of marketing to the vacationer. 
 Instead, the ads, which are also running in Roll Call and The International Herald Tribune, remain tightly focused on Mr. Chavez's social spending spree, $1.7 billion and counting this year alone, all of it generated from the state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. ''Something remarkable is happening in Venezuela today,'' the ads proclaim. 
 One ad features three frames of smiling Venezuelans, the text reads: ''In the past Venezuela's oil wealth benefited a few: Now it benefits a few million.''
 Another says: ''You no longer have to be an oil executive to benefit from Venezuela's oil wealth. Just ask Yasmeli Espinoza.''
 The country remains poor, the ads say, but the huge outlay of oil revenues is expanding education, health care and housing for all. ''There's a new sense of excitement and national pride in Venezuela today,'' the ads report.
 To the determined opponents of Venezuela's government, who make up a coalition of business leaders, private media owners and political parties, the ads are little more than propaganda intended to hide failed economic policies and an increasingly authoritarian agenda. Mr. Chavez's government is using oil money to buy loyalty, those adversaries say, doing little to restore investor confidence in Venezuela or create jobs.
 ''Remember, all publicity, all propaganda shows people smiling and people living well, even if you're selling alcohol and cigarettes,'' said Bruno Scheuren, a Venezuelan who makes videos for companies and is active in antigovernment politics. ''And what they are selling here is a fiction. They are images that do not reflect reality.''
 Kevin McCauley, who writes about how countries advertise and lobby for Jack O'Dwyer's Newsletter, a Manhattan publication that tracks public relations and advertising, said: ''I love those power-to-the-people ads that Venezuela is running. The purpose, of course, is to show that the Chavez government has grassroots support, and counter Bush administration spin that he is a lefty commie who loves to hang out with Fidel.'' Mr. McCauley said the ads representedd ''more of a people-to-people'' approach that is ''more flower-powerish.''
 ''It jumped right out at me,'' he said. ''I saw it and it was very effective.''
 Venezuela's government, which won office in a 1998 landslide that demonstrated popular disdain for two corrupt parties that had long ruled the country, is new to selling itself. But after an economically devastating antigovernment strike last year, the government mounted a l public relations effort aimed at winning hearts and minds abroad.
 From the summer of 2003 until last summer, the government has spent more than $1.6 million on lobbying in Washington, according to the Center for Public Integrity in Washington. Venezuela reaches government officials through Patton Boggs, one of Washington's best-known legal and public affairs firms, and reporters and policy makers through the Venezuela Information Office, a lobbying organization of left-leaning activists created and financed by Venezuela.
 Those advocates not only spiff up Venezuela's image, but they doggedly unearth damaging evidence of Bush administration ties to opposition groups determined to remove Mr. Chavez from office. Collecting documents from the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit agency financed by the United States government, activists showed that $2.2 million was spent from 2000 to 2003 to finance organizations like Sumate, which helped organize the recall effort, or to pay for training for Venezuela's political parties.
 Such revelations proved extremely useful in Venezuela, where anti-American sentiment mined by Mr. Chavez helped him win support. But it did little to dispel claims outside of Venezuela that his government was undemocratic and radical.
 The president's rambling attacks on the Bush administration, accusing the United States of orchestrating efforts to remove him, made him look abroad like the tin-pot leader of a banana republic. Venezuela's sliding economy, along with recurring reports of government meddling in the media and out-of-control National Guard troops, did not help.
 The new ads, though, present a different direction as the country tries to put a positive spin on its leftist government and what Mr. Chavez calls his peaceful revolution, said Bernardo Alvarez, the ambassador in Washington, whose office commissioned and paid for the campaign. 
 Mr. Alvarez said the government wanted to explain why oil-generated social spending was not only popular with many of Venezuela's 25 million people, but that it was also bringing stability that would make the country more attractive to investors. 
 He declined to reveal how much the ad campaign cost, but full-page ads in The New Yorker run about $75,000 and quarter-page ads in the Op-Ed page of The Times cost $45,000.
 ''It's a way for us to say, 'Look, sirs, if you want to invest in the country, let me tell you what it is that we're doing,''' Mr. Alvarez said.

HEADLINE: In Debate on Foreign Policy, Wide Gulf or Splitting Hairs?

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
It is an axiom of the two presidential campaigns that their candidates offer a stark choice about America's role in the world. 
 On Thursday night, voters will have their best chance yet to judge that choice when President Bush and Senator John Kerry meet in their first debate, on foreign policy.
 ''I don't think we've had as clear-cut a difference between two presidential candidates on international issues since 1980,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, a former United Nations ambassador and now a top adviser to Mr. Kerry.
 There are ''clear differences on the biggest priorities facing the American people, first and foremost on the war on terrorism,'' Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said on Wednesday.
 Yet, in the view of some politicians and policy analysts, this race has done little so far to clarify the major issues of foreign policy. ''I was a little more hopeful this year that we'd get a robust debate on these issues,'' said Lee H. Hamilton, the former Democratic representative from Indiana who served as the vice chairman of the Sept. 11 commission. ''It's just appalling, if you look at what is not being addressed. You confront not just terrorism in the world, but you confront turmoil, chaos.'' 
 One reason the candidates have not discussed a wide range of issues is that -- for all the talk about stark differences -- on many foreign policy subjects, from relations with China to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, the two differ only slightly, if at all. 
 Even on Iraq, the candidates' sharpest stated differences are retrospective, rather than prospective. Mr. Bush defends the war as central to the struggle against terrorism; Mr. Kerry criticizes it as a diversion. As they look ahead, though, neither man is calling for the immediate departure of American troops; both advocate accelerating the training of Iraqi forces.
 Both want to create similar conditions for an American withdrawal; Mr. Kerry argues he will find a way to do that more quickly.
 Concerning China, both candidates speak of building a cooperative relationship while promoting internal reform. Susan Rice, another Kerry national security adviser, argued that the candidates had ''fundamental differences'' on foreign policy, but said that on the specific question of China, ''the differences are more of nuance than fundamentals.'' 
 On Israel and the Palestinians, both candidates support Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, in building a barrier against West Bank Palestinians and planning to evacuate settlers from the Gaza Strip without a peace agreement. 
 Sam Nunn, the former Democratic senator from Georgia who is co-chairman of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which focuses on threats from unconventional weapons, noted that both candidates had called controlling such weapons the No. 1 foreign policy challenge. ''But I don't think there's enough discussion,'' he said. 
 For example, Mr. Nunn asked, could the United States simultaneously build a strong relationship with Russia to control such weapons and press the Russians to move ahead with internal democratic reform? ''If there's a conflict between those two goals,'' he asked, ''which is more important, and how do you deal with it?''
 Both men have proposed plans to restrict more countries from producing potential fuel for nuclear weapons. Mr. Kerry has said he would sharply step up a program, which he argues Mr. Bush has underfinanced, to secure nuclear stockpiles in Russia. 
 Senator Chuck Hagel, the Nebraska Republican, said, ''I think both these campaigns have let down this country.'' He said that the most important issue to address was how ''to put back together America's standing in the world.''
 In modern presidential campaigns, candidates tend to pick foreign policy issues at least as much for what those issues say about them as for what they might have to say about the issues. They marshal policy differences as symbols, as markers of values, judgment or style. 
 When they debate Iraq, the candidates are clashing over matters of real moment -- over whether, for example, the insurgency is growing stronger -- but also trying to cement specific images. Call it character versus competence: Mr. Bush wants to present himself as a leader with the courage to go it alone, facing a rival who wavers; Mr. Kerry wants to present himself as wise and prudent, better able to judge threats and enlist allies against them.
 In discussing what he described as major differences between the two candidates, Mr. Holbrooke argued that ''the core issue is that John Kerry is a real internationalist.'' He added that from Mr. Bush's speeches, ''you could put him right up there with Woodrow Wilson,'' but that there is no ''connection between his speeches and his performance.''
 White House officials continued to cast the foreign policy debate primarily as a way for Mr. Bush to make his case that Mr. Kerry is not a suitable commander in chief.
 ''We are a nation that is still at war, and it's important that the president speak with clarity and show resolve,'' Mr. McClellan said. ''And that's what this president has done. 
 ''He will talk about his optimistic vision and his resolve and his clear strategy for success. And that stands in stark contrast to Senator Kerry, who has offered pessimism and uncertainty and defeatism during a time of war.''
 There are substantive reasons for the candidates to emphasize their styles in foreign policy, for it is no easy matter to anticipate what crises will astonish the next administration. Four years ago, during the three debates between Vice President Al Gore and Governor Bush, ''terrorism'' was mentioned only once -- by Mr. Gore.
 And even when it comes to approaches, presidents have often found themselves prompted by circumstances to modify or reverse a stance they promoted as candidates. ''I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building,'' Mr. Bush declared in 2000.
 James B. Steinberg, the director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, argued that the questions of character and policy were entwined this year to a degree they had not been since 1972, during the Vietnam War. ''There is a big character issue being debated here,'' he said. ''But people are also really lining up around two very different world views, and two very different responses to 9/11.''
 Those two worldviews are easily caricatured, with Mr. Bush mocked by Democrats as a trigger-happy loner and Mr. Kerry lampooned by Republicans as wanting permission from the United Nations to protect the United States. Yet behind the cartoons are unmistakable philosophical differences, with application across the range of foreign policy. Mr. Bush has a record of breaking with allies to act in what he perceives as vital American interest; Mr. Kerry is more comfortable operating with consensus. 
 The debate on Thursday is likely to focus on Iraq. Mr. Bush's advisers have identified what they think is a major vulnerability in Mr. Kerry's arguments: The Democrat, they say, is far more interested in talking about plans to withdraw American troops than in describing how he would stabilize Iraq and bring democracy to the region. They have hinted that Mr. Bush will make that a key point. One senior Bush official called Mr. Kerry's arguments ''a slow version of cut and run.''
 Mr. Kerry has seized on Mr. Bush's admission of a single ''miscalculation'' in the post-invasion phase in Iraq, and regularly ticks off other miscalculations that he argues have cost lives and money. His advisers have discussed how long a list Mr. Kerry should present in the debate.
 Iraq is also likely to serve as a gateway to other issues. Already Mr. Kerry's claim that Iraq is a diversion has led him to accuse Mr. Bush of neglecting other matters. Speaking at Temple University on Friday, he cited independence from Middle East oil and relations with the Muslim world among those areas of neglect, and he called for debt reduction to support social progress in ''the most vulnerable nations.''
 Mr. Kerry also argued that the Bush administration had failed to address ''the nuclear danger'' posed by the advancing nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea.
 Some foreign policy analysts argue that Iran has been an accidental beneficiary of the two American-led wars of the last four years, which removed hostile governments in neighboring Afghanistan and Iraq. The 160,000 American troops in those two nations are preoccupied, at least for the moment. Oil prices are at record levels, a boon to Iran, and Iran's fundamentalist religious leaders have tightened their hold on power. 
 ''I don't care who wins the election -- Bush or Kerry -- Iran will come right to the top of the agenda, right under Iraq,'' said Geoffrey Kemp, director of regional strategic programs at the Nixon Center. 
 Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry call Iran's nuclear program unacceptable, and both speak of pursuing diplomacy to choke it off. Mr. Kerry says he would also pursue sanctions, though there is little sign that European nations would join that course. 
 North Korea's nuclear program is more advanced than Iran's; the C.I.A. has warned that North Korea may conduct its first nuclear test before the election. Again, both candidates call for diplomacy. But while Mr. Bush wants to continue the ''six nation'' talks toward North Korea's disarmament, Mr. Kerry says he would also pursue direct talks with Pyongyang.
 Neither man has said what he would do if diplomacy failed.

HEADLINE: Iraqis Look With Hope to School Openings Twice Delayed by Violence

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
In this second school year since the United States deposed Saddam Hussein, Iraqi education officials have twice put off the start of classes, citing instability in the provinces.
 The delay underscores the profound effect a growing insurgency is having on ordinary Iraqis, who already suffer daily violence like car bombs and kidnappings. Still, it has not dampened high hopes of revitalizing an educational system devastated by 35 years of dictatorship, in which loyalty to Mr. Hussein mattered more than knowledge. 
 Education officials said the start of school had been postponed from Sept. 11 to Sept. 18, then to Oct. 2. The timing is still not entirely clear, with some children saying they were told Oct. 15. Other ministry officials said that because of a delay in financing, new textbooks would not be printed and fully distributed for another month or more.
 In interviews, Education Ministry officials said fighting in Najaf, in the south; in Baghdad's Shiite districts, and in cities like Falluja, in the west, was the primary cause for the delay.
 Schools across Iraq used to ring in the school year in early September. But in the chaos that swept Iraq after the American invasion last year, they opened late, with hasty orders issued by the ministry to skip portions of texts about Mr. Hussein. Now the long-awaited books are finally on their way, but safety concerns persist.
 An early test came in late August, when school officials began administering entrance exams to students across Iraq. In some particularly volatile cities, like Falluja and Ramadi, said Sabah al-Jaff, director general of testing, the tests were held in special areas considered to be safe. Four guards stand watch at each location, and two other groups of police patrol the area.
 So far, the testing has gone smoothly, he said in an interview.
 Despite the late start, education officials were optimistic about the new curriculum and changes that are moving through Iraqi schools, which, in the years that Mr. Hussein ruled Iraq, had delivered ever poorer education. A rigid system of control forced out teachers who were not members of Mr. Hussein's Baath Party. Students paid bribes to improve their grades. A course called National Education required students of all grades to memorize Baath Party achievements.
 Since the American invasion, Education Ministry officials, with help from international advisers and Iraqi exiles who returned after the war, have been drafting new textbooks and new teacher manuals and lesson plans.
 The new books have been long delayed over financing, said Dr. Rahim Younis al-Azawi, assistant to the curriculum director at the ministry. ''We might not start distributing until October or November,'' he said.
 The old English textbooks were black and white, with few illustrations. The lessons were often drab descriptions of the reality of life under Mr. Hussein.
 ''This is a summer camp,'' read one lesson for middle-school pupils. ''It's arranged. We've been working here for a week now. We've been trying to dig a drainage canal. We work eight hours every day, but in the evenings we have parties.'' 
 The passage ends: ''Everyone is enjoying himself.''
 The new English workbooks are thicker and have color illustrations. Lessons include games and poetry and are broken down into chapters with titles like ''My Birthday.''
 The much-despised course of National Education is gone. In its place is a course that is a mix of civics and home economics, and teaches everything from electricity usage to respect for human rights and the opinions of others. 
 It was a welcome switch for Vian Said, a 16-year-old in Baghdad whose least favorite subject had been National Education. Her mother, Nifal Armagani, said she hoped computer and science courses would be added. Education had so deteriorated in the time of the Hussein government that on an average day, Ms. Armagani spent four hours tutoring her children after school.
 The decline was due in part to the decline of the teachers themselves. The generation of teachers who began their careers under the Hussein government were given inadequate training that emphasized absolute loyalty to Mr. Hussein, and not depth of knowledge, explained Mr. Said, of the ministry. 
 ''You can't depend on them to teach students,'' said Sardar Muhammad Said, another assistant to the curriculum director, who graduated from a teaching academy in the 1960's before the Baath Party established absolute control over the schools. ''They were brainwashed. Most don't know their subjects.''
 So this summer teachers took refresher courses in how to teach and how to behave toward students. The training included lectures about students' rights and teachers' duties. Over the past several months, teachers from primary, secondary and high schools -- in all about 326,000 -- were scheduled for the training.
 As for Vian Said, it was enough to be free of memorizing Baath Party accomplishments. She expressed her joy at being free of it by chiming into a mocking chorus when her sister and cousins chanted the former morning school salute as they sat in the living room of their central Baghdad home: ''Long live Saddam Hussein!'' they shouted, through smiles.

HEADLINE: Senate Bill Aims at Makers of File-Sharing Software

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
Just over a year ago, the recording industry unleashed its first barrage of lawsuits against people who share music online -- a move that appeared to curtail illegal file swapping briefly. But in the months since, activity on file-sharing networks has recovered and grown, prompting the music and movie industries to try legislating the file-sharing beast into submission. 
 The Senate Judiciary Committee is now considering a bill that stands at the center of the file-sharing debate -- the Induce Act, or the Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004. It joins a torrent of other bills introduced in Congress and in state legislatures to address piracy of copyrighted materials. Negotiations on the bill's language are expected to continue today. A vote could come as early as next week.
 Last week, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California signed a bill that would charge file swappers in the state with a misdemeanor if they fail to include a valid e-mail address with the files they trade. On Tuesday, the United States House of Representatives passed the Piracy Deterrence and Education Act, which would provide stiff penalties for copyright violators, including up to three years in prison. A similar measure passed the Senate in June. 
 Unlike other bills, however, the Induce Act is aimed at the makers of peer-to-peer file-sharing software, rather than at those who use it. Supporters of the bill say it is needed to curb abuses of intellectual property rights. Opponents contend that its broad language will stifle innovation.
 The fight has brought together some unusual alliances. The American Conservative Union, for example, has joined with advocacy groups, like Public Knowledge and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to challenge the Induce Act. The group has begun running ads, citing what it sees as a potential tsunami of lawsuits that would follow should it be signed into law. ''Compromising property rights and encouraging predatory, costly litigation is not a conservative position,'' the ads say. 
 In a letter sent to the Senate this month, the National Taxpayers Union called the Induce Act ''the legislative equivalent of trying to rid a house of termites by burning it to the ground.'' And the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group, produced its own study of peer-to-peer file sharing last month, concluding in part that this kind of legislation might well threaten ''a huge range of legitimate activities.''
 Months of haggling have yielded alternate drafts, yet little in the way of middle ground. Still, critics and supporters appear to agree on at least one point: regardless of whether this particular version of the bill is passed, distributors of file-swapping software like Kazaa may not be able to escape legislation for long. 
 Whether this or any law can ultimately stymie illegal peer-to-peer networking, however, remains an open question. After all, at any given moment, roughly seven million people are exchanging digital content on peer-to-peer networks, according to industry trackers. Much of it is pornography, most of it is music, and nearly all of it is illegally shared. 
 At its heart, the Induce Act is the music and film industries' response to a court victory won by two peer-to-peer software companies, StreamCast Networks, the maker of Morpheus software, and Grokster. A federal appeals court in August upheld the notion that a technology capable of legal uses cannot be held liable simply because some -- or even most -- of its users deploy it to violate a copyright. That decision relied heavily on the principles of a 1984 Supreme Court decision popularly known as the Sony-Betamax case, which gave makers of electronic devices crucial legal protection against claims of copyright infringement. 
 The Induce Act, said Markham Erickson, the director of federal policy for NetCoalition, an Internet policy watchdog group, ''would make Sony-Betamax irrelevant.''
 The language of the bill would hold liable anyone who ''intentionally aids, abets, induces or procures'' copyright infringement. The bill was introduced by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and is supported by a bipartisan coalition of 10 senators, including Democrats like Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barbara Boxer of California, as well as Republicans like Bill Frist of Tennessee and Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina. 
 Supporters contend that in the absence of tough legislation, commercial enterprises like Kazaa and Grokster will continue to reap profits from rampant illegal behavior on the peer-to-peer networks. 
 ''Music, movies, books and software contribute well over half a trillion dollars to the U.S. economy each year, and support 4.7 million workers,'' Senator Frist said in remarks supporting the bill's introduction in June. ''When our copyright laws are blatantly ignored or threatened, an enormous sector of our economy and creative culture is threatened.''
 Mitch Bainwol, Senator Frist's former chief of staff and now chairman of the Recording Industry Association of America, which is leading the charge on the Induce Act and the thousands of lawsuits that have been filed against individual users, puts it more plainly. 
 ''Napster was shut down because it had a centralized server,'' he said, referring to the father of peer-to-peer file sharing that was forced to shut down in 2001, and later reopened as a pay service. Soon after Napster's initial collapse came the decentralized peer-to-peer networks that are now at the center of the debate. ''These decentralized systems exploit a loophole. They make money on advertising and their business model is based on theft.''
 While that may be true, opponents of the Induce Act say that the bill's language is so sweeping that many other technologies may be in danger of being caught in its grasp. They argue that innovations as common as the VCR -- or Xerox machines or the iPod -- would never have come about if their inventors had toiled under the threat that some users might misuse the technology. 
 ''This is not just closing loopholes,'' said Susan Crawford, a professor of Internet law at the Cardozo School of Law in New York. ''They're creating nooses.'' 
 That concern has generated a frenzy of activity among trade groups and Internet advocates on one side, and the recording industry and their supporters in Congress on the other. Several drafts of the bill were generated and discussed by the groups, including versions from the federal copyright office, which has supported the bill, and the Consumer Electronics Association, a trade group that sought to codify the principles of the Sony-Betamax decision and minimize the bill's repercussions by focusing the language squarely on peer-to-peer technologies. 
 While supporters of the bill have characterized the negotiations and language-tweaking over the last several months as free and open, opponents say the process has done little to address their concerns. 
 ''We said, 'If you're going after the peer-to-peer networks, then you define it that way,''' said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Association. ''So we gave them a piece of legislation and it was totally ignored.''
 ''We're intensely paranoid about this,'' he added. 
 Other opponents point out that peer-to-peer technology is not something that can be successfully constrained by new laws. A company can be prevented from making commercial gains with a product that uses peer-to-peer networking, but how would a law stop the tinkerers and programmers who know how to create peer-to-peer software and willingly share their innovations on the Internet? 
 ''You might as well ask yourself, 'Why couldn't the World Wide Web ever just go away?''' said Adam Toll, a co-founder of BigChampagne, a company that tracks peer-to-peer usage. ''It would take a totalitarian concentration of resources to make such a thing happen, and you'd have to take away the thinking that resides in millions of brains around the world.'' 
 Eric Garland, the chief executive of BigChampagne, predicts this battle will be a blip in the evolution of the music and film industries. ''This is really not so different from what happened with radio over 70 years ago,'' he said. 
 The current legislative and legal battles, Mr. Garland said, are merely the desperate attempts by the content industries to hold on to an old business model that affords them a remarkable amount of control over how and when their products are consumed. Once they accept the new paradigm, ''these types of technologies are eventually going to make people in the creative chain a lot of money,'' Mr. Garland said. 
 Perhaps so, but Mr. Bainwol of the recording industry suggests that the illegal file sharers need to be dealt with first. ''There's no way to have a vibrant peer-to-peer market place so long as you have a rampant illegal market place,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Early Unscientific Poll Shows Divided Capital

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Major league baseball in the nation's capital? George W. Bush, the president of the United States and a former owner of the Texas Rangers, is for it, unreservedly. Richard A. Gephardt, a former Democratic presidential contender and a diehard St. Louis Cardinals fan, is for it, enthusiastically -- if it does not fatten the Cardinals' loss column. 
 George Will, a political commentator, baseball connoisseur and Chicago Cubs fan, is for it, eloquently, as a reinforcement of small-d democratic sensibilities. ''Baseball is the right game for democracy -- you settle,'' he said. ''You do lose 60 games a year even if you win the pennant. If you fail 70 out of 100 times at bat, you're still a .300 hitter.'' 
 But in another part of town, about a mile from the eventual site of the stadium for the Montreal Expos along the Anacostia River, enthusiasm was muted.
 Irving Jenkins, a 34-year-old driver on the P2 bus route between the Anacostia subway station and the National Archives, was indifferent. The absence of the major league sport that last left town after the 1971 season, when he was 1 year old, did not bother him growing up and does not bother his sons now.
 ''My son, he plays basketball and football,'' Jenkins said as he waited for the signal to begin his route. ''I offered him baseball, but it's too slow for him.'' 
 Gesturing toward crumbling neighborhoods hidden behind overhead freeways, he said: ''The furthest thing from these people's minds right now is baseball. They're scratching to make ends meet. The only way they'll go to a game is if someone gives them a ticket.''
 For 33 years, since the second iteration of the Washington Senators followed the first out of town, sports fanaticism in the District of Columbia has centered on the Washington Redskins, which, when today's college students were learning to read, won Super Bowl championships. The basketball Bullets and their successors, the Wizards, have drawn followings, as have the hockey Capitals. 
 But for a generation, even as the metropolitan area's suburbs grew more affluent and the largely African-American city at their center slowly lost population, baseball has been an away game. It is enjoyed by the city's perpetual incoming tide of newcomers largely through televised games of hometown teams, or by those willing to make the 55-minute drive to Camden Yards in Baltimore to cheer the Orioles.
 At the Orioles outlet store near the K Street lobbying corridor, two employees stood glumly among the racks of pint-size jerseys under a television screen that showed grinning District politicians and businessmen celebrating. ''We can't say anything,'' one said in response to an inquiring reporter.
 Will said: ''One of baseball's problems in recent years is that its demographic does not include enough African-Americans. It's doing wonderfully with Hispanics.'' 
 The revival of baseball in Washington, he hopes, ''will help redress that imbalance.''
 The eyes of Rasheed Johnson, 12, who was standing at the Anacostia subway station with his mother, brightened noticeably when he was told that baseball was on its way back to his hometown. ''I love baseball,'' he said -- never mind that he was wearing a Los Angeles Lakers jersey. 
 His mother, Carol, added, ''I love the Orioles.'' Would she switch her allegiance to the new team? ''If they are pretty good and represent us pretty good, I would switch,'' she said.
 Mickey Kantor, with a can-do spirit befitting a former United States trade representative, commerce secretary and semipro shortstop, had high hopes for his town, now that it will have a team. 
 ''I think it makes a big difference in terms of the spirit of the city,'' he said. ''When the Dodgers came to L.A. and the Giants to San Francisco and other franchises came to cities that didn't have a franchise, it has economic benefits, but more important implications, a growing spirit, a spirit of optimism.''
 Kantor, a self-described ''ultimate baseball fan,'' added, ''Without a baseball team you don't appear to be in the same category as New York and Los Angeles.''
 Washington's mayor, Anthony A. Williams, speaking at a crowded, baseball-cap-bedecked news conference Wednesday afternoon, evoked the same spirit about the future of the neighborhoods of Anacostia, in Washington's poor southeast quadrant. 
 Noting that redevelopment activity had begun there, Williams said that a new ballpark ''is going to amplify and expand and extend the development that is already under way.''
 The town's other chief executive, President Bush, discussed the new game in town with his press secretary, Scott McClellan, in the cabin of Air Force One. 
 ''He talked about how great it was that baseball was returning to the nation's capital,'' McClellan said. ''He said baseball fans in the Washington area have been looking forward to this day for many years.''
 On the question of whether the president would throw out the first ball on opening day next spring, McClellan said, ''I don't think invitations have been extended yet.''

HEADLINE: The course of the economy runs through the White House, not around it.

 BODY:
A FANTASY has caught on in this presidential election season. We are told that presidents do not matter much to the course of the economy. 
 But a brief tour of history starkly suggests the opposite. In fact, every president at least since John F. Kennedy significantly influenced the course of the economy, even in the short run. 
 How did this improbable idea of presidential impotence catch on with economists and political analysts? Most likely the main reason is that fiscal policy -- more government spending or lower taxes -- is widely thought to be less powerful than monetary policy. The president has some control over fiscal policy but not over monetary policy, which is the province of the Federal Reserve and its chairman. And even if fiscal policy were as potent as once thought, it is usually untimely because presidential proposals take so long to wend their way through Congress. 
 History, however, provides case study after case study to undermine this new conventional wisdom, even if one concedes the dominating influence of monetary policy. 
 First, there were the Kennedy-Johnson tax cuts, passed in 1964, which had a strong stimulative effect on the economy, leading to the fastest growth rates of any decade after World War II, including the 1990's. The Federal Reserve under William McChesney Martin accommodated the fiscal stimulus by expanding the money supply and keeping interest rates down. But President Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson took the policy initiatives. 
 When Mr. Johnson, against the wishes of his economic advisers, failed to raise taxes in the late 1960's to pay for the escalating Vietnam War, the economy overheated, and economists of all political stripes agree that the age of high inflation then began. Mr. Johnson surely mattered. 
 In the late summer of 1971, President Richard M. Nixon, trying to shake off the vestiges of recession, strongly stimulated the economy through fiscal policies to ensure that he faced the 1972 election with a low unemployment rate. He also, of course, simultaneously adopted wage and price controls to stop the inflation that his stimulus might cause, leading to damaging imbalances later in the decade. 
 His friend Arthur Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve, also stepped on the monetary gas in 1972. Mr. Burns's policies may have been necessary and even more potent than fiscal policy, but it was the president who took the lead. The economy strengthened, as did underlying inflationary pressures. 
 Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter both adopted stimulative fiscal policies in the 1970's, again with the help of the Fed's accommodation. Again, the policies strengthened the economy. And again, it was the presidents who largely called the shots, for better or worse. 
 Many argue that the Federal Reserve's accommodation of presidential fiscal policies changed with the appointment of the strongly independent Paul A. Volcker by Mr. Carter in 1979. But presidential decisions were as critical as ever. Consider the radically large tax cuts engineered by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. This time the Federal Reserve did not accommodate the president, but pushed interest rates to damaging heights in an attempt, misguided or not, to suppress the inflationary impact of Mr. Reagan's stimulative policies. 
 Did Mr. Reagan matter? Of course, he did. Without those tax cuts, monetary policy would not have been as extreme, and the worst recession of any period after World War II might have been far less severe. Moreover, the nation would not now be encumbered by a level of debt that was thought unimaginable when Mr. Reagan took office. 
 President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton also mattered, though on balance arguably for the better. Their tax increases ultimately calmed the bond market and enabled the Fed under Alan Greenspan to reduce interest rates. By the late 1990's, at last, the economy grew at the rapid rates of the 1960's. 
 What about the current president? He has certainly mattered. 
 On the one hand, President Bush himself, sounding quite Keynesian, is arguing that his tax cuts have brought the nation out of recession. In fact, more economists now agree that fiscal policies can indeed be potent. In a paper delivered at a conference in Paris last week in honor of John Kenneth Galbraith, Philip Arestis of Cambridge University argued that evidence supports the usefulness of both fiscal and monetary policies, especially when they are put in place in tandem. 
 Among the research he cites are two papers by the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F. Working Paper Nos. 02/87 and 02/208) that provide ample empirical support for the stimulative potential of fiscal policy. The monetary fund research, for example, suggests that arguments about how larger deficits necessarily crowd out private borrowing do not generally hold up. 
 But on the other hand, the Bush expansion is a stubbornly tepid one, unable to produce a net gain in jobs or raise wages at a normal pace. It might also already be fading. 
 Why? In fact, as critics have long argued, the Bush fiscal stimulus package is proving to be inefficient. William Dickens, an economist at the Brookings Institution, argues that the tax cuts were backloaded. Thus, they unsettled business decision makers and financial markets in the near term in anticipation of huge future budget deficits, while many of the tax-cut benefits did not kick in until later. This damped both hiring and capital investment. And aiming tax cuts largely at the wealthy also provided less stimulus for the buck because the wealthy tend to save the money. 
 A more effective stimulus would have included more tax cuts for lower-income Americans and, ideally, more outright government spending for states and for pressing needs like education and infrastructure. The monetary fund researchers, for example, find a larger multiplier -- that is, a larger increase in gross domestic product -- from government spending than tax cuts. 
 There is one other way presidents matter. They can raise or lower a nation's confidence. ''The worst thing about Bush's economic policy is his foreign policy,'' Mr. Dickens said. The unexpected and destabilizing events in the Middle East, coupled with the enormous budget deficit, have significantly discouraged business from hiring and investing, he said. 
 We have not discussed all the other influences of a president -- on social policy, deregulation, and so on. But the final point cannot be overstated. To what extent do presidents adopt policies that imbue the business community -- indeed, all of America -- with confidence? Both Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan, to name two, adopted especially contradictory and confusing economic policies. Now, so has President Bush. And that surely matters.

HEADLINE: With Bush Advancing, Missouri May Be a Battleground All but Conquered

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Is Missouri a swing state that has already swung? So it seems to many people here on the eve of the first presidential debate.
 John Kerry has not visited the state in nearly three weeks and may not be back, local Democrats say, until the second debate, scheduled for Oct. 8 at Washington University in St. Louis. This is no accident of scheduling.
 Its 11 electoral votes are certainly a prize worth winning, and Missouri was listed as a battleground state by both parties as the campaign began. It has symbolic significance as well. In every presidential election over the last century, with the single exception of 1956, Missouri has gone with the winner, usually by a margin closely approximating the national figure. 
 Neither wholly Southern nor wholly Northern, fully Eastern nor fully Western, it is America writ small. Most of its demographic characteristics -- its residents' age, marital status, income and educational levels -- mirror the nation's.
 Early on, the Kerry campaign poured advertising dollars into the state. From March 4 to June 20, St. Louis and Kansas City ranked among the nation's top 10 cities in terms of television spending by the two sides, according to the Wisconsin Advertising Project, which tracks such matters. During that period, the average Kansas City household saw presidential political commercials roughly 280 times.
 But ever since the Kerry strategists decided to omit Missouri from their major advertising purchase after the Republican convention, the intensity of combat has diminished. Though the reasons for the change in strategy are not clear, politicians of both parties in Missouri took it to mean that Mr. Kerry's advisers thought it unlikely he could prevail here. 
 Republicans described Mr. Kerry's visit to the state on Sept. 10 as his ''farewell tour,'' and Lloyd Smith, the state director of President Bush's campaign, crowed that the Kerry team was ''pulling up the stakes on the tent and getting ready to load it onto the truck.''
 Not quite. The Democratic National Committee has stepped into the breach, running a large number of commercials that only a professional could distinguish from Kerry commercials, and independent groups have also spent heavily on Mr. Kerry's behalf. One such group, the Media Fund, spent $250,000 in a single week to televise an advertisement tweaking Mr. Bush for what it portrayed as inappropriate involvement with Saudi leaders.
 In fact, the national committee appears to have all but taken over the Kerry campaign in the state. Queries about advertising strategy here were referred to Washington, where Chris Mather, a spokeswoman for the committee, said it was ''spending very significant resources in Missouri and working with the Kerry campaign to win there, as much as the law allows.'' She declined to supply details.
 But John R. Petrocik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Missouri, a national authority on voting, said that ''the election is pretty much resolved here.'' 
 ''So far Bush has told a better story,'' Professor Petrocik said. ''And John Kerry hasn't explained his vision for the country, what he would do differently.
 ''I still think Iraq could elect Kerry and defeat Bush. It's Kerry's magic bullet, but he hasn't really fired it yet. He did a good job in his speech in New York a week or so ago, but he didn't keep at it. He should have made the same speech again and again, five times in the next week. You don't win the presidency with a laundry list.'' 
 Ken Goldstein, director of the Wisconsin Advertising Project, said his state was ''the new Missouri: a competitive midsized state that mirrors national numbers the way Missouri used to.'' Advertising dollars have therefore flowed north, he said, with Madison now ranking fifth on the list of cities with the heaviest political advertising spending and St. Louis and Kansas City dropping into the lower ranks of the leading 50.
 From Sept. 17 to Sept. 23, more than 300 commercials ran in Madison, about 275 in Milwaukee and about 200 in Green Bay. In Missouri, the numbers were tiny by comparison. Mr. Bush and the Republicans ran about 100 in St. Louis and Kansas City, the Democratic National Committee 40 in each of those cities and Springfield.
 Missouri is a little more conservative than the country as a whole, so as the country shifted toward Mr. Bush in the days after the Republican convention, Missouri seemingly shifted a little more. 
 Three polls, all taken between Sept. 13 and Sept. 19, all with margins of sampling error of 3.5 or 4 percentage points, show Mr. Bush ahead by 6 or 7 points -- not decisive, but a sharp tilt toward the president.
 The two big metropolitan areas, St. Louis and Kansas City, backed Al Gore in 2000 by sizable margins, but the rest of Missouri gave Mr. Bush enough votes to overcome that. Of the 103 mostly rural and small-town counties, Mr. Bush took 95. 
 Gun control and abortion are major problems for Mr. Kerry in the nonmetropolitan counties this year, as is the recognition of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, his home state. On Aug. 3, Missouri, by 71 percent to 29, became the first state to approve a ban on same-sex marriage since the Massachusetts action.
 Missouri's concentration of evangelical Christians is big enough to carry plenty of political influence: at 36 percent of registered voters, it has one of the two largest proportions outside the South, according to the National Annenberg Election Survey.
 Not surprisingly, Republican strategists chose a country town, Warrenton, about 60 miles west of St. Louis, for Vice President Dick Cheney's visit to the state last week. Several signs in the crowd said, ''Bush-Cheney Farm and Ranch Team.''
 Social conservatism in rural areas, reinforced by intense patriotism that tends to favor Mr. Bush, plus social and economic conservatism in the outer suburbs of the big cities, could add up to a majority for the president.
 The Democrats dominate the cities and are fighting for the inner suburbs. They have sent in field workers ''far surpassing anything we've ever done here before,'' Christine Glunz, another spokeswoman for the national committee, said this week, and opened 23 field offices in the state, compared with only 7 four years ago.
 They have also registered thousands of new voters in the state's urban neighborhoods, where black turnout is a key to a strong showing by Mr. Kerry. Another is the contest in flourishing St. Louis County, which now has a much larger population (1,016,315) than the city itself (348,189). The Democratic nominee's most recent stop in the state was a ''town hall'' forum at Affton in St. Louis County.
