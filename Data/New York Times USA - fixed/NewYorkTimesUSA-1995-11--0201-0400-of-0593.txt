HEADLINE: The G.O.P.'s Legislative Blackmail

 BODY:
Republican Congressional leaders plan to extort political concessions as the price of meeting two budget deadlines next week. They are playing an ugly game of political coercion that will force President Clinton to accept dubious programs that he would otherwise veto or else risk endangering the Government's credit rating.
One deadline is looming on Wednesday, when the Government is expected to reach its legal limit on borrowing. There will be no instant default because current law gives the Administration a limited ability to tap trust funds to pay off bondholders. But eventually the Government will default unless Congress raises the debt ceiling. Default would be treacherous because it could unsettle capital markets and drive up interest rates on future debt, socking the taxpayers. 
 The Republicans plan to use the threat of default as a crowbar to force Mr. Clinton to accept legislation he opposes. The House and Senate passed bills yesterday that would give him what he needs, a bill to lift the debt ceiling. But they include unrelated amendments that, for example, curtail appeals by death row prisoners. They would also strip the Administration of its ability to exploit money in trust funds to avoid default in the future. Thus next month, when the new debt ceiling is reached, the President would be in an untenable position: either sign a new debt-ceiling bill sent up by Congress -- no matter how many odious amendments it might contain -- or else default.
By shackling the Administration's tools for managing debt, the bills would alter the balance of legislative power in budget negotiations. If Congress is committed to making this change, or altering other laws, it should do so through ordinary legislative means that preserve the right of the Senate to filibuster and the President to veto.
The second deadline occurs Monday, when the Administration's temporary authority to spend money on discretionary programs runs out and permanent budget bills remain tied up in committee. Government offices will have to close unless the White House and Congress pass another stopgap measure.
Here again Republican leaders are trying to force the White House into accepting irresponsible measures as the price for keeping the Government functioning. The House and Senate have passed stopgap bills to which they attached restrictions on the right of nonprofit groups that accept Federal money to engage in political advocacy, even using their private funds. These restrictions are not about balancing the budget and do not belong in bills extending the Government's budget authority. The restrictions should be forced to clear the ordinary legislative hurdles, including filibuster and veto.
Unfortunately, the Democrats' hands are not clean. They resorted to similar tactics when they controlled Congress and a Republican controlled the White House. But political blackmail is unprincipled no matter which party employs it.

Teaming Up to Sell Rembrandts
Sometimes the lines blur between the role of an auction house, traditionally a public forum, and that of a dealer, whose business is transacted in private. While auction houses have always sold works by "private treaty" (a sale in which the house finds a buyer for an artwork without putting it on the block), the lines become murkier still when a dealer and an auction house form a working relationship. 
 The latest example of such a strange pairing involves Sotheby's and Artemis, the London dealer. They have teamed up to sell an extraordinary collection of 122 Rembrandt etchings assembled by Joost R. Ritman, an Amsterdam-based manufacturer of disposable utensils for airlines. Adrian Eeles of Artemis helped Mr. Ritman form the original collection, which is why his gallery is associated with the auction.
Peter Kortenhorst, Mr. Ritman's financial adviser, said the reason he was selling his Rembrandt collection, along with a host of other objects, is that he is raising capital in an effort to reacquire his company, De Ster, which was taken over by a bank two years ago.
The etchings will be on view from tomorrow through Thursday (by appointment only) in a small annex at 411 East 76th Street in Manhattan where Sotheby's stores and exhibits art. The collection is being sold as a whole, rather than as individual etchings, by private treaty sale.
Aretmis isn't the only dealer involved with Mr. Ritman or with Sotheby's. While Sotheby's is including his jewelry, Dutch silver, 17th- and 18th-century glass and Oriental carpets in various auctions, Robert Noortman, another London dealer, is working with Sotheby's on the private treaty sale of about 20 Old Master paintings.
This isn't the first time Sotheby's has linked up with a dealer to sell important property. The best-known partnership was formed five years ago when Sotheby's joined forces with William Acquavella, the Manhattan dealer, to form Acquavella Modern Art, a subsidiary of Sotheby's Holding Company. It paid $143 million for the contents of the Pierre Matisse Gallery in Manhattan, which included about 2,300 works by such artists as Miro, Dubuffet, Giacommeti and Chagall, and has been selling the works privately since.
"I think there will be a lot more partnerships like this in the future," said Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive officer. "We have more access to sellers."
 
 
 
Breaking Through $100 Million
 Both Sotheby's and Christie's broke the $100 million barrier for the first time since May 1990 as the week of the important Impressionist and modern art auctions ended on Wednesday night.
That evening, the Sotheby's sale scored the highest total, taking in $113.6 million, still below its estimate of $126 million to $174 million. Of the 88 works offered, 65 found buyers.
On Tuesday, the Christie's auction made less. But more of the works offered sold than at Sotheby's. The Christie's sale totaled $107.7 million. Of the 62 works offered, 55 found buyers.
Both evenings underscored the strength of the market, with more $5 million-plus works offered than in any of the last five years. Both sales had moments when it seemed as though no price was too high. At Sotheby's, van Gogh's "Thicket" (1890) sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for nearly $27 million, more than twice its $10 million high estimate.
 
 
 
Auctioneers Are Auditioning
 It hasn't been the same at Sotheby's since John Marion retired. The star auctioneer, who was also the chairman of Sotheby's in New York, left the company nearly a year ago. Filling the void hasn't been easy.
Simon de Pury, Sotheby's chairman in Europe, is now the auction house's top auctioneer. David Nash, director of Impressionist and modern art worldwide, is trying to enter the arena. Another familiar face, Diana D. Brooks, the company's chief executive, has been quietly practicing taking bids in small day sales. "My colleagues felt it was important for a top Sotheby's official here to be an auctioneer," she said. "And I am surprised to say that I love it. It's terrific to be in there with clients." She will conduct one session of the contemporary art day sales next week.
Does this mean she will begin taking the important evening sales soon? "Not for a long time, if ever," she said.
 
 
 
The Tate Wins an $80 Million GrantStrikes It Richer
 All it took was an abandoned power station and a dream for the Tate Gallery of Modern Art in London to win $80 million in lottery money from the Millennium Commission. The grant, which was announced last week, means a big leap forward for the Tate. The money is half of what is needed to transform the 100,000-square-foot Bankside Power Station on the South Bank of the Thames into London's first museum of modern art. It will be the first national gallery to be built in Britain since the 19th century.
"Just as the Pompidou Center has successfully attracted visitors to Paris, the regeneration of Bankside will create a new public facility south of the Thames and revitalize the surrounding area," said Virginia Bottomley, the chairman of the Millennium Commission.
By the rules of the lottery, the Tate has to match the $80 million, which it plans to do by raising funds from private sources. "We're hopeful we will be able to announce final commitments from some donors over the next three months," said Nicholas Serota, the Tate's director.
Mr. Serota said he had known that the Tate was a leading contender before the lottery grant, but that he had been nervous before the announcement because of recent public opposition to spending lottery proceeds on projects perceived as elitist. "That we are creating something entirely new helped," he said. "So did the fact that this project will help to regenerate a whole area of London." The new museum is expected to create 650 jobs in the borough of Southwark, generating about $75 million in economic activity each year. Tate's existing Millbank building is to become the Tate Gallery of British Art, showing works from the Renaissance to the present.

HEADLINE: Alaska Legislators' Oil Vow Gets Different Play at Home

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 10

 BODY:
In trying to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Congress is banking on a promise from Alaska political leaders that all money earned from oil leasing will be split evenly between the state of Alaska and the Federal Government.
But members of Alaska's powerful Congressional delegation, all Republicans, have been saying one thing in Washington and quite another back home. The lawmakers have told their constituents that the promise of a 50-50 split is a ploy to win approval in Congress. Once the refuge is opened, they said, Alaskans will sue to get 90 percent of the royalties. 
 A successful suit would undermine Congress's main justification for allowing oil and gas drilling in the refuge, which President Clinton has vowed to protect. Oil development in the refuge was added as a rider to the Congressional budget resolution on the ground that the billions earned from leasing would significantly help to reduce the Federal budget deficit.
As the differing interpretations have come to light in the last week, Alaska's political leaders have scrambled to explain themselves.
"I misspoke about my position," Representative Don Young said in a letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia. If there is no 50-50 split, Mr. Gingrich has said, there will be no development deal in the refuge, a 19 million-acre home for caribou, grizzly bears and innumerable other species.
Mr. Young was referring to a statement he made in an Alaska radio broadcast last week in which he said: "My decision has been all along that, all right, we'll take the 50-50 and then we'll go after the rest of it at a later time. If necessary, we'll do it through the court system."
Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska made similar remarks several months ago. Talking to reporters in Alaska, Mr. Stevens said that oil drilling should move ahead on the promise of the 50-50 split but that "once the state actually receives less than 90 percent -- then we can sue."
The lawmakers now say they do not plan a lawsuit, and they promise to share the oil revenues evenly with the rest of the United States. But it may not matter what their new position is. The 1959 Alaska Statehood Act, which
brought the 49th state into the union, clearly says that Alaskans will receive 90 percent of royalties from any lease of Federal land.
The only way to insure the 50-50 split is to amend the state compact through a vote of the people of Alaska or the State Legislature. Given Alaskan dependence on oil windfalls, it is far from certain that such a radical departure from the way the state now shares oil money would be approved. This year, each man, woman and child in Alaska received a dividend check of $990 from the state's oil revenue. The state does not have sales or income taxes.
"I would say it's very much up in the air," said Fritz Pettyjohn, an Anchorage lawyer and former legislator active in the conservative wing of the state's Republican Party. "A lot of people just aren't ready to give up that much of what they feel is rightfully theirs."
Mr. Young, while telling Speaker Gingrich that Alaska will agree to give up its 90-10 share rather than lose the chance for any new royalties, has expressed doubt at home about the outcome. "I do, frankly, think there will be people who will go to court over it and eventually win this issue and this argument," he said in the radio interview.
Mr. Young, chairman of the House Resources Committee, refused to talk to a reporter on Thursday about his remarks last week. His chief of staff, Dan Kish, said, "He put his foot in his mouth and misspoke." Mr. Kish said Mr. Young stood by the promise of a 50-50 split.
Gov. Tony Knowles of Alaska, a Democrat, said he thought he could persuade the Legislature to change the statehood compact when it met in January. But without the change, the effort by Congress to open the Arctic refuge would be dead, Mr. Knowles said.
In Congress, some lawmakers say the comments by members of the Alaskan delegation show that the Republican leadership was misled. Congress was expecting to receive half of about $2.6 billion from the initial seven-year oil leases. That money was to be used to balance the the Federal budget.
But if the 90-10 split is enforced, then only about $260 million would go to the Federal Government and the rest would go to Alaska. Those numbers also reflect an estimate of oil prices that are much higher than many economists predict.
Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who opposes drilling in the refuge, said, "What this shows is that the Alaska delegation made a promise to Congress that they can't keep, and is completely unenforceable."
Representative Scott L. Klug, Republican of Wisconsin, is leading a group of House Republicans who have asked Mr. Gingrich to strip the Arctic oil drilling rider from the budget reconciliation bill, a blueprint for Federal spending over the next seven years.
"Very serious doubts have been raised about the total funding that would be made available to the Treasury from the proposed leases," Mr. Klug wrote in a letter to Mr. Gingrich last week; the letter was co-signed by Representative Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of Minnesota.
The Arctic refuge has shaped up as one of the major environmental battles of this Congress. President Clinton has said he will veto the budget bill if it has the provision to allow drilling in the refuge. His supporters view it as an appeal to the majority of Americans, who, according to recent polls, are uneasy about Congressional efforts to roll back environmental protection.
Environmentalists say drilling would cause irreparable harm to the refuge, where huge caribou herds provide food for the native Gwich'in people. Supporters say the drilling, which would take place on the bleak northern plains, can be done with minimal damage to the environment.
In Alaska, oil drilling has broad support, and many people would rather take their chances on the election in 1996 of a more development-minded Republican President than give up their 90 percent share of oil riches.
"Quite frankly, there's a big argument going on within the Republican caucus right now," State Senator Mike Miller, a Republican from the town of North Pole, told The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner on Thursday. "I'm leaning toward requiring a vote of the people."
This year, Alaskans were paid $536 million from the Permanent Fund, which was set up in 1982 as a way to share Alaska's oil wealth with its citizens. The fund is now worth $18 billion, and it grew by an average of $6.7 million a day over the last year.
What feeds the Permanent Fund is oil from Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field in North America. But that oil will be depleted in about 20 years, according to geologic estimates. In the meantime, with oil prices much lower than Alaska's economists had expected, the state is facing a big deficit.
There is wide dispute over how much oil may lie under the tundra of the Arctic refuge.
"What this is really all about is the high-pitched whine of the Alaska greed machine," said Allen Smith, the Alaska head of the Wilderness Society, an environmental group. "We have no state sales tax. No income tax. We get 85 percent of our revenue from oil, and all of sudden we're facing a $500 million deficit."
Accepting only 50 percent may be hard for most Alaskans to swallow, but making such a promise now looks like the only way to insure Congressional passage, said Mitch Rose, a spokesman for Senator Stevens.
"If the price of getting the Arctic refuge through Congress is accepting 50 percent of something, rather than 90 percent of nothing, then we're going to stick with 50-50," Mr. Rose said.

HEADLINE: Rights Groups Say Shell Oil Shares Blame

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Human rights advocates and environmental organizations in the United States and Britain angrily criticized the Shell oil group yesterday after the hanging of the Nigerian writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists, saying the company had damaged the executed men's reputation with Nigeria's military rulers and could have done more to secure their reprieve.
A group led by Mr. Saro-Wiwa, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni Peoples, had protested environmental damage by Shell and other oil companies in the Ogoni region in the Niger Delta, as well as human rights abuses there by the Nigerian military against the Ogoni and other ethnic groups. 
 Shell suspended operations in the Ogoni region in 1993 after civil unrest, but still produces about half of Nigeria's crude oil output of two million barrels a day.
"Shell is the bulwark of Nigeria's economy, producing almost half its oil," said William Shulz, president of Amnesty International. "It did not do all it could have done. It had influence which it did not exert."
Gavin Grant of the Ogoni Community Association, a London-based organization that supported Mr. Saro-Wiwa's campaign, said, "Shell demonized Ken Saro-Wiwa in the eyes of the Nigerian military." Human Rights Watch called on Shell and other oil companies to close down their operations in Nigeria.
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the company's formal name, issued a statement from its London headquarters expressing "deep regret" that the executions had taken place. It said that it no immediate plans to scale back its operations in Nigeria.
Behind the anger with Shell lies a perception that the company was halfhearted in its efforts to secure pardons for the men after they were condemned to death at a trial widely seen as flawed on charges they had incited demonstrators to murder four pro-Government chiefs.
On Oct. 31, after the defendants were found guilty, Shell acknowledged it was being pressed to use its influence'with the Nigerian Government to secure clemency for them, but said it would not do so, saying, "It is not for a commercial organization like Shell to interfere in the legal processes of a sovereign state such as Nigeria."
The company also accused Mr. Saro-Wiwa of supporting violence, saying that although his organization asserted its campaign against the oil drillers was nonviolent, "this is not our experience."
The company's grudging attitude brought protests from Mr. Saro-Wiwa's supporters in the West. On Nov. 2, Shell issued another statement in which it dropped the accusation that Mr. Saro-Wiwa abetted violence and called it "understandable" that the families of those condemned to death should issue "emotional and moving appeals on their behalf."
But the company expressed no regret at the death sentences and again refused to intervene on the condemned men's behalf.
Only after the death sentences were confirmed by Nigeria's ruling military council on Wednesday did Shell issue a third short statement, saying Cor Herkstroter, chairman of the committee of managing directors of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, had written to the Nigerian military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, "requesting clemency on humanitarian grounds."
But it warned that openly pressing the Nigerian authorities to commute the sentences might prove counterproductive, saying "many of those who know Africa best, like Nelson Mandela, have advocated quiet diplomacy as the way forward."
In this case, however, quiet diplomacy did not work.

HEADLINE: NIGERIA EXECUTES CRITIC OF REGIME; NATIONS PROTEST

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Nigeria's military Government today executed Ken Saro-Wiwa, one of the country's leading environmentalists and authors, provoking international protests and calls for punitive measures against Nigeria.
Mr. Saro-Wiwa, 54, a prominent critic of the Government who was arrested last year on charges of murder that he had steadfastly denied, was hanged with eight co-defendants at the prison in the eastern city of Port Harcourt at 11:30 A.M., the official Nigerian press agency said. 
 The executions, which followed an outpouring of appeals for clemency, drew a swift international response.
The United States, Britain and other countries withdrew their ambassadors, the Commonwealth countries were considering whether to expel or suspend Nigeria and the World Bank announced it would not support a $100 million loan to Nigeria for a huge project to develop liquefied natural gas.
The White House called on the United Nations to condemn the executions and consider an embargo on sales of military equipment to Nigeria. But it stopped short of calling for the action that would sting most -- sanctions on the oil exports that provide virtually all of Nigeria's foreign income.
South Africa's President, Nelson Mandela, called the executions a "heinous act." In Washington, the White House issued a statement that deplored the Nigerian Government's "flouting of even the most basic international norms and universal standards of human rights."
Nigeria went ahead with the executions despite the multitude of calls for leniency, which reflected an increasingly cloistered siege mentality among the country's military rulers, diplomats said.
For the last several years Mr. Saro-Wiwa, a popular author, playwright and television producer, has been one of the Government's most articulate and determined critics. He had built a campaign against environmental damage by oil companies and for a fairer share of Nigeria's immense oil wealth for the regions where it is produced.
Mr. Saro-Wiwa's organization, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, grew to become the largest political organization in the 350-square-mile homeland of the Ogoni. This ethnic group, to which he belonged, includes 500,000 people who live in the oil-rich but desperately poor swamplands of Delta State.
When the movement's members began to demonstrate for an end to oil spillages by Royal Dutch/Shell and for a share of the revenues from the oil pumped from their land, international human rights groups say, Nigerian troops began mounting a kind of scorched-earth campaign against the Ogoni, burning villages and committing murders and rapes.
Shell, Nigeria's largest oil producing company, has acknowledged frequent spills but has said the Ogoni movement exaggerated their impact.
After four pro-military traditional leaders were killed last year, Mr. Saro-Wiwa and several associates were quickly arrested for the crimes. But his defenders say he was framed and did not receive a fair trial.
Deeply unpopular, the current Nigerian leaders have little to show for over two years of near-absolute power in what was once one of Africa's most prosperous countries and is now one of its most miserable.
The head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, issued a clemency order last month lifting death sentences in a reported coup plot involving a former head of state, Olusegun Obasanjo, and dozens of other former officials, army officers and journalists. Diplomats and Nigerian analysts said the order had created profound tensions among senior officers who interpreted the lifting of the sentences as a dangerous sign of weakness.
"These guys know that they have their backs against the wall," a Western diplomat said of Nigeria's leaders. "There are people in the ranks who are against them, there are people in their own circles who are having doubts, and with the population against them and now the world against them too, they must feel that to show any softness is to commit suicide."
The executions drew outraged reactions at a meeting of Commonwealth heads of government in Auckland, New Zealand, a regular event that brings together Britain with its former colonies.
Hours after the announcement of the executions, Prime Minister John Major of Britain and President Mandela each called for the expulsion of Nigeria from the 52-member organization.
"I would recommend every move to indicate to the Nigerian Government that we totally condemn what they have done," Mr. Mandela told reporters in Auckland.
In recent days, both Mr. Mandela and Mr. Major had been advocating a quiet diplomacy toward Nigeria, and until the executions were disclosed, neither Britain nor South Africa had supported growing calls for Nigeria's expulsion from the Commonwealth.
Defending his country against the wave of criticisms, the Nigerian Foreign Minister, Tom Ikimi, who was attending the Commonwealth meeting, said Mr. Saro-Wiwa was guilty of "the brutal murder of four Nigerians from his area."
"Which state does not have problems?" Mr. Ikimi added.
Germany, Austria and South Africa said they too were recalling their ambassadors, and a flood of other condemnations were announced from African countries and from the European Union.
With an eye to the country's human rights situation, the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, announced today that it was rejecting the $100 million loan to Nigeria that was seen as crucial to a $3 billion project to - liquefy natural gas. For decades the gas has been burned off rather than captured and processed at Nigeria's coastal oil fields.
The flaring of this gas, which generates smog and raises the temperature of the surrounding areas, was one of Mr. Saro-Wiwa's longstanding complaints against international oil companies operating in Nigeria.
Since his arrest, Mr. Saro-Wiwa had been held in a military camp in Port Harcourt, where he had been denied ordinary visitation rights and allowed infrequent access to legal council.
"I was found guilty even before I was tried," he told the court at his sentencing. "In the course of this trial, I have been brutalized."
On Thursday, Mr. Saro-Wiwa's wife, Hauwa, was turned away from the detention center where he was held as she tried to bring her husband food. The authorities took the food to Mr. Saro-Wiwa, but Nigerian press reports said that when the prison authorities refused to say where it had come from, he refused to eat it.
Earlier this year, Mr. Saro-Wiwa's lawyers abandoned his defense, saying they were being mistreated by the country's military authorities and routinely denied access to Government documents pertaining to the case. The lawyers, themselves prominent human rights figures in Nigeria, said it was plain that the country's military justice system had ordained Mr. Saro-Wiwa's conviction from the start.
For his part, Mr. Saro-Wiwa -- one of his country's best-known poets, a onetime government minister and formerly a highly popular newspaper columnist -- has always maintained his innocence.
"The crime of the Ogoni people is that they had the temerity to ask for their rights from both the Government of Nigeria and from Shell," Mr. Saro-Wiwa wrote in his opening defense statement.
"What the criminal partners of this alliance are trying to tell the world by this arraignment is that the black man, even the best of them, is no better than a criminal," he said. "For if a man of my upbringing, education, cultivation and demonstrated achievement in various areas of life cannot conduct an argument for rights peacefully and in a civilized manner, then no one else can do so."
In response to the executions, President Clinton recalled Ambassador Walter Carrington from Lagos and planned to lodge a protest with the Nigerian Ambassador. He took a series of steps that largely extended current American restrictions on Nigeria, but stopped short of measures with large practical effects, like economic sanctions or an oil embargo.
The President also directed the American representative to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, to start consultations on "appropriate U.N. measures to condemn these actions."
American officials said Ms. Albright would seek support for a condemnatory resolution by the Security Council, a strong action in that body.
If the United States is able to win passage of such a resolution, officials might then consider pushing for an international arms embargo. "It would not be an easy thing to do," an official said.
There was no talk of economic sanctions or an oil embargo. Officials said that it was traditionally quite difficult to rally any international support for oil embargoes and that unilateral oil embargoes were not effective. Nearly half of Nigerian oil exports go to the United States, an American official said, although that amounts to less than 10 percent of overall American oil imports.
In other steps, the White House announced that Mr. Clinton had banned the sale and repair of military goods and services for Nigeria, a largely symbolic action since the United States has already stopped most if not all weapons sales to the African nation.
He extended the current United States ban on visas -- which already prohibits the entry of senior Nigerian military officers, senior Government officials and their families -- to include all military officers and civilians who "actively formulate, implement or benefit from the policies that impede Nigeria's transition to democracy."
Mr. Clinton ruled that Nigerian officials visiting the United Nations or international financial institutions would be under cold-war-style travel restrictions and must stay within 25 miles of those institutions. And he said the United States would continue to oppose International Monetary Fund loans and debt relief for Nigeria.
The White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said in a written statement that the United States "strongly condemns" the execution of the nine men. "These executions demonstrate to the world the Abacha regime's flouting of even the most basic international norms and universal standards of human rights."

HEADLINE: Energy Chief Expresses Chagrin Over Monitoring Reporters

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary said today that she was "chagrined and embarrassed" that her department had hired a company that ranked reporters who cover it, but the White House said that, despite the furor over the practice, Mrs. O'Leary could keep her job.
Mrs. O'Leary said the contract with the consulting firm, Carma International, had been requested without her knowledge last year, by the then-head of the department's press office. That person, Michael Gauldin, was Bill Clinton's press secretary when Mr. Clinton was Governor of Arkansas. 
 The White House said the practice was "unacceptable and will not be tolerated." Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, ordered Mrs. O'Leary to cut the budget for her office by $46,500, to cover the cost of the contract. It ran from December 1994 until the department canceled it in August.
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said the contract was "just another reason to turn out the lights at the Energy Department." House Republicans, who also want the department broken up, said more than 70 of them had signed a letter urging Mrs. O'Leary's resignation.
Mrs. O'Leary said, "I think people were gunning for the whole department, and having lost that piece, they're gunning for me."
Mr. Gauldin, who now holds a similar job at the Interior Department, could not be reached today for comment on the episode. There was no answer at his home or office today, a Federal holiday. He did not reply to an E-mail message.
Mrs. O'Leary said the contract, which also involved rankings of members of Congress, governors and others, was part of an effort to improve the department's credibility among all the people it dealt with. She said her department had never asked for the ranking of reporters or others that the consulting concern provided, only an analysis of coverage. She said she had seen only two of the concern's monthly reports and had not read either far enough to find the rankings.
She said that the Carma contract had been canceled because the reports had not been useful and that no action had been taken based on the reports.
The White House statement said, "Upon receiving Carma's initial reports, the department should have directed Carma not to rate reporters and news organization and in failing to do so, exercised poor judgment."
Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, where the department is planning to store nuclear waste, complained last month that Mrs. O'Leary was traveling more than the Secretary of State and with a larger entourage. Republican members of Congress had also complained about the Secretary's travels.
Mrs. O'Leary, who was in New Orleans today on a previously scheduled trip to discuss aid to the oil and gas industries, said in a telephone conference call with reporters that an advisory panel comprising academics, public officials and a journalist had recommended that the department should determine how it is perceived.
A survey requested by Mrs. O'Leary's predecessor found that among 450 people who dealt with the department, its headquarters was trusted less than almost all other institutions and industries, even the civilian nuclear industry.
The Energy Department was created almost 20 years ago from the remnants of the Atomic Energy Commission, which routinely lied about its nuclear activities in the name of national security. With its cold-war mission gone, it turned to cleaning up atomic weapons plants and disposing of surplus nuclear materials. Repairing public trust was crucial, Douglas Elmets, its press secretary in the last years of the Reagan Administration, said today.
"Far more than her predecessors," he said of Mrs. O'Leary, "she came to the realization that if you don't have the public on your side, or the media on your side, for that matter, you're going to have a very difficult time getting the cleanup going." Mrs. O'Leary said today that her department's credibility had now taken a step backward.
Carma counted people quoted in stories about the Energy Department and judged their comments as positive and negative and how much so. The largest group of those saying positive things were Energy Department officials.
It also listed and rated members of Congress, state regulators, governors and other who said things that it judged unfavorable.
Carma reported on "positive messages," like "the risks of public exposure from stored plutonium is extremely low" and "the D.O.E. handles too many important areas to justify elimination."
It listed "negative messages" like "little progress is being made to clean up plutonium storrage sites" and "D.O.E.'s budget should be cut substantially."

Hoke of Ohio and Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, called yesterday for her ouster. Mr. Hoke displayed a poster titled "O'Leary's World Tour' about her extensive travels as Secretary.

HEADLINE: Terms of Muslim-Croat Alliance Are Set at Dayton Talks

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 10

 BODY:
A wide-ranging agreement to invigorate a tenuous Muslim-Croat alliance in Bosnia was announced today by senior Administration officials and portrayed as an important step toward an overall Bosnian peace settlement. But the effectiveness of the accord and the strategy behind it remain uncertain.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on a one-day visit to the peace talks here, said the accord would bring the Muslim-Croat federation established last year "to life" and described it as "an essential building block of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole." Up to now, the federation has done little more than stop the fighting that raged in 1993 between Muslims and Croats. 
 The agreement, signed after 10 days of negotiations here that have scarcely begun to address the most contentious issues of an overall Bosnian peace, amounts to the first serious attempt to divide authority between the central Government of Bosnia and the federation, establish the rudiments of economic life, and integrate divided Muslim and Croatian communities.
But it hardly touches on one of the most difficult questions: the degree of integration between Croat forces and the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Army. During a recent offensive in western Bosnia, fighting twice broke out between Croatian and Bosnian units, bringing the federation to the verge of collapse.
Moreover, it remains unclear whether the American strategy of strengthening the military and economic power of the Muslim-Croat federation as a counterbalance to the Serbs will ultimately prove compatible with the stated American aim of maintaining Bosnia as a single state. The stronger and more integrated the federation becomes, the more the Serbs of Bosnia may feel their future lies elsewhere.
"If the federation can succeed as a multi-ethnic democracy, then so can Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole," Mr. Christopher said. But if this is to happen, then the relationship between the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic within Bosnia foreseen in any peace plan will have to be one of cooperation rather than hostility.
It is far from clear how such cooperation will be worked out in that the basic aim of the Serbs' current leaders remains that of ruling themselves with a view to eventual confederation with Serbia or secession.
As the agreement was signed today by the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, and the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, Croatia moved troops and heavy artillery close to Eastern Slavonia, the one remaining Serb-held part of Croatia.
The troop movement may amount to no more than saber rattling. But it nevertheless underscored the fragility of the negotiations here. President Tudjman has vowed to retake Eastern Slavonia by the end of this month through negotiation or military might.
The agreement signed today gives the federation government extensive powers, including control over defense, justice, customs collection, taxation, agriculture, health and internal affairs.
The central Bosnian Government, whose form and function remain to be defined in any overall peace accord, would retain control over foreign policy, foreign trade, air traffic control, immigration and citizenship, and monetary policy.
Over the last 20 months, since the formation of the federation, Croats and Muslims have argued over how authority should be divided. The Muslim-led Government has been reluctant to cede any real authority to the federation, while Bosnian Croats have seen the federation as a means to weaken the Government and strengthen their ties with Croatia.
In practice, Croatian-controlled areas, amounting to about 20 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina, have been governed by the self-styled authorities of Herzeg-Bosna and have pushed ahead with integration with Croatia.
The agreement seeks to undo this process by dissolving the institutions of Herzeg-Bosna. At the same time, four federation ministries -- commerce, traffic and communications, energy and industry, and education, science and culture -- are to be established in Mostar.
Every fourth session of the federation's government, which is to meet weekly, will be held in Mostar. The remainder will be held in Sarajevo.
In one of its most important stipulations, the accord says a new customs system is to be set up by Dec. 10 and internal customs checkpoints between Croatian and Bosnian Government-controlled areas removed.
Because Croatia and Herzeg-Bosna control geographic access to landlocked Bosnia, Croats have been able to take an enormous cut on all goods going into Bosnia. This practice has infuriated the Bosnian Government. Beginning with the 1996 budget year, the agreement says an agreed proportion of customs revenue will accrue to the central budget of the Bosnian republic. An annex to the agreement establishes steps to bring about the reunification of Mostar, the magnificent city on the Neretva River whose Old Bridge, a marvel of Ottoman architecture, was destroyed by Croatian shelling during the 1993 war. The city has remained divided along the front lines of that conflict.
On the central issue of military integration, the agreement calls only for greater integration between senior Croat and Muslim commanders. It adds that "international assistance" will be sought in the creation of a "joint planning staff."
In practice, "international assistance" almost certainly means American help. This in turn raises the difficult issue of how American military aid to the federation will prove compatible with a large American presence in the NATO force that would be sent to police any overall settlement.

HEADLINE: Bias Against Straphangers? Suburbanites Beg to Differ

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Their trains may have padded seats, luggage racks and toilets, but many commuters on the Metro-North and Long Island railroads don't think they're getting a far better deal than their subterranean cousins.
For one thing, commuters in the nearer suburbs say current fares of $6 or so per ride -- or roughly $3 with a monthly pass -- mean they already pay two to four times as much as subway riders for trips that are shorter than many subway rides. 
 "This is not a question of discrimination," said Bruce Goldman, a Manhattan salesman who commutes on the Long Island Rail Road from Island Park, just six miles east of the Queens border. "They can take the subway from the Bronx to Brooklyn for $1.25. It costs $142 a month on the train, and that's going to increase."
Although suburbanites have been portrayed in a recent transit lawsuit as the undeserving winners in the latest round of fare increases, many commuters say they are not getting any bargain. They say it may be too simplistic to conclude that the fare increases are discriminatory because they are proportionately higher in New York City, where transit riders are predominantly black and Hispanic, than in the predominantly white suburbs.
That argument, raised by civil rights and transit advocates in a lawsuit against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, led a Federal judge last week to block a 25-cent subway-fare increase. A Federal appeals court overturned the ruling on Thursday, but the issue is unlikely to be settled until a trial later this year.
Commuters point out that their world has its own economic diversity: one in five commuters, for example, has a family income under $50,000. And commuters like Jonathan Factor say that people who protest the new fare structure -- a 20 percent increase on the subways and an average 9 percent increase for commuters -- forget that many riders are "taking a double hit." More than 60 percent of L.I.R.R. commuters and a third of Metro-North commuters also take the subway to work.
"I suffer the increase on the Long Island Rail Road, but I also pay the increase on the subway," said Mr. Factor, a lawyer from East Meadow who takes a train to Pennsylvania Station and a subway to his lower Manhattan office. "I feel doubly discriminated against."
Metro-North commuters who ride long distances from communities like Poughkeepsie and Somers said that while they got more distance for their money, they could not afford to pay much more for transportation.
"The fare discriminates against all hard-working people, no matter whether they're in the city or around the city," said Robert Peter, a recently retired engineer who had been paying $10.25 each way to make the 50-mile commute from Somers, N.Y., or $185 with a monthly pass.
Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North, said officials had decided that they could not raise fares for remote stations like Poughkeepsie, where the monthly fare will be $257 starting Dec. 1. Many people settled so far from New York because they could not afford houses closer to the city. Raising their fares, he said, would drive them into car pools, cutting the transit system's income.
Many commuters also do not fit the Cheeveresque stereotype of a prosperous white stockbroker in a trench coat. Metro-North said that although the median household income for its commuters was $93,750, 21 percent have household incomes under $50,000. On the L.I.R.R., where the average household income of the riders is $84,000, 25 percent of riders have family incomes under $50,000.
Cassandra Trotman is a Panamanian immigrant who commutes from the Bronx's Woodlawn station to White Plains to earn $6 an hour caring for the frail as a home health aide. She pays $2 each way for her commute and does not feel she should pay more to protect the subway and bus fare, which she also pays.
"Commuters are not all wealthy people," she said. "I'm a mother of three kids. Sometimes I have to borrow the money from a friend to pay the fare."
The fastest growing segment of commuters, railroad officials said, is working-class people -- store clerks, baby sitters, cleaning workers and students -- who commute from the New York to more affluent suburbs. To encourage this group's ridership, Metro-North fares from the Bronx are kept artificially low.
The economic woes of commuters draw little sympathy from Gene Russianoff, the lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, which joined in bringing the civil rights suit against the proposed transit fares. Two-thirds of subway riders have family incomes of under $50,000, he said.
"Railroad commuters have a quicker, safer ride than people coming in on a stop-and-go subway trip," he said. "More people sit on the railroad than on a subway or bus."
Still, he cautioned, he was not promoting fare increases for commuters, only more generous subsidies for subway riders.
And among commuters, there is considerable sympathy for subway riders.
"It's clear the rise in the fare places an undue burden on those least able to afford it," said Irene Ditti, an L.I.R.R. commuter who lives in Rego Park.
Yet many commuters bristled at the implication that they should subsidize the subway system.
"If one management owns hotels in New York and Los Angeles, that doesn't mean they should charge more in New York to carry the hotel elsewhere," said Benjamin Schaffer, a Manhattan architect who lives in White Plains.
There are also businessmen like Richard Wehrmann, 41, who said the subject of fare increases didn't "warrant my time" because a one-way fare increase of 50 cents for the White Plains-to-Manhattan trip was not enough to pinch financially.
"I don't count my change," he said.

HEADLINE: State to Let Owners Clear Park Lands

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Over the objections of some environmentalists, the Pataki administration has decided to allow owners of private woodlands within the vast Adirondack Park to clear-cut tens of thousands of acres where trees were damaged in a freak windstorm last summer.
The decision represents a substantial shift in the state's land-use policy for private holdings within the park, where the largest previous permit for clear-cutting involved 55 acres. 
 Much of the private land in the park is actively logged, but not by clear-cutting -- a process, environmentalists argue, that by stripping the land of every tree eliminates wildlife habitat and can cause erosion and runoff, which can harm streams and lakes.
Representatives of the logging industry called the plan a reasoned response to an extraordinary natural disaster. The potent windstorm at dawn on July 15 steamrolled a Rhode Island-sized stretch of the 6 million acre park system, killing four campers and a motorist and damaging or toppling an estimated 125,000 acres of trees. Of that, more than 30,000 acres are privately owned.
While the Adirondack Mountain Club also endorsed the plan, other environmentalists said the decision reflected a pro-business tilt at the Adirondack Park Agency, a state agency which regulates private land use, now that Gov. George E. Pataki has replaced its chairman and several board members.
To qualify under a blanket permit that is to take effect early next week, any landowner in a swath crossing four Adirondack counties need only claim that one of every three trees in a woodland was damaged in the storm. But no inspections will be required to verify such claims.
Gregory A. Hill, an assistant director of the Adirondack Park Agency, said the permit balanced the need to preserve the park's integrity with the need to respond to the storm. "We changed it in several respects to respond to environmental concerns," he said of the new policy.
Representatives of several environmental groups, including the Adirondack Council and the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said they did not object to limited clear-cutting, but they were alarmed at the lack of government oversight, particularly in areas with sensitive wetlands.
They said they would mount legal challenges to the permit, the final language of which was released yesterday by the Adirondack Park Agency.
"We think that the A.P.A. is turning its back on its historic role as protector of the Adirondack Park," said Sarah Meyland, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment. "This new permit, we believe, is serving the needs of the forest products industry and not the needs and interests of the public."
Other environmentalists, noted however, that their fears were tempered by the recognition that the market for timber is weak and therefore the economy may well restrain the timber industry even if, as some see it, the Pataki administration won't.
Neil Woodworth, a lawyer for the Adirondack Mountain Club, said, "Frankly, the major companies are not going to want to take down any trees they don't have to."
The storm also created a dispute among state environmental and fire officials and environmentalists over what to do about millions of fallen trees within the "forever wild" areas of public forest preserves. A decision on that front is expected by the end of the year.
The damage to private lands was seen as needing quicker action, so privately owned timber would not go to waste.
After the storm, timber companies like the International Paper Company, which operates tree farms on 300,000 acres within the park boundary, asked the state to issue special guidelines that would -- on a one-time basis -- allow extensive clear-cutting where the storm damaged private forests. Industry officials said that if timber wasn't salvaged quickly it would rot or discolor.
But some environmentalists said the permit, which expires on June 30 next year, will allow landowners to clear-cut entire forests under what amounts to an honor system. John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, a private group, said the permit is far too generous in allowing two live trees to be cut for every dead or damaged one.
Mr. Woodworth of the Adirondack Mountain Club said that while he generally supported the permit, he was disturbed by the provisions covering clear-cutting in wetlands, particularly the absence of a requirement that Park Agency forestry experts visit cutting sites.
"We wanted the agency to go out on each and every clear-cut in wetland areas," Mr. Woodworth said. "In the field, an A.P.A. forester and a company's forester can very nicely determine what's necessary," he said. "But if they're just talking about it on the phone, he won't know how wet it is, what's in there."
Robert Stegemann, a spokesman for International Paper, said the A.P.A. responded well to the blowdown, inviting environmental groups and the industry to help it draft the permit. "It's good to see government trying to address a unique situation in a responsible way," he said.

HEADLINE: Debt Ceiling Impasse Dampens Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
With the Republican-controlled Congress and the Clinton Administration still at loggerheads over raising the Federal debt ceiling to allow the Government to meet interest payments, Treasury securities fell yesterday, continuing their slide of Thursday.
Traders and dealers seem convinced that politicians could not possibly be so naive as to allow a default that would undermine the Government's credibility. Yet the unsureness of the situtation is weighing heavily on bond prices. 
 "We're moving through a period where the Government's credibility is being beaten up every day," said Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist at the First Albany Corporation.
The 30-year bond fell 23/32 , to a price of 1077/32 , sending its yield up to 6.33 percent, from 6.28 percent on Thursday. That was still at the low end of this year's range; in January the yield was as high as 7.92 percent.
The Treasury said yesterday that an auction of $29.6 billion of three- and six-month bills scheduled for sale on Monday could be postponed because of the conflict.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president in charge of the Government trading desk at Cowen & Company, said: "I think that the Street is convinced that we will see some sort of an accord on the debt ceiling this weekend. Some market participants are still even looking for an interest rate cut at the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday. But I think the cards are stacked more toward a December ease."
Discussing the possibility of a Government default, Mr. Gamba said, "I believe that the repercussions would far exceed anyone's estimation." But, he added: "I don't believe the Government would allow that to take place. It's really hard to say how the market would react, because it's never happened."
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, called the impasse between Congress and the Administration macho theatrics that were being played to the hilt. Still, he saw a potential for both a "loss of credibility and a significant decline in prices."
Mr. Delaney said that the "procrastination and posturing is negative for both the markets and national image in the long run."
He added that if "the Treasury pulls out all stops to insure timely payment on principal and interest," there will be a short-term, temporary effect of uninvested cash looking for a home.
In addition to the uncertainty caused by the impasse in Washington, traders were inclined toward caution before next week's scheduled economic reports and the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. These are among the reports due:
*On Tuesday, October retail sales;
*On Wednesday, the October Consumer Price Index, October industrial production and capacity utilization, and September business inventories;
*On Thursday, the November Philadelphia Fed survey and initial weekly unemployment claims;
*On Friday, October housing starts.
One positive economic straw in the wind yesterday was a survey by the University of Michigan, which reported its preliminary sentiment index for November rose to 90.7 from 90.2 in October. Economists say the higher number suggests that the wrangling in Washington has not had an adverse influence on consumers' attitudes.

HEADLINE: Dow Sets Another Record But Overall Market Is Off

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Even though the Dow Jones industrial average set a high for the third consecutive session, stock prices were under pressure yesterday as investors worried that the Federal Government might default on its debt because of political conflicts over the budget.
The 30-stock Dow average gained 6.14 points, to 4,870.37, buoyed by a round of computer-guided buy orders and the strength of its large-capitalization cyclical issues. For the week, the Dow had a gain of 44.80 points. But in yesterday's trading the broader averages turned lower, and there were more declines than advances on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 "People fear the implications of a Government default," said Edwin C. Walczak, chief investment officer of Vontobel U.S.A., explaining what he called "a cloud over the market."
With Congress and the Clinton Administration in an impasse over raising the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling, bond prices fell yesterday. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond slumped 23/32 and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.33 percent, from 6.28 percent on Thursday.
Falling bond prices led to weakness in the overall stock market. Among the other indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eased 0.54 point, to 592.72, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.72 points, to 1,063.87. Declining issues on the Big Board outnumbered advances by 1,246 to 975. Volume was light, with 298.7 million shares changing hands, down from 380.8 million shares on Thursday.
The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet next week and there has been talk of a possible reduction in the Federal funds rate, which is charged on overnight bank loans. But many analysts do not expect any action on rates at this meeting.
The stocks of brokerage firms, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates, suffered some big losses yesterday. Morgan Stanley dropped 1 7/8, to 87 3/4, and Merrill Lynch declined 1 5/8, to 58 7/8.
Among the big movers in the market, American Greetings, which announced that it would take a charge for a corporate revamping in its third quarter, declined 3 7/8, to 27. Canandaigua Wine, which reported lower-than-expected earnings for its fourth quarter, plunged 1813/16 , to 311/16 . And Marvel Entertainment, which said that third-quarter profits dropped, fell 2, to 11 7/8.
Drug companies that sell heavily in overseas markets also fell. Johnson & Johnson closed at 79 3/4, down 1 1/4; Abbott Laboratories ended at 39 1/4, down 3/8, and Pfizer closed at 58 1/2, down 1 1/8.
On the other hand, stocks involved with the Internet continued their upward push. Spyglass increased 8 1/2, to 92; Netcom On-Line advanced 3/4, to 79, and Sun Microsystems rose 4 3/4, to 89 7/8.

Mexican Stocks and the Peso End Day Largely Unchanged

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Stocks ended largely unchanged today, buoyed by a surprising show of peso stability against the dollar but held back by fears that turmoil will again rock Mexico's fragile markets.
The stock market's index of leading shares ended down 0.99 of a point at 2,310.10. Gainers outpaced decliners by a slender 32-to-28 margin. 
 "The market ended quiet," one trader said. "There are an equal number of optimists and pessimists out there."
The peso steadied today after a two-day slide in volatile trading. The peso settled today at 13.25 United States cents, unchanged from Thursday.
"The peso is too devalued right now," a dealer said. "It is at levels which are excessively low and there has to be a correction."
Mexico's currency plunged Thursday to an all-time low of 12 United States cents, generating panic in the market, before Banco de Mexico, the central bank, stepped in to sell around $200 million and buy pesos in a bid to support the Mexican currency.
Banco de Mexico said today that it did not intervene in the market again to help the embattled currency, although some analysts said they did not believe the central bank.
Some foreign investors searched the market for cheap shares after the peso's recent fall, but others took profits from gains on Thursday, fearing the peso was headed lower.
Analysts said high interest rates and inflation following the peso's woes will weigh on stocks in the coming days.
"I think investors are coming to the conclusion that 1996 is going to be another lackluster year," said Vinod Sehgal, director of Latin American analysis at Oppenheimer & Company.
Analysts said investors would closely watch the 1996 budget, which is to be introduced on Tuesday.

Dollar Higher in Thin Trading, As Fears of a U.S. Impasse Ease

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose in thin trading yesterday as currency traders in Europe and the United States grew slightly more confident that an agreement on the United States budget could soon be reached.
The dollar was also helped by a steadying of the Mexican peso, which slid the two previous days in volatile trading. 
 Many banks were closed yesterday in observance of Veterans Day, contributing to the thin trading.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar edged up to 100.90 Japanese yen from 100.40 yen on Thursday. The dollar also climbed to 1.4176 German marks from 1.4104 marks and to 1.1390 Swiss francs from 1.1361 Swiss francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5665 from $1.5794.
The dollar started its rise during the overlap between United States and European trading. Robert Ryan, who follows foreign exchange at the Bank of New York, said the timing indicated that both European and American traders were taking the opportunity to reverse earlier positions to cut their risk over the weekend.
The reaction follows a sharp fall in the dollar on Thursday as anxieties over an impasse on the United States budget finally affected world currency markets.
"Yesterday, we were all upset about a budget impasse and today they said, 'It's the weekend, we better square our positions,' " Mr. Ryan said.
President Clinton said yesterday that he wanted to work with the Republican-controlled Congress on the budget but not "under the threat of a Government default or shutdown."
Ron Leven, a global currency strategist for J. P. Morgan & Company, said traders noticed quickly that the dollar did not fall after Mr. Clinton's announcement, which came a little after 1 P.M.
"People said, 'Uh, oh, if the dollar didn't fall on this, I better get out,' " Mr. Leven said.
In other currency trading, the Mexican peso settled at 7.55 pesos to the dollar -- unchanged from Thursday, when it hit a record low for the second consecutive day against the dollar. That took pressure off the dollar, which is affected because of the close economic ties between the United States and Mexico.
The mark weakened yesterday, as some traders grew concerned that growth forecasts for Europe might be overstated.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Hunsicker Leaves Mets for Houston Job

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

 BODY:
Gerry Hunsicker, the Mets' assistant vice president of baseball operations since 1991, was named the general manager of the Houston Astros yesterday.
The Astros also announced that they would continue to reside in Texas in 1996 rather than be sold and moved to northern Virginia. 
 "The Mayor and some of the key business leaders in the city were here to make a joint announcement with Drayton McLane to announce that the plans to move the franchise to Washington have been tabled and the Houston Astros will play in Houston in 1996," Hunsicker said by telephone from Houston.
Hunsicker, who began his baseball administrative career with the Astros in 1978, signed a three-year contract. At least one-third of his tenure will now be spent in Texas, something that only two weeks ago was not guaranteed. McLane, the Astros' owner, seemed more than willing to sell the team and see it moved because of protracted losses -- $60 million in three years, McLane contends -- and poor attendance.
"Drayton has asked the community for its support and 1996 will be the year of reckoning for the city, or the opportunity for the city to come out and show that support to ultimately determine whether this is a viable city to house a major league franchise," Hunsicker said.
"At some point during the '96 season, Drayton will evaluate and make a determination to see whether it is viable here or reopen discussions about the possibilities of moving."
Hunsicker, 44, replaces Bob Watson, who resigned from the Astros on Oct. 23 to become the general manager of the Yankees. The risk of not being able to stay in Houston, Hunsicker said, is something that comes in today's economic climate.
Still, Hunsicker said he signed on with the team because "these opportunities don't come along very often."
"There's never a perfect opportunity today with the economic problems in the game," he said. "Every job has its drawbacks. The reason this opportunity seemed right because it was coming back to an organization that I was familiar with."
Hunsicker acknowledged that leaving the Mets now that many of the players he helped nurture through the minors are making contributions makes the decision somewhat bittersweet.
"I grew up with a lot of these kids and they're finally getting to the point where they're maturing and ready to make a contribution at a major league level, that's certainly one of the rewards for people in scouting and development," he said. "The fact that I'm not there, however, will not dampen my pride and enthusiasm for what has happened in those areas."

HEADLINE: Canada Without Quebec Won't Fall Apart

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Edgar M. Bronfman's Nov. 5 letter on Quebec: Mr. Bronfman describes himself as a former Canadian, and I suspect he harbors a nostalgic view of Montreal as far more important to the Canadian polity and economy than it once was. The sad fact is that Quebec and Canada have had less and less to do with one another over the last few decades. 
 A Canada without Quebec would not fall apart. Quebec has been at the heart of Canadian decentralization efforts for several decades, as federal governments attempted to accommodate the forces driving increased powers to Quebec. Quebec's separation would end this process and give Canada a unity of purpose it has never before enjoyed.
Canadians are aware that Quebec is a nation evolving into a country. There is nothing the Government of Canada can do to "buy" Quebec's loyalty, as it has attempted to do since the 1960's, and the citizens of Canada will not allow any further efforts to decentralize the country. As the referendum revealed, only in Montreal and the regions nearest Ottawa do most of its citizens feel any atavistic attachment to Canada.
What does all this mean to Canada outside Quebec? Precious little. For the past 25 years, economic power has shifted from Montreal to Toronto and, increasingly, Vancouver and Calgary. English and French have, as languages do, settled into their own territories, with Quebec increasingly unilingual. To most Quebecers and Canadians, Quebec is already a separate country in all but name.
Mr. Bronfman's view that Atlantic Canada cannot survive without Quebec is inexplicable. For at least the past 15 years Quebec has been considered, officially, a have-not province and receives far greater federal money than it pays in taxes.
As a British Columbian, I find Mr. Bronfman's assertion that without Quebec we would leave Canada and drift into the United States to be baffling. Western Canada has always wanted a greater, not lesser, role in Canadian confederation. We want in, not out.
In a Canada without Quebec, western Canada would have a much greater say in the governing of the country, and the political balance of power would come to resemble the westward economic flows already taking place.

HEADLINE: How to Answer a Hanging in Nigeria

 BODY:
Scorning pleas for clemency from governments, human rights groups, environmentalists and private citizens across the world, Nigeria's military dictatorship executed Ken Saro-Wiwa yesterday. A military court had convicted him in the murder of four pro-government leaders of the Ogoni people. But Mr. Saro-Wiwa, an anti-government Ogoni leader, was nowhere near the murder scene and was denied a fair chance to defend himself.
For two years, Gen. Sani Abacha's military Government has been systematically eliminating its critics by execution, long prison terms, intimidation and exile. The suppression of dissent has given a corrupt clique of generals a free hand to loot Africa's most populous country and drive it toward a new civil war. 
 Humane principle and raw self-interest compel the rest of the world to respond forcefully. America's Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, made a good start yesterday, urging the Security Council to condemn Nigeria's action. Unfortunately, the Council is unlikely to act. Nigeria is a current member, and China usually vetoes resolutions condemning violations of human rights.
But other effective action is possible. Heads of government from throughout the formerly British Commonwealth are meeting in New Zealand this weekend and weighing graduated sanctions against the Abacha regime. These begin with a suspension of all but humanitarian aid, an end to military cooperation and denial of visas to top officials of the military Government -- moving on, if needed, to a freeze of leaders' overseas financial assets and an oil embargo. Nelson Mandela also wants Nigeria expelled from the Commonwealth.
Commonwealth leaders should apply the initial sanctions at once, and other nations and institutions should join in. Washington, which has led the way on low-level sanctions, should consider tougher measures, including an oil embargo. The United States is one of Nigeria's main oil customers.
Nigeria's self-inflicted tragedy threatens to spread misery throughout West Africa, compromising its neighbors' economic and political prospects. The world must respond with tough and targeted economic sanctions.

HEADLINE: As Crisis Looms, Essential Services Are Assessed

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
If the Government closes down Tuesday morning, as looks increasingly likely, people may find it hard to complain to their congressmen about a delayed Veterans Administration check or the Statue of Liberty turning them away.
That is because 9 of the 15 telephone operators in the House of Representatives will be told to stay home, the first time in the history of Government shutdowns that Congress itself has had to share the consequences of the Government's failure to complete a Federal budget. 
 In the past, Congress exempted itself from many of the laws it wrote for everybody else. But, with the ascendancy this year of Republicans determined to make Congress more accountable, lawmakers subjected themselves to the same treatment.
This time they are joining the legions of other Federal workers being evaluated as to who is essential to Government and who is not, an exercise going on all over town today, where senior officials were deliberating over such questions as:
How would things be arranged to get Air Force One fueled for the President's trip to the Asian Pacific Economic Conference in Japan?
Could the negotiators at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, be paid on time if they continued their peace talks with Balkan leaders?
What would officials say to the 23,000 people holding tickets to the eagerly awaited Vermeer exhibition that opens Sunday -- but may close Tuesday -- at the National Gallery of Art?
Would Labor Department lawyers decide that Consumer Price Index figures, on which securities markets depend, could be published on Wednesday?
Whose scientific experiments could be set aside for an indeterminate period without being ruined?
As Congress pushed through temporary measures extending financing for Government agencies and Government borrowing, both of which President Clinton has pledged to veto, senior administrators throughout the Government braced themselves for what now seems an almost inevitable shutdown.
"It seems very unlikely we could get a turnaround," Alice M. Rivlin, the Budget Director, said in an interview this afternoon. A shutdown of any length, she added, would "be very difficult for a great many people."
Most Federal workers were off today, which the Government was celebrating as Veterans Day. Following a regular, though probably hectic, workday on Monday, some 800,000 Federal workers, or 40 percent of the nonmilitary Government payroll, would be sent home after reporting for duty Tuesday morning if no agreement was reached or imminent.
Those remaining on the job would be those considered essential to public health and safety or part of a cadre needed to complete an orderly shutdown, such as locking offices or concluding last-minute business. About half those to be furloughed are in the Washington, D.C., area, with the rest scattered throughout the United States and in embassies and other facilities abroad.
Most things, of course, are already decided since the Government had made contingency plans earlier in the year for a shutdown on Oct. 1, the first day of the 1996 fiscal year.
Air-traffic controllers would scan radar screens, meat would be inspected, as would passengers arriving from abroad, Amtrak trains would run and the mail would go through. Social Security checks would be distributed as usual and the contractors and states that process Medicare and Medicaid payments would continue to make these payments.
Food stamps would also be available, because the Agriculture Department's financing bill is one of two that have been enacted so far; the other covers military construction.
The Federal Reserve, which obtains its money from its investment portfolio, would continue to move trillions of dollars around the financial world electronically and weather forecasts would be as reliable as ever. Veterans and military hospitals would be almost entirely unaffected.
As for the military, the 1.6 million men and women around the world would remain on duty, though the Pentagon said 279,000 of its 850,000 civilian personnel would be furloughed, mainly those involved in planning, low-priority maintenance or some kinds of training.
And it will be business as usual at the Central Intelligence Agency's headquarters and overseas stations, which, if necessary, could draw on secret contingency funds in a crisis.
"Nobody in the field asks me whether the Continuing Resolution means I can't come to work," a senior official said, referring to the stopgap spending measure.
One of the most visible effects of a Government shutdown would be a severe State Department cutback, perhaps 90 percent, in issuing passports and visas. Passports would be issued only in emergencies, which generally require a ticket to prove an imminent departure as well as extra payment.
"Very quickly you'd see huge lines," predicted Richard Greene, the Department's chief financial officer. Passport offices are expected to be crowded on Monday.
Americans abroad would find curtailed ability to get help if they should get sick, lose documents, be arrested, run out of money or otherwise need embassy aid. In many countries, however, the law requires that local employees be paid. In all, 1,600 of 8,000 State Department employees in the United States would be furloughed, while only 1,800 of 18,000 abroad would be idled.
National parks would also be closed, though visitors will have free, unattended access to some, at least for awhile, as the Interior Department estimates it will take three days to clear campgrounds and concessions.
One of the more complicated and potentially costly situations is that of the thousands of holders of Treasury bills, notes and bonds that come due next week. Today, reflecting the general turmoil over Government finance, the Treasury issued a notice that investors who have given standing instructions for automatic reinvestment of proceeds from maturing issues may lose one or more days of interest.
This would occur if replacement securities cannot be issued as scheduled because the ceiling limiting Government debt had not been raised. For those planning to purchase new 10-year notes, in fact, the Treasury warned that investors would have to pay the Treasury accrued interest from Nov. 15 until the date the bonds are actually issued so they could get a full semi-annual interest payment May 15, 1996.
Although 46 percent of Treasury Department employees would be idled, the Internal Revenue Service would continue processing tax returns and the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing would keep churning out produce coins, currency and stamps.
It was not clear, however, that the Federal Communications Commission could complete its auction, slated for Monday, of licenses to operate "wireless cable" systems.
As for the President, officials said he could go to Japan because the Constitution obliges him to carry out foreign policy, Air Force One being necessary for security and secure communications. The White House entourage, however, was thought likely to be smaller than usual if confined to "essential" personnel.
One White House aide made a dentist appointment for Tuesday afternoon.
At least one Government official, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, seemed resigned to more than the fleeting shutdowns that have prevailed for the past 15 years.
She has been called for jury duty on Monday and has not sought to be excused even though she has been asked to be available for five days.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Taking Stock in Third World;
A World Bank Unit Tries to Jump-Start Capitalism

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Nearly two years after it opened for business, the Lusaka Stock Exchange is not exactly humming.
Thanks to a series of setbacks -- including the murder of the organizer's brother, the delayed privatization of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines and other state-owned businesses and the continuing malaise of the local economy -- the exchange's four employees don't have a great deal to do. On a typical day, 20,000 shares change hands, the equivalent of about 2 seconds of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Yet no one is having second thoughts at the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank agency that served as midwife for the exchange, in the capital of Zambia, in southern Africa.
Sooner or later, foreign investors will discover Zambia, and the sputtering Lusaka market will be one reason they do, say officials of the Washington-based agency. A stock market, they say, even an anemic one, signals an openness to outside investment and raises even a poor country's flag a little higher on the international horizon.
"The stock exchange is the national airline of the 1990's," said Francois Wohrer, an investment officer at the I.F.C.
Indeed, more and more countries like Zambia are turning to exchanges to attract some of the billions of foreign dollars now pouring into the world's emerging markets. And when they do, they usually turn to the International Finance Corporation for help.
Founded nearly 40 years ago, the agency is the World Bank's financing arm for the private sector, with a mandate to stimulate capital markets and promote productive companies in developing countries. Toward that end, it offers technical advice that ranges from setting up stock exchanges and banking systems to writing new commercial laws. And it makes direct investments in companies starved for capital.
In its early years, the agency largely got nowhere. Most economies in the developing world were tightly controlled, and foreign investors could see plenty of risk but little opportunity.
"In the beginning, it was preaching in the desert," said Rudolf H. van der Bijl, a manager in capital markets at the agency.
But all that changed in recent years as the movement to free markets swept through Latin America, Asia and Africa and as the Communist world collapsed. Suddenly, the I.F.C. found itself in demand during a period of growth, with the capitalization of emerging markets increasing more than tenfold in the last decade.
Now, with so many markets bubbling and so many Western investors eager to jump in, the agency is something of a victim of its own success. Some critics in the private sector say it has outlived its usefulness, only getting in the way of smart money that is finding its own opportunities all over the world.
But private money, the agency's defenders note, likes to go where the action is, leaving it to the I.F.C. to get the action started in the first place. The agency is still busy, they say, setting up or repairing stock markets in places as far apart as Romania and West Africa, where it is putting together the first regional exchange in the world.
The Lusaka market, a part of the country's transition from a stagnant, highly centralized economy to a capitalist one, has had all the problems of a typical start-up operation.
The goal was to build a real exchange out of what had been an informal stock trading system, in which shareholders connected through local newspaper ads.
A team of the agency's market specialists arrived in Lusaka in March 1993, 10 months before the market was scheduled to open under the terms of a grant from the World Bank.
The man to meet was Ben Ngenda, a local lawyer who was trying singlehandedly to write the country's new securities laws. "The poor guy, the first time we met him, he was totally lost," said Mr. Wohrer, the investment officer, recalling Mr. Ngenda sitting in his office amid piles of regulations from other countries.
Ultimately, Zambia settled on a leanly run exchange, with four regulators to oversee the four employees, who run things on a single personal computer. I.F.C. officials laud Mr. Ngenda for his role in shaping the exchange, saying that nearly every successful stock market owes its existence to the enthusiasm of one local individual.
But while the exchange opened on schedule, in February 1994, little else has gone right.
Even before opening day, Mr. Ngenda fell out of favor with the Government, which apparently lost the will to privatize as fast as he wanted, and he was not picked to run the country's new securities commission, as the I.F.C. had hoped. Shortly after the opening, under circumstances that remain unclear, Mr. Ngenda's brother, an accountant, was shot and killed while investigating fraud in a local company and Mr. Ngenda's office was ransacked. Mr. Ngenda, who now has bodyguards, has little to do with the exchange anymore.
Meanwhile, the privatization that would have resulted in more companies being listed on the exchange still has not occurred. Indeed, only one company -- Chelanga Cement -- has been privatized and listed so far, although trading of seven other stocks occurs on an unofficial basis.
"You have all this local politics, of which we can only know a tiny bit," said Theresa Barger, who was division chief of the I.F.C. for Africa from 1992 until earlier this year.
For better or worse, the exchange is now pretty much on its own, consulting the agency's officials when needed.
Starting stock markets is only part of the agency's work. Often it will revamp a market that is inefficient, corrupt or simply not functioning. In Venezuela, it helped create an electronic stock exchange, the Bolsa Electronica, that now operates in tandem with a manual exchange.
"When you have the most active emerging market in the world operating on a manual basis, you have a recipe for disaster," said Peter Tropper, a senior investment officer at the agency.
This was also the case in Kenya, where the Nairobi Stock Exchange, which was established in 1954, had slowly withered because of antiquated trading practices and heavy taxes. The agency brought in computers and a better system for clearing trades. It also persuaded the Government to cut taxes. Last year, the market capitalization doubled, to more than $3 billion.
But the success of the agency has led to questions about its relevance. With private-sector specialists in emerging markets seeking opportunities in even some of the most exotic locales, the agency's role is in flux.
In particular, critics say the I.F.C. has a growing reputation for making bad investments in companies. Even when its decisions are sound, it is criticized, because its investments can crowd out private money.
Richard W. Richardson, a former official of the agency who is now a senior adviser to the Overseas Development Council, a private group, said the agency's goal should be its own extinction. But as a practical matter, that is not likely to happen, he added. "People don't like to work themselves out of jobs," he said.
Not everyone in the private sector is sure the agency has been eclipsed.
"The name I.F.C. investing in an opportunity can bring in other investors because they feel the I.F.C. has done its homework," said Marianne Hay, who manages emerging market money for Morgan Stanley, including the firm's $240 million Africa Fund.
The agency has tried to respond to criticism by pushing out into the periphery of emerging markets, to places in Africa and the former Soviet Union. In the year ending June 30, it lent or invested $2.9 billion in 213 projects in 67 countries, a 21 percent increase in financing over the previous year. The agency is underwritten by the 162 countries that belong to the World Bank; it also borrows money on the open market.
Still, many at the agency realize that times have changed.
"The I.F.C. needs to be ahead of the curve -- we go where angels fear to tread," said Ms. Barger, the former division chief for Africa. "As it turns out, angels and devils tread everywhere now."
The agency does have some of the former Communist world to itself, perhaps because it is such hard going there.
In Romania, for example, the first post-Communist Government was enthusiastic about a stock market, calling on the I.F.C. in 1990 to start the process. A team of experts arrived in November 1991, but two months later the Communist Party was voted back into power. Though work on the exchange continued, a subtle harassment campaign was begun against the consultants, said Mary Ellen Iskenderian, who oversaw the project for the agency.
"The first housing was at this old Government resort that was an hour-and-a-half drive out of Bucharest," she said. "It was perceived as a kind of harassment, that they don't want us."
The market officially opened last July, but trading has been put off several times, in part because of a stalled privatization program. Trading is now scheduled to begin Dec. 1.
In fact, privatization, along with controlling inflation and unemployment, is among the key requirements for a stock exchange. The goal is to reach a critical mass of about 20 listed companies.
In West Africa, the agency is trying to get around the shortcomings of individual countries by linking up the seven members of an economic and monetary union.
This regional market would replace the Abidjan Stock Exchange in the Ivory Coast, which has suffered for years, in part because of the requirement, until recently, that prices could not go down.
The new market, which will also include Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo, is expected to have about 60 listed companies when it opens a year from now.
The ultimate test of the agency's work, of course, is what becomes of a market when it is on its own. The prognosis for the Lusaka exchange would appear to be good, despite its light trading so far. In fact, a second company, Shoprite-Checkers, a supermarket operator, is scheduled to be listed in a few weeks.
Ms. Hay of Morgan Stanley is already paying attention. "It's one that we're watching," she said, "and it's one that will be in the Africa Fund at some point."

HEADLINE: Cuba Libre, and Benetton, Too

BYLINE: By Andrew Meier; Andrew Meier writes often about the former Soviet bloc.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Thanks to a Cubana Air flight from a West Indian isle, I recently joined the growing number of Americans who have crossed a final frontier of the cold war. Cuba is one of the hottest destinations in this hemisphere. The tourists may go for sun and sand, but they also bring change. And if enough Americans went, they could bring down their Government's embargo.
Quite a few yanquis are already there. Cuba may be Communism's last haven, a Galapagos of the cold war, but more and more American executives are scouting the terrain. On Oct. 6, the day Mr. Clinton relaxed travel restrictions, Time Warner escorted an entourage of corporate executives to dine with the aging dictator in Havana. (Mr. Castro's table included the heads of G.M., Lockheed, the Gap, Sears, Kmart, Hyatt and two dozen other giants.) 
 Most Americans still have to go via Mexico or the Bahamas or Latin America. As you'd expect, they are an odd collection. There was the author of best-selling thrillers, who confessed, when caught by surprise in a pizzeria near the old Havana Hilton, that he had come in search of material. There was the Southern Baptist, on leave from his floor-tiling business in Georgia, who had come to save the souls, as he put it, of "the voodoo shell-flickers."
Most surprising were the yanqui prospectors eager to make the most of Mr. Castro's fading memory of Marxism. "Hundreds of American businessmen have been here," said a correspondent who has lived in Cuba for years. "They know the place is coming up for sale."
Cuba drifts somewhere between Communism and capitalism. In an air-conditioned hotel room in Havana you watch Bosnians on CNN waiting for bread, while a block away, in the ruins of a colonial villa, men carry home buckets of water five flights up marble stairs. You pay everywhere in dollars and get change in the tourists-only currency (convertible to the dollar at one-to-one). At a hotel bar you have two Coca-Colas, one from Mexico, one from Canada. (Like the Campbell's and Gerber's in the dollars-only stores, they are the forbidden fruit of Nafta.) The Oklahoma oil-and-gas man next to you orders a Jack Daniels and a pack of Marlboros.
In Havana, in short, you find yourself wondering, "What embargo?"
It's a nation open for business. AT&T, Sprint and M.C.I. have provided long-distance links. Benetton has billboards next to faded portraits of Che Guevara. Adidas and Mizuno sponsor Cuban athletes. The Italians have come to sell cars, the Canadians to dig for minerals, the Israelis to plant citrus groves, the Spanish to run resorts.
In its strange intermezzo, Cuba has the same desperate characters I saw in Moscow a few years ago. The pubescent prostitutes in search of exit visas are outnumbered only by the hard-currency scavengers who sense opportunity. But the end may not loom so near for the old guerrilla. Fear pervades Mr. Castro's island, and there is no sign of any Cubano Lech Walesa mobilizing in the cigar factories. Mr. Castro's move in September to allow businesses wholly owned by foreigners will only fortify Cubans with dollars, who are the backbone of his rule.
Americans who want to bring democracy and free enterprise to Cuba needn't be stopped by the embargo. They can go, now, and trade with the enemy.

BOND OF IRON: Master and Slave at Buffalo Forge
By Charles B. Dew. Norton, $14.
 The author provides a detailed portrait of economic and social life at a Virginia ironworks before and after the Civil War. He shows that the industrial skills of the black slave laborers afforded them an autonomy that was unheard of in agriculture. He "complicates and enriches our understanding of the human as well as the larger social and economic meaning of American slavery," Drew Gilpin Faust said here last year.
 
COME ALONG WITH ME: Part of a Novel, Sixteen Stories, and Three Lectures
By Shirley Jackson. Edited by Stanley Edgar Hyman. Penguin, $10.95.
 Long before anyone had heard of Stephen King, a New England writer was turning out stories about the macabre and the surreal, and how frequently they could be found in small towns. This anthology includes Shirley Jackson's best-known story, "The Lottery," as well as her last, unfinished novel and some intriguing insights into her fiction. In 1968 our reviewer, Guy Davenport, said: "Only things haunted by our own touch are worth having; our hell is to live with things haunted by another's hands. Shirley Jackson knew better than any writer since Hawthorne the value of haunted things."
 

MEA CUBA
By Guillermo Cabrera Infante.
Translated by Kenneth Hall with the author.
Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.
 This collection of essays often celebrates Cuban intellectuals while cursing the regime that has crushed many of them, particularly homosexuals. Written by a Cuban expatriate and novelist, these pieces create "a moving chronicle of love and despair for the country he lost to Castro," Alma Guillermoprieto said in these pages last year. The origins of that loss are explored in CONTESTING CASTRO: The United States and the Triumph of the Cuban Revolution, by Thomas G. Paterson (Oxford University, $14.95). The author argues that by backing the dictator Fulgencio Batista and by ignoring the causes of Cuban discontent, the United States helped create the Communist nation at its doorstep. He "succeeds admirably . . . in telling a story that is crucial to understanding the frigid standoff" between the two countries, Thomas Carothers wrote here in 1994.
 
EATING PAVLOVA
By D. M. Thomas. Carroll & Graf, $10.95.
 What if Freud had written a memoir? In this fiction the dying psychoanalyst tells his daughter Anna of adventures, amorous and otherwise, that may or may not be imagined. Last year our reviewer, James R. Kincaid, said, "Stoic wit sustains . . . this extraordinary novel."
 
VOYAGE TO THE GREAT ATTRACTOR: Exploring
Intergalactic Space
By Alan Dressler. Vintage, $13.
 A young astronomer relates the bumpy journey -- both scientific and personal -- that led him and six colleagues to conclude that a vast region of space is being pulled toward some huge yet undiscovered mass called "the great attractor." The book "reads like a novel, with strong characters, conflicts and suspense," Dennis Overbye wrote in the Book Review last year. Cutting-edge science is also the subject of THE QUARK AND THE JAGUAR: Adventures in the Simple and the Complex, by Murray Gell-Mann (W. H. Freeman, $15.95). In it a Nobel Prize-winning physicist explains that it is the tendency of complex systems to emerge from simple ones. "His intellectual power shows through," David Lindley said here last year.
 
TAFT
By Ann Patchett. Ivy, $5.99.
 Fate and circumstance create an unlikely alliance between the narrator, a black bar manager and former bluesman, and two working-class white teen-agers who have recently lost their father. Last year our reviewer, Diana Postlethwaite, said, "Ann Patchett is unique: a generous, fearless and startlingly wise young writer."
 
SEX AND SUITS
By Anne Hollander. Kodansha Globe, $13.
 Everyone knows that tailored clothing is enduring -- but erotic? The author, an art historian, argues that the basic man's suit is both an expression of the modernist esthetic and the wearer's virility. "Her book is a masterly endorsement of fashion's bid to be included among the modern arts," Bill Blass wrote here in 1994.
 
WEST OF YESTERDAY, EAST OF SUMMER: New and
Selected Poems (1973-1993)
By Paul Monette. St. Martin's, $9.95.
 These works bear witness to the poet's life, from early places and events to the advent of AIDS, which eventually claimed two of his lovers and finally himself. The newest are "moving in their anger and their mourning," one critic wrote in 1994. Also reissued is LAST WATCH OF THE NIGHT: Essays Too Personal and Otherwise (Harvest/ Harcourt Brace, $12), which include Monette's reflections on topics from gay politics to his own mortality. "His outrage and passionate convictions drive this book," Claudia Ricci wrote in these pages last year.
 
HUNTERS & GATHERERS
By Geoff Nicholson. Tusk/Overlook, $10.95.
 Steve Geddes is writing a book about collectors. This fictional account of his research shows how even disparate things can be linked. The novel is "clever, entertaining and intriguing," Eric Kraft said in the Book Review earlier this year.
 
BAD HAIRCUT: Stories of the Seventies
By Tom Perrotta. Berkley, $6.99.
 Set in New Jersey, where the author grew up, these 10 tales recount the coming of age of the narrator, Buddy. Mr. Perrotta "carefully details the texture of his childhood world," Jennifer Howard wrote in these pages in 1994. LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: By Douglas Durst;
A Savvy Developer Who Marches to His Own Beat

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
BACK in the summer of 1987, the Durst Organization began building 114 West 47th Street. It was a time when developers were putting up huge office towers all over the West Side, certain that the appetite for high-priced space would never be slaked.
Not Seymour B. Durst. He did not build until United States Trust signed on for more than half the building. And if U.S. Trust were to back out, he said at the time, "we won't proceed further than the excavation." U.S. Trust didn't, the building went up on schedule and, unlike other towers of the time, it remained fiscally sound. 
 Now fast-forward to the fall of 1995. Most developers will not consider building without a tenant in tow. But not Seymour's son, Douglas. He wants to build an office tower on the east side of Broadway, between 42d and 43d Streets -- on spec. In fact, he just took $215 million in first mortgages on three of his other buildings to do so.
"My father understood that the market was overbuilt in 1987, and I understand that space is scarce in 1995," Douglas Durst said.
Spoken in true Durst contrarian fashion! Ever since Joseph Durst, Seymour's father, started the company in 1915, the Dursts have marched to their own drum sounds.
They bailed out of residential properties in the 1940's, as soon as rent control was installed. They embraced the Grand Central area, building office towers on Third Avenue when most developers thought the market stopped at Fifth Avenue, and on Sixth Avenue when those same rivals doubted that corporations would place their headquarters that far west.. And while other real estate families built downtown, or outside city limits, the Dursts stubbornly stuck to midtown in the 40's.
"My father would not build anything he could not walk to," Douglas Durst recalled.
Five years ago, the Dursts sued to stop four buildings from going up on Times Square, saying that adding that much space would destroy the market. They lost the suit -- but the economy did what the courts did not, and the towers have yet to be built.
Now, Douglas Durst thinks the time to build is here. He may be right. According to RELocate, which tracks rental space, only about 18 percent of the 215 million square feet of office space in midtown is less than 15 years old. Only five of the newer buildings have large blocks of contiguous space.
"I don't think Douglas is dreaming," said Stephen B. Siegel, the Edward S. Gordon Company's president. "On a limited basis, this market can absorb new construction."
Nor are many new buildings in the offing. Brokers say that HRO International is very close to getting a tenant -- and thus, financing -- for a new tower at Madison Avenue and 47th Street. The only other possible project -- the tower that Rockefeller Center Development Corporation wants to build at 49th Street and Seventh Avenue -- has been indefinitely sidelined. The tower must use the air rights from some of Rockefeller Center's bankrupt buildings, and the bankruptcy court now controls those rights.
"Even if the air rights were settled tomorrow, it could take three years before we started building," said Jonathan D. Green, the Development Corporation's president.
The Dursts, in contrast, are raring to go. When Seymour Durst died, at age 81, last May, he left a legacy of nearly 5 million square feet of office space, in eight buildings that, brokers say, are invariably well maintained, modernized and realistically priced -- and thus, almost fully rented. They are also all within an easy walk of each other.
The 50-year-old Douglas, now the company's president (the Durst mantle of leadership normally passes by seniority, but Douglas's older brother, Robert, is uninterested), is holding to his father's ideas of constant capital improvement and geographic tightness. But otherwise, he will not march lock-step to the beat his father heard.
"There may not be substantial differences, but there will be subtle changes in methods and approaches," he said.
The changes thus far have not at all been subtle. Douglas Durst is looking for equity partners for the Times Square tower; his father was a development loner. Seymour Durst would only build as-of-right; his son is quite willing to negotiate zoning rules.
And while the father stuck to his real estate knitting, the son believes in diversification, particularly when it dovetails with his personal interests. Douglas Durst is an avid supporter of the arts; this year the Durst Organization co-produced "Hamlet" on Broadway. Douglas Durst and his wife, Susanne, are avid equestrians and environmentalists who have long used horse manure to enrich the soil on their 300-acre organic farm in Northeast, N.Y. (Miscellaneous fact: Eli Zabar sells Durst tomatoes at his Vinegar Factory.) Now the Durst Organization is talking to an Italian company about a joint venture in composting.
Mr. Durst makes no apologies for stamping such a personal imprimatur on the company. "I am making the decisions now," he said. "So far, I've been pretty successful."
INDEED he has. Douglas Durst joined his father's firm in 1968, armed with a bachelor's degree in economics. For his first decade, he spent a lot of time handling personal residential projects, learning the management side of the business, and familiarizing himself with the company's buildings and leases. By the 1980's he was ready to immerse himself in deal-making.
Today, his 39-year-old cousin, Jonathan (known as Jody), handles operations, while his cousin Joshua, 37, handles residential properties and development sites.
Deal-making remains Douglas's bailiwick, but he does not rule by fiat. About three years ago he led negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service, which has since moved into 1133 Avenue of the Americas, which spans 43d to 44th Streets. The deal was complex, involving carving a side entrance to the building and sealing off an entire floor to satisfy zoning density rules.
Others at the negotiating table remember him as clearly in charge of the deal but ready to take advice from his cousins, from the tenants, even from brokers.
"Douglas is a leader, but he leads through team effort," said Carol Nelson, Gordon's executive vice president. Joseph Siegel, an I.R.S. executive, concurred. "Douglas's style was to work through other people," he said. "He's clearly on top, but he knows how to delegate."
What he does not know how to do, Mr. Siegel said, is make small talk. "Douglas is more curt than other developers," he said.
Indeed, in an industry rife with tales of tantrums and scenes, there are few stories circulating about any of the Dursts.
"Interesting anecdotes come about from problem deals," said Ira Schuman, an executive vice president at Julien J. Studley. "With the Dursts, there's no screaming or histrionics; it's just boring and reliable."
And it seems that Douglas Durst, while not humorless, is known as particularly taciturn. "He doesn't like fluff and he doesn't say a lot, and what he does say, he has thought through," said Tara I. Stacom, a Cushman & Wakefield senior director. Added Mary Ann Tighe, a Gordon executive managing director who worked on the I.R.S. deal: "Seymour's sense of humor was elfin and twinkly, Doug's is ironic and deadpan."
Nor do tenants necessarily miss the social niceties. "We cut our deal with the Dursts in six weeks," said Robert J. Egan, a partner at the law firm Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, which in 1994 moved to 1133 Avenue of the Americas. "Somewhere else, it might have taken six months."
One reason for the speed, several brokers note, is that Mr. Durst never lets his ego get involved in deals. They say he readily seeks advice, he is flexible on rents, and gives in to demands for such things as extra electricity, even if he feels they aren't warranted.
"He's more concerned with building a relationship than with getting the last 50 cents on a deal," said Josh N. Kuriloff, a Cushman & Wakefield senior director.
 BUT Mr. Durst does have a massive dose of economic pragmatism. For example, he is quite willing to rent space in prime office buildings to less than stellar retailers. One example: He rented the store at 201 East 42d Street to Conway's, a discounter.
"He goes for the best tenant available at the best rent he can get," said Benjamin Fox, a partner of New Spectrum.
("They were supposed to deliver a more upscale store, but the lease language wasn't as enforceable as we thought," said Mr. Durst.)
Mr. Durst says he is in "discussions" with Conway about the store's image. He is also, although he won't discuss it, probably in discussions about where his company goes from here.
Mr. Durst says that, despite his bullishness on the economy, he would not build a speculative office tower that did not hook up to the site the Dursts own to the east of the one on which he wants to build. Once he puts a tower on that site -- probably six years from now -- that's the end of the Durst commercial assemblages.
But, with no creditors or shareholders to satisfy, Mr. Durst can take his time deciding strategy. The chances of the company leaving family control are nil. Either Jody or Joshua will probably take over in a few decades. Yet another cousin, Kristopher, 23, is joining the company this year.
So far, none of Douglas's three children -- one son, 25, and two daughters, 18 and 27 -- have joined the business, but he does not rule it out. "When she was 8, my youngest daughter said she wanted to be president of this company some day," he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if she does it."

THE CONFIDENCE GAME
How Unelected Central Bankers
Are Governing the Changed
Global Economy.
By Steven Solomon.
Simon & Schuster, $30.
 While the title "The Confidence Game" might suggest another harangue against the power of central bankers, Steven Solomon argues that their independence is necessary. Hundreds of billions of dollars began flowing faster and faster through international financial markets in the 1980's, threatening to swamp any country's economic policies with little warning. In that environment, writes Mr. Solomon, a freelance financial journalist, "the democratic self-interest was increasingly best served by delegating monetary responsibility to an independent, nonpartisan cadre of internationally minded technocrats dedicated to continuity and financial order rather than relying on the right thing being done by foreign governments prone to political expedience, bouts of paralysis and incompetence." Despite the book's international theme, the focus is more on the Federal Reserve than the Bank of Japan or Germany's Bundesbank. Mr. Solomon is also more descriptive than analytical. Much of the book consists of a year-by-year -- and even month-by-month -- description of international monetary policy through the 80's and early 90's. But anyone who needs to know about recent international economic history -- particularly American college students in economics -- will find this book a solid review of the background to today's news.

ARTISTS AT WORK
Sixteen years ago several artists seeking inexpensive work space found some vacant buildings on Canal Street in the Industrial Park area of Stamford. Since then the artists' numbers have grown along with their status and they are called the Loft Artist Association. 
 Each year they have held an Open Studio Tour and the 1995 edition on Saturday and Sunday is supported by grants from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation and Heyman Properties. More than 35 painters, sculptors, photographers, performance artists, puppeteers and other creative tenants will be on hand from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. both days, exhibiting their work and their workplaces.
This year's event is dedicated to Reuben Nakian, the Stamford-based sculptor who died in 1986. A collection of his original plaster figures and cast bronzes, first moved into the complex 15 years ago, has been installed in its own new gallery.
Admission is free and visitors will be offered refreshments as they wander through the studios. To reach the site, at 737 Canal Street, take Exit 8 northbound from Interstate 95 onto Canal Street, or Exit 7 southbound and left onto Canal Street. For more information call 961-0658.
 
HOLLYWOOD TURKEYS
Tom Holehan and the Stratford Library have collected some of Hollywood's tackiest movies, dubbed them "The Turkey Film Festival," and scheduled them on Monday through Friday of this week. All screenings are at noon, uncut, free of charge, and audiences are welcome to bring bag lunches. Mr. Holehan, a director, arts critic and member of the library staff, will offer commentary on each film.
The first, "Butterfield 8," released in 1960 won an Oscar for Elizabeth Taylor. Some believe the award was mainly for Ms. Taylor's spunk during filming, when she experienced the first of many hospitalizations.
Tuesday's film, "Can't Stop the Music" (1980), puts Tammy Grimes, Valerie Perrine, June Havoc and Bruce Jenner in musical numbers reminiscent of parents' weekend at summer camp. In "Johnny Guitar" (1954) Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge battle each other and the Old West in cowgirl outfits.
"Mandingo," produced in 1975, miscast James Mason as a bigoted Southern plantation owner. The final opus, "Bride of the Monster" (1956), starred Bela Lugosi and was directed by Ed Wood. The library is at 2203 Main Street and the phone number is 385-4162.
 
HANDMADE GIFTS
The line forms outside hours before the annual Christmas sale of the New Canaan Sewing Group opens. The group, which was founded in 1931, now numbers more than 100 women who contribute their handiwork and have made their organization a treasured source of gifts for Christmas, birthdays, graduations and other events.
Doors will open on Thursday at 10 A.M. at Waveny House in Waveny Park, 677 South Avenue, and close at 2 P.M. Not a lot of time to go through the plethora of needlework, decoupage, lace, table linens, pillows, doll clothes and furniture, miniatures of historic New Canaan buildings, handknitted sweaters and mittens.
Over the years the volunteers have contributed nearly $775,000 in profits to area charities and social agencies. Last year some 22 organizations shared $40,000 raised through the sale. (More information: 966-1171).
 
BEIJING TROUPE
The Central Ballet of China, appearing at Jorgensen Auditorium in Storrs on Tuesday at 8 P.M., combines folk idioms with the traditions of classical Russian ballet. Its dancers have been coached over the 34-year history of the company by such distinguished dancers and choreographers as Rudolf Nureyev and Beryl Grey.
The troupe, which is based in Beijing, deals artistically with repressive attitudes at home, as in the piece called "New Year's Sacrifice," wherein a forcibly married young Chinese bride is unveiled -- bound and gagged.
Other portions of the program are described as more balletic, contemporary, funny, and in "Pas de Quatre" show the power and style of the male members of the troupe.
Tickets at $10 to $14, with discounts for students and older people, may be reserved by calling 486-4226.
 
ALONG THE WATER
Connecticut's riverfront and shoreline areas are the focus of the third annual conference on preserving historic landscapes, organized by the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. Titled "Where Land and Water Meet," the conference will take place on Wednesday from 8:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. at Water's Edge Inn in Westbrook.
Waterfronts, managed by various municipalities, are difficult to control regionally. Some areas --including Norwich, New London, Derby, Norwalk and Collinsville -- have embarked on redeveloping their waterfronts as centers of retailing and recreation. Many rural communities are faced with sewage systems designed for summer cottages that have in recent years become year-round homes surrounded by additional development of larger homes.
Guilford, Westbrook, Portland and Westport are experiencing severe pressure for development by commercial interests, and cities like New Haven, Hartford and Middletown would like to reopen public access to their waterways, which are currently cut off by highways and railroads.
Among the speakers in the morning session are Elizabeth Mills Brown, architectural historian from the Waterfront Center of Washington, D.C.; James Gibbons, planner, and Peter Patton, Wesleyan University professor.
Three workshops offered during the afternoon include a two-and-a-half-hour cruise on the Connecticut River, narrated by Bruce Yenawine of the Connecticut River Museum in Essex; a session on preservation and planning, and one on economic development by Charles Brilvitch, municipal historian from Bridgeport.
Advance registration is $50, $55 on the day, including lunch. The cruise costs an additional $20, and the conference plus a one-year membership in the trust is $70. Call 562-6312 to register or obtain more information.
 
IN A DEVIL'S DEN
A walk through the Devil's Den Nature Preserve in Weston will now be easier with the publication of a 48-page self-guide booklet available from a box at the map shelter in the parking lot. It costs $3, but may be borrowed free of charge if it is returned in good condition.
The Saugatuck region of the 1,720-acre preserve is featured, with 19 stations along the trail. The booklet is designed to accommodate visitors who complete a hike of the trail or who come back to finish their trek on another day. The booklet covers the ecosystem of the preserve, its biodiversity, watershed protection, trees, plants and animals, and human activity.
The booklet was written by Lillian Willis and illustrated by Dick Maccabe, edited and researched by Stephen Patton and Lise Hanners. The Nature Conservancy preserve may be reached via Route 57 off Exit 42 of the Merritt Parkway, east on Godfrey Road to Pent Road, which ends at the preserve's parking area.

HEADLINE: CITY LIFE;
In Trenton, a Ditch That Was a Canal Fights for a Comeback

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
For most of its meandering route across central New Jersey, the Delaware and Raritan Canal is quiet and scenic, an extended waterfront park with a broad pathway where mules once pulled canal boats. Here in Trenton, it recalls this city's industrial prime of nearly a century ago, when barges carried coal and lumber through a thriving business district.
But for generations, the canal's Trenton section has been anything but thriving: a muddy, garbage-strewn ditch through a neighborhood of dilapidated houses and abandoned warehouses, of vacant lots roamed by drug dealers and vagrants who barely notice the nearby Battle Monument commemorating George Washington's first victory in the Revolutionary War. 
 Now, city officials are trying to restore the canal and its neighborhood to a semblance of their former selves through a $60 million Canal Banks project, which would rehabilitate houses and public spaces. Although the project has only begun, there are signs of progress: tractors churning, houses going up, pedestrian paths being blazed.
"For many years, the canal has almost been a negative, not a positive," said Mayor Douglas H. Palmer. "But the water gives any city a great opportunity to develop, and when you couple that with highway access, you have an area that has a lot of potential."
In fact, it was highway access that hastened the neighborhood's decline in the 1950's. With the construction of Routes 1 and 29, much of the traffic through the Battle Monument area, known as Five Points, was diverted from the inner city. By the early 90's, the area had become a drug hangout surrounded by bars and liquor stores. Today, unemployment in the neighborhood is 22 percent -- twice the city's average -- and a third of the 6,500 residents are below the poverty level.
In 1991, the city proposed a wide-ranging redevelopment project for the 265-acre Canal Banks Neighborhood Target Area. Alan Mallach, the city's director of housing and development, says the project has symbolic significance: Five Points is the geographical heart of the city, and the monument commemorates the battle that put Trenton on the map. And Trenton is, after all, the state capital.
Mr. Mallach says that although serious work has been going on for only a year or so, and not always smoothly, the progress is encouraging.
Take North 25 Park, an unsightly concrete jungle gym and unofficial drug center that was demolished last year and resodded this summer. (It takes its name from a nearby center for the elderly.) The city plans to add benches and playground equipment next year. It will do the same for the triangular Battle Monument Park, with new benches and other improvements expected by next summer.
Along the canal, a three-mile pedestrian and bicycle path is being cleared. Parallel to the canal will be a linear park along a former railroad right-of-way. Until this summer, that right-of-way was a drainage ditch, overflowing with debris and the nastiest of rodents. Now, part of the ditch has been paved over, flanked by newly planted trees and new curbs.
Another high priority is the rehabilitation of vacant but structurally sound buildings to create new housing, particularly for home buyers. About 150 homes have been built; the goal is 600 by 1999. At the same time, the city plans to redevelop several abandoned buildings, including an 11-acre Magic Marker factory on Calhoun Street, to attract businesses. A small shopping center has been planned along North Broad Street.
To pay for the project, the city has tapped a variety of sources: a state contribution of $3 million, from money that became available when the Richard J. Hughes Justice Center was refinanced; $1.5 million from the Capital City Redevelopment Corporation, a state agency, and assorted other millions from Federal, state and private grants. A total of $15 million has been spent on or committed to the project, but at least $40 million to $50 million is still needed, Mr. Mallach said.
Bill Valocchi, project coordinator for the Canal Banks redevelopment, said the early financing and work had provided a sort of foundation for the effort. But he added: "There are a lot of unknowns. If we couldn't continue the process, it could easily go back to the way it was."
Residents have largely supported the venture, although there have been some reservations about turning what has long been a business district into one that is mostly residential. Jeffrey W. Utley, owner of Willie's Restaurant on North Broad Street, is pleased with the project even though he must move his business up the road to clear the way for new housing.
"It's hard for me to get uprooted, but in the long run, it's going to pay off, not only for me, but the community and the city and the other people who have been dying for some changes," he said. "I hope it's contagious. If you live next door to someone who's always sloppy, and you clean up your own place, they're going to start catching on. And those who don't catch on are going to leave, because they'll stick out like a bad needle."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
Mrs. Whitman's First Lady

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
CHRISTABEL VARTANIAN says she has one of the best jobs in the Whitman administration: She is in charge of graciousness. For Ms. Vartanian, the job seems as tailor-made as the pink fitted jacket she wore one recent morning on a tour of the official mansion, Drumthwacket.
The job, head of protocol, pays $55,385 and is a new one -- for a very good reason. While Mrs. Whitman entered office equipped with a First Gentleman -- John Whitman, an investment banker -- he was not willing to take over traditional First Lady jobs: planning dinners, rescuing guests stranded awkwardly at official cocktail parties, presiding over household staff meetings, charming visiting legislators and business leaders. 
 So this Governor, the first woman to serve as New Jersey's head of state, needed her own First Lady -- someone unquestioningly loyal and discreet, with an ambassador's sense of propriety. Fittingly, she turned to her old friend, supporter and neighbor, Ms. Vartanian.
True to form, Ms. Vartanian rose to the challenge, and with characteristic graciousness. "I'm fortunate she asked me," she said.
But what does this new department actually do? For starters, Ms. Vartanian and her two assistants deal in details. They dig up new addresses for the holiday cards, approve the gilt state seal on the dinner invitations, coordinate the napkin colors with the tablecloths, procure fresh orange juice for the Saudi Ambassador while making sure the skirts of all women within his sight cover their knees. Through all of this, she eschews the limelight, letting credit fall on the Governor or the staff.
She is more than a social secretary, though. With the Governor's scheduler, she plots out Mrs. Whitman's days. Her charge is those social events that are really business, as opposed to the Governor's few social events that are actually for fun. Typical of a year's hundreds of occasions are a high tea for the Ambassador of Mongolia, a cocktail party for the Coalition for Lower Taxes, a luncheon for the Heavy Construction Coalition.
This particular morning, the occasion is a children's tour of the six formal downstairs rooms of Drumthwacket, the Governor's official mansion in Princeton. The upstairs rooms, like those in the White House, are private, for family living. The children are from Far Hills Country Day School, which the two Vartanian children -- Nishan, now 19 and at Rollins College, and Annabel, now 17 and at Blair Academy -- attended, along with the Whitman children.
Ms. Vartanian looks impeccable in her pink jacket with black trim over a black dress and black pumps -- an outfit reminiscent of those Jacqueline Kennedy wore as First Lady. There is, in fact, a vague resemblance, in the swinging dark hair and oval face with blusher-flushed cheeks.
"The Governor was really excited to hear you were coming," she tells a foyer filled with children, "and she was so sorry she couldn't be here."
If the Governor, in fact, had more pressing engagements than greeting a schoolchildren's tour, Ms. Vartanian gives no hint. She seems to be of a rapidly evaporating school of women who learned to soothe, to defer, to charm, to tip things into the most favorable light. And to be savvy while doing it. Of the gate-enclosed, antique-filled mansion surrounded by rolling lawns and gardens, attended by servants, she says, "Really, this is the people's house."
Only two statements approached anything like criticism: "The transition was not the smoothest thing," said said of the hand-off from the previous administration, and: "We don't want to criticize Giuliani's staff. I do believe he has someone in protocol." She was referring to the diplomatic uproar that ensued when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani forced Yasir Arafat to leave a concert during United Nations festivities in Manhattan.
Ms. Vartanian grew up in Clewiston, in South Florida, daughter of one of the town's most important men. Her father, Loyd Kelly, owned the Caterpillar tractor franchise in the country's biggest sugar-growing area.
SHE was valedictorian of Clewiston High School, and majored in theater and English at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla. She prefers to keep her age private, explaining, "I'm from the South." At Rollins, she met her husband, Paul, who now sells antique jewelry wholesale from an office in Manhattan. They moved to Long Island and then Bedminster. Through Governor Whitman's parents -- "such gracious people, so welcoming" -- she met John and Christie Whitman. That was around 1974. When Ms. Whitman ran for Governor, the Vartanians offered "moral support" and helped organize fund-raising events.
Accepting the new Governor's request to help out, Ms. Vartanian found herself immediately facing a weeklong series of parties for the World Cup soccer championships. She needed to identify, find addresses for, invite and prepare for 3,000 guests
"I had no lists," she said. Lists, and lists of lists, are her basic tools.
She and Rachel Donington, an assistant, began by drawing up alphabetical categories: Assembly members, senators, cabinet members, celebrities and members of the clergy, the press and sports figures. They asked friends and acquaintances. They looked up Italian and German corporate divisions in the state -- for the countries playing -- and invited the chief operating officers. They came up with 22 computer-printed pages of names and addresses of prominent people to invite to the parties.
Ms. Vartanian shopped until she found the perfect fabric for tablecloths -- a soccer-ball print -- and had soccer-ball invitations printed. She located New Jersey singers and musicians.
Her philosophy of party-giving is to "get the big picture." Menus, caterers, decorations and entertainment -- all revolve around that.
If the World Cup parties were "lighthearted," sporty, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial fund-raising event was "patriotic." There, she arranged for life-sized bronze statues of a wounded soldier, his buddy and a nurse to be placed in the center of the big tent on the lawn. The state troopers' bagpipe and drum corps played.
"It was wonderful they had that opportunity," said Ms. Vartanian, apparently referring to both the musicians and the guests.
"It was fabulous," said Ms. Donington, who is 26, and postponed law school for this "only happens once" job. "They loved it."
Ms. Vartanian: "We try to make people comfortable."
Ms. Donington: "People are so enthusiastic. It's so rewarding."
Referring to the Governor, Ms. Vartanian said: "Of course our parties are only as good as she is." In setting the tone of events, she added, "we want to reflect how the Governor would like things to be; we think of that first."
Ms Donington: "We make the style. Style is just as important as strong policies."
The heart of the style and the protocol is Drumthwacket, 150 years old, with its busts and portraits of George Washington and its thick curtains and archways, three chiming grandfather clocks and brilliantly shined oval desk for signing bills into law. The mansion is grand and lovely, like a period museum, and so formal that both the footsteps and voices of the staff members, volunteers and docents seem muffled, hushed. Even the iced tea is striking, made by a Drumthwacket recipe that includes fresh mint grown in the garden.
Drumthwacket, Ms. Donington said, "is perfect." And she went on: "It's karma. Good things happen at a place where good people are doing the good things."
Those things, by necessity, include feeding and amusing some 10,000 guests a year. Inexorably, the parties continue -- tea for 100 from the Federation of Jewish Women, a reception for the 80 members of the Garden Club of New Jersey, dinner for the Mexican Economic Trade Summit, a group of 20.
In addition Ms. Vartanian and Ms. Donington are planning Mr. Whitman's project for governor's spouses. This year the theme is "children and violence," and Mr. Whitman and Ms. Vartanian are trying to get a "Just say no to violence" campaign going. They're starting with a poster contest for juvenile offenders.
MEANWHILE, there are everyday crises. Making sure, for instance, that extra place settings are removed from banquet tables, something the White House staff neglected, Ms. Vartanian once noted when she was there. Or if, as she has done, Governor Whitman makes a last-minute appearance somewhere. It happened recently when Pope John Paul II arrived at Newark International Airport. To make sure the Governor had a chair, somebody hastily handed one over the fence to somebody else, who put it on the tarmac minutes before the Governor walked over. "Too last-minute for me," Ms. Vartanian said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
After Assassination, Israel Is a Fragile Market

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
AS a shaken Israel recovers from the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli financial markets are girding for two big tests in coming weeks.
Ever important will be the participation of American and other foreign investors, who had been moving into Israel in recent months, but who may now remain on the sidelines for the short term. 
 Perhaps they have good reason. The Israeli markets are likely to be fragile and volatile, with poor earnings from even a single company -- like the disappointing report last week from the high-technology manufacturer Elbit -- capable of sending the entire market down. The Mishtanim index of 100 stocks on the Tel Aviv stock exchange fell 1.8 percent in extremely light trading last week.
Well before the Rabin assassination, the stock market had been depressed, hurting even well-regarded companies like ECI Telecommunications Ltd., Bezeq, Tadiran and Teva Pharmaceutical.
The first big test for the Israeli markets since the assassination will come as early as this week, with a nearly $130 million stock sale in the United States for Koor Industries, a Tel Aviv-based conglomerate that is a mirror of the Israeli economy.
A second test will come later this month when Israel seeks to sell $250 million of government bonds.
But in the long run, Israeli and American financial analysts say the biggest test will be the ability of the Government of Shimon Peres, Mr. Rabin's successor, to continue the peace process and to calm the political waters at home. A signal of his success or lack thereof could come in elections as early as February. If a Peres Government manages to provide stability for the Israeli political system, it would build confidence among American, European and other foreign investors, the market watchers said.
For all the foreign investors now getting cold feet, "there are many, many more who have not invested at all and are actively considering it," said Lior Bregman, an Israeli market analyst for Oppenheimer & Company. "Israel, you must remember, is a country that performs better in crisis than under normal circumstances."
Israel has the largest nonoil economy in the region, and a growing number of financial analysts say it has been unfairly lumped with emerging markets like Mexico, now suffering from a currency crisis.
Having absorbed a flood of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Israel continues a remarkable transformation from a war economy to a powerful peacetime economy whose principal export markets are Western Europe, North America and Asia. Its gross domestic product will probably rise this year by more than 6.5 percent.
Foreign investors have finally started to move into Israel, including such marquee names as Nestle, Cable and Wireless, Intel, Motorola and even Roy Disney, the nephew of Walt Disney, whose Shamrock Holdings is already a big investor in Koor.
The market reception of Koor's planned sale of nearly seven million American depositary receipts this week will be closely watched. The sale has already been delayed a week, in part because of the Rabin assassination but also because of concern over market demand. Koor, with nearly $3 billion in 1994 revenue, is Israel's largest industrial group. It has interests in Tadiran, a maker of telecommunications equipment; Makhteshim Chemical Works, a pesticide maker; Nesher Israel Cement Enterprises, a construction company, and Sonol Israel, one of the country's largest chain of gas stations. "You buy Koor and you are buying Israel," Mr. Bregman said.
As is often the case in the Middle East, the outlook for business in Israel is complex. True, the Likud party has moved a bit from the right toward the center over the years, and the socialist-leaning Labor party, the party of Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres, has moved somewhat toward the center as well. Both support similar economic policies, like privatization and the deregulation of financial markets and of foreign investments.
But the remaining differences are significant. If Likud, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, wins the election, it may return to its past policy of devoting hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. Besides provoking the Arabs, such an action would drain money from the Labor party's program of building roads, modernizing telephone service and other public spending that is critical to business.
Whatever the bumps along the way, the peace process may be inevitable. "Peace is on automatic pilot," said David Rosenberg, research director for Pacific Mediterranean Capital Markets Group, a research firm in Herzliya, a Tel Aviv suburb. "Short of disavowing the Oslo agreement, Netanyahu has to go through with it."
But even peace has its implications for business. Should Syria reach an agreement with Israel on the disputed Golan Heights, defense spending would rise temporarily, mainly to pay for redeploying military bases, curbing civilian spending.
No matter which party takes control of the country, it will have to deal with some clouds hanging over the economy and the financial markets. Inflation, tame until recently, threatens to flare, though not to the ruinous 400 percent levels of the 1980's. Now exceeding 7.5 percent annually, inflation could reach double digits next year.
Interest rates, recently stable, appear to have nowhere to go but up. Israelis are already paying a real interest rate of nearly 8 percent, compared with 3 percent or so in the United States. And the burgeoning trade deficit is likely to double to more than $10 billion this year.
"You somehow have to find a way to finance this growing trade deficit," said Victor Halpert, who follows Israeli securities for Salomon Brothers in London. "But Israelis themselves, disappointed with the performance of the stock market last year, are not participating in stocks. Therefore, Israel needs more foreign investment and must borrow more money through the sale of bonds."

Baruch Plans Hung Up as S.R.O. Holdouts Hang On

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
When Jim Davis looks at the Hotel Gramercy, a shabby warren of tiny rooms in a faded brick building at 24th Street and Lexington Avenue, he sees a bit of New York history -- a single-room occupancy hotel devoid of crack and crime, a haven for genteel people who happen to be down-at-the-heels. (Murray Kempton, the writer, planned to spend a night in the hotel and ended up staying for three years in the late 1970's, said Mr. Davis, an unemployed construction worker and handbag designer.)
But when officials from the state's Dormitory Authority look at the sagging seven-story hotel, which is said to be more than a century old, they see a potential roadblock in the final phase of a proposed multi-million dollar project that will consolidate Baruch College, which is now housed in six leased buildings from 18th to 26th Streets. (The first phase, a $159 million library and technology center, opened at 151 East 25th Street, in September 1994.) 
 The Dormitory Authority would like to demolish the Gramercy and the Amsterdam Hotel, once a crime-ridden S.R.O., as well as most of the other buildings in an area bounded by 24th and 25th Streets and Lexington and Third Avenues to make room for a $270 million, 416,800-square-foot hulk that will house classrooms, academic offices, physical education facilities and an auditorium. Demolition is scheduled to begin next spring.
The problem is that 19 scrappy residents of the Gramercy and the Amsterdam will not budge. They are appealing a State Supreme Court decision granting the Dormitory Authority a condemnation order; a hearing is set for December. "This is a David and Goliath story," Mr. Davis said.
Donald Eng, a lawyer with David Rozenholc & Associates, a Manhattan firm representing nine of the tenants, added: "Baruch can expand without taking S.R.O. units. You're going to have more homeless people on the street."
In 1991, John Egan, the former executive director of the Dormitory Authority, promised Community Board 6 that displaced S.R.O. tenants would be relocated within the neighborhood in equal or better housing and that 155 units of S.R.O. housing would be built in the neighborhood to replace the demolished units.
The Dormitory Authority doesn't dispute this. But now, it says Mr. Egan was not authorized by the State Legislature to build replacement housing. "It was not a legal promise," said Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the Dormitory Authority, adding that the agency is not obligated to relocate the remaining tenants but has hired a relocation company and a social worker to help them find housing. Residents of the S.R.O.'s say they have been interviewed by the relocation company, Relocation Management Associates, but have not been shown any new housing.
The former owner of the Gramercy and Amsterdam, LB Oil Company, stopped renting rooms when residents died or moved away. Some were harassed into leaving, said Mr. Davis, citing heating and electrical problems that went unattended. John E. Tuchler, who managed the buildings for LB Oil, denied any campaign of harassment and added that all tenants were offered $7,500 to leave.
But the remaining tenants deny they were offered a financial incentive. "Why would they offer money to an old bird like me?" said Lawrence Clayton, 89, a 22-year resident of the Gramercy.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Future View: Reorganized Industry, Change in Sales

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
BRACE for a complete reorganization of the investment management business in the United States, Goldman, Sachs & Company says. A host of pension funds, mutual funds and institutions now manage $6 trillion, but rising costs and global competition will reduce the field to a handful of dominant companies and many small specialty firms, Goldman predicts in a recent report, "The Coming Evolution of the Investment Management Industry: Opportunities and Strategies."
In the mutual fund industry, Goldman expects several big changes in how funds are distributed to investors. For now, there are simply too many funds vying for too few assets, meaning that brokers, financial advisers and others who distribute funds have considerable leverage over fund companies and can demand high fees for their services for the foreseeable future. 
 But there will continue to be a movement away from products sold by full-service brokers, who impose sales charges of perhaps 5 percent of the amount invested, according to Goldman. For investors who want advice, financial planners will be the distributor of choice, Goldman predicted. Their fees are relatively low, at 1 percent to 1.5 percent of assets under management. Also, the financial interests of planners and investors can be aligned, whereas brokers may have incentives to sell specific funds.
In the "do it yourself" camp, investors will probably shift away from dealing with fund companies directly and toward electronic systems. Discount brokers like Charles Schwab and Fidelity Brokerage already allow investors to make fund purchases from many companies through them and then send out consolidated statements of fund holdings, reducing the paperwork. (Along the way, no-load fund companies may rely more heavily on electronic distributors to whom they pay a toll.)
But electronic distribution and financial advisers will help investors understand the taxes on and risks of their holdings. With more knowledge about taxes, investors may flee from funds with both taxable and tax-deferred money in search of the best treatment for each. Companies will probably respond with more products for those interested in minimizing taxes.
Investors now have trouble determining risk, partly because many managers have broad authority and because disclosure of holdings must be made only twice a year. With better information about risk from advisers and electronic services, investors may demand changes.
 
Through a Glass Ceiling
 Women keep showing up as managers of the leading money market funds. Among the seven taxable money fund categories, women ran the top-performing funds in five categories as of Sept. 22, said IBC's Money Market Insight, an industry newsletter. That quirk prompted an IBC survey, which found that 43.3 percent of the 987 money funds are run by women. (Funds with more than one manager were excluded from the survey.) By comparison, women run just 11.5 percent of stock funds and 13.8 percent of taxable bond funds. They show up more often at municipal bond funds, at 22 percent.
A money fund is generally considered a stepping stone to a stock or bond fund, said Tracy Burk, the editor of IBC's Money Fund Report in Ashland, Mass. There are fewer securities to analyze in money funds than in stock and bond funds. The concentration of women reflects their recent entry in the money management business, Ms. Burk said, and suggests that many will move to the stock and bond side in coming years.
As to questions about bias, the women who manage money funds did not express complaints. "Performance is so critical that sponsors don't care who is running the money, as long as they are doing a good job," Ms. Burk said.
 
What's Insured And What's Not
 Too many people are confusing mutual funds with bank certificates of deposit and other insured products, causing concern at the National Association of Securities Dealers.
The N.A.S.D., a self-regulating group of the securities industry, has proposed rules intended for banks and others that sell a variety of investments, some insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and some uninsured.
Among other things, the proposal stipulates that banks should sell mutual funds in an area separate from where they take deposits. Even then, it says, customers should be told that the funds are not insured and are not deposits of the bank, meaning that customers could lose their money.
In addition, bank tellers or others without N.A.S.D. clearance could not be offered cash or any other incentive for customer referrals that result in fund sales.
 
Giving Israel A Chance
 The Growth Fund of Israel, from the New England Funds in conjunction with Bn'ai B'rith and the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company, will invest in equities issued by companies based in Israel or that derive a large part of their revenues there.
The fund will be managed by David Herro and Adam Schor, both of Harris Associates, a Chicago unit of New England Mutual. Mr. Herro manages Oakmark International, and Mr. Schor has served as an analyst at that fund since 1992. Batucha Securities, a Tel Aviv money manager, serves as economic subadviser. The initial subscription period is scheduled to start Jan 15.
Since being acquired by New England Mutual, Harris has been busy. It is adding three funds to its Oakmark group, bringing the total to five. The new trio are Oakmark Balanced, which will own a mix of stocks and bonds; Oakmark Small Cap, which will own securities in companies with market capitalizations of less than $1 billion, and International Emerging Value, which looks for companies in the emerging markets or small-cap firms in any foreign country.
 
New Funds
 PBHG Technology and Communications will own shares of companies involved with computer software or hardware, network and cable broadcasting, military and aerospace, biotechnology and similar fields. It will be run by John Force and James Smith, both of whom recently joined the fund's sponsor, Pilgrim Baxter & Associates. Mr. Force was a vice president and portfolio manager at Fiduciary Management Associates. Mr. Smith was a senior vice president at Selected Financial Services. Both previously managed small-cap stock funds.
Kemper Value and Growth aims for growth of capital through a mix of growth stocks (issued by companies whose earnings are expected to grow rapidly) and value stocks (priced low relative to their predicted earnings). The growth portion of the portfolio is managed by Kemper and the value portion by Dreman Value Advisors, a recent acquisition of Kemper. Its sales charge equals 5.75 percent.
Phoenix Strategic Theme looks for stocks that the managers believe capitalize on social, economic and political trends, and Phoenix Small Cap invests in companies with a market capitalization of less than $500 million. The sales charge is 4.75 percent.
 
Manager Changes
 Jacques P. Perold, most recently vice president of structured trading for Fidelity Investments, was named manager of its Deutsche mark, Sterling and Yen Performance funds, succeeding Scott B. Kuldell, who keeps the reins of Fidelity Short-Term World Income.
Eric Ende, a senior analyst with First Pacific Advisers, has taken the reins of FPA Perennial from Chris Linden, who needed to reduce his role for health reasons.
P. Nicholas Edwards, formerly of Jardine Fleming Investment Advisers, Tokyo, has joined the management team of Warburg Pincus International Equity.
Robert J. Milnamow has taken over a top-performing fund from the Oppenheimer Management Corporation. Mr. Milnamow is managing the Main Street Income & Growth fund, recently vacated by John Wallace. Mr. Milnamow was formerly the manager of another growth-and-income fund, Phoenix Total Return.
 
Merger
 The Oppenheimer Management Corporation signed an agreement to acquire the Rochester Funds, subject to approval by Rochester shareholders. The funds to be acquired are Rochester Fund Municipals, Limited Term New York Municipal and the Bond Fund for Growth.

HEADLINE: The Plain Truth About Wellesley

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was pleased to be highlighted in your article "How to Succeed? Go to Wellesley" (Oct. 29). Please note, however, that I am not above the glass ceiling, just scrunched more tightly underneath it. Were I a man, I would be the chief economist for all of CS First Boston, not just for the equities department. Wall Street is still diversity unfriendly at the top. 
 More generally, you missed the common denominator for why Wellesley graduates succeed in business -- ordinary, boring diligence. I majored in chemistry, not economics, never formed any network from college or among fellow alums whom I met after college -- nor did other women I knew. The dominant characteristic I have observed in Wellesley graduates is that we all work like crazy. The school obviously selects on this basis, perpetuating its record.
If this hypothesis is correct, it should serve as advice to others. A fancy education, a sharp mind, associating with like-minded acquaintances will help in business success. But nothing is more valuable than hard work.

HEADLINE: Euro-Slash;
Deficit-Cutting's International

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
THE proclamations of Europe's political leaders these days could make House Republicans in Washington sound almost profligate.
"The priority of priorities is to cut deficits," said President Jacques Chirac of France, adding that the country would have to live with high unemployment and a leaner social welfare system while it got its finances under control. 
 "The Government has sought to achieve a careful but firm balance between financial discipline and the social sustainability of budget deficit reduction," said Prime Minister Lamberto Dini of Italy, "but there is no intention to relent in the effort to cut the budget deficit further."
Even Sweden's left-leaning Prime Minister, Ingvar Carlsson, who helped build one of the world's most lavish social welfare systems, has gotten that deficit-cutting religion. "We don't want to dismantle our system, but we can't spend where we don't have the income," he said.
The rise of deficit reduction to the top of the national agenda has reshaped American politics, and the current political brinksmanship between the White House and Congress over how to achieve it now threatens to shut down the Government. But the scale of United States' problem is modest compared to the deficits being run this year by many other industrialized nations, particularly those in Western Europe.
So of necessity Europe has caught budget-cutting fever too, but with a difference: It has no Newt Gingrich. Instead of political ideology, the primary engine of change in Europe is the global financial market -- which of course also motivates the Americans, since high deficits anywhere bring high interest rates and divert investment from its most productive uses. But because European economies are much more dependent on exports -- and because of the European Union's efforts to forge a single currency -- European governments of all ideological stripes are held hostage even more tightly than Washington by bond and currency traders, who daily pass ruthless judgment about economic and political performance by sending interest and exchange rates up and down.
And as the European governments come under increasing pressure from the markets to reduce their budget shortfalls, they are sending shock waves through their political, economic and social firmaments.
Although a conservative, Mr. Chirac, for example, was elected on a platform of creating jobs and reducing France's stubbornly high unemployment rate. But late last month he did a complete about-face, saying deficit cutting had to come first. Last week Mr. Chirac shook up his floundering Cabinet under Prime Minister Alain Juppe in an attempt to strengthen and streamline his government before it announces painful tax increases and spending cuts on Tuesday.
Across Europe, deficit reduction is clouding the prospects for economic growth and reducing high unemployment rates. It has put on the chopping block Europe's generous systems of health care, pensions, unemployment benefits and other social welfare. It has forced left-wing parties to adopt centrist economic policies. And it has imperiled the European Union's cherished goal of knitting its members inextricably together through the planned single currency.
"It's a fundamental issue," said Stanley Crossick, head of the Belmont European Policy Center, a research group in Brussels. "It puts into play the fundamental conflict western society faces today, which is how to achieve the balance between economic and social necessity."
As in the United States, most citizens seem to recognize the need for deficit reduction and to support it -- at least to the point that it begins biting into their most cherished benefits. And the cuts are starting to bite.
The British Government is planning to slash funding for road building and for welfare payments to single mothers and people injured on the job. The German Government just proposed cutting unemployment compensation by 5 percent for people out of work more than a year. Sweden cut $17 off the $100 monthly payment it makes to every family for each child regardless of need.
As the cuts hit home, the middle and working classes are taking notice, and popular support for many political leaders is ebbing. French unions are planning a day of protest on Tuesday when the Chirac government lays out its austerity program.
The scale of the problem remains daunting. In the United States, the 1995 deficit amounts to about 1.8 percent of gross domestic product. The comparable figure in Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, is 2.3 percent. In France it is 5.0 percent, in Italy 7.8 percent, in Britain 4.2 percent and in Sweden 9.2 percent.
The accumulated public debt run up by the United States now amounts to 63 percent of the nation's economic output, and that ratio is just slightly less in Germany and France. Italy's debt equals 122 percent of output, and Belgium's 138 percent. Any person applying for a mortgage with that kind of credit record would be laughed out of the bank.
Efforts to make progress in Europe come against a difficult backdrop. Unemployment in many countries is high; in France it is 11.5 percent, compared with 5.6 percent in the United States. Cutting spending and raising taxes only slows growth and inhibits job creation, at least in the short run.
At the same time, the deficit cutting inevitably means reductions in social welfare at a time when unemployment, rising immigration and the breakdown of traditional family patterns is causing growing unrest in some areas. In the suburbs of Paris, scarred by joblessness and drug abuse, hooliganism and other unrest among young people has become almost a nightly affair.
For all the political repercussions already rippling through Europe, left and right broadly agree that there is no need -- yet -- to radically remake the expansive systems of health care, pensions, unemployment insurance and family aid that have defined European social and economic policy since World War II. While reducing the size of government was a central plank of the Contract With America that helped sweep the Republicans into power in Congress a year ago, no European government besides Britain's was elected on a similar platform.
The urgency of Europe's efforts to get its finances under control can be traced largely to the European Union's decision nearly four years ago to seek a single currency. Monetary union was seen as a logical next step in a decades-long effort to bind European countries so closely together that another war would become unthinkable; in particular it was seen as a means for France to attach itself firmly to Germany.
But creating a single currency requires the economies of the participating nations to be stable, healthy and moving more or less in lockstep. So in the Treaty of Maastricht four years ago the European Union set out a series of strict criteria for membership in a currency union. One of the requirements was a budget deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2000.
Then Europe got walloped by a recession that sent unemployment soaring, tax revenues plummeting and budget deficits rapidly upwards. The question ever since has been how to keep alive the hope of monetary union without inflicting further economic and social pain.
Of the big countries, only Germany seems certain of meeting all the criteria, including deficit reduction. If France cannot make it, the idea of a single currency will probably collapse -- and that it something Mr. Chirac clearly does not want to be blamed for.
"European economic and monetary union is not just some idea or other," said Klaus Kinkel, Germany's Foreign Minister, "but the central European political goal of coming years."

HEADLINE: Political Stakes Are High In Mexican State Election

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MORELIA, Mexico, Nov. 8

 BODY:
This is the land of monarchs and peasants, a place of brooding mountains and gentle lakes that is also one of the most traditional places in Mexico and its most radical.
The Pacific coast state of Michoacan is the setting for elections on Sunday that are taking on dimensions as broad as the wave of monarch butterflies that began arriving by the million here last week on their yearly cross-continental migration. 
 On the ballot are candidates for governor, the state assembly and 113 mayors. At stake, in the eyes of many, is the future of the Mexican political system.
The three major parties have a lot riding on the outcome.
For the battered and chaotic leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, the P.R.D., the elections probably represent its only chance in this generation to win control of one of Mexico's 31 states. A loss here in the birthplace of the party, after last year's third-place finish in the presidential election, could mean the end of the party as it now is organized.
For the right-leaning National Action Party, or PAN, Michoacan is an important prelude. A victory or a strong showing here in the mostly Indian, mostly poor, often violent southern half of Mexico would give the party true national standing.
Of four state elections held so far in 1995, the PAN has won three, all in the north. A victory here would put the party in an advantageous position for the important 1997 midterm elections and then the presidential race in the year 2000.
Then there is the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, which has ruled Michoacan, and Mexico, for 66 years. A loss by the PRI would cap a devastating year in which severe economic suffering, compounded by corruption and violence in the party, turned Mexican voters away from it in droves.
An PRI victory, seen in independent polls by the University of Guadalajara and the independent Mexico City newspaper Reforma as increasingly likely, would breathe new life into the party and its leadership.
In 1992, the PRI's candidate for Governor officially won but P.R.D. protests prevented him from physically taking office for three weeks. Carlos Salinas de Gortari, then President, eventually appointed an interim PRI Governor.
The biggest surprise of the campaign has come from the conservative party, which instead of putting up a figurehead candidate for governor brought in a former congressman, Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, 33.
Some analysts have said Mr. Calderon is just a spoiler who will siphon enough votes away from the P.R.D. candidate, Cristobal Arias Solis, a 41-year-old senator, to allow the PRI to win with Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi. But Mr. Calderon said that "we are in it to win."
Most polls show Mr. Tinoco, 49 and also a senator, ahead with a small lead.
The people of Michoacan say they are ready for a change, but many, like Raul Sanchez Cabezas, 35, who has lived here all his life, retain a grudging admiration for the PRI's ability to stage as grand a show as Mr. Tinoco's rally here on Tuesday.
"Even after all that's happened, with crime, with the economy, with dirty politics, so many people still come out for the PRI," he said.
Nearby, workers swept up the thousands of campaign placards and empty water bottles that were left behind after Mr. Tinoco's rally ended and the peasants returned home. Just then, a few monarch butterflies crisscrossed overhead.

HEADLINE: Farm Issues Are Taking Center Stage

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
On Thursday, as the Federal Government teetered at the edge of shutting down and defaulting on its debts, several powerful Republicans spent nearly two hours bickering about the price of milk.
The chairmen of the House Rules Committee, Appropriations Committee, Agriculture Committee and the House Republican Conference met with a dozen other Republicans in the office of Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon of New York, the chairman of the Rules Committee. They set a simple rule: anyone who yelled loudly enough or pounded the table hard enough to cause the room's giant chandelier to tremble would be ejected. 
 While nobody was ejected, "it started out calm, cool and collected -- by the time it was over, I think everyone's temperature had elevated 20 degrees," said Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, a New York Republican who participated in the meeting.
Farm issues have been eclipsed in the public budget debates by Medicare, Medicaid and welfare, but by today the Republicans from the Senate and the House had finished most of the work on compromises for welfare and Medicaid. But there was no word of progress on the farm bill. With roughly one-third of the Republicans in the House and Senate representing heavily rural areas, farm issues are tying up the negotiations as some Republicans show a marked willingness to vote against legislation if it will hurt their farmers.
Two of the 10 Republicans who voted against the budget on the House floor were from upstate New York and objected to the dairy provisions -- Mr. Boehlert and Representative John M. McHugh. They and other New York Republicans threatened late this week to sink the budget bill if changes in the milk provisions were not made. With Democrats nearly united against the spending cuts, the Republican leadership cannot afford to alienate more members over farm policy.
Peanuts, sugar and dairy products like milk, butter and cheese have emerged as the sticking points in a budget conference between House and Senate agriculture committee leaders that was supposed to end on Friday. Now they are just hoping they can finish on Monday.
House Republicans are divided among themselves, to say nothing of their differences with Senate Republicans. This autumn the House Agriculture Committee never succeeded in agreeing on any budget legislation, and the budget bill passed by the full House included agriculture provisions that the committee had defeated by a vote of 27 to 22.
Now those divisions are reappearing. Lawmakers from peanut-producing states are quarreling with urban lawmakers who complain that the Federal program has made peanut butter prices too high. Members of Congress from sugar-producing states are trying to defend price supports and fend off efforts to protect the Florida Everglades from the pesticide and fertilizer runoff from giant sugar farms.
No farm program took deeper cuts in the Senate than the dairy program. The House budget bill also cuts dairy subsidies, but goes even further in eliminating the current system of fixing milk prices at high levels to keep each state's milk farmers in business.
The system keeps prices highest in the Northeast and Southeast, where dairy farmers have particularly high costs. Lawmakers from these regions waged a vigorous campaign last week to force House leaders to yield on this issue to the Senate, which would continue limiting regional competition in milk prices.
Mr. Solomon began threatening late this week to lead a group of upstate Republicans in voting against the final budget unless milk farmers were allowed to keep their current system for holding up milk prices. "Never in my life have I ever joined a rump group," he said on Friday night. "For the first time in my life I have done that, because it's a matter of life or death."
Dairy districts tend to be politically placid places that re-elect their representatives year after year, allowing them to gain considerable seniority and turning dairy policy disputes into high-level battles.
For all the acrimony, the meeting on Thursday settled nothing. Representative Pat Roberts of Kansas, the Agriculture Committee chairman and an advocate of sweeping farm-policy deregulation, declared at the end that Speaker Newt Gingrich would have to arbitrate the dispute.
The betting on Capitol Hill now is that the northeastern dairy farmers will eventually get what they want. Whenever a group of senior congressmen feel strongly about blocking legislation that affects their constituents, there is usually little to be done by colleagues who are arguing in the name of public policy theories and economic efficiency.

HEADLINE: Casino Issues Spotlight Rift In the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Trapped in the poor southeastern corner of Fairfield County, the people of Bridgeport are pinning their hopes for economic salvation on an unlikely ally. The predominantly Democratic city is counting on the new Republican Governor, John G. Rowland, to win approval for a law to bring what could be the world's most profitable casino to Bridgeport.
To the west, the county's wealthy bedrock Republican towns are not at all pleased with the man they helped elect. Many prominent Republicans are fighting the casino proposal that Mr. Rowland, the state's first Republican Governor in 20 years, has said is vital to Connecticut's prosperity. 
 "This would be an economic Chernobyl," State Senator William H. Nickerson, a Greenwich Republican, said at a recent news conference. He said the $875 million casino proposed by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians would create traffic and other problems that would hurt the region's economy.
The rift over gambling comes as casinos have emerged as a divisive issue nationally for the party. In Connecticut, it pits the urban Republicanism of Mr. Rowland, who rose to power by appealing to conservative Democrats in the blue-collar city of Waterbury, against the affluent suburbanites who have been the Republican Party's backbone.
At stake for Mr. Rowland is the success of his plans for welfare reform and urban renewal: his plan to force more than 40,000 people off public assistance. To undertake that program, which features a 29-month time limit on welfare, the country's strictest, Mr. Rowland needs jobs.
"You have to do more than just kick people off welfare," Paul Green, Mr. Rowland's spokesman, said. "Voting against the casino will very much undercut what we are trying to do in these other efforts. It will send a message, 'Drop dead, Bridgeport,' and we don't want that."
Mr. Nickerson and other anti-casino Republicans say they are following their conscience on gambling, as they would on issues like abortion or gun control.
But there are hints that the split may represent deeper differences about the state party's direction. While Mr. Rowland has strongly endorsed Senator Bob Dole's bid for the Presidency, Mr. Nickerson and two other top State Senate Republicans who oppose the casino had said they wanted to see if Gen. Colin L. Powell was going to run.
In Washington, Senator Richard G. Lugar, another Presidential candidate, has used the rapid growth of the casino industry as an issue to attack Mr. Dole, who has received more than $500,000 in contributions from gaming interests. While Mr. Lugar has called on the Christian Coalition to oppose casinos' expansion on moral grounds, Mr. Dole has defended gaming as a legitimate industry.
There may be few places where anti-casino sentiment is stronger than lower Fairfield County, a Republican stronghold, once home to George Bush and still the home of William F. Buckley Jr. and the corporate headquarters for a host of Fortune 500 companies. In a survey of his district conducted by Mr. Nickerson, 72 percent were opposed to the Bridgeport proposal, in contrast to a statewide poll that showed a slight majority favoring it.
Some of the anti-casino feelings are based on principle. "It's immoral," said Charles P. Stetson, a Republican from Fairfield and chairman of the Family Institute of Connecticut, a group affiliated with the national evangelical group Focus on the Family. "I thought the Republican Party was the party of responsibility, but I'm beginning to wonder."
But perhaps more important to the anti-casino movement are the fears about its impact on quality of life.
"It would turn I-95 into a parking lot," said Chris Bruhl, chief executive of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, a Fairfield business group. Already the highway is operating at 165 percent of intended capacity, traffic is routinely slowed to a crawl during rush hours and the 19-mile trip from Fairfield to Stamford can take more than an hour.
The thousands of new visitors to a casino would create insurmountable gridlock, Mr. Bruhl said, quelling the economic growth in the county, particularly in Stamford.
He added: "They're feeling desperate in Bridgeport now, and desperate people are willing to take gambles. But please don't underestimate how desperate we feel about traffic. Don't underestimate the desperation of people prepared to fight for what they have."
Tom Ragland, First Selectman-elect of Greenwich, said recently that people in his town were not open to changing their commuting habits: "You've got a Bimmer in one driveway and a Mercedes in another, you're not going to grab a bus. You've earned a place in this world and carved out a life style."
The opposition goes beyond such concerns. Mr. Nickerson has argued that casinos take money from other industries, cause a net loss in jobs and are bad public policy. While casino supporters tout the 10,000 jobs the Pequots created with their Foxwoods Resort Casino in eastern Connecticut, Mr. Nickerson has pointed to poverty and crime in Atlantic City as proof that casinos do not help urban development.
"This is the wrong medicine for a sick patient," he said.
Casino supporters, including some Republicans, dismiss those arguments as cover for wealthy suburbanites who don't care about Bridgeport and don't want a casino in their back yard.
"We don't buy the traffic argument," Mr. Green, the Governor's aide, said. "It's a convenient push-button issue." The State Transportation Commissioner, J. Williams Burns, a Democrat appointed by Mr. Rowland, said the problems, while serious, could be overcome.
Jack E. McGregor, a prominent Republican who was co-chairman of Mr. Rowland's transition team and heads a Bridgeport water company, said he was "totally outraged" by his neighbors' opposition. "This is a quintessential Greenwich-Stamford example of their total lack of resolve to address Bridgeport's problems," he said.
When the General Assembly approved tax incentives last year to lure the North American headquarters of Swiss Bank to Stamford, no one in Bridgeport objected, he said, and traffic from the 2,000 new jobs was never mentioned. "We have not done anything but be totally cooperative in the economic rebirth of Stamford," he said. "It's about time that those roadways became two-way roadways."
In a sign that Mr. Rowland's argument may be influencing some party members, State Senator Judy Freedman, a Westport Republican who was believed to be leaning against the casino, sounded almost positive about it after meeting with Mr. Rowland.
Noting that in a referendum in Bridgeport, 82 percent endorsed a casino, Ms. Freedman said: "We all believe in local control. That's Republicanism. If Greenwich voted for something, would Bill Nickerson want the state to come in and criticize it?"
While opponents contend that Bridgeport has exaggerated its problems -- they note that crime has been dropping -- Mr. Rowland has said that only casino operators are prepared to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the state's most distressed city. Since 1989, one-fifth of Bridgeport's jobs have disappeared, and last year it was ranked seventh among American cities in percentage of population lost.
With the Legislature in special session to consider the casino issue, Mr. Rowland has appeared to pick up momentum in a debate that had appeared unwinnable.
The Pequots have agreed to increase the money they would pay the state, estimating that their payments to the state from Foxwoods and the Bridgeport casino would total $3.4 billion over the next 10 years.
But Mr. Rowland remains short of the votes he needs and has taken a political risk by pushing the issue so vigorously.
It is a Connecticut truism that elections are lost in Fairfield County, and Republicans there have abandoned their party before. In 1954, Fairfield Republicans cost Gov. John Lodge his re-election, partly out of anger over his building of I-95 through their towns. In 1988, they voted against Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Greenwich and helped a Democrat, Joseph I. Lieberman, stage an upset.
Yet Mr. Rowland may also pick up votes in Bridgeport, where he did remarkably well for a Republican in the last election, losing the city to his Democratic opponent by 1,642 votes.
The proposal may signal a new type of Republicanism in the state. "The Governor's approach distinguishes him not only from Democrats, who would make poverty worse by continuing dependency on welfare, but also from some Republicans," Mr. Green said. "They talk about cutting programs and tax breaks, but they don't show enough sympathy for the poor. They're not creating opportunities in our cities."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 15, 1995

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, an article on Sunday about a casino proposed for Bridgeport, Conn., omitted a reference in some copies to a casino proponent who said other Fairfield County communities have not supported Bridgeport. He is Jack E. McGregor, president of the Aquarion Company. The article also omitted a comment by State Transportation Commissioner William Burns. He said traffic problems relating to the casino could be overcome.
In addition, the article misstated the duration limit for welfare payments under a new Connecticut law. It is 21 months, not 29.

HEADLINE: The Homeless Huddle at City's Margins

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
Monica Links gave up on trying to live in Central Park. After one run-in too many with the police, she moved two months ago to her current crate, set near festering garbage and rotting rags on an abandoned Hudson River pier. So far, no one bothers her there.
Kelly and Joe Mullen used to inhabit the entryway of a private building at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue. Now, chased from there, they live in a kind of cave, fabricated largely from cast-off comforters, on another crumbling pier -- taking refuge, like Ms. Links, at the very edge of Manhattan. 
 "Pretty soon we're going to be living in rowboats in the river," Mr. Mullen said.
In a campaign that began under the Dinkins administration and intensified under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the most visible clusters of homeless people in the most trafficked parts of the city have been cleared away.
It would appear at first glance that New York has made notable progress toward solving its homelessness problem. But homeless people and their advocates say that much of that apparent progress is illusion, and city officials acknowledge that there is no evidence of a radical decline in the number of homeless people on the streets.
Rather, the geography of Manhattan's homeless population has changed.
The shanties are gone from Columbus Circle and Tompkins Square, and the tattered people with cardboard mats no longer bed down on Grand Central's marble floors or in boutique doorways along Madison Avenue. The southern half of Central Park is relatively free of nighttime inhabitants.
But many have simply been pushed out to the periphery of the island, settling on piers, in nooks along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and in crannies beneath the bridges, fashioning new homes far enough out of the way to be left alone by the police.
Some have learned to hide better, moving deeper into parks or underground into disused tunnels; others find doorways in Harlem or far downtown, where the police do not move them along. Many now wander as loners or in pairs, giving up the larger groups that afford more safety but also invite more attention.
"They're pushing people to the margins of the island," said Mary Brosnahan, director of the Coalition for the Homeless.
In the view of the homeless and their advocates, the city is playing a kind of three-card monte game with the issue of homelessness, by spurring vagrants to move more often and find better hiding places.
"The Mayor's definition of quality of life is to get us out of sight," said William Andrew Card, 57 and homeless for six years, as he waited for a free dinner at St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue. "His idea of quality of life is that Dagwood and Blondie don't have to look at it."
But city officials see the shift in homeless populations differently. Some homeless people do simply hide, said Joan Malin, the Commissioner of Homeless Services, but others have been reached by the intensified efforts of roving teams of social workers.
"The message is out that it's wrong to be on the streets," she said. "Not, 'We're moving you away,' but 'Come on in,' " into the shelter system or other housing and into substance abuse programs.
"If someone is ready to come in, there are four or five ways to get into the system that didn't exist five years ago," she said. "There are also people who flat out don't want to participate in services, do not want to be part of the system, are actively drug-abusing and have opted not to be part of this, and moved off into the parks or further away from sight."
Neither advocates for the homeless nor city officials can conclusively map out the new whereabouts of elusive vagrants, or even estimate how many there are. But they can piece together some of the new geography.
Riding the two Coalition for the Homeless vans that provide soup and sandwiches to several hundred people each night, Michael Polenberg, director of the group's food program, has noticed a definite shift. The lines in midtown have shrunk precipitously, and those near Housing Court in lower Manhattan and up in Harlem have grown, he said.
Numbers have swelled under the F.D.R. Drive near the South Street Seaport. Under the Manhattan Bridge, tiny cottages that look like glorified doghouses are at full occupancy, even boasting an ironic sign: "Homeless Hills, Phase I -- Sold Out."
Frequent police sweeps bring a mix of shame and anger to many homeless people, even as they accept that they have no right to live on property they do not own.
"They just don't leave us alone," said Leo Thomas, 63, as he prepared recently to bunk down in the doorway of a church on First Avenue until 7 a.m., when he and his cardboard covering must be gone. "I used to sleep on 47th and Second -- got chased out of there. Then on 42d Street by the river park, used to sleep there, but now they hassle you. And down on 36th Street -- I used to sleep there, but now they have barricades there."
Neither the street people nor those who try to help them object to the basic idea of getting vagrants off midtown sidewalks and out of train stations and parks.
"They should get the homeless off the streets," said Kelly Mullen, who has been homeless for nearly three years.
"But," she added, "are they taking them off just to make a pretty city or to have compassion and understanding for people in crippling situations?"
Social workers worry that when street people are rousted repeatedly, they become far more difficult to reach with aid.
"It's become more difficult to engage people because they're more frightened," said Barbara Rinehart of the Goddard Riverside Neighborhood Center, a settlement house on Columbus Avenue.
Terry Troia, executive director of Project Hospitality of Staten Island, said her teams have noticed that "it's a lot harder to draw people out" so they can receive food, counseling or health care.
"So while it's not in the public eye," she said, "the problem's not solved -- but it's a lot harder to do the outreach."
Groups helping the homeless acknowledge that city shelter services and programs to help drug and alcohol abusers have expanded; the problem, they say, is that once the programs end, there is still little housing to move into, and people end up back on the streets. The city offered 1,997 rehabilitated apartments to the homeless in the 1995 fiscal year, against 2,563 in 1994, city management reports show.
And though Ms. Malin said the shelter system has become more hospitable, many homeless people still shun the shelters as dangerous centers of drug abuse, violence and thievery, preferring the streets even as winter approaches.
"I was in a shelter for three days and all my stuff was stolen," said Ms. Links, a 21-year-old Bronx native who has been homeless for more than six months and recently lost a job as a pizza waitress.
So the remaining homeless continue to scatter to undisturbed spots. Even when they are out of sight, however, the nests many homeless people fashion for themselves are often not secure.
The two dozen inhabitants of the Hudson River piers where Ms. Links and the Mullens live, just off West Street, have been told by Sanitation Department workers that they will probably have to leave in a month or so.
"It's hard because Giuliani is making it very hard," Kelly Mullen said. "I hope he'll let us ride out the winter here; I pray every day."
It is not exactly heaven, despite its river views, but the pier does offer some amenities, such as they are: Kelly Mullen sometimes bathes in the salty river, she said; a few yards away, walls of milk crates provide a modicum of privacy around a makeshift toilet sitting over a hole in the pier's concrete. A Department of Sanitation plant next door lets them have drinking water. On what they call the "gay pier," some of the dozen inhabitants -- who include Sylvia Rivera of Stonewall fame -- say they go out "canning" for returnable bottles together, and otherwise help each other out.
Ms. Links, over on what might be considered the young people's pier, contemplated the prospect of a forced move with regret. Her shed is decorated with hand-drawn hearts and a declaration of "friends forever" with Roger, a 21-year-old gay man from Union City, her neighbor.
There is no going back to Central Park.
"They told me next time they'd catch me they'd incarcerate me," she said, "and I just don't like the bullpens."
On a recent evening, she had just finished one of her many writings, this one a paragraph titled "Reality." It said:
"When the night falls it finds me all alone, and makes me wonder if I'll ever have a home. I set out into this crazy world thinking it was so easy. But instead I've been made into a destroyer. My world empty and cold with only a small gleaming light at the bottom called Reality."
Near the Port Authority bus terminal, Larry Jackson, an unemployed and homeless former messenger, said it seemed to him that "it's a job in itself to move your belongings from one place to another."
But homeless people develop a certain savvy, he said, learning what areas are heavily policed only at certain times. They flood to the Port Authority on the weekends, he said; otherwise, they are tending to move to places like 125th Street and Lenox in Harlem, where they are rarely disturbed. Most do not leave Manhattan, preferring to stay as close as they can to familiar territory and known sources of help.
In the more desirable shantytowns, like the one under the Manhattan Bridge, the residents are so aware of their real estate's appeal that they say they band together to keep out would-be interlopers. "You got to know who you're letting in," said Pedro Maldonado, who lives in one of the closet-sized cottages there. "There's a lot of dog eat dog here, too -- we're not angels."
The Homeless Hills settlement, with its sheltered location under the bridge and an accessible supermarket bathroom nearby, is considered one of the best, its residents said, despite the danger of a drunken fall into the water and the annoyance of passing buses of gawking, photo-snapping tourists.
But there is also the advantage of being highly visible -- attracting enough contributions that one resident joked, "We gain 15 pounds at Christmastime."
Neither the shack-dwellers of Homeless Hills nor those of the Hudson pier plan to use the shelters if they are kicked out.
Kelly and Joe Mullen supposed that when they had to leave, they would move to some park, though that would mean giving up most of their scavenged possessions. It was a dreary prospect, another move.
"You get worn down," Kelly Mullen said. "It's a message sent to you: you're no good, you're not acceptable, you're perverted, you're disgusting. So you go with your tail between your legs, and want to give up."

HEADLINE: Trouble at the Guggenheim Foundation

 BODY:
For 70 years the Guggenheim Foundation has been a renowned Midas of the creative world, handing out grants to 13,500 artists, scientists and scholars, from Aaron Copland to Linus Pauling to James Baldwin, as well as 40 Nobel laureates. These days, however, the Guggenheim Foundation has fallen on, if not yet hard times (its endowment is $150 million), then surely very pinched times.
For years the foundation spent too generously, way exceeding the legal requirement that a foundation spend at least 5 percent of its assets annually. At the same time it invested too conservatively, putting all its assets in the hands of one bank money manager instead of trying for more diversification and a more aggressive investment strategy. Some years the investment earnings did not even cover the grants awarded, which the foundation kept adjusting for inflation and which it maintained at 300 a year. 
 Obviously, the foundation could not continue on its spendthrift path, which is why it is now embarked on cost-cutting and more strategic investment. It is attempting to raise $10 million to $20 million for its endowment and, sadly, handing out about half the previous number of fellowships. It is the loss of fellowships that especially galls Joel Conarroe, the foundation's president. "We're all aware of how many brilliant people we have to turn away every year," he said. "We feel a particular urgency not only to give more awards but larger ones."
The need is urgent indeed because even in the best of times America's artists and thinkers do not have many places to turn to for help in writing a book, mounting a dance, or working out a theory. But with the Federal Government beginning to relinquish its role as a supporter and enthusiast for this nation's arts and humanities, these are among the worst of times. The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities have endured both deep cuts and the calumnies of those who feel threatened by the talented, the imaginative and the occasionally unsettling.
Fortunately for those whose hopes for their work are pinned on getting a Guggenheim, the foundation is slowly amassing contributions from what it calls its "friends and family," among them 1,776 Guggenheim fellows. Unfortunately for many of those "brilliant people" of whom Mr. Conarroe speaks, the N.E.A. and the N.E.H. have few such friends in Congress.

High-Turnover General Managers

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Even the people in the room may not be able to tell the general managers without a scorecard at the general managers' meetings in Scottsdale, Ariz., this week.
The position has become so volatile that two clubs, barring last-minute decisions, won't even have general managers in the room because they haven't filled their vacancies. Four general managers have been named to their jobs in the last month. Two of them will attend for the first time as general managers; the other two have participated before but for different teams. 
 The lineup is even more jumbled than it was a year ago, when four new general managers went to the meetings having been hired in the previous month. A fifth had been hired two months earlier.
"General managers are the ones whom owners have put in charge of their purse strings," John Schuerholz of the Atlanta Braves said. "That's why they're flying in and out of office like managers used to."
Schuerholz, with 14 years in the position, has become the dean of general managers. "How about that? Isn't that amazing?" he said, finding it hard to believe himself.
But Schuerholz has divided his time between the Braves and the Kansas City Royals, leaving Sandy Alderson, the Oakland Athletics' general manager for 12 years, as the senior man in terms of continuous service.
At the other end of the service scale, 13 of the 28 clubs have changed general managers in the last two years. Four changes have occurred in the last month, and two jobs still have to be filled. Bill Bavasi, who became the California Angels' general manager less than two years ago, on Jan. 12, 1994, ranks 16th on the seniority list in terms of continuous service.
Alderson, Fred Claire of Los Angeles, Woody Woodward of Seattle and Lee Thomas of Philadelphia are the only general managers who were hired by their current employer before 1990.
"As a result of the dramatically increased financial obligations that owners have, they have in turn placed far more importance, and therefore greater pressure, on winning and delivering a winning product," Schuerholz said, discussing the turnover. "That pressure falls squarely in the lap of general managers."
Alderson, whose team is undergoing a change in ownership, attributed the turnover in general managers to the turnover in owners in the last 10 years.
"Many owners have gotten themselves more involved in baseball decision-making," Alderson said. "As a consequence, the general manager has become a more specialized individual. He's probably less a generalist and more a specialized baseball-experienced individual. Often the tenure of someone of that type is a function of team performance."
As impatient owners change general managers, they often have sought younger men whose outlook might be different from the veteran general managers who used to hold their jobs for years. Of the changes made in the last two years, eight new general managers came from jobs as assistant general manager or player development director.
At age 34, Jim Bowden of Cincinnati is one of the youngest general managers in the league. In his three years working for Marge Schott, he has done a remarkable job under difficult circumstances.
"The game has become very business-oriented," he said. "Every time you do a deal or sign a player, the first issue now is financial. It's not player talent. The game is ever changing. What ownership looks for in a general manager is changing. Twenty-five years ago the emphasis was on trading and player evaluation. Now the scope has to be widened."
Despite his youth, Bowden said he believes in the older general manager.
"The key is experience," he said. "People like myself have the disadvantage of not having been around 25, 30 years. That doesn't mean I would give back my job because I like my job. But I've surrounded myself with older, more experienced people."
Schuerholz agreed that there is a "very different breed" of general manager.
"The owners are going away from the old standard mold of the veteran, deeply schooled, well-experienced, well-grounded baseball guy to someone who has more modern-day appeal," he said. "Whether that's intellectual appeal, communicative skills or whatever that may be, you see a larger number of younger and less experienced guys being thrust into a position that demands, from time to time, reliance on experience and long-standing knowledge and instincts that are developed over time. Sometimes the young guys who are put in these jobs can't develop those skills to satisfy the owners."
Two of the recent changes were forced by resignations, an unusual development in a field that totals only 28 jobs. Randy Smith left the San Diego Padres because he was not comfortable working under Larry Lucchino, the club's new chief executive officer, and Kevin Malone gave up the Montreal Expos' job, saying he wanted to build a team, not tear it down in the Expos' method of economic operation.
Smith is Detroit's new general manager, but Malone remains unemployed. He is one of three finalists for the Baltimore vacancy, the others being Joe Klein, whom Smith replaced, and John Barr, the Mets' scouting director.
 
Vaughn Is Truly Valuable
 When the American League's most valuable player is announced Thursday, if his name is not Albert Belle, instant critics should remember the award is not for the player of the year.
Belle, who led the league in home runs, total bases and slugging percentage and tied for the lead in runs batted in, runs scored and doubles, clearly was the best player in the league. But was he more valuable than or as valuable as Mo Vaughn?
Belle had much more help in leading Cleveland to the A.L. Central championship than Vaughn had in getting Boston to the East Division championship. That does not detract from what Belle did, but any time a team has as many fine hitters as the Indians had, the value of each is diminished by the sum of the parts.
One example to illustrate: Belle and Manny Ramirez each hit his 28th home run Aug. 20, helping the Indians increase their lead to 19 games. At the time, Ramirez was outhitting Belle, .328 to .323, and had driven in more runs, 91 to 85. Ramirez proceeded to skid into a lengthy slump while Belle continued bashing the baseball, but when the Indians were breaking open the division race, Ramirez was at least equally as valuable as Belle.
If some baseball writers who otherwise might have voted for Belle did not because of his menacing behavior, they might be less than objective, but they also would be human.
 
Mattingly or McGriff?
 Thirteen years after they traded him away to a career that would glitter in three other major league cities, the Yankees would like Fred McGriff back. There's one problem, though. George Steinbrenner also wants Don Mattingly back.
"He knows he can't do both," Jim Krivacs, the agent for both first basemen, said. "He's thinking Donnie's going to play. If that doesn't happen, that changes things."
Mattingly plans to decide in the next few weeks if he wants to continue playing. If the answer is yes, he will play for the Yankees, even though he could go elsewhere as a free agent.
McGriff, who has played for the Braves the last two and a half seasons, also is a free agent.
"Oh yeah, we want to sign him," John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager, said. "We've let it be known to him and his agent we want to sign him. But there's a question because there's an economic marketplace at play out there."
Krivacs said McGriff, 32, likes Atlanta but added, "We have some decisions to make. The big thing we're trying to get a handle on is where the market is now."
The Yankees drafted McGriff out of high school in 1981. After he led the Gulf Coast rookie league in runs batted in and home runs in 1982, they traded him to Toronto with Dave Collins and Mike Morgan for Tom Dodd and Dale Murray. It remains one of the most memorable trades in the Steinbrenner era.

HEADLINE: Islands Lapped by Tides of Change

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
NOLAN PARK is so quiet you can hear a squirrel's footfall in the golden leaves. Now that late autumn has come, sunlight pierces the heavy canopy of sycamore, oak and maple. It warms the eggnog-yellow clapboard houses around the park, with their gabled rooftops and curlicue woodwork. It dapples the red-brick sidewalks and deep front porches, festooned with American flags. It glints off the World Trade Center nearby.
Nolan Park is not just an uncommonly pretty neighborhood. It is less than 10 minutes from lower Manhattan. 
 Small wonder that developers and urbanists began dreaming last month when it was announced that Nolan Park and the rest of Governors Island, which has been off-limits to civilians since it was garrisoned by the Army in 1794, would become available in 1998, after the Coast Guard closes its base there.
It is a rare day indeed when the opportunity arises to incorporate an entire new island into the civic fabric.
But New York is a city of many islands -- only the Bronx is attached to the mainland -- and much else is happening on this insular real estate.
A master plan is to be prepared for Randalls and Wards Islands, where officials envision a much improved sports and recreation center. On Ellis Island, the enormous Baggage and Dormitory Building may be restored. A 600-bed addition to the West Facility at Rikers Island was recently completed. Landlords on City Island are requesting new commercial zoning. The Parks Department has its eye on North Brother Island (the Bronx), South Brother Island (Queens) and the Island of Meadows (Staten Island) as part of a five-island rookery.
And Roosevelt Island played host last month to 85 builders, financiers, designers, planners and officials from around the nation. Their mission, in a daylong workshop, was to recommend development scenarios to the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, which is trying to decide how to resume construction after six becalmed years.
"There is an urgent need to build out the island to a critical mass," said Jean Lerman, president and chief operating officer of the corporation. "The tram could handle more riders. The garage could handle more cars. The stores could clearly use more business. What is buildable that could enhance the island?"
The question of what is buildable is also being asked on City Island, where some landlords want the city to change the M1 manufacturing zoning -- a throwback to the vanished boat-building industry, they say -- to C3 commercial zoning, which permits residential development.
"We feel M1 is archaic and restricts our potential," said Herbert A. Hild, president of Hild Sails, who owns about 2.5 acres on the east side of the island, between Pelham Cemetery and the slip for the Harts Island ferry. Mr. Hild has been in the sailmaking business for 50 years. "It's not that we're going to turn around and build condos," he said. "It's just that we feel we're in an obsolete type of zoning."
Such tensions reflect the changing way in which New Yorkers will be using the islands around them. "Are islands going to be viewed as enclaves?" asked Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. "Are they refuges for the people who live there, or tourist attractions, or recreational and wildlife space, or places where you isolate and dump as many undesirable land uses as you can?"
Roosevelt Island served for most of its existence as a place where the city isolated the poor, the criminal, the insane and the diseased. For 20 years, it has slowly been transformed into a residential quarter. There are now some 8,200 people living in 3,248 units in 18 apartment buildings. In 1989, the operating corporation solicited proposals for a 2,000-unit residential project on a 19-acre parcel called Southtown, between the existing towers and the Queensboro Bridge, which would have added 4,400 residents to the island.
DEVELOPERS didn't bite at the time, but that reluctance may be changing.
"There was a great deal of interest in pursuing Southtown," said Alyce M. Russo, director of planning and development at Roosevelt Island, as she described the workshop. "That exceeded our expectations -- pleasantly." Among its strong points, Southtown has both the tram terminal and a subway station, served by B and Q trains.
One of the most difficult questions will be whether to preserve the existing mix of low- , middle- and upper-income residents or lift the 25 percent ceiling on market-rate housing, thereby permitting proportionally more higher-priced units and making the economics more enticing to developers.
One participant in favor of lifting the cap was Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center, who is a former New York City Housing Commissioner and Deputy Mayor. "It's not realistic from a housing finance standpoint to assume anything but market-rate housing," he said, "which, on Roosevelt Island, is middle class."
Alexander Cooper, of Cooper, Robertson & Partners, who was co-architect of the master plan of Battery Park City, said it would be helpful to waive the current mix and modify the master plan.
Defending the existing master plan and the economic mix was Edward J. Logue, the former president of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, who is regarded as the father of the Roosevelt Island project. He traveled to the workshop from another island, Martha's Vineyard, where he now lives.
Mr. Logue conceded that it was difficult, if not impossible, to build affordable housing at a time when Government subsidies have dried up, but he did not think that was a reason to abandon the vision of economically integrated communities.
"To restore the social health to our cities, we've got to have this mix," Mr. Logue said. Mr. Cooper suggested that co-op owners be permitted to make a profit when reselling their units and that the density on the island be increased to 6,000 or 7,000 units.
Con Howe, Director of Planning for the City of Los Angeles, urged care in apportioning development sites. "If you don't preserve lots of the island as completely open space," he said, "you'd lose one of the fundamental reasons anyone would want to live there."
Mr. Howe was once executive director of the New York City Planning Department. He was disappointed by his return to Main Street, which serves as the spine of Roosevelt Island's residential area. "The architecture hasn't weathered well," he said, "and you don't feel connections either to open space or to the waterfront."
Some teams at the workshop focused on details like the five mini-schools that have been empty since 1992, when a new grammar and intermediate school opened. "We would take them all down," Mr. Leventhal said. "To have prime waterfront space taken up by vacant schools is something we didn't want to sit still for another moment."
P ARTICIPANTS also looked more generally at the governance of the island. Robert Davis, the founder and president of the Seaside Community Development Corporation, which created the new town of Seaside in Florida, said a stronger governing body was needed -- "something like the Battery Park City Authority, with that kind of entrepreneurial initiative and degree of control."
"Ed Logue had that kind of wheeling and dealing power and then some," he added.
For his part, Mr. Logue said, "My solution is that the island ought to have self-rule; make a compact with the State of New York and just let them go."
Whatever happens on Roosevelt Island, it is almost certain to occur long before the redevelopment of Governors Island. "What makes Roosevelt Island different is that it has a subway stop -- that's fundamental," said Alexander Garvin, a member of the City Planning Commission and the author of a book, "The American City: What Works, What Doesn't." He and Bethami Probst coordinated the Oct. 17 workshop.
Roosevelt Island also has a tram and, like City Island and Randalls Island, a bridge to the rest of the city. "You'd have to go a long way to produce the same result on Governors Island," Mr. Garvin said. "We're talking about hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to produce a bridge."
"Also, you're beginning with a vision in the case of Roosevelt and Randalls Islands that you can build on," he said. "You've got a long time before you can come up with anything like that for Governors Island."
That is not to say there haven't been visions. Proposals have ranged from the prosaic -- a residential enclave -- to the fantastic: a Disney theme park, an ecology park and convention center, a movie studio complex or a site for the city's sex businesses and a casino.
City officials have tried to dampen any speculative discussion, however.
"It's very, very premature," said Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, who heads the Governors Island task force for the Giuliani administration and was given a tour by Coast Guard officers last Monday. "We don't even know yet under what circumstances the property is going to be conveyed."
The Coast Guard will begin moving next spring and plans to turn the island over to the General Services Administration. But it is not clear how the Government will then dispose of the island, to whom, under what circumstances and at what price (although an estimate of $500 million was advanced by the Congressional Budget Office).
Mr. Rose said his more immediate concern was the transferring of many Coast Guard operations to New Jersey, Virginia and South Carolina, along with a $70 million annual payroll.
For now, Governors Island is a small town of about 4,000 residents, to which 1,800 commuters travel daily. There are some 800 housing units over its 170 acres. Much of the residential stock is modern and unremarkable. There is an array of two-story town houses on the east side, a cluster of 10 three-story apartment houses on the southern tip and, overlooking the harbor, a trio of seven-story buildings and a T-shaped 10-story structure that is the island's skyscraper.
What gives Governors Island its exceptional character are the historic structures. The frame houses of Nolan Park are for senior officers, as are the sturdy brick homes along Colonels' Row, which got its name before the Army turned the island over to the Coast Guard in 1966, after which the captains moved in.
Quarters 1 is the designation of the Admiral's House, a 155-year-old, 27-room mansion overlooking Buttermilk Channel, with two-story-high Tuscan colonnades front and rear. Quarters 2, home to the base commander, is a more modest brick house nearby. It has been much altered over the years but may have been begun in 1708 as the home of the provincial governor and is known as the Governor's House.
The most unusual housing on the island is undoubtedly the quadrangle within the walls of Fort Jay, a five-pointed, star-shaped fortification that was completed in 1798 and rebuilt in 1803. The apartments are reached by crossing a dry moat. Surrounding the fort is a nine-hole golf course.
F ORT JAY is one of three fortifications on the island. Castle Williams, on the north shore, is a semicircular structure that was completed in 1811 along with Castle Clinton in Manhattan to protect New York from a British invasion. The South Battery of 1812 is the officers' club.
Across the harbor is another island laden with landmarks. Although the reopening of Ellis Island in 1990 attracted worldwide attention, there are many structures beside the Main Building, with its cavernous Registry Hall, that have yet to be restored.
"It's not over yet," said Michael Adlerstein, associate field director of the National Park Service's northeast area.
The largest unrestored structure is the 87-year-old Baggage and Dormitory Building, which adjoins the Main Building and once housed 5,000 immigrants at a time, usually those who had arrived too late of an evening to be processed. Later used by the Navy as a brig, it was abandoned in 1954. The 125,000-square-foot building has only three stories, but each floor is 20 feet high. Because it has a flat roof, it has been subject to considerable weather damage.
"It will be wonderful if we can save it," Mr. Adlerstein said. Discussions are under way, he said, with the private Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, which has raised money for the restoration projects.
Underneath the Triborough Bridge, another foundation has a role in determining the future of another set of islands. The Randalls Island Sports Foundation is a semi-public organization formed in 1992 to help the Parks and Recreation Department maintain, operate and improve the 400-acre Randalls and Wards Islands Parks. (Although now a single land mass at the confluence of the East and Harlem Rivers, Randalls and Wards were separated until the 1940's by the Little Hell Gate Channel.)
Aimee Boden, the director of the parks, said the foundation hopes to get $800,000 from City Hall for a master plan that would look at ways to improve access to the island and create new sports installations that could be financially self-sustaining.
SOME possibilities include ferry and bus service, roadway improvements and parking expansion, the reconstruction or replacement of the 21,000-seat Downing Stadium and a new field house with 4,000 to 6,000 seats.
Although the islands have 27 softball and baseball fields, 11 tennis courts, 7 soccer and football fields, a golf driving range and a 400-meter running track, Ms. Boden conceded that "you would not know you were in a park -- it doesn't look like a park, feel like a park or smell like a park." In part, that is because the islands are also home to the Triborough toll plazas, the Manhattan Psychiatric Hospital, a waste-water treatment plant and the Fire Department's training academy, among other things.
"There's got to be a way to look at all this mixed institutional use and make the park a cohesive facility," Ms. Boden said.
The Parks Department's involvement with islands does not stop at Randalls and Wards. During Henry J. Stern's first term as Parks Commissioner, in 1984, the agency acquired jurisdiction over Pralls Island, an 80-acre salt meadow and heron rookery in the Arthur Kill off Staten Island. In 1993, an agreement was reached to turn the 50-acre Shooter's Island, also off Staten Island, in the Kill Van Kull, into a wildlife sanctuary.
Now, the department would like to add the North and South Brother Islands and the Island of Meadows. "The combination of these five islands represents more than 2,000 breeding pairs of wading birds," said Marc A. Matsil, chief of the natural resources group. He said there were seven species of herons, egrets and ibises, representing roughly 20 percent of the entire breeding population in New England.
In addition to acquiring islands, Mr. Stern has actually added to the city's collection.
During the reconstruction six years ago of the Harlem Meer in Central Park, he saw to it that a 30-by-40-foot island was created. He named it Duck Island.
Now, Mr. Stern is at it again. As part of the reconstruction of the Great Lawn in Central Park, Turtle Pond is to be dredged and expanded by about 50 percent. An island will be built in the middle.
The reconfigured shoreline will include a new promontory that may be known as Turtle Neck, Mr. Stern said. Or, because it would be made of earth, it could be called Terra Peninsula.
If that were the case, the name of New York City's newest island would quickly suggest itself: Terrapin Insula.

LET'S MAKE A DEAL
 
Surf's Up!
Even in a year of frantic dealmaking, the tattoo of announcements was deafening, adding up to more than $20 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions. First Interstate Bancorp, which had been seeking alternatives to a hostile bid from Wells Fargo, found one with First Bank System of Minneapolis. But the sale price of $9.98 billion was less than what Wells Fargo is offering, and some large shareholders at First Interstate said they would vote against the deal if Wells Fargo makes a new bid.
Elsewhere on the corporate society page: International Paper agreed to pay $2.7 billion for Federal Paper Board; Central and South West, a Texas utility, $2.58 billion for Seeboard, a utility in the south of England; Softkey, a Japanese publisher and operator of trade shows, will pay $2.1 billion for Ziff-Davis Publishing; Cordis accepted a sweetened offer of $1.8 billion from Johnson & Johnson; Texas Utilities agreed to pay $1.55 billion for Eastern Energy of Australia; Learning Company accepted a $555 million offer from Broderbund Software, and Flower Industries and Artal Luxembourg said they would buy Keebler from United Biscuits for $500 million. And those were just the big ones.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Warning Lights Go On
In the latest sign that consumers may be moderating their spending, the Federal Reserve reported that new installment debt was sharply lower in September. And new claims for unemployment benefits shot up to the highest level since July 15. Neither is good news for retailers as the holiday season looms.
 
VOLATILITY
 
It's Down . . . No, It's Up!
Technology stocks stumbled badly after Cirrus Logic, a chipmaker, said one of its biggest customers was sharply reducing orders. The next day the Semiconductor Industry Association said chip orders were very strong, and technology soared for the rest of the week, pulling the Dow along as they went.
OPPORTUNITIES
 
Directors in Waiting?
Put off by the bickering and tawdriness of politics? Inspired to conduct surveillance of journalists' and the coverage? Sounds like the sort of credentials a corporate headhunter might admire. As Gen. Colin L. Powell and for-now Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary ponder their futures, are they attracted to those chairs around the boardroom tables?
 
TAXES
 
Not Something for Everyone
For all the talk during the budget debate about trimming taxes, the cuts envisioned in the bill approved by the Senate would leave unchanged the taxes paid by 55 percent of American households. An additional 10 percent would have taxes increased or Government tax credits lowered. The 43 million Americans whose taxes would be reduced would find the benefit amounts to about 68 cents a day, or $249 annually.
 
REAL ESTATE
 
A Deal for Rockefeller Center
Ending a months-long messy struggle for control of Rockefeller Center that began when Mitsubishi decided to walk away from its $2 billion investment, a group led by Goldman, Sachs agreed to buy the landmark development. The group, which includes David Rockefeller, with an offer of $306.1 million, was able to supersede an offer from the Chicago financier Sam Zell.
 
COMPETITIVENESS
 
$100 Million Gift to Princeton
Hoping to make American engineering more competitive with what he sees in Asia, Gordon Y. S. Wu, a Hong Kong businessman, gave $100 million to his alma mater, Princeton's School of Engineering and Applied Science. "You need top quality schools to stay at the top so others can follow," he said.
 
FINE ART
 
'Do I Hear $100 Million?'
Both Christie's and Sotheby's held auctions of fine art that broke the $100 million barrier for the first time since May 1990. Though Sotheby's took in $113.6 million with its offering of Impressionist and modern art, the total was well below what the auction house had anticipated.

GRAPHIC: Photo: "COMPACTNESS: Does Detroit Feel the Squeeze?" -- Jeff Gibson climbs out of what he says is the world's smallest "street legal" car, the Arbet, outside the Kingdome in Seattle, where the 1995 International Auto Show opened on Thursday. The Arbet, hand built by Arliss Sluter, includes 5,000 handmade parts and is powered by a two-cylinder, 13-horsepower engine. Do not expect to see it in a showroom any time soon.

HEADLINE: SHEILA BURKE IS THE MILITANT FEMINIST COMMIE PEACENIK WHO'S TELLING BOB DOLE WHAT TO THINK

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE; Jason DeParle is a staff writer for the Magazine. His last article profiled Anthony Lake, Clinton's national security adviser.

 BODY:
IT IS A DEAL-CUTTING DAY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, and the reporters who patrol the Capitol's ornate hallways are edgy with empty pads. A few sidle up to the Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison, while a handful check in with the Democratic leader, Tom Daschle. But the main pack converges, in a jostling, sharp-elbowed scrum around a former nurse who holds no elected office and until her recent misfortunes was unknown outside official Washington. With microrecorders in outstretched arms, they capture every word.
Bosnia? "It's on the agenda for the 5:15 bi-part at the White House," she says. The budget? "We are going to have a balanced budget, and we are going to have it on our principles." The future of of graduate medical education? "I think ours is likely to be a shaving, rather than a radical restructuring, as there is on the House side."
Confident and disarmingly frank, Sheila Burke dismisses her retinue and heads back into the chamber to resume the business of the Senate. As chief of staff to the majority leader, Bob Dole, Burke is sometimes called "the 101st Senator," a title that, for all its hyperbole, technically understates her role. Day to day, Burke does more to shape the Senate's agenda than all but a handful of its actual members. For a decade she drew little of the public scrutiny that the Government's behind-the-scenes players deserve. Then, in the ways of Washington, she burst into view amid one of the symbolic lynchings that regularly sweep the city.
Movement conservatives have long distrusted Burke, a 44-year-old ex-Democrat who calls herself a social moderate and believes in abortion rights. Their suspicions ignited a few months ago into a public campaign to get Dole to dump her. "To get Bob Dole to do the right thing, we have to climb over the body of Sheila Burke," wrote Paul Weyrich, whose columns and broadcasts offer a bellwether of conservative ideological thought. Weyrich said: She is "a feminist who has mastered the art of manipulating the Senate majority leader. Men of his generation don't know how to handle aggressive women of a younger generation."
The bashing of Burke is one of those modest, passing events that suddenly reveal a complex mix of the city's political mores. At one level, it is the story of Dole's main problem as he constructs his front-running bid for the Presidency: how to straddle the party's shrinking center and its ever-extending right. While Dole would find it a major strain to run the Senate without Burke, it is a minor bother to run for President with her.
At the same time, the attacks on Burke showcase a development that reaches far beyond this moment in Presidential politics: the rise of a conservative opinion-setting network, which, over the past 25 years, has grown remarkably adept at framing the issues of public debate. The agenda setters might be thought of as a loosely knit group that includes think tanks, foundations, columnists, direct-mail operations, talk-show hosts and various self-appointed spokespeople. Most of them, despite their success, insist that they are fighting an uphill battle against the liberal bias of Establishment institutions, particularly the press.
At one end of the spectrum, the conservative opinion makers include policy types skilled at shaping issues. (With one well-aimed fax, the strategist William Kristol helped smother all talk of last year's "health-care crisis.") At the other end, the conservative network includes an attack-dog wing proficient at demonizing individuals, whether through Willie Horton ads or talk-radio hosts who label Hillary Rodham Clinton a "feminazi." When it comes to vilification, the left isn't always more virtuous: recall Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. But for now it has little of the right's fervor, finances and reach.
Burke is merely the latest target, and the attacks on her provide a case study in right-wing ire. On July 26, the syndicated columnist Robert Novak accused her of "militant feminism." On July 7, a Wall Street Journal columnist called her "a former liberal Democrat" with "undue policy influence." On July 10, Phyllis Schlafly dubbed her "Hillary Lite." The next day, Paul Weyrich labeled her "Clinton-lite." A Time magazine article two weeks later was headlined, "Bring Me the Head of Sheila Burke," and by August, The Washington Post had run a news report, a profile, a column and an editorial. What started as some muttering among movement conservatives was suddenly news to The Economist of London.
Like many of the attacks, the portrayal of Burke as a feminist Svengali may say more about the phobias of her critics than it does about her. "The suggestion that Dole is led by anyone, female or male, in a direction he doesn't want to go is laughable on the face of it," Burke says. She has been denounced, accurately, as a graduate of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, inaccurately as a 60's protester and absurdly as a disciple of Simone de Beauvoir. Oddest of all, she stands accused of trying too hard to find common ground during last year's health-care debate. It would be a flattering charge, if only it were true.
There is an unwritten rule that tells Congressional staffers what to do when their names make the paper -- shut up and disappear. But Burke can't quite summon the penitential pose. "There was a suggestion that if you loved Hillary, you'd love me," she says, rolling her eyes and sitting in the office where she routinely routs Democrats -- amid autographed pictures from George Mitchell, Tip O'Neill and Mrs. Clinton herself. "Well, I mean I'm strong-willed and I'm independent, and I see women as fully capable as men of doing anything they choose. I'm not in the least apologetic about any of that."
Since any hope for continued anonymity "was shattered six months ago," Burke agreed to open one of her workweeks to outside observation. Watching her left little doubt that her 15-hour days are devoted to Dole's agenda, not her own. The more intriguing question, given her centrist beliefs, is, Why?
BURKE'S EYES SWELL WITH FATIGUE AS SHE slumps at a conference table littered with caramel wrappers, legal pads and crumbs. Down the hall, Senators are debating a welfare bill that will end 60 years of Federal support for poor children. Their grand philosophical claims fill the chamber, but the deals are being cut here, on a diet of junk food and caffeine. It feels like a college cram.
"I don't want to spend money willy-nilly, but can we give Moynihan his study?" Burke asks. A scowling colleague rolls her eyes and calls Burke "a pointy-head" for dispensing a $20 million gift to a New York Democrat -- one insisting, at that very moment, that the Republican bill will flood the streets with orphans. But Burke thinks the study worthwhile. "I know," she says sarcastically, "I'm such a softy for Moynihan." The study goes in.
More serious is what Burke calls "the very unpleasant subject of Pennsylvania." The state's Republican Governor and two Republican Senators have been demanding changes in the formula that will dispense Federal welfare dollars. They are currently exploiting what amounts to a $100 million loophole in Federal law, and they want to make sure the money is built into future base lines. Needing the officials' support, Dole has told Burke to accommodate them. She makes a technical change that will cost nearly $1 billion over the next seven years. And so it goes, well into the night -- a favor here, a deal there, a series of problems to be solved. "All those drafters who have died and gone to heaven are looking down on us and vomiting," she laughs.
Watching Burke manage the sausage factory, two things become apparent. One is her mastery of the details. A group of Democratic aides arrive and gamely suggest paying for more child care by cutting "corporate welfare." Burke, a step ahead, explains that even if the Republicans agreed, budget rules would not allow the revenue to finance new spending. Standing on the Senate floor, she finds the Republican John Chafee stumped by a colleague's arcane inquiry; she steps up and whispers the answer. "It dazzles me -- her knowledge," Chafee says afterward.
The second thing Burke knows is Dole, and her ability to speak for him is the mainstay of her power. An aide to Senator Charles Grassley races into her office. The Iowa Republican wants to denounce a Democratic amendment that would exempt all battered women from the bill's work requirements. But Grassley wants assurance before he risks being called an enemy of victimized women. "Grassley said, 'I'm not going to stand up and oppose this one unless the leader's on board,' " his envoy says. Burke scarcely looks up before giving Dole's permission to oppose it. "Dole will vote no," she says (arguing that states should exempt individuals but not whole classes of people). Burke calls the amendment "dumb on the face of it," then pauses and adds, "not that that necessarily makes a difference."
Burke's brusque irreverence is part of what brought on her troubles with the party's right wing during the welfare debate. In early June, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill that threw conservatives into revolt. They called its work requirements weak and its illegitimacy provisions absent. Unlike the House bill, for instance, it did not include a "family cap," which bars increased payments for additional children.
While Burke was skeptical about some of the illegitimacy proposals, she says the decision to omit them was made by Senator Bob Packwood, then the committee chairman. But the word in conservative circles is that Burke had engineered a feminist coup. "She has her own agenda, and she was pushing it," says Senator Lauch Faircloth, a North Carolina Republican. Dole fell under stinging attack from a Presidential rival, Senator Phil Gramm, and he had to pull the bill from the floor. "All hell broke loose," Burke says.
One of the oddest ensuing battles centered on semantics. Conservatives wanted the bill's preamble to call marriage "the foundation" of society. Burke sided with those suggesting "a foundation," explaining that "there are other parts of society -- you know, celibate priests -- who are important." The "the" camp prevailed and the quarrel made the papers, with the subtext that Burke was siding with single mothers and homosexuals. "It was translated into my hating marriage," she says.
The antagonisms boiled over on June 21, at a meeting of conservative advocates in her office. Calling it "contentious" would be an understatement. Burke says Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation spent the hour glaring at her; others say she more than returned the cold stare and at one point scolded, "Don't give me that look." When Andrea Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition began to insist that she represented "real people," Sheldon says Burke "just lost it." Burke exploded: "What do you mean -- I'm not a real person? I'm a nurse!" Burke says she resented the implication that "Hill staffers are just completely stupid and out of touch."
Dole eventually fashioned a compromise that gave the advocates most of the provisions they wanted. Some, like the family cap, were then defeated on the Senate floor by other conservatives worried that attempts to reduce illegitimate births would increase abortions. Burke says that's the point: that her critics blamed her rather than acknowledging that "conservatives themselves are divided." In truth, the whole debate was a sideshow. With or without a family cap, the welfare bill that cleared the Senate with 87 votes topped off a stunning rush to the right. In ending poor children's entitlement to Federal aid, it struck a death blow to 60 years of established social policy. And for better or worse, Burke helped wield the ax.
But she emerged more suspect than ever on the right. As she pushes the bill along one evening, Burke finds herself fingered in a new plot: aides to a conservative Republican accuse her of withholding a new Medicare plan. Her response is R-rated. She collects herself somewhat, grabs the phone and calls the staff member at home. "It's not Dole and it's not me," she barks.
Dole walks in at 9 P.M. as Burke winds the conversation down, and she tells him to expect a Senator's complaining call in the morning. Dole grouses -- "Well, they have to feel important" -- but Burke is only half-listening. "All I want to do is go to the bathroom," she says. "It's all I've wanted to do for an hour."
HILE PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY CALLS BURKE an anti-family radical, in the mold of Simone de Beauvoir, her roots are more Doris Day. Burke relished her provincial upbringing in Merced, Calif., where she completed 12 years of parochial school and developed family ties that were intense even for an only child. Burke describes her parents' deaths, 13 months apart in 1988 and 1989, as the most difficult time in her life, and she remains unable to part with the family home. During her father's last year, she spoke with him every day. "She had a relationship with her parents that was unlike any I've ever seen," says Mike Richards, a college friend. "It wasn't a parent-daughter relationship. It was on another level."
Her father, George A. Burke, was an executive with the Farmers Insurance company. Her mother, Joan Winfield Burke, minded the town's business as the answering service for its doctors and ambulance company. A British-born traditionalist, she once blamed the chaos of the 60's on the decline of the Latin Mass, and was only half-joking. Burke's paternal grandfather had been a unionized miner in Butte, Mont., and the family's politics were Democratic, by habit as much as fervor.
Among Burke's early role models were the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart, an order of artists and mild agitators whose preachings on social justice so irritated a Los Angeles cardinal that he banned them from the city's parochial schools. They staffed Merced's Our Lady of Mercy, where Burke edited the yearbook and collected debate-team trophies. "If you want peace, work for justice stuff -- it surrounded the students all the time," says Sister Dorothy Bushnell, Burke's 10th-grade teacher and longtime friend. The social gospel notwithstanding, it remained an innocent time. While other teen-agers were flocking to Woodstock in 1969, Burke held a prom party in her parents' home and the sisters were invited.
Burke went on to college -- not as a protester at San Francisco State, as The National Review put it this summer, but as a nursing student at the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit redoubt where she never touched a placard. "I pulled a 1.9 my freshman year," she says. "I was just right in the toilet." Burke spent a year working in a surgical ward after graduation, then plunged into the profession's politics, moving to New York in 1974 to work for the National Student Nurses Association. Dole hired her in 1977, when she was 26, to help with health policy; she switched party affiliation a few years later, earned a Kennedy School degree and by 1986 had risen to chief of staff.
Burke's salary is $102,000 a year ($30,000 less than those at the top of the Senate's pay scale). She also pays a price. Fifteen-hour days are common, and they separate her from three young children: Daniel, 7; Katie, 5; Sarah, 3. Burke's husband, David Chew, is a management consultant (and former Reagan White House official) who travels frequently, and the family gets by with a housekeeper and a live-in au pair. "It's not perfect," she says, "but it's better than what a lot of people have." She makes time to bake birthday brownies for each of the 24 members of her staff, and her colleagues go out of their way to stress Burke's devotion to her kids. (She'll drive home to read a bedtime story, then return to her office and work past midnight.) But work-family conflicts remain a central part of her life.
During the week of the welfare debate, Burke blocks off one night as sacrosanct, to fulfill a longstanding promise to take her son to a Yankees game in Baltimore. He marches into her office at the appointed hour with his father, his cap and a question: "Are you going?" With the welfare bill still on the floor, Burke is stuck in the office; she emerges a few minutes later, long-faced, as she recounts the conversation.
"No," she told him.
"Good," he said. "I hate you."
"I know you don't mean that."
"Yes, I do."
"There's just no way not to feel guilty," Burke groans, vowing to find tickets if the Yankees make the playoffs. (They do and she does.) At 11 P.M. she is still working, stacking piles of welfare amendments, when she comes across one that makes her laugh. Its subject is abstinence. "It's getting to be a life style around here," she says.
Amid such devotion, it's easy to understand what Dole sees in Burke. "I see a good staff director, and somebody that's been loyal and works hard," he says. "Even when we were in the minority, she had a lot of influence, because she knows the subject matter. That's power -- it's not title." When he introduced her to Richard Nixon last year, Dole claimed Burke had "forgotten more about health care than Hillary Clinton ever knew." (Nixon's reply didn't exactly strike a blow for sexual equality: "Yes, and she has better legs, too.") Asked whether Burke was pursuing a separate agenda, Dole snapped: "I make the decisions. I'm the guy on the ballot."
But why has Burke chosen Dole? While her loyalty runs deep, her own politics are at least a quarter-turn toward the center -- and, what's truly unusual for a Congressional aide, she acknowledges it. Dole trumpets his pro-life credentials. Burke says, "I fundamentally think it's a woman's right to decide." A jubilant Dole hailed the welfare bill as "a revolutionary change." Burke calls it "a good bill," but when pressed adds, "I do worry about the safety net." Is it possible that the country will look back and discover it has done to poor children what it did to the mentally ill: dumped them on the street? "You can't have gone through it and not worry about that, absolutely."
From the right this sounds like heresy; from the left it sounds like someone putting career ahead of conviction. Burke argues that "there are always issues upon which you disagree with your boss," but says that in the broad scheme of things "I'm perfectly comfortable" with Dole's positions.
Burke's tie to Dole, like most career paths, is in part the product of happenstance: he not only hired her but also promoted her to a position of power. "Had I come to know somebody like Jack Danforth or whomever -- Warren Rudman, Bill Cohen, Olympia Snowe -- would I have been comfortable working for them?" she asks. "You know, I probably would have." Explaining her commitment to Dole, Burke calls him "a man of principle" and praises the physical courage he shows in daily battles against his war injuries. But what most impresses her is the quality in Dole that conservatives most distrust: his nonideological, deal-cutting streak. "He is a legislator in the finest sense of the word," she says. "He's not locked into a single view on an issue, but changes as he understands how things work."
When Dole underwent prostate surgery in 1991, Burke spent Christmas morning at his bedside. But she would never call him Bob. "Oh, gosh, no," she says. "It wouldn't even occur to me."
"We are an odd couple," she says. "But you know, the mix seems to have worked."
FUTURE ANTHROPOLOGISTS WILL HAVE A rich time decoding all the forces behind the attacks on Burke. There is Presidential politics, of course -- bank shots to avoid direct confrontation with Dole. There are old habits of ideological policing. Paul Weyrich says he first met Dole when the two of them tried to banish a suspected moderate from the Nixon Administration; the official, John Robson, turned out to be a rock-ribbed conservative. "One of life's little ironies," Weyrich says.
There are new habits of ideological policing: since last November, other moderate Republican staff members have also fallen under attack. Wey rich goes as far as describing Burke as a kind of world historical figure, "with all 10 fingers in the dike, propping up this failed political establishment." There is even the ghost of Richard Darman and his centrist influence on George Bush's Presidency. Invoking Darman's dread name, many movement conservatives fear Burke will rise to similar heights in a Dole White House.
There is also what sounds like a lot of old-fashioned fretting about a woman's achieving power. Robert Novak chose a particularly loaded phrase when he called Burke "Queen of the Senate." Weyrich wrote that Burke's sex is the source of the problem, since Dole comes "from an era when you treated women with deference" and finds himself powerless against an assertive woman. Burke bristles at the "conscious attempts to bring my gender into the debate," after nearly two decades in which "it's never been an issue."
At the same time, many Senators have gone out of their way to praise her, from Democrats like Robert Byrd and Daniel Patrick Moynihan to Republicans like Nancy Kassebaum and Rick Santorum. Among them is John McCain, an Arizona Republican of impeccable conservative credentials, who immediately returns a phone call and leaps to Burke's defense. "She has always treated me with the utmost courtesy," he says. "She has never set the agenda. What she has done with utmost efficiency is carry out the wishes of Bob Dole. I don't know whether Sheila Burke is liberal, conservative, libertarian or vegetarian -- I know she is honest, decent and hard working."
And McCain is just getting started. "If it had not been for Sheila Burke," he continues, "we would not have gotten a line-item veto through the Senate." McCain wouldn't seem to have a motive for puffing up Burke. After all, he's backing the candidacy of Dole's main rival, Phil Gramm. So what's going on? "If I sound resentful at the attacks, it's because I am," he answers. The Senate "has gotten to be a nasty place, and it isn't just Presidential politics."
At one level, Burke's travails stem from a vilification impulse that is as old as the country itself. But the Burke affair also underscores a newer phenomenon: the rise, in the past quarter-century, of a formidable machine to promote the conservative agenda.
There are any number of places to begin the story of how modern conservatism donned its brass knuckles. But as good a place as any is the afternoon in 1969 when the young Paul Weyrich wandered into the strategy session of a coalition on civil rights. Weyrich was then a 27-year-old press secretary to a Colorado Senator, Gordon Allott, and was invited by mistake. There he beheld the Liberal Behemoth in all its steely glory. "They put together a battle plan, right then and there," Weyrich says. "I was absolutely mesmerized."
Weyrich is telling the story from the seat of his ever-expanding empire, a Capitol Hill town house that might be called nondescript, except for the Mongolian sword hanging beside his desk -- he likes to tell visitors that he sits to the right of Genghis Khan. A smooth-faced, round-bellied man in suspenders, he rarely smiles, and speaks in a hypnotic, almost martial voice, as he recalls the epiphany.
Walking into the civil rights meeting, he found a liberal establishment organized on every front. The Brookings Institution was promising a study, the A.C.L.U. a lawsuit, church groups were offering demonstrators and lobbyists and Carl Rowan was agreeing to write a column. The tale has the far-off, fuzzy quality of a story embellished through countless retellings, but the facts are beside the point. Weyrich had found his calling.
"From that day on, I became absolutely insufferable," he says. "Knowing how the liberal side operated, it was my responsibility to set up something to replicate this on the right." Weyrich resolved that movement conservatives had to have it all: "think tank, lobby, legal arm, means of communication, political action -- you know, the whole nine yards."
And thanks in no small part to his efforts, now they do. With $250,000 from the beer magnate Joseph Coors, Weyrich established the Heritage Foundation in 1973 and served as its first president. With continued help from the Coors family, he moved on to found an advocacy group, the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation, with a related organizing arm called Coalitions for America. From his base there, Weyrich has been an important adviser to both the Christian Coalition and Newt Gingrich. Weyrich's latest project, National Empowerment Television, may prove his most important. It pipes his political sensibilities into 11 million cable households, around the clock.
And that's just Weyrich's own little empire. Washington is now endlessly buffeted by the network of groups he once envisioned. The "whole nine yards" now includes research organizations like the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute; foundations like the Bradley, Olin and Scaife trusts; "pro-family" groups like the Family Research Council, the Christian Coalition, the Eagle Forum and Concerned Women for America; political action committees like Gingrich's old base, GOPAC; journalistic outlets like The American Spectator, The Wall Street Journal editorial page and The Washington Times, and Rush Limbaugh.
And that doesn't include fringe-ish direct-mail operations like Floyd Brown's Citizens United, which offers subscribers to its newsletter, "Clintonwatch," personal copies of the Gennifer Flowers tapes. ("In accordance with what our founding fathers really meant by 'freedom of the press,' " the solicitation explains.)
Their cumulative influence is the envy of the left. Anyone doubting that the opinion maker's world has been set on its head should consult this year's House freshmen, who abandoned the Harvard orientation course their predecessors had attended the past 24 years. Instead, they chose a session at Heritage, where the faculty included Limbaugh, Ralph Reed, Charles Murray and William Bennett. If, in fact, the Liberal Behemoth that Weyrich thinks he saw ever existed, it has long since been overtaken. In old liberal strongholds like union headquarters and the Brookings Institution, the head scratching is almost audible as people wonder, "How do they do it?"
To some extent the conservative groups succeed simply because they are now selling to a larger public market. But part of the explanation for the success of Weyrich and his colleagues involves the ideological fervor nurtured by their youthful status as outcasts. "The stigma of being a 'Goldwater Republican' was very, very pronounced," he says, recalling his 1966 arrival in Washington. "You had to sort of pretend that you really weren't -- you know, it was sort of St. Peter in the courtyard, 'I'm not one of them.' "
What's odd about the siege mentality, of course, is that conservatives have been in the majority more or less continuously since 1968. But they haven't been in the majority in most areas of what used to be called the Establishment, and many continue to feel persecuted, whether by the chic leftism of prominent universities or by the bland liberalism of educational, philanthropic and religious groups. Not to mention the press, which in Weyrich's view is "very plugged into these folks." Despite his remarkable success, Weyrich argues that conservatives are still outgunned in the agenda-setting wars, offering as an example the popularity of Colin Powell. "See, that's a liberal initiative. They're able to propel a guy like this into a major status in a matter of weeks. We have nothing comparable." It's an outlook that keeps Weyrich's trigger finger trained.
A second explanation for the counter-establishment's success is simpler: the smart use of money. For 25 years, ideologically driven benefactors like Coors and Richard Mellon Scaife have poured funds into conservative causes. "The conservatives have invested a great deal of money in these activities," says John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron and a prominent student of the right. The cause got an unlikely boost in 1985 when the Allen-Bradley Company, a Milwaukee manufacturer of factory automation equipment, was bought out by Rockwell International; part of Allen-Bradley was owned by a small foundation, which saw its holdings explode. Rechristened the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, it now has assets of $450 million and a beneficiary list that runs from center-right to out there, from the American Enterprise Institute to The American Spectator. The list includes the Heritage and Free Congress Foundations, Commentary, The New Criterion, The National Interest and the work of several thousand like-minded graduate students at Harvard, Boston College and the University of Chicago, among other places.
The foundation paid Charles Murray nearly $500,000 over the four years he researched his book on race, I.Q. and genetics. It subsidized David Brock's attack on Anita Hill in The American Spectator and the legal work of Clint Bolick, whose Wall Street Journal op-ed piece was the first to dub Lani Guinier the "quota queen." Liberal-leaning philanthropies like the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations dwarf Bradley in size. But Bradley's president, Michael Joyce, notes that his more established rivals tend to finance less ideologically pointed pursuits. "We invested a lot in people who are writers, thinkers, intellectuals -- some of that can be seen in the kind of conservative discourse that you have today," he says. "I have friends on the left, who, while they disagree with our aims, have been very admiring of how we carry out our agenda."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Trying to Lure Business to the Red Hook Waterfront

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
USUALLY it's the arrival of artists that is said to herald the rejuvenation of an urban neighborhood. When artists move into low-cost underutilized industrial space, can repopulation and higher property values -- or gentrification, as it may eventually be called -- be far behind?
But in Gregory O'Connell's view, revival along the Red Hook waterfront in Brooklyn would mean the arrival of more industrial tenants, more trucks operating day and night, and perhaps eventually, more cargo ships. 
"Our tenants come in here by truck seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and make all the noise they want," he said, making the pitch of the owner of waterfront industrial property, which he is. "They moved here to get away from residential areas. If residential uses ever get in here -- that's when our problems start."
Mr. O'Connell owns the 84,000-square-foot warehouse at 106 Ferris Street. He also owns the 2.5-acre Pier 41 property, with its 150,000-square-foot warehouse building, and the once-tumbledown Beard Street warehouse, with 330,000 square feet of space on 7.5 acres.. Gradually, he is rehabilitating all the buildings and filling them with industrial tenants. His success is demonstrating that there is a market from small enterprises for industrial space with excellent trucking access, when it can be provided at rents of $3 to $4 a square foot a year. Many of the smaller tenants take 7,500 square feet. Mr. O'Connell is doing it as a sweat-equity contractor -- taking on no expensive bank loans, but plowing back slowly built earnings into further rehabilitation, in the hope of long-term increases in value.
In another sense, his efforts also throw into bold relief some of the inherent tensions between residential and industrial land uses when they exist side by side in New York City. The City Planning Commission is attempting to reconcile these conflicts in Red Hook as it reviews a community planning document prepared under the auspices of a subcommittee of Community Board 6.
Several of the recommendations deal in principle with strengthening Red Hook's ability to attract jobs. But others look to specific land uses or policies that would eventually interfere with heavy industrial activities nearby, and might in fact undermine industrial growth -- the elimination or restriction of truck traffic on Van Brunt and Clinton Streets; the rezoning of whole industrial blocks so that housing could be introduced on them and the conversion of a major underutilized industrial building, the privately owned 480-500 Van Brunt Street, to residential use.
The City Planning Commission held an initial hearing on the plan, and now Commissioner Edward T. Rogowsky, the appointee of the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, is working with Community Board members to try to resolve the conflicts. Pauline Blake, chairwoman of Community Board 6, has voiced confidence that this will be done.
Red Hook has 338 businesses, of which 293 are blue-collar concerns employing about 4,000 people, according to Bette Stoltz, executive director of the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation. At least 100 businesses have moved in over the last three years, almost all of them blue-collar concerns, she said. "There is a heavy industry here that needs to be protected," said Ms. Stoltz.
Many of the move-ins have gone to Mr. O'Connell's buildings. He is a retired police detective who over the years acquired about 60 small residential buildings with 250 apartments, and then turned to commercial acquisitions. Working as general contractor, he has gradually improved and tenanted his properties. When he bought the 84,000-square-foot 106 Ferris Street, it was 20 percent occupied. Now it is fully occupied -- by a carpentry shop, a furniture importer, a woman's handbag maker and a record-storage company, among others.
When he bought Pier 41 at the end of Van Dyke Street from a private owner in 1984 its 150,000 square feet of space was 40 percent occupied. Now it is fully occupied with 20 tenants, most of them in spaces of 6,000 to 7,000 square feet. The Beard Street acquisition came in 1992, when he was awarded a long-term lease by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
"It was in terrible condition -- vacant, with the roof collapsed, and parts of it unused for 25 years," Mr. O'Connell said. He is gradually repairing and rebuilding it, and already has 13 tenants in 150,000 square feet, about 40 percent of the building.
With Richard Dattner as architect, Mr. O'Connell has a master plan to link his two piers along the waterfront, and use the services of one of his tenants, the Brooklyn Historical Railway Association, a trolley restorer, to build track on the waterfront and inland to make the waterfront a destination for visitors.
T HE site includes 4,000 linear feet of bulkhead and 13 acres under water, and Mr. O'Connell is hopeful that eventually tenants will include bulk-cargo shippers using warehouse space for commodity imports arriving by water. Meanwhile his smaller tenants are typically taking spaces of 7,500 square feet. The Civil-War-era pier is 150 feet across, and every 50 feet there is a masonry fire wall, so the smaller tenants taking 7,500 square feet get front and rear doors to their space.
"We want to bring in small freighters to ship out containerized products to places like Haiti," Mr. O'Connell said. "There's a big market down there for everything. Their families here want to export all kinds of products to the people back home."
He also said that these activities could be combined with public access to the waterfront if the design were done correctly.
Another waterfront owner and developer in Red Hook is Gerald Ponsiglione Jr., whose family company, Continental Terminals, bought the 13-acre former Daily News warehouse property on the water from Woolcott Street to Coffey Street. Half of the News building was leased to Snapple Beverages and half to the Federal General Services Administration.
Now Snapple, a division of Quaker Oats, is completing a two-year reconstruction of its 150,000 square feet for a Snapple and Gatorade distribution operation. And in a new-construction project nearby, a 35,000-square-foot building is under construction for the General Services Administration.
Still another waterfront property is New York Shipyard, with 24 acres of land -- and 12 acres under water -- off Beard Street from Columbia Street to Richards Street. The company ceased operation as a shipyard about two years ago and its president, James Murphy, is trying to market the property. The original community zoning proposal called for rezoning a portion of the property for light manufacturing, so that it would serve as a buffer between waterfront activity and housing.
"The waterfront industry has died," said Jeffrey C. Brown of Brown & Son, a real-estate company. "The face of the neighborhood has changed from heavy manufacturing and ship supplier and electronic companies to warehouse companies doing distribution, or small manufacturers." The Red Hook Marine Terminal, a containerport, is the only currently active waterfront shipping operation.
Mr. Brown, who is trying to market the New York Shipyard property, said his vision for the property was "big-box retailing and a passenger terminal." Many smaller cruise vessels won't dock in New York City at present because of the high costs at existing facilities in Manhattan, he said.
As for the Port Authority, it has sold most of its Red Hook property, and is now trying to market another one, the Grain Terminal at the mouth of the Gowanus Canal. Similarly, a privately owned pier where Revere Sugar once operated is unutilized, with an expensive demolition requirement awaiting any buyer.
Accordingly, the plan that is eventually adopted for Red Hook will probably try to provide for more retailing and other commercial enterprises near the waterfront, in addition to light industrial and distribution activities. But housing will likely be confined to locations where it won't interfere.
 At the same time, the conservative advocates have shown a marketing gift that, for whatever reason (maybe it's the background in business), their adversaries have never matched. While Weyrich says Heritage was meant as a counterweight to places like Brookings, that's like saying Rush Limbaugh is a counterweight to Dan Rather. The model was always different -- in the case of Heritage, it was designed less like a university and more like a public relations firm. It pioneered the two-page "backgrounder" and invested heavily in a Rolodex of Congressional staff members and reporters. Today, it is among the wealthiest Washington think tanks (with revenues of $23 million), and it spends much more than its rivals on various forms of promotion, including fund raising, lectures, lunches and seminars.
Other conservative groups have shown a similar knack. The Family Research Council sends letters to National Merit semifinalists offering an 800-number to call for help with college research; its list of available background papers includes "Homosexuality Is Not a Civil Right" and "The Pitfalls of a Gender-Blind Military." Dozens of distinguished scholars had written tomes on intelligence that languished on dusty shelves, but Charles Murray generated unprecedented attention with "The Bell Curve," in part by shrouding it in mystique -- refusing to circulate galleys, then inviting opinion setters to a special weekend seminar with him. The hush whetted media appetites and left Murray's critics unable to respond during the initial publicity blast, since they hadn't seen the book. As a result there was a blizzard of uninformed speculation on whether blacks are at a genetic disadvantage to whites, reintroducing to public debate a subject once thought to have been safely buried.
IN THE SAME DECADES THAT conservatives have been fashioning their ideological ascendancy, American politics as a whole has been growing more personal and vindictive. Conservatives hold no monopoly here; it certainly wasn't Weyrich who went around Washington in the 1980's spray-painting "Ed Meese Is a Pig." Indeed, one of the watershed events was the liberal campaign in 1987 against Judge Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court. Many conservatives view it as the watershed event. Liberal advocacy groups worked to defeat him with all the attention to nuance and civility that now marks the Burke affair, and with much more at stake.
"Robert Bork's America," in Senator Edward M. Kennedy's famously hyperbolic words, would be a place where "women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens."
The problem was that even Bork's fierce conservatism didn't fit the caricature. "Like it or not, Bork falls (perhaps barely) on the borderline of respectability," wrote two of his adversaries at the Advocacy Institute, a liberal lobbying group. (The paper is quoted in Ethan Bronner's definitive account of the nomination, "Battle for Justice.") Nonetheless, they continued, "Bork must come to be seen as an extreme ideological activist, serving as Reagan and Meese's political agent." Bork's opponents painted him that way, Bronner concludes, with a campaign of "half-truths."
In their wake, they left a new verb, "to Bork," and the conservatives' vow to exact their revenge. "After Bork lost, this movement sobered up and said, 'We will never again allow this thing to happen,' " Weyrich says. Washington's discourse has been more or less on a downward slide ever since. First, 1988 brought the Willie Horton ads, painting Michael Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential nominee, as soft on black rapist-murderers. Then in 1989, Weyrich sank the nomination of Senator John Tower as President Bush's Secretary of Defense, describing him as the drunken companion of "women to whom he was not married." And this was just a prelude to the slime-slinging on all sides of the 1991 Clarence Thomas nomination.
By the 1992 campaign, Floyd Brown, the producer of the Willie Horton ads, was back in business, selling an attack paperback on Bill Clinton and, for just $4.99 a call, the chance to hear the Gennifer Flowers tapes. The inaugural year brought the portrayals of Joycelyn Elders as the "condom queen," Lani Guinier as the "quota queen" and Hillary Rodham Clinton as a feminist super-villain. Colin Powell has not yet entered the Presidential race, but he has already attracted his share of attack faxes. At a recent news conference of anti-Powell conservatives, the general was assailed for being too liberal and too cautious. "He may not want to run after this, " Weyrich said.
The ubiquitous direct-mail houses keep it all churning -- after all, who's going to contribute to a group that says, "Joycelyn Elders: Experts Disagree"? Instead, Brown sent out a 1993 letter headlined, "Joycelyn Elders: Nazism Reborn." Concerned Women for America promised to battle "Elders's sex-crazed policies on every front."
Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum not only promised to fight Elders and her "Big Mama government," it also warned that the Children's Defense Fund was conspiring with the United Nations "to replace parents," and that if Washington joined the World Trade Organization, "this year's Fourth of July may be the last Independence Day that Americans are ever able to celebrate." So who should be surprised these days to hear Representative Helen Chenoweth, the Idaho Republican, speculating that black helicopters are sneaking into Idaho on secret missions to create a New World Order.
None of it sounds much different from, say, an afternoon on Wey rich's network, National Empower Continued on page 100
ment Television. During a break in my conversation with Weyrich, I wait in a visiting room and watch the network's afternoon fare: a call-in show about Whitewater featuring the "media critic" L. Brent Bozell 3d. "I'm not a conspiracy nut," the caller from Indiana begins. "I am," Bozell says. The subsequent conversation spins off into speculation that an airstrip in Mena, Ark., knits Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton into a single mega-scandal involving guns, drugs and Nicaragua. Even Bozell finds it "a little too pat" to picture the three Presidents in one conspiracy. "But are there questions?" he asks. "You betcha!"
SUCH WAS THE STATE of political dialogue this summer when the Borking of Burke (as The New Republic put it) began in earnest. It had been building for a while. Novak, who prides himself on being the "Prince of Darkness," had written an anti-Burke column in spring 1994. Weyrich weighed in over the winter, advising Dole to "fire Sheila Burke." By this spring, a number of Senate conservatives were muttering their concern over Dole's lack of ideological fire, and one Senator called the New York Times columnist William Safire, urging him to expose Burke as a moderate. So something was already in the air when Novak fired his shot in late June.
The subsequent chronology would look awfully suspicious to a conspiracy buff. As Brent Bozell might say: "Are there questions? You betcha!" The Wall Street Journal's op-ed piece was written by John Fund, a former Novak research assistant. Fund, in turn, quoted Weyrich. Weyrich then followed up, hitting Burke with both a television commentary and a column in The Washington Times. Novak, meanwhile, is the host of a show on Weyrich's network. Mmmm. Sounds like a plot -- shades of Mena, Ark.
"I assure you -- and Novak will affirm this -- that he and I had no communication about Sheila Burke," Weyrich says. "I didn't talk to anybody. You know, John Fund called me. I didn't call him and say, 'Hey, we need an article on Sheila Burke.' "
Novak did not affirm this; he would not return phone calls, although he did take Burke to task in a column for cooperating with this article. But Weyrich is probably telling the truth when he disavows any formal plan. Then again, who needs a plan? Lots of people had it in for Burke already, and when she bounced the conservative activists on June 21, she lighted a match in a gas-filled room. A few days later, Novak was on the phone, telling Burke that Senator Faircloth's staff had complained to him. His column hit print five days after Burke's blowup.
Burke's toughness is such that a colleague once gave her a box of nails garnished with salt and pepper, in case she missed breakfast. While she often rolls her eyes at her detractors, she occasionally strains to sound understanding. "I mean, the November elections were a dramatic shift, and I think people are telling us that things needed to change," she says. But the charges have stung. Burke has received more than 150 letters of support from friends, strangers, Democrats, Republicans -- from Mack McLarty at the White House and even from a former aide to Jesse Helms. They matter enough that she keeps them in a special file and stays late to offer handwritten responses. "What troubles me the most is, at the end of the day your reputation is really all you have left," she says.
Of course, the whole thing would have gone unnoticed by anyone beyond the movement faithful had the mainstream press not picked it up. The Burke story reincarnates an old problem: covering an attack campaign inevitably helps the attackers by keeping the story alive. (The Willie Horton commercial was actually broadcast in just a few markets but gained its notoriety through endless press recyclings.) At the same time, to ignore the attacks is to conceal some aspect of political reality -- in this case, that Bob Dole really does have a problem with the right.
Once the Burke story was in play, it echoed everywhere despite the emptiness of the accusations. I ask Grover Norquist, a columnist for The American Spectator, why so many people have it in for Sheila Burke. Norquist says he barely knows her, but "people have said she's a new Dick Darman -- that's a frightening thing." This is an odd way of putting it, since Norquist happens to be one of those "people." He was quoted in The Wall Street Journal on July 18, at the height of the Burke-bashing: "This could be Dick Darman II."
Norquist momentarily falls silent when reminded of his comments, then says he must have been quoted out of context by "left-wing" reporters at The Journal. "I don't even know the lady," he says. But this does not inhibit him from adding another dig. "The liberal news publications are all writing about what a swell guy she is, which must mean it's a problem or that she leaks like a sieve."
Arthur Ravenal Jr., a former South Carolina congressman, is similarly enlightening. He gave the Burke story an extra bounce this summer when he announced that her politics had prompted him to resign a ceremonial post with the Dole campaign and sign up with Phil Gramm. When I ask about his encounters with Burke, he admits that he had never met her and knew nothing of her beyond what he had read on The Journal's op-ed page. When I note that Burke felt the article depicted her unfairly, Ravenal's reply captures the spirit of the day: "There's nothing fair in politics, you know."
By and by, the trail of the Burke-bashers leads to one of the inner sanctums of contemporary conservatism. There, on the third floor of the Hart Senate Office Building, it all comes together: the seemingly distinct phenomena of Willie Horton, Gennifer Flowers, Whitewater and Sheila Burke. It is the office of Senator Lauch Faircloth. The link is Faircloth's latest hire, a 29-year-old Republican operative with a crew cut, crisp shirt and round glasses. He looks just like the character the Columbia Journalism Review rendered last year in a rough artist's sketch. Here he is: David Bossie.
When the Journalism Review came across him last year, Bossie was working as Floyd Brown's main investigator at Citizens United. Bossie would not allow himself to be photographed, explaining that he needed to preserve his anonymity for his forays into Arkansas. He had signed on with Brown sometime after the 1988 Willie Horton commercials, but in time to produce the 1992 paperback attack on Clinton, called "Slick Willie." By 1994, Bossie had helped turn Citizens United into a P.R. firm flacking Whitewater documents and tips -- to great effect, apparently. The Review found "an eerie similarity between the Citizens United agenda and what has been appearing in the press," down to "omissions, spin and implication." Faircloth hired him away over the summer to help with his own Whitewater work. Bossie's presence during an interview about Burke is a development that should give her no comfort.
"Sheila Burke is far from being as conservative as I am, but very few people are," Faircloth begins. That seems the crux of his complaint. He spends the rest of the hour shelling peanuts and growling into his private phone, which keeps ringing with a wrong number. He has no specifics to add about Burke, other than to call the early draft of the welfare bill "a pot of pablum." (Faircloth is the only Senator to vote against the final bill because it is too liberal.)
But why blame her, rather than Bob Packwood, the committee chairman? "It was just assumed she was involved in directing the legislation." Why for that matter would Bob Dole (whom Faircloth is backing for President) keep a mischievous liberal in his midst for nearly two decades? "I don't know," Faircloth says. "I couldn't comment."
OF ALL THE COMPLAINTS that have been hurled Burke's way, perhaps the strangest is that she worked too hard to find common ground in last year's health-care debate. She is not assailed for backing a specific, wrong-minded policy; the complaint is simply that, as Novak put it, "she kept health-care negotiations with the Democrats going long after the issue was dead."
There is, in fact, a case to be made against Burke and her boss, but it's the opposite one: following the polls, they dashed all hope of a health-care breakthrough, disowning even the moderates' bill, which Dole himself had endorsed a year before. There was a Republican Senator who worked for compromise until the bitter end -- John Chafee -- and Burke was barely on speaking terms with his staff. "She was very much an instrument of obstruction," says Christine Ferguson, who was then Chafee's health specialist. "It was very, very frosty between us."
The Dole camp's decision to block any health plan was no minor triumph of politics over principle. Dole, after all, spent 39 months in a hospital recovering from his war wounds. As Burke puts it: "Here is a guy who really knows firsthand, up front, what health care can do for you. And also knows what it was like not to be able to pay for it." While Burke dutifully argues that Dole himself "worked damn hard" to forge a Republican consensus, she concedes that the debate as a whole was a debacle of misinformation. "And no question about the fact that I'm as much to blame as anybody," she says. "It was not a pretty picture."
Dole is responding to the attacks on Burke with his usual acidic asides. After spending the week with her, I am escorted into his cavernous Senate sitting room, where, without rising from his wing chair, he greets me with a gripe: "You're going to spread it some more." Novak's was a "cheap shot," he says, and Weyrich "says he's a friend, but it's pretty hard to determine sometimes." Dole dismisses the idea that he can't handle strong women, noting that he lives with one -- his wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, a former Cabinet secretary who has just taken a year's leave from her job as president of the International Red Cross. "These guys, the old-boy network, some of them may not like women," he says. His dark demeanor takes a comic turn as he hikes his voice into a mocking squeal to imitate Phil Gramm's disowning the attacks on Burke. "I'm not, no, I'm not attacking Sheila," he squeaks, and then growls that Gramm is "mailing out this stuff." (The Gramm campaign denies it.)
Dole says he has told Burke that "she's doing a good job and doesn't have to worry about it." It's an endorsement, though a notch below a ringing defense. Dropping her would make him seem craven (particularly after his embarrassing flips and flops over a campaign contribution from the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group). Dropping her would also complicate Dole's task of running the Senate while running for President. Still, the attacks are having an effect. "I've had it raised four, five or six times across the country," he says. "Like last week in Orlando, Fla., somebody got up and attacked Sheila Burke. So it's out there." The only false note is the hint of innocent surprise at the depth to which his profession has sunk. "Maybe that's the way you do business in politics."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 17, 1995, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Perspectives column on Nov. 12, about the Red Hook waterfront, misstated the ownership of two buildings. The Beard Street warehouse is owned by a developer, Gregory O'Connell -- as noted in the first reference to the building and in the picture caption -- not leased from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. A separate building, at 480-500 Van Brunt Street, is city property through tax foreclosure; it is not privately owned. A reader's letter dated Nov. 15 pointed out the errors; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.
A picture caption on Nov. 12 with an article about Sheila Burke, Bob Dole's chief of staff, misidentified a longtime benefactor of conservative organizations and politicians. He is William K. Coors, not Joseph Coors.

HEADLINE: What to Do With All That Open Land?

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
AS the state prepares to pull the last patients out of the huge Fairfield Hills Hospital complex, opened in 1933 in Newtown, a variety of groups are watching anxiously to see what kind of new uses are proposed.
With ready access to Routes 25, 34 and Interstate 84, as well as by virtue of its being the largest undeveloped block of land in Fairfield County, Fairfield Hills is expected to attract a lot of interest when it becomes available. 
 Town officials want some of the property used for economic development, particularly the 1.5 million square feet of existing space in 140 buildings.
"We've got a huge amount of existing space, the setting is beautiful, the buildings are in pretty good shape, and the feeling is, let's use that space rather than leave it vacant or build something new," said Newtown First Selectman Robert Cascella.
On the other hand, Frank R. DeLucia, executive director of Nunnawauk Meadows, a 120-unit housing complex for the elderly built on about 65 acres of former Fairfield Hills land, said another 100 units could go up on adjacent land if the state agreed to make it available.
"But we do have some concerns with the ultimate use of the property," Mr. DeLucia said. "We want to make sure it's something compatible, not only with us but with the town. Our expansion plans hinge a lot on what happens with that property."
Farmers want to see the rolling fields of hay and corn preserved; with more than 500 acres of farmland it represents the largest agricultural parcel in the county.
"There are not a large number of farms left in Fairfield County. There's only about seven dairy farms left, and the majority of their land is in hay and corn," said Joseph J. Dippel, director of the state Farmland Preservation Program. "It's a one-of-a-kind property for that part of the state."
And Richard G. Bell, a lawyer, member and director of the Pootatuck Land Company, a 100-year-old club that operates a 200-acre hunting and fishing reserve adjacent to the hospital, said the primary concern of his group is that any use not harm the underground water sources in the area.
The state has pumped water off the Pootatuck property since 1947 on a 99-year lease that provides water only to the hospital. Recently the water lines were extended to Nunnawauk and the Garner Correctional Center built on Fairfield Hills land -- without any change in the lease terms.
"As this re-use project moves forward, I would not be totally surprised to see them forget about that issue again, but we're going to bring it up," Mr. Bell said. "We may be very happy to have sensible uses made of that property, provided the water quality of the stream and the aquifer are protected."
But he warned that "There are a lot of uses that would be quite incompatible with the aquifer, either because they would take too much water out of it, or they would pollute it."
As for hospital authorities, "We're not taking any position on the future use of the property," said Robert F. Taylor, a spokesman for the Department of Mental Health. "We're out of there on Jan. 1, and have a very neutral position regarding what happens to it after that."
Before the end of the year, Gov. John G. Rowland is expected to appoint a 10-member task force to oversee the implementation of a report done by a previous task force on new uses for the Fairfield hospital property.
"It's like a pearl right in the middle of town -- a big one," said Representative Julia B. Wasserman, Republican of Newtown, who was chairman of the previous task force. "The right thing has to be done for the state because the people of the state own it, but also for the town and the entire region."
Over the last decade, as it became clear the hospital would be closed, there have been several studies and recommendations on the reuse of the property. Ms. Wasserman said that for now, the Governor has pledged that the state will retain the property, but she worries that if the current effort is not successful, the estimated $100 million value of the property will prove too enticing, and it could be sold.
"It's a marvelous resource, and the state should not give it up," Ms. Wasserman said. "But after a few years, if these plans haven't worked out, and the property hasn't started to become self-sufficient, the Governor is going to start looking for a buyer."
At one time the state operated three state hospitals -- Norwich Hospital in Preston and Connecticut Valley Hospital in Middletown, as well as Fairfield Hills.
But a declining patient census has forced some consolidation. Fairfield Hills was built for a patient population of as many as 3,500, but in recent months it has been in the 120 to 140 range.
"Through a better network of support services we've been able to help a lot of people make the transition into group homes," Mr. Taylor said. Community-based programs now help mentally ill people shop, pay bills, get and keep a job, and maintain their medication. Research shows most people make more progress in a community setting.
"As more people have moved into the community, it's time to move to a single campus and consolidate all the services," Mr. Taylor added. Norwich Hospital, which has a similar capacity to that of Fairfield Hills and a similar census, too, will be closed in 1997.
"Centralizing the services in Middletown was the right choice in terms of efficiency," Mr. Taylor said. "There might be some minor inconvenience involving families who are visiting patients, but we don't think it'll be terribly disruptive, and in fact it'll allow us to improve the services if we only offer them in one location."
After January, the Fairfield grounds will be turned over to the state's Department of Public Works for maintenance until the reuse plan is implemented.
Some reuse has already taken place. Garner Correctional Center, a high-security prison has opened on the southeast corner of the property, even though the town spent $500,000 on legal fees trying to stop it. In exchange, the town got land for a sewage treatment plant on the northwest corner of the property, and 25 acres adjacent to Commerce Road for economic development activity.
Nothing so controversial is planned for the rest of the property. The largest part of the property is to be retained as open space, probably by the state's Department of Agriculture.
Mr. Dippel, of the Farmland Preservation Program, said that would not rule out fishing in the two streams that cross the property, or passive recreational uses like hiking, biking and cross-country skiing on the network of hospital roads and trails.
"Things like that would not actively impact the agricultural value of the property, but would expand the number of people who would be getting use from it," Mr. Dippel said.
Much of the rest of the plan is more general. Five buildings are identified for possible use as administrative office space by town, state and regional agencies.
Two large halls and several smaller buildings could be used for housing. Kent House, at 238,407 square feet the largest building on campus, is proposed for educational uses -- a professional school or college.
Land adjacent to the town's 25 acres off Commerce Road could be used for light industrial purposes: food processing, a technology park, business incubator space, or a hospital industry. And a site is identified for a possible state Department of Transportation maintenance garage.
Ms. Wasserman said the state's Office of Policy and Management recommended against any more specific language because it doesn't want the state unable to respond if, for instance, a pharmaceutical company wanted to take over the entire parcel.
"The feeling is that giving away too much of the land would tie their hands in terms of potential uses," Ms. Wasserman said. The town, she said, would like to retain the campus atmosphere as much as possible.
Mr. Cascella said for that reason he is pleased to have been asked to serve on the implementation committee that the Governor will name shortly.
"It was very, very important for Newtown to have a voice on the implementation committee," Mr. Cascella said. "It's a lot easier for citizens to contact us, and get answers, than to get in touch with people at state agencies in Hartford. There is also an overwhelming feeling in town that we have to protect the environment, particularly in that area."
He said, however, that he does not expect any problems as the state works toward finding new tenants for the property.
"The state and the town have worked together well for the last two years on the reuse report, and I can't imagine that's going to suddenly change," said Mr. Cascella, who was re-elected first selectman on Tuesday.
Mr. Bell, of Pootatuck Land, said he would reserve judgment until more specifics emerged from the reuse process, and he cold see how it might affect the area.
"There are some long-range land-use issues that are going to have to come to a head in this process," Mr. Bell said. "We're not looking for a confrontation, but we do want to see these issues resolved."

Myths, Fraud, and the Attack on America's Public Schools.

 MORE than 40 million American children are enrolled in public school; it is one of the most universal of our experiences and a large industry (spending about $160 billion a year), as well as perhaps the single leading activity of government. Strangely, though, public school is also a topic about which it is possible to assert almost anything without being subjected to the reality testing that ordinarily applies in public discourse. One reason for this is that so many of the leading discoursers belong to the 1 percent of Americans who attended, or send their children to, expensive nonsectarian private schools: public school is an abstraction to them. Another is that our public school system is so radically decentralized, compared with those of other industrial nations; it is under the control of 15,000 local boards of education rather than a central ministry whose policies are highly visible. Even public school parents have very little idea what their children do in class all day.
In these four books, we have a blind-men-and-the-elephant exercise that is hard to imagine taking place with any other issue so important and so close at hand. In "Dumbing Down Our Kids," Charles J. Sykes presents us with a nightmarish picture of a public school system standing close to ruin, thanks to the dominance of destructive liberal ideas that prevent any real learning from going on. Mike Rose, in "Possible Lives," conducts a detailed national tour of public education, especially in poor areas, and finds it to be triumphantly, inspiringly successful. David C. Berliner and Bruce J. Biddle, taking the same side as Mr. Rose but striking a different tone, argue in "The Manufactured Crisis" that the very notion of an educational crisis is a frightening example of the potency of the big lie technique. Neil Postman would probably agree with Mr. Sykes that there is a crisis, but in "The End of Education" he defines it in exactly the opposite way, as consisting of an insufficiency of the humanist ethos in schools.
There is so much public education going on in this country that it would be possible for everybody to be correct in a narrow literal sense: the system probably does contain in its vastness some example of every conceivable kind of success and failure. But there is also an underlying philosophical issue that may explain, better than the actual conditions do, the striking differences between these books.
The two Founding Fathers who were most interested in education, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, both believed in disseminating schooling widely among the people, but they had distinctly different purposes in mind: in Franklin's case, training students "to enter the World" as economic actors, in Jefferson's, teaching them "how to work out their greatest happiness" as citizens. Universal public education didn't become established until the 19th century, when educators of a Jeffersonian bent, most notably Horace Mann, learned how to play the Franklin card -- stressing the practical benefits of education as a way of persuading the public to pay taxes for it. So from the very beginning there has been a tension in public education: educators are mostly Jeffersons and the taxpayers whose support they need are mostly Franklins.
The one conservative in this crowd, Mr. Sykes, a journalist and radio talk show host who is the author of several books on education, believes that the purpose of public school is to teach children concrete skills that will be useful -- to them individually in the job market and to the national economy as a whole. One reason he and the others disagree about everything is that they see the purpose of public school as being fundamentally different, in fact almost opposite: "to find and promote large, inclusive narratives for all students to believe in" (Postman); to be "preparatory arenas for civic life" (Rose); "to promote the joy of learning for its own sake" (Berliner and Biddle, on higher education in particular). All three liberal books explicitly and repeatedly reject the idea that schools exist to prepare young people for the marketplace, and treat as dubious the idea that education confers economic benefits. Mr. Sykes wants public schools to be part of the mainstream economic culture; the other authors want schools to stand apart from, even provide an alternative to, the idea that America is about business.
Although Mr. Sykes's book is packaged as the latest attack on political correctness, he is quite forthright in stating that the educational trends he finds alarming are not products of the 60's counterculture. As he points out, the 1950's, usually the halcyon past in conservative discourse, were a nightmare decade by his lights because of the popularity of the undemanding Life Adjustment theory of education. For him the real starting point for everything alarming was the adoption, by a subcommittee of the National Education Association, of a series of progressive-education "Cardinal Principles" -- in 1918!
Today the villains, to Mr. Sykes, are the latest iterations of progressivism. He is very good at making fun of jargony new movements like Outcome-Based Education and Whole Language, along with other manifestations of educational mediocrity and therapeutic excess that he has dug up: an education school doctoral thesis on golf, a textbook that seeks to instruct small children in masturbation, a teachers' magazine that promotes "collaborative writing" because it means fewer papers to grade. What we ought to do, Mr. Sykes says, is junk all this feel-good nonsense and focus on teaching basic skills to students segregated into ability groups, and then subject the schools to tough evaluation in the form of standardized tests.
 IT is hard to tell how much of public education Mr. Sykes has seen directly -- he appears to be working mainly from materials in the library. His book is a prime example of what Mike Rose says is the tendency of education writers who aren't teachers to operate at a "high level of generality and opinion." Also, Mr. Sykes leaves out an important factor underlying the softening of academic rigor in public education during the 20th century, which is the enormous expansion and ethnic diversification of the school population under the banner of universalizing opportunity. Until World War II, only about half of all students entering high school nationwide graduated, and only a fifth started college; today it's three-quarters and three-fifths. Suddenly given the difficult task of making practically every American child into a little Franklin, teachers have responded by shifting the mission to turning out Jeffersons.
Mr. Rose's book operates at a high level of specificity and nonjudgmental ism. It is the product of immense labor -- he examines nine separate educational settings scattered all over the country -- undertaken, Mr. Rose says, to answer a "desperate need of rich, detailed images of possibility" in public education. A former schoolteacher himself (as is Neil Postman) and now with the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Los Angeles, he began his project by asking his contacts to nominate good schools for him to visit; he didn't go looking for bad news, and he didn't find any.
 ALMOST all of the book consists of long, leisurely, heavily quotational, elegantly rendered accounts of Mr. Rose's visits to schools. It is not his style to make his points directly, but he does answer some of Mr. Sykes's arguments implicitly by showing us students on the South Side of Chicago rigorously explicating a dead white European male text ("As I Lay Dying"); the civil rights hero Bob Moses teaching youngsters in the Mississippi Delta about prime numbers and factor trees; bilingual education students in California mastering English.
Although it is quite clear that Mr. Rose judges schools by a different standard from Mr. Sykes (if a test score is mentioned anywhere in "Possible Lives" I didn't see it), his evidence from the field does suggest that perhaps the dichotomy between traditional and trendy in education may be a false one. It is possible for public schools (the ones my kids go to, anyway) to embrace publicly every possible buzzword and vogue of the moment while still teaching children to spell and multiply. The real question, in the schools Mr. Rose visited, is whether the students' minds are awake or asleep, and he's persuasive that the teacher, not educational doctrine, is the main determinant of that.
Mr. Postman writes in a voice similar to Mr. Rose's -- informal, clear, one that self-consciously avoids educationese -- but he hasn't done the legwork that Mr. Rose has. He is working in the tradition of the casual essayist, the honorable amateur, and this lends his book both its considerable charm and a vague, digressive feeling. "The End of Education" must be the only book that admiringly discusses the work of both Robert Fulghum, the homespun philosopher, and Count Alfred Korzybski, the semanticist.
What Mr. Postman, University Professor and chairman of the department of culture and communication at New York University, has to say about education, he asserts rather than demonstrating; his determination to eschew the sweaty academic tone is so powerful that it sometimes leads him into a don't-bother-me-with-the-facts position. He writes, for example, that "the Germans and Japanese are opening huge automobile plants in America, and in states not famous for the excellence of their educational systems" -- but Tennessee, the most successful lurer of plants, instituted a major school reform precisely to attract foreign auto manufacturers. In another place Mr. Postman writes, "I refer, for example, to Saul Bellow's rhetorical question concerning the absence of Swahili novels (or was it Navajo novels?) that are the equal or superior to the novels of Proust." The studied inaccuracy is meant to be winning, but Mr. Bellow's remark was about Papuans.
Mr. Postman's previous book, "Technopoly," has got him put into the neo-Luddite category, along with anti-computer writers like Kirkpatrick Sale and Wendell Berry. Part of what he is up to in "The End of Education" is revising and extending his remarks on technology so as to make himself seem less automatically technophobic, and he does a good job of this. There is a good fit between the idea that people and machines are not natural allies and the idea that schools should teach thinking rather than specific skills. Mr. Postman's ideas about education are not the world's most practicable, but they're appealingly fresh: he wants to abolish textbooks and elevate anthropology and linguistics to a primary position in the curriculum. He still comes across as hostile to personal computers, though, usually assuming that computer courses would have to have a shop-class aspect rather than teaching just the kind of understanding of "discourse" (in computer languages) that he most values.
"The Manufactured Crisis" hasn't got a shred of Mike Rose's or Neil Postman's gentility and reasonableness. It represents liberals who have learned how to write the kind of book conservatives based in think tanks have been publishing successfully for a decade -- the all-out attack on the other side. Its first sentence is "This book was written in outrage." That isn't false advertising.
Mr. Berliner, a professor of psychology and education at Arizona State University, and Mr. Biddle, a professor of psychology and sociology at the University of Missouri, are out to refute the idea that the quality of American public schools is shamefully low. They spend most of their book picking apart a line of conservative (or, to use their term, "far right") education writing that began, roughly, with the publication of the Reagan Education Department's 1983 report, "A Nation at Risk." School spending has gone up so much, they say, mainly because of the enormous growth of special education, not because the money is being wasted by bureaucrats. S.A.T. scores are steady, not declining, and aren't a good measure of educational quality anyway, because the takers are a self-selected group. The story everybody has heard about a survey in the 1940's that showed the biggest problems in public high schools to be talking and gum chewing is simply apocryphal. Mr. Berliner and Mr. Biddle are at their best when they are spiritedly refuting the kinds of studies that are usually treated as gospel by a statistics-intimidated press.
The problem isn't just that the conservative critique of public education is wrong, Mr. Berliner and Mr. Biddle say; they go a step farther and accuse the conservatives' recent work of being intentionally wrong, "a deliberate disinformation campaign." In one place they accuse two of their betes noires, John Chubb and Terry Moe, of willfully distorting their statistical findings. These are grave charges, indicative of a rage at the conservatives that goes far beyond the stagy, amiable ideological warfare of the television talk shows.
 THE English-only movement, to Mr. Berliner and Mr. Biddle, "represents merely the old wines of racial hatred and bigotry in new bottles." When the Bush Administration won't release a report it commissioned because it contradicts administration dogma on education, it reminds Mr. Berliner and Mr. Biddle of more egregious Government cover-ups, which leads to the thought, "Somewhere down this road one finds totalitarianism and the Nazi death camps."
Some of the outline of an agreed-upon reality can be detected beneath the surface of "The Manufactured Crisis." Mr. Berliner and Mr. Biddle don't, for example, really argue that public schools are getting better, only that they aren't getting worse, which they see as an achievement in light of the problems that have been dumped in the schools' laps by "a society that is falling apart." They answer the conservative argument about the poor quality of schools of education with a non sequitur: "The vast majority of . . . teachers have completed undergraduate degrees." They rest their opposition to a longer school year on the questionable assumption that the curriculum wouldn't change. The feeling that emerges from "The Manufactured Crisis" is that Mr. Berliner and Mr. Biddle, with their mastery of the education literature, know perfectly well what the strengths and weaknesses of the public schools are, but feel they have to declare the critics of education to be 100 percent wrong. All teacher evaluation, competency testing and merit pay, any hint of an instrumental view of public education as preparing people for the work force, they entirely resist, because of mistrust of the motives of people who favor those ideas. The tone of "The Manufactured Crisis" demonstrates that there are, perhaps more than most people realize, angry men on the left too.
Education was supposed to be one of several issues on which we were witnessing the emergence of a new consensus, whose political embodiment was Bill Clinton. Mr. Clinton's education reform efforts in Arkansas are what made him a plausible Presidential candidate. These books demonstrate that on education the consensus may now be thin to the point of nonexistence; the two sides despise each other and disagree completely on the essential question of what the main purpose of public education is. It won't do, however, to assume that the only answer is to let public education fade away. As two of the books forcefully remind us, public schools are functional institutions to a much greater extent than many of us may think -- and they are still where practically everybody is educated. Allowing them to deteriorate is a luxury we don't have.

HEADLINE: Mexico City Isn't Artists' Sole Patron

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Nov. 8 Ocotlan Journal, on the artist Rodolfo Morales: The assertion that the Mexican Government overwhelming sponsors and controls the arts has been untrue for nearly a half-century.
When muralism and nationalist themes dominated Mexican art in the 1920's, 30's and 40's, various government bodies had widespread control over the all-important public artistic commissions. At mid-century, however, numerous political, economic and cultural factors led to the adoption among a new generation of painters and sculptors of more international styles of art. 
 Since then the Government has provided much-needed support to museums and to individual artists; nevertheless, an increasing number of commercial galleries and corporate and private donors have also played an important role.
Several leading artists in the last decade are known for the critical attitude in their work toward Mexico's culture and government. Works containing such often-biting criticism could not be displayed in major public institutions if the Government exerted the kind of control your article suggests.

HEADLINE: Latest Offer Is Spurned in Budget Talks

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The White House invited Republican Congressional leaders late today to meet on Monday to try to avert a pending Government shutdown, but only if the Republicans agreed to scrap their plan to raise Medicare premiums for the elderly.
But the Republicans said no deal, not until the President was willing to meet the leaders unconditionally and without Congressional Democrats. 
 The White House invitation, which was issued shortly after 5 P.M., "had no other intent than to try to spin the 6 o'clock news," said Tony Blankley, a spokesman for Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Asked if Mr. Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, would show up at the White House on Monday, Mr. Blankley said: "Absolutely not. Not until he says he wants to talk with the Speaker and the majority leader unconditionally and without his Democratic chaperones."
The spurned invitation followed a series of back-and-forth barbs on television programs today, with the Clinton Administration and Republican leaders stating their bottom-line demands for averting a shutdown of the Government early Tuesday, which now seems all but inevitable.
The Administration demanded that the Republicans drop what Democrats describe as an $11-a-month increase in Medicare premiums; the Republicans said President Clinton must agree to work toward a budget that would be balanced in seven years.
The Republicans say there is no Medicare premium increase contained in the continuing resolution -- a temporary budget to keep the Government functioning -- they plan to send to President Clinton on Monday. They say that the rate of Medicare Part B program costs that the elderly would pay would be the same as it is now. The dollar amount, however, would increase, from $46.10 a month now to $53.50, while under current law it would fall to $42.50.
As for the Administration, the President has suggested that he was willing to consider a seven-year balanced budget, but only if it preserved certain programs involving Medicare, the environment and education.
It was not clear whether or by how much either side was willing to budge after a weekend of digging in their heels in the increasingly vituperative spending standoff. Republicans believe that if they back off their promise to balance the budget in seven years, they face ruin at the polls; the President's advisers believe he must stand firm both to counter his image as a man of no convictions and to uphold those programs vital to his natural constituency.
The temporary spending bill, which the House passed on Friday and the Senate is expected to pass on Monday, includes items Democrats call "ideological bells and whistles," like the Medicare proposal, that the White House considers unacceptable. With public opinion polls on his side, President Clinton has vowed to veto the bill when he receives it sometime Monday, setting the stage for the Government shutdown.
"This is the Republicans against the American people," Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, told reporters today after a television appearance as he explained the President's resolve to veto any measure that, as he described it, raised Medicare premiums and cut aid to education and the environment.
Mr. Gingrich saw the matter differently, saying the dispute marked a clear-cut fork in the road. The Republicans, he said on NBC's "Meet the Press," were offering "a major choice for America, whether you want to go to a balanced budget, which we do, or whether you want to continue year after year of borrowing money from your children and, frankly, in the long run keeping interest rates higher and, ultimately, we think, breaking the country financially."
Mr. Gingrich said he would be willing to renegotiate everything else in the bill if Mr. Clinton would agree to the principle of reaching a balanced budget in seven years. "Everything would clearly be on the table at that point, as long as he agreed to seven years of an honest balanced budget that was real," he said.
If the President vetoes the measure and no last-minute agreement is reached on Monday, all Federal workers across the country would still report for work on Tuesday, but about 800,000 "nonessential" workers -- about 40 percent of the nonmilitary Government payroll -- would then be sent home. About half of them work in the Washington area.
The Administration said the mail would still be delivered, Amtrak trains would run, active servicemen and women would remain on duty, air traffic controllers would remain on the job, the Internal Revenue Service would still process tax forms and Social Security checks would be sent out. Welfare checks and food stamps would still be issued but no new applications would be processed.
Other functions classified as nonessential would cease. National parks, monuments and museums like the Smithsonian Institution would shut. Veterans' benefits would not be mailed. Much of the State Department work force would be furloughed, cutting off the issuance of passports unless citizens produce an airline ticket showing an imminent departure overseas.
One person planning a foreign trip is President Clinton, who has scheduled events later this week in Japan. Mr. Gingrich said today that if the budget crisis was not resolved, Mr. Clinton should cancel his trip. Mr. Panetta said the Administration's foreign policy would not be "held hostage" to the Republicans' implacable stance on the budget, but he suggested that the trip might be cut short.
Mr. Clinton had planned to leave on Thursday for a five-day visit that included an economic summit meeting in Osaka with 17 Asian and Pacific leaders to set up a free-trade zone and a state visit in Tokyo that included ceremonial talks with Emperor Akihito, working talks with the Prime Minister and a speech to United States and Japanese forces on the aircraft carrier Independence.
Asian leaders would almost certainly take a cancellation as a sign that the United States is not as committed to its relationships in the Pacific as Mr. Clinton has insisted. And Japanese leaders could be especially upset at the sign of a Presidential slight at a time when relations between Washington and Tokyo are already strained over several incidents, including the involvement of three American servicemen in the rape of a 12-year-old girl on Okinawa.
If Mr. Clinton goes, he can expect to be excoriated by Republican leaders. When Mr. Clinton headed for a golf outing on Friday, Mr. Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole quickly appeared at a news conference holding golf clubs and mocking the President for absenteeism in the middle of a crisis. Administration officials said they were waiting for the Republicans to act and that there was nothing for the President to do.
The blame game continued throughout the weekend, with both sides sounding more insistent on the rightness of their positions and saying it was up to the other side to end the stalemate.
When Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole said that they were shocked that the President essentially "hung up" on them on Saturday and that they stood willing to talk, Mr. Panetta said that there was "nothing to talk about" as long as the Republicans insisted on raising Medicare premiums.
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, issued a statement late today saying that the President was unwilling to increase Medicare premiums by $11 per month "on every Medicare beneficiary as a condition for keeping the Government running."
Senator Dole said President Clinton was "playing politics over a little Medicare provision that doesn't raise anyone's premium."

HEADLINE: Without Powell in Race, What's a Centrist to Do?

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Charles J. Kelly Jr., managing director of Citizens for Colin Powell and a veteran of the draft-Eisenhower campaign, has not quite figured out what to do with all the volunteers who enlisted in the Powell-for-President movement.
"We'll have to think about how not to lose the positive energy he brought into people's lives," he said. 
 Mr. Kelly's quandary underscores the predicament for Republican voters who call themselves moderates and for voters of various political beliefs who say they are most comfortable in the centrist camp. Now that General Powell has decided not to run in 1996, what's a die-hard Powell moderate supposed to do?
For the moment, the choices are familiar. Democrats as well as Republicans will try to capture the centrist energy generated by the possibility of General Powell's candidacy. But analysts across the political spectrum feel that neither party and no candidate is offering a true centrist program.
As quiet as they keep it, most Americans wear the moderate label. In a New York Times/CBS News Poll last month, 44 percent of Americans called themselves moderates compared with 16 percent who picked the liberal label and 34 percent who described themselves as conservative. In the same poll, General Powell was rated favorably by 43 percent of the public.
Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator and Democratic Presidential candidate in 1992, said Republicans and Democrats did not understand where a majority of Americans were. "There is a clear consensus and it's right in the middle -- socially liberal, fiscally conservative, pro-environment, pro-campaign reform," said Mr. Tsongas. "The problem is neither party fits the paradigm." So far this year, he said, he has tested this view in 25 states in speeches before diverse audiences. "You see people nodding everywhere you go," he said.
In the long term, some Republican politicians expect their front-runner, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, to win over moderates who were attracted to a Powell candidacy. But other politicians and observers believe that Republican moderates and centrists in general will be shopping for a candidate who subscribes to the middle-of-the-road views General Powell sketched out on his book tour this fall.
The New York Times/CBS News poll included 418 self-identified Republicans in the survey sample of 1,269 respondents. Of the 418 Republicans, 50 percent called themselves conservatives, 38 percent described themselves as moderates, 8 percent said they were liberals and 4 percent said they did not know what to call themselves.
Picking General Powell's political beneficiary is an easy call for some seasoned politicians. "Dole is the leader of the pack," said Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican and a Dole supporter. "Most will move that direction." Though she is not exactly sure where moderate energy will go in the Republican primaries, she said she expected it to "surface more in the general election."
Her moderate Republican colleague from Maine, Senator William S. Cohen, said he also expected Mr. Dole to inherit a lot of Powell supporters because Mr. Dole is the front-runner and "a classic conservative with Midwest roots and a good heart" who understands how to help people on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.
But because Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, are challenging Mr. Dole from the right, Mr. Cohen's view comes with a caveat. Mr. Dole's chances of inheriting Powell supporters, especially in the general election, "assumes that Dole doesn't go further off to the right to preempt Gramm and Buchanan," Mr. Cohen said.
The Cohen-Kassebaum take on the campaign after General Powell's decision last Wednesday is by no means the only scenario circulating these days.
Larry Sabato, a professor of political science at the University of Virginia, is not alone in his belief that many moderates in the Republican Party and lots of centrists in the electorate are now homeless.
"The centrists have turned off to Clinton and off to Dole for essentially the same reason," Professor Sabato said. "They view Clinton as a captive of the left and Dole as the captive of the right. So the question is: Where do they go?"
Mr. Sabato's 1996 election scenario follows two plot lines.
While General Powell's spectator position helps Mr. Dole in the short term, he said, moderate Republicans could help a Candidate X who could emerge from the second tier of Republican candidates to become Mr. Dole's principal challenger after the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. Under these circumstances, Mr. Sabato said, the Republican Presidential candidates with a chance to upset Mr. Dole and inherit centrist support are Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Steve Forbes, the scion of the Forbes publishing fortune.
"Candidate Y," Mr. Sabato said, "is the independent candidate who will inherit centrist support if the party nominees turn out to be Clinton and Dole." He said voters will not like President Clinton's triangulation strategy -- moving to the center and keeping himself at arm's length from Congressional Democrats and Republicans. Nor will they appreciate Mr. Dole's running to the right just to survive the Republican primaries and shifting to the center for the general election.
"At a certain point, voters know you don't mean it," Mr. Sabato said. "They realize that you are everywhere and therefore nowhere philosophically.
"If the choice is Clinton or Dole, you're going to hear a collective sigh audible from coast to coast: 'Is that all there is? Don't we have another choice?' And that is the genesis of Candidate Y."
In a CBS News Poll conducted after Mr. Powell announced his decision, 57 percent of Republican primary voters said they were satisfied with the choices they had, while 39 percent said they wished others would join the race.
Mr. Sabato's take on the 1996 Presidential race resonates with a number of politicians, including Mr. Tsongas and Thomas Kean, the former two-term Republican Governor of New Jersey. Mr. Kean, president of Drew University, said, "If the parties don't adjust themselves, the people will." He said that poll numbers show that General Powell's centrist views represent perhaps the majority of Republican voters and that many such voters agree with General Powell on hot-button issues as well. Republicans Mr. Kean talks to like and respect Mr. Dole but "rightly or wrongly" are not sure Mr. Dole can win a general election, he said.
Before General Powell declined to run, Mr. Tsongas said that Democrats and Republicans alike would approach him about the possibility of a Powell candidacy. He described them as Democratic Party activists who believe in fiscal responsibility and see their children's future at risk and as Republicans "upset at environmental trashing."

HEADLINE: SUNY's New Trustees to Press for More Campus Independence

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki does not yet control the governing board of the State University of New York. But his seven appointees have made their agenda clear: bringing a free-market approach to the government-run university system.
Beginning in June, Mr. Pataki took advantage of an unusual opportunity to name a large proportion of the SUNY board at once, because his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, had not filled some vacancies. With two more openings to be filled, the Governor could have a majority on the 16-member board by December. 
 His appointees so far come from traditional Republican backgrounds, including Edward Cox, a corporate lawyer married to Richard M. Nixon's daughter Patricia; Thomas F. Egan, an investment banker from Westchester County and former member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, and Erland E. Kailbourne, the chairman of Fleet Bank and the only Pataki appointee with an undergraduate degree from a SUNY campus.
Already, the new trustees are shaking up the university. In a set of proposals released last week, they advocated giving the campuses more freedom to do everything from setting their own tuitions to keeping any surpluses.
Candace de Russy, a new member who lives in Bronxville, N.Y., and has a doctorate in French, called the vision "radical campus autonomy."
The proposals are an attempt to set the board's agenda as it considers a major multiyear plan for the system of 64 campuses and 400,000 students. The trustees will discuss the plan and may vote on some of its elements at a meeting to be held this afternoon at the Sagamore Hotel in Bolton Landing, N.Y., north of Albany. The plan is to be released to the State Legislature on Dec. 1.
The first indication that new board members were flexing their muscles came last month, when, joined by two older members, they refused to approve a routine budget request to the Governor's Division of the Budget, saying they had not had enough time to consider the numbers.
"We had to know what we were approving," said Dr. Harvey Wachsman, a physician and lawyer who is one of the board's newest members. "It turned out that it was the first thing that showed that things were going to change."
Because of the vote against the budget last month, the trustees convened a finance committee that had been dormant for some years. And at the committee's meeting on Nov. 1, the new board members again pushed for change, suggesting that the university ask for much less money than it received this year.
It was a radical proposal. Normally, the State University system -- like other state agencies -- writes a budget wish list, which is then cut by the Governor or the Legislature. In the spring, after the state budget passes, university officials must scramble to fill in any gaps, by cutting spending or raising tuition, which they did last year, boosting its annual cost by $750 to $3,400 for four-year schools.
This year, the Division of the Budget imposed new restrictions on the request. It asked for, and SUNY administrators prepared, a request that used the 1995-96 numbers with 1.6 percent added for inflation, for a total of $1.5 billion.
But the new trustees argued for a new approach: be realistic.
"It is best for our students that we take a hold of our numbers and we tell the Division of the Budget that we're serious," said Mr. Cox. "We should say, 'This is what we want, this is all we want, no more.' We'd be making a statement by doing it."
He also said that since many trustees believed another tuition increase was inevitable, they should account for it now. But Arnold Gardner, the chairman of the finance committee, who was named to the board by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1980, said that if the trustees did not advocate on SUNY's behalf, no one would.
When the new trustees talk about "making the campuses responsive to their individual markets," Mr. Gardner said, "to me that means, 'We won't close any campuses, but we'll let the forces of nature close them if they can't survive.'
"It's a Darwinian approach," he said.
The budget argument and last week's proposals for revamping the university have set off alarms among some old members and Democrats in the Legislature. Frederic Salerno, a vice chairman of Nynex who has led the board since 1990, said that some new trustees did not understand how the board had done business in the past.
"There is the idea among some of the new members that the old trustees didn't do anything but rubber-stamp what SUNY central wanted," Mr. Salerno said, speaking of the central administration. "And, boy, it's an unfair observation."
In the State Legislature, where most of the major proposals for changing the university would have to be approved, Democrats are watching the trustees carefully.
In an interview, Edward C. Sullivan, the Manhattan Democrat who leads the Assembly's higher education committee, delivered a warning: "These proposals would in effect destroy the university as we know it and leave behind a collection of semiprivate colleges, some technical colleges and several closed campuses. It won't happen in one year, but the handwriting's on the wall."

HEADLINE: U.S. PLANS TACTICS TO AVOID DEFAULT WITHOUT DEBT BILL

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin indicated today that he was preparing to carry out a costly emergency plan to forestall a national default at midweek by juggling the Federal Government's books to pay off investors.
Mr. Rubin's comments came as Speaker Newt Gingrich forwarded to President Clinton a bill passed by Congress on Friday to raise the debt ceiling temporarily, a bill that is laden with restrictions on the Treasury's ability to use its small arsenal of weapons to delay default. Mr. Clinton has vowed to veto the measure, probably on Monday, because he views it as an effort by Congressional Republicans to corner him into signing their version of the Federal budget or being forced into default next month. 
 The positions of the Republican majority in Congress and the White House continued to harden today, with only a few glimmers of possible compromise. The Government seems almost certain to begin a partial shutdown early Tuesday morning after Republicans and the Administration spent the weekend dueling on talk shows and at news conferences and rejecting each other's preconditions for talks to work out their differences.
President Clinton invited Congressional leaders of both parties to meet him in the Oval Office on Monday, but only if Republicans drop an increase in Medicare premiums from a spending bill that would keep the Government functioning. Mr. Gingrich rejected that condition. [Page A20.]
Earlier, the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, had offered to drop the restrictions from the debt ceiling bill if Mr. Clinton would agree to the Republican timetable of seven years for a balanced budget. The White House rejected that suggestion, as it had a similar notion put forward by Mr. Gingrich the day before.
While a Government shutdown would have ramifications for Federal services around the country, Administration officials are increasingly focused on the risks of a default, which could reverberate in markets around the world. Mr. Rubin's emergency plan, which may kick into action as early as Monday, involves "disinvestments" from two huge Government-administered retirement funds and other steps that Mr. Rubin himself said several weeks ago "raise serious, unresolved legal and practical issues."
Today, he repeated those warnings, adding with resignation, "This is no way to run a country."
Mr. Rubin is clearly walking a fine line, hoping to scare Congress into action but to avoid shaking the markets. The signal that an imminent default could be forestalled seemed to be part of that balancing act.
Mr. Rubin's decision comes as he and the Republican majority have sketched out wildly different notions of how the bond and stock markets might react to the threat of default. The Treasury Secretary, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, has warned for weeks that Americans would pay for a default "for years and years to come," in the form of higher interest rates that borrowers would charge to the United States because of the increased risk that repayment would not come on time.
His position seemed bolstered late Friday when a leading credit-rating agency, Standard & Poor's, warned that the United States was in jeopardy of losing its triple-A credit rating because of investor concerns that debt payments would be held hostage to political arguments over the budget.
Even an increase of only a half a percentage point on the rates the Government pays could cost the United States $25 billion more a year and increase the cost for homeowners holding variable-rate mortgages. The Clinton Administration is betting that angry voters would blame the Republicans for those higher payments. A surge in interest rates would also clobber investors holding existing Treasury bonds, because the price of those securities would tumble.
A radically different view is held by Mr. Gingrich and endorsed by a number of leading Republican financiers. They insist Mr. Rubin is deliberately trying to scare the markets to bolster his political agenda. And they claim that the markets will yawn rather than panic, viewing a Federal default as just another part of Washington's giant game of fiscal chicken as Congress and the White House argue over budget priorities. If the result of that argument is a commitment to faster deficit reduction, they claim, interest rates will even be driven lower.
Senator Dole reiterated that view again today on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley" declaring that "the markets have changed" and that a balanced budget would mean that "interest rates are going to drop a couple of percentage points."
"This whole idea that there would be a permanent rise in interest rates is nonsense," Stanley Druckenmiller, managing director of the Soros Fund, said during a visit to Washington to brief Mr. Gingrich. "Today, we buy Argentinian and Brazilian debt," he said, naming two countries that were in desperate financial shape a decade ago. "The whole idea is absurd."
But the immediate question is whether Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Dole and their allies have the intestinal fortitude to test the theory in real life. If they are wrong and the markets go haywire in coming weeks, it could derail both their budget battle and Mr. Dole's run for the Presidency.
Analysts have used military analogies to underline the seriousness of this particular showdown. The most alarming hark back to the early days of the cold war, when many believed that the United States had the power to deliver a pre-emptive nuclear strike that would wipe out the former Soviet Union's missiles without devastating retaliation. But no political leader ever seriously considered testing it for fear of being wrong in such a winner-take-all calculation.
In the past decade, Congress has also briefly threatened to withhold approving an increase in the debt limit, but both market analysts and political experts say the issue has never reached the crisis point it is at today. The difference is that containing the nation's borrowing authority has been seized by the freshmen and sophomore classes in Congress as a symbol of their deficit-cutting fervor, even though the borrowing are simply a reflection of how much Congress has spent beyond the revenue the Government brings in. The White House points out that even the budget proposed by the Republicans would require a huge increase in the debt ceiling over the next seven years.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rubin is carefully talking around questions about what kind of financial tricks to avoid default he is keeping in his silos.
For example, Treasury officials have described one way they may try to get through the next few days without defaulting on roughly $25 billion in interest payments due Wednesday and $40 billion in principal on Treasury securities due on Thursday.
The first line of defense would be an order from Mr. Rubin to cease the nightly investment, in overnight securities, of the so-called "G-fund," a $21.5 billion retirement fund for Federal employees. That would allow the Treasury to issue securities in the same amount without crossing the current debt ceiling limit, $4.9 trillion.
That sum is not enough to meet the payments due on Wednesday. So Mr. Rubin would have to reach into other funds. His next step would probably be to disinvest holdings in the $350 billion Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Mr. Rubin would first have to declare, however, that he believes the debt limit crisis would last months or more before he could legally sell some of the fund's securities. Eventually, under current law, Congress would have to pay back to both funds the interest they lost because of this maneuver.
Then, there are nearly 180 other funds the Government oversees. But meddling with them could open the Administration to charges that it was violating its fiduciary responsibility to people whose savings are kept in those funds. That leaves aside the giant Social Security trust fund, which Mr. Rubin has vowed not to use "for any purpose other than to insure the payment of benefits to Social Security recipients."
"We will work our way through Nov. 15 but it will be through taking extraordinary actions," Mr. Rubin said today.
One of the big concerns is how foreign investors view the manipulations. In the year ended June 30, foreigners bought 65.6 percent of the new securities issued by the Treasury. If they decided that the risk of letting their money get caught up in a political dispute was too great they could precipitate a selloff.
So far that has not happened, partly because investors seem to feel that Mr. Rubin would not allow a default to occur under any circumstances. Unfortunately for Mr. Rubin, what's reassuring to the markets is also bad politics. By constantly moving back the date when a default is certain, he has opened himself up to criticism from Mr. Gingrich that he is manufacturing the crisis.
"Secretary Rubin has the authority to avoid default," Mr. Gingrich said, brushing past the point that the debt-limit bill he sent to the White House today would strip away that authority in the future. "In fact, he's now privately telling the President not to worry."

HEADLINE: Insecurity Rocks Mexico's Cradle-to-Coffin System

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 12

 BODY:
By late afternoon, when the coffins are gone and a cleaning man is vacuuming the carpets, Felipe Flores Duran finally has time to finish the paperwork. Of the three funeral parlors on his Mexico City intersection, the one run by the Mexican Social Security Institute is by far the biggest and classiest, with seven viewing rooms and a snack bar, and in this quiet moment, Mr. Flores Duran, its director, says that is how it should be.
"Having the best possible service for the dead is something that's really important to Mexicans," he said. 
 During the last half-century, Mexico's Social Security system has evolved into a lifelong security blanket that includes hospitals in which one out of every three Mexicans is born, and a chain of 16 funeral parlors that, like the one run by Mr. Flores Duran, offer $73 pine coffins and dignified $52 wakes.
The system also tends to the basic business of collecting and managing retirement pensions, but poor management and the fact that Mexicans are living longer have left Social Security so close to financial collapse that President Ernesto Zedillo has proposed a sweeping overhaul.
The President says business and labor support changes that will hand over some pensions to private managers and make the system more efficient. A new law was introduced on Thursday. But for many of the 37 million Mexicans currently enrolled, the system and its branch services are an untouchable birthright.
If American politicians face a storm of protest whenever they suggest changing Social Security in the United States, imagine what awaits Mr. Zedillo as he takes on an institution that includes not only the Mexican equivalent of Social Security, but also Medicare, Medicaid, the National Endowment for the Arts and even Club Med and Wal-Mart.
"I'm afraid of the changes," said Procopio Ramirez, 64, a construction worker from Mexico City who is about to retire and is not sure he will receive the pension he thinks he qualifies for. "It seems like they might privatize Social Security and if they do that, the medical help won't be the same and the pensions won't be as much."
Felipe Arias Bertrand, who spent most of his life working for the Social Security agency, is now a leader in a movement to block the proposed changes, which he says go too far.
"We recognize that the system needs a profound revision," he said, "but in order to remake it, what the Government now proposes will destroy the system."
Besides reflecting the dreams and desires of millions of Mexicans, the Social Security system today also underscores some of the profound changes that have taken place in the 52 years since it was created.
In 1950 the average life expectancy of Mexicans was 49.6 years, which meant that few who contributed to the system lived long enough to collect. By 1993, an improved standard of living and better medical care largely provided by the agency's 1,764 hospitals and clinics had helped raise life expectancy to 70.5. The number of insured workers and their families who rely on the Social Security pensions has come close to exceeding the contributions being made by active workers.
An analysis by the agency in March estimated that by the year 2002, the system will be bankrupt. This is a problem shared by social security systems in the United States and Europe. But in Mexico, it is a recent phenomenon.
During the years when contributions exceeded payouts, the Mexican agency was flush with money and decided to expand into health care and the other diverse components that now are part of the system. As demographics changed, the system raided the pension funds to support the hospitals and other services.
The medical part is also under stress. In 1950, the leading causes of death were diarrhea and pneumonia, which typically struck the young. Today, with an older population, the leading causes are heart disease and cancer, which can require long and expensive hospitalization.
Mr. Zedillo sees Social Security reform as an essential step toward recovering from the economic crisis that followed the devaluation of the peso in December. By allowing workers to open individual retirement accounts that would be professionally managed and offer higher interest rates than the current system, Mr. Zedillo expects to be able to increase Mexico's low rate of domestic savings. More savings would be used to finance investments.
To improve health care, Mr. Zedillo wants to broaden the base of those covered by Social Security. Now only salaried workers and their families can join the system, leaving millions of Mexicans without access to the hospitals.
Contributing workers and their families are entitled to medical care at most of the nation's hospitals and clinics and to a minimum pension of $2 dollars a day after age 65 or in case of a disability. Access to the stores, day-care centers, vacation centers and funeral parlors run by Social Security is available to all Mexicans.
Contributions to Social Security, made by workers, employers and the Government, total more than 25 percent of salary, and evasion is widespread. For a clerical worker who makes about $185 a month, the total social security tax is around $45 a month, of which the worker pays about $11.
Proposed changes would lower costs and extend coverage to self-employed workers and people in the huge informal economy.
The fate of the ancillary programs that the agency has acquired during the last five decades is uncertain. The in-house analysis done in March made it clear that they are a huge drain on the system.
About the only service that actually turned a profit last year were the funeral parlors. Perhaps that is why Mr. Flores Duran, the Mexico City director, does not worry about the coming changes. "It's a fact that the Mexican system will undergo a great change," Mr. Flores Duran said, "but most of the changes will have to do with living people. I don't think they'll do anything to the funeral service."

HEADLINE: Professor Talked of Understanding But Now Reveals Ties to Terrorists

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla.

 BODY:
When the radical organization Islamic Jihad selected a new leader late last month, its choice struck people at the University of South Florida like a sucker punch, a painful blow out of the blue.
News reports from Syria showed a face of jaw-dropping familiarity: the face of a bespectacled man known on campus as Ramadan Abdullah, an adjunct professor who taught Middle Eastern politics until he left last spring. Now identified by his full name, Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, he vowed a "hard war" against Israel, which he accused of killing Islamic Jihad's founder, Fathi Shiqaqi, on Oct. 26 in Malta. 
 Dr. Shallah applauded the assassination on Nov. 4 of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel by an Israeli law student.
With his violent words, Dr. Shallah exploded the image he had carefully cultivated for four years as a soft-spoken scholar who preached understanding and eschewed militant rhetoric, a genial man who won student plaudits and invitations to lunch with professors. When Dr. Shallah's wife, Maha, gave birth to a daughter last February, faculty members sent cards.
Now, people at the state-run university are wrestling with the realization that they had unwittingly played host to the person who became the leader of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed organization whose suicide bombers have killed Israeli soldiers, civilians and an American college student.
"We couldn't be more surprised," said Mark T. Orr, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel who directs the university's international studies center. "There was never any indication that he had any sympathy with acts of terror for anyone's cause."
Paul Eckelkamp, a former Navy intelligence specialist who was one of Dr. Shallah's students, voiced a similar view. "He didn't seem like a radical to me," said Mr. Eckelkamp, a 25-year-old junior. "He seemed like a very well-educated man who was concerned about how Islam was viewed around the world."
Up to a point, that would describe Dr. Shallah, who was born 37 years ago in the Gaza Strip, then under Egyptian administration.
His resume lists impressive distinctions: a 1990 doctoral degree in Islamic and Middle Eastern studies from the University of Durham in England, authorship of scholarly articles on Middle Eastern economics and fluency in English, Arabic and Hebrew, with reading ability in Persian.
He also taught economics at the Islamic University of Gaza from 1982 to 1986 -- just when Islamic Jihad was being formed in the area by young intellectuals who admired Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the spiritual leader of Iran. Dr. Shallah has recently been reported to have been among its earliest leaders.
When he arrived in Tampa in the summer of 1991, apparently carrying an Egyptian passport, Dr. Shallah came at an opportune time to slip into an academic role.
A year earlier, several Palestinian scholars in Tampa had founded the World and Islam Studies Enterprise, a small research institute in a minimall here.
One of the institute's founders was Khalil Shiqaqi, a visiting scholar at the University of South Florida and a brother of Islamic Jihad founder Fathi Shiqaqi. Khalil Shiqaqi has been considered a political moderate, without connections to Islamic Jihad. He now teaches in Nablus, on the West Bank.
Another institute founder was Sami al-Arian, 37, a Kuwaiti-born Palestinian who is a tenured professor of engineering at the University of South Florida. Dr. Arian said Dr. Shallah had offered to work without pay for the institute. "He was one of the best things you can ever imagine, someone who wants to give his time and volunteer," said Dr. Arian, who added that he had never suspected him of being anything other than a scholar. "It's unbelievable to me."
Dr. Shallah became the institute's director of administration, with an office, a computer and a fax machine. He published heavily footnoted articles on economics in the institute's quarterly, an Arabic-language journal. And he gained access through his position to the university.
About the time he arrived, the institute came to the attention of the university's Committee for Middle Eastern Studies. Formed in 1991, the committee's mission included the possibility of setting up a Middle East center, according to its guidelines.
In these circumstances, the World and Islam Studies Enterprise "was a godsend," said Arthur J. Lowrie, an adjunct professor who retired from the United States Foreign Service. Its scholars, devout Muslims knowledgeable about Middle Eastern affairs, offered "the kind of expertise it would be rare to find among American academics," he said.
In March 1992, university officials signed an agreement with the institute to hold conferences and exchange faculty members "by appointing them to temporary teaching or research positions." Dr. Shallah signed on the institute's behalf.
At a conference, Dr. Shallah introduced a speaker with these words: "We believe cooperation and intellectual dialogue help Americans and Muslims reach common grounds of understanding."
Last May, the agreement became controversial, after The Tampa Tribune charged that the institute had a connection, mainly through Dr. Arian, to the Islamic Committee for Palestine, a local group that had sponsored conferences supporting the intifada, the 1988-93 Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza. The Tribune suggested that the committee had ties to Islamic Jihad and Hamas, another militant group. Dr. Arian vigorously denied any link to those organizations, as did the institute.
Nevertheless, the university, citing procedural errors, suspended its agreement with the World and Islam Studies Enterprise in June.
That month, Dr. Shallah left the United States, telling friends he needed to tend to his gravely ill father in Gaza. Mr. Lowrie and Dr. Arian said they had heard nothing from him after that but had thought he had a job offer in Europe.
But Alaa Saftawi, a senior member of Islamic Jihad, told The Associated Press recently that Dr. Shallah had shelved his academic career last summer to work full time for Islamic Jihad. News of Dr. Shallah's selection to head the organization and his connection to the university was reported in the Nov. 3 issue of The Forward, the Jewish weekly published in New York.
In the semester before he left, Dr. Shallah taught Middle East history and politics at the university, just as he had during the spring semester of 1994. He also signed a loyalty oath, swearing that he supported the United States Constitution.
"Like all universities, we're vulnerable," said President Betty Castor, a former Florida Commissioner of Education. "Here was someone who had credentials which were examined at the departmental level. People around here feel a little betrayed right now."
A university spokesman, Todd Simmons, said students' written evaluations of Dr. Shallah's courses had praised his teaching.
But some students now recall oddities in Dr. Shallah's methods. "I never remember him discussing Israel," Mr. Eckelkamp said. "He would a lot of the time discuss 'the Palestine area.' "
Similar complaints reached Daniel J. Berman, director of the campus chapter of the Hillel Foundation. That worried him, he said, because "a lot of students are coming here and getting their first exposure to Middle East politics from the professors."
Still, Dr. Shallah did little else to call attention to himself. No one remembers him speaking out in favor of any militant group. Off campus, he lived modestly, renting a two-bedroom apartment on a quiet residential street. Colleagues respected his privacy. He received only $2,300 for each of his courses, but no one inquired too closely about how he supported himself.
Now the question most often heard is why a top figure in a terrorist organization spent four years in central Florida. "Why Tampa?" Dr. Orr asked.
One professor, Abdelwahab Hechiche, who teaches government and international affairs, offered a possible answer. "Everywhere in America, people who work hard can be in touch with the whole world," he said. "See, many people visit here from Europe and the Middle East."
"At the same time, Tampa is not Washington, D.C.; it is not New York," said Dr. Hechiche, who was born in Tunisia. "This is an atmosphere for anonymity."
That would fit a scenario described by Yehudit Barsky, a senior research analyst with the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. Around 1988, she said, organizations like Islamic Jihad began moving leaders not directly involved in terrorism abroad.
These men living in the West had access to fax machines and personal computers, enabling them to communicate with one another and publish work for distribution in the Middle East, she said, adding that it paid to keep a low profile.
That still leaves a question in the mind of Mr. Lowrie, who befriended Dr. Shallah. Mr. Lowrie is concerned that Muslims are often portrayed harshly in the United States, with the vast majority of peaceful believers smeared with the broad brush of violence caused by a few, and Dr. Shallah had said that he shared this concern.
"What about the damage he's done to understanding Islam, getting rid of the stereotypical thing?" Mr. Lowrie said. "Instead, his actions have played into the hands of his most direct enemies."

HEADLINE: In Utah, a Pitched Battle Over Public Lands

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: ESCALANTE, Utah

 BODY:
One of the last blank spots left on the map of the mainland United States is a big swath of sandstone skyscrapers, rust-colored canyons and cake layers of earthly turmoil.
The cartographers of this region must have been in a perpetual funk, trying to attach names like Devil's Backbone, Deadman Ridge and Carcass Canyon to the luminous landscape of southern Utah. But what looked useless and forlorn to Mormon pioneers of the 19th century is shaping up, in the last years of the 20th century, as a treasure at the center of the biggest land fight now before Congress. 
 John Ford tried to capture this region in his western movies, and Ansel Adams attempted to do the same thing with a still camera. What Congress is poised to do now is pass a bill that will essentially zone 22 million acres of public land here in such a way as to determine how nature and commerce will interact for decades to come.
A land of dinosaur tracks and ancient Anasazi ruins, most of the red rock canyon country of southern Utah is run by the Federal Bureau of Land Management. And most of it is wild and open country, with very little development. The bill before Congress, sponsored by the Utah Congressional delegation, would set aside 1.8 million acres as protected wilderness but allow mining, road building and other industrial developments in the remaining 20 million acres of bureau land. A Dutch-owned company, Andalex Resources, is awaiting approval to construct a huge coal-mining operation in the heart of this largely roadless area.
The bill has been approved by a House subcommittee and is awaiting similar action in the Senate. A much broader bill that would set aside 5.7 million acres for protection is being proposed by a coalition of environmental groups and members of Congress.
But the conflict in Utah is more than just the biggest single public land issue before Congress this year. The delegation-sponsored bill would set a precedent, opponents say, altering the intent of the 1964 Wilderness Act. Opponents say it would allow roads, reservoirs and power lines even inside protected wilderness, areas that are supposed to be places "where man himself is but a visitor," according to the law.
Also, the bill would take 18 million acres of Federal land out of consideration for any future wilderness designation, directing the Bureau of Land Management to manage it for miners, ranchers, timber companies and other users.
Wilderness used to be an issue of less conflict. Scientists, photographers and outdoor lovers of both parties found open doors in Washington when lobbying for wild land. The late Western writer Wallace Stegner appealed to President John F. Kennedy for the first of the nation's wilderness bills by writing that, "Something will have gone out of us as a people if we ever let the remaining wilderness areas be destroyed."
Since then, about 39 million acres outside of Alaska have been preserved, areas where hunting, fishing and hiking are allowed, but activities that would leave lasting scars are not. The people who ride snowmobiles or motorcycles, and who prospect for minerals, say they have been shut out.
This year the tables have turned, and it is wilderness advocates who are being shunned -- at least in Washington. A onetime taxidermist, Representative Don Young of Alaska, a Republican, is trying to weaken the Endangered Species Act, and a former pesticide salesman, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, has been trying to reduce the enforcement power of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Both men, who are in leadership positions in the House, chafe at being characterized as despoilers, and say what they are trying to do is restore balance. Also, they say too much public land is already under the restrictive rule of the Federal Government, especially in the West.
When Terry Tempest Williams, the Utah nature essayist who traces her Mormon roots to 1847, went to testify before the parks and public lands subcommittee this year on behalf of the broader bill, Representative James V. Hansen, the Utah Republican who is the panel's chairman, left the room. At a later public hearing in Utah, he told Ms. Williams that he could not understand what she was talking about. She is the naturalist in residence at the Utah Natural History Museum.
Out of power for decades, Western Republicans who now control the chief public land committees are in a rush to overturn years of conservation law. They have proposed oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, and are setting up a commission to close or sell off some national parks.
"It's like having Dracula in charge of the blood bank," said Ken Rait of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, one of 90 groups pushing for the broader bill.
"There is a vindictiveness, a kind of mean-spirited sense of getting even with environmentalists," said Robert Redford, the actor and part-time Utah resident who has been fighting Western land battles for nearly 30 years.
The Utah wilderness has become a flashpoint, because it is the first time that Congress has tried to tackle the issue of protecting land on the nearly 300 million acres run by the B.L.M. Most wilderness areas are on Forest Service land or in national parks.
"People don't come to Utah for wilderness," Mr. Hansen said. He said that he loved the outdoors as much as any native Westerner, but that the lands that environmental groups wanted to protect did not really qualify as true wilderness.
"They sure don't come here to look at coal mines and clear-cut logging," said Mr. Redford, whose portrayal of the Sundance Kid as a foil to Paul Newman's Butch Cassidy in the popular movie helped spawn a multimillion dollar spinoff of tours along the old outlaws' trail.
Of late, people have been coming to Utah's wild lands in record numbers. More than five million people visited southern Utah in the last year, a threefold increase over a decade. They were drawn to five national parks, Bryce Canyon and Zion among them, and to the countless slickrock domes, empty canyons and broad vistas in the desert air.
"The old-timers who have been here forever can't believe what's going on," said Jack Pollock, a maintenance worker in Boulder, a little ranching town that sits at 6,600 feet. "People used to be afraid to come here because they thought it was nothing but rattlesnakes and Mormons."
Boulder was one of the last towns in the mainland United States to gain automobile access. It was depressed, as was much of this broad region known as the Colorado Plateau, after uranium miners abandoned the area in the 1950's. Now, sportsmen, mountain bikers and retirees flock here, a place where it is said you can look for nearly a hundred miles in most directions at night and not see a light generated by a human source.
"I get letters every day from people in my district who say, 'Jim, we need more wilderness,' " Mr. Hansen said. "I say if you can find it, fine. But there is not much true wilderness on this B.L.M. land."
Not true, said Jim Baca, who was director of the Bureau of Land Management in the first two years of the Clinton Administration.
"This particular crew in Congress is hateful, in a lot of respects, and they are listening to the fringe groups now making a lot of noise," he said. "They need to be reminded that the names of every American are on the deeds to those lands."
When Mr. Hansen and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Utah's powerful senior senator, toured their home state last summer, they found there was far more support for wilderness than they had imagined. But Mr. Hatch still favors a small wilderness bill, saying there are oil, coal and mineral deposits on public land that are too rich to be go undeveloped.
Many of the new businesses that rely on unspoiled land say their voices are not being heard on the wilderness issue. Of the 22,000 public comments received over the last year, more than 70 percent of those were in favor of a large wilderness area -- a percentage that roughly matches polls taken by Salt Lake City news organizations.
By contrast, mining, logging and grazing interests have found open doors, after years of saying they were not listened to by environment-friendly Congressional committees.
"This coal mine is going to bring several hundred crucial jobs to our area," said Roger Carter, president of the southwest Utah chapter of People for the West, a prodevelopment group financed by mining, timber and ranching interests.
He was referring to the mine planned by Andalex Resources. The company envisions tapping into one of the richest coal veins in the United States, here in the Kaiparowits Plateau area, and then trucking the ore 240 miles to a railhead for eventual shipment to Asia. It would cause only minimal environmental damage, Mr. Carter said.
"For the 20 or 30 people who actually visit the plateau this far in, it could be a problem, but not for everyone else," he said.
But the emptiness, Ms. Williams noted, is precisely what gives southern Utah value beyond mere economic reasons. "If you knew wilderness in the way that you know love, you would be unwilling to let it go," she said at a recent hearing in Utah. "We are talking about the body of the beloved, not real estate."

HEADLINE: In America;
Welfare Stampede

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
"Our children and our country cannot afford another four years of neglect from Washington," said Bill Clinton, in the campaign book he put together in 1992 with Al Gore. "The next generation of young people should not be America's first to grow up with less hope than their parents. It's time to act to help our children."
That last sentence was the important one. I misunderstood it when I first read it on page 47 of the amusingly titled book "Putting People First." I did not understand at the time that the future President's idea of helping children was to support legislation that would push another 1.2 million of them into poverty. 
 The Republicans who crafted the cruel welfare "reform" legislation that is now in the hands of Congressional conferees deserve the obloquy of decent and compassionate Americans. But it should not be forgotten that these Republicans passed quickly and joyfully through a conceptual door that was opened by Mr. Clinton, who promised repeatedly in his campaign to "end welfare as we know it."
It was his biggest applause line. And as he delivered it with a finesse that could be envied by the most skilled demagogue, Mr. Clinton had to know that the screaming, whistling, foot-stomping audiences were cheering something quite different from the detailed plan that Mr. Clinton's aides were handing out to more thoughtful observers.
Those campaign audiences were cheering what they thought they were hearing -- that Mr. Clinton planned to cut off welfare benefits to them. They did not realize that the detailed plan, which provided for education, job training, job placement, even job creation, would cost much, much more than welfare as we knew it. Had they known, they would have booed.
To watch Mr. Clinton do his welfare dance is to understand why his detractors call him Slick Willie.
In any event, the Republicans saw the door marked "End Welfare As We Know It" and they charged through it, not even thinking about the resources that were supposed to be provided to keep poor people from being left in the lurch. The Republicans are being followed by huge numbers of Congressional Democrats, who recognize a political stampede when they see one, and even by Mr. Clinton, who is now looking furtively around for a safe way to slip through the door himself.
If he does, which is to say, if he signs any version of the welfare legislation that is being hashed around in conference, it will be a betrayal and a disgrace that will leave Mr. Clinton on the wrong side of history. He will have done more harm to children with one stroke of his pen than Presidents Reagan and Bush combined.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan stated the matter clearly: "For the first time since it was enacted in 1935, we are about to repeal a core provision of the Social Security Act -- Aid to Families With Dependent Children."
The Senator described this as "an obscene act of social regression." He said it "visits upon children the wrath of an electorate disillusioned with government and lost to principle."
A report prepared for Congress by the Office of Management and Budget estimates that the welfare bill passed by the Senate could push as many as 1.2 million children into poverty, and the House bill as many as 2.1 million. Those estimates are conservative.
As Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, noted: "The report assumes no recession in the next decade, which is unprecedented. It assumes that all states have time limits no shorter than five years, although a number of states have already proposed two-year time limits."
And, she said, "it assumes 100 percent maintenance of effort" by the states, even though on Friday House and Senate conferees agreed that states would only have to maintain at 75 percent of last year's level.
The White House is threatening to veto legislation that is moving in conference toward the House version. But Mr. Clinton's press secretary has said the President "may have to accept" a bill that is close to the Senate version.
Well, of course, he doesn't have to. And he wouldn't if he believed, as James Agee did, that "in every child who is born, under no matter what circumstances, and of no matter what parents, the potentiality of the human race is born again."

HEADLINE: DANCE REVIEW;
From the Graham Repertory, a Study in Contrasts

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF 

 BODY:
Four and a half years after its founder's death, the Martha Graham Dance Company continues superbly to preserve the Graham repertory. The proof was on hand again Friday night, when the company presented two strikingly different Graham works: the lyric 1949 "Diversion of Angels" and the recently revived excerpts from a 1936 social-protest piece, "Chronicle."
Every audience, nonetheless, demands what the impresario Sol Hurok used to call "novelties." The Graham troupe's three-day season at City Center, which closed Saturday night, was used mainly to give New Yorkers a view of the world premiere that Robert Wilson, as guest choreographer, created for the company earlier at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 
 Reviewed in Washington, the Wilson piece, "Snow on the Mesa," is subtitled "Portrait of Martha." It was placed in a new context at City Center, and not always to its advantage. At the Kennedy Center, "Mesa" was preceded by the 1944 Graham classic "Appalachian Spring," whose distilled dramatic image of a pioneer roof-raising has a visible if indirect link to Mr. Wilson's theater of images.
But "Diversion" and "Chronicle" are essays in emotion conveyed entirely through abstract movement, and their power sets up an anticipation of kinetic expression that Mr. Wilson's pictorial approach to movement was not intended to resemble.
Surprisingly, an essentially green cast in "Diversion" went beyond expectation in an especially well-defined performance of Graham's ode to love in its many aspects.
Fang-Yi Sheu, a newcomer, was the woman in red, emblematic of passion whose sharp contractions and swiftness were so striking. Miki Orihara, whose form is always superb, and the especially promising Marc Mann rightly elicited gasps with their playful and energized "yellow" duet. Peter London and Katherine Crockett (serene as the woman in white) had a majesty in the architectonic shapes of their own duet and epitomized a deeper love.
It was the articulate vitality of the entire cast that made this performance so dazzling. The ensemble included Martin Lofsnes, Gary Galbraith, Elizabeth Auclair, Sandra Kaufmann, Alessandra Prosperi and Amanda Thomas. Norman Dello Joio's music was heard on tape.
Powerful is the word for "Sketches From Chronicle," revived for the "Radical Graham" season last year at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In 1936, Graham saw a world in turmoil and recalled World War I. The first segment is, in fact, titled "Specter 1914" and turns a lamenting woman reclining on a platform into a red-shrouded specter of death. Terese Capucilli's mesmerizing performance is anything but basic; it expands Graham's fabled economy of movement into a poetic dimension.
"Drums-Red Shroud-Lament," this segment's subtitle, echoes the spare style of music and dance in the 1930's that Graham used to contemporary effect in the section "Steps in the Street." Rika Okamoto was the woman absorbed into the patterns of the ensemble, danced to Wallingford Riegger's music. The subtitles of that section ("Devastation-Homelessness-Exile") are superseded by "Prelude to Action," which speaks of "Unity-Pledge to the Future." Here, a larger female group is exhorted by Ms. Capucilli, no longer in white as she was last year but in a suitably flaming red dress.
An audience new to Graham would have to realize that "Chronicle," a 1930's period piece, and "Diversion of Angels" present only a limited view of Graham's range. It is a range hinted at by "Snow on the Mesa." In one scene, "Very Young: Kachina Clowns," Mr. Wilson lets loose a swarm of grotesque dancers who cavort to the sound of breaking glass by Brad Fields. They are both tragic and comic.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE TREASURY;
Delicate Juggling Act For U.S. Credit Rating

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
So how long can Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin keep up his juggling act?
The answer to that question is at the heart of the Clinton Administration's strategy of holding off the Republican-dominated Congress without actually ruining the impeccable credit rating the country has had since 1789. Every few days for the past month, Mr. Rubin has proclaimed that default is imminent, unless he takes extraordinary, and costly, action. And every few days, showing just a few cards at a time, he has come up with a strategy that keeps the United States afloat, and the markets and Congress guessing. 
 Today, he announced the outline of a strategy that would allow the Treasury to pay out $102 billion to investors on Wednesday and Thursday, not a bad trick for a country that technically can no longer borrow enough to buy a used car.
To pull it off, he is juggling accounts in two huge retirement funds, liquidating their investments so that the Government has more room to borrow without crossing its $4.9 trillion debt ceiling. He is using those funds because, under legislation passed a decade ago, Congress has committed the country to repaying any interest the two funds lose because of financial footwork of this kind.
But if this standoff lasts for several more weeks or months, Mr. Rubin will find himself running into dubious legal ground and shaky political territory. And there is always the lurking possibility that the bond markets, which rose today on the news that default has again been deferred, will suddenly decide that Mr. Rubin has run out of maneuvering room.
"You are watching a very intricate game of poker, with Gingrich and the markets occupying the other seats at the table," one of the Administration's senior economic officials said the other day. "And the hand that beats one doesn't necessarily beat the other."
So for Mr. Rubin, the challenge is clear. He must constantly proclaim that disaster is nigh, to keep the political pressure on Congress. And he must constantly keep that disaster a week or so away, to give his boss some room to operate without fear of a backlash for messing with retirement funds entrusted to the Government.
The elements of that strategy are dribbling out piece by piece, as Mr. Rubin shows just enough of his hand to keep the markets calm. By early Wednesday morning, assuming that no last-minute deal is struck with Congress, he will stop investing the Federal Employees Retirement System's fund in Government bonds. That will allow him to borrow up to $21.5 billion. That has been done before, and it is politically risk-free, because Congress passed legislation in 1985 to refund any lost interest to the fund. Unfortunately for Mr. Rubin, that money will barely get him through the end of the day on Wednesday.
After that, the Treasury Secretary dips into new territory. The same 1985 legislation allows him to declare a fiscal emergency, giving him the right to disinvest the $350 billion Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. No one has tried it before, and there are restrictions: the amount he can withdraw depends on how long he estimates the emergency -- the possibility of imminent default -- will continue. "The law does not say when, how, or in what amounts" the Secretary can liquidate the funds, creating more room to borrow, a senior Administration official dealing with the issue said today.
As a result, the Treasury is taking the position that the Secretary has broad discretion. Exactly how broad? Mr. Rubin's aides will not say.
They are being evasive for several reasons. The first is that Mr. Rubin's legal authority will almost certainly be challenged. Republicans, seeking to tie his hands in the bigger budget battle, are already encouraging suits charging that Mr. Rubin is violating his fiduciary responsibility to the Federal employees whose retirement money is stashed in the giant fund.
"The people on behalf of whom the trust fund is held may take an interest," the House majority leader, Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, said today.
Mr. Rubin is likely to respond that while he must protect the retirement fund, he also has a fiduciary responsibility to keep the United States out of default.
But as time goes on, Mr. Rubin will begin to run out of both political and legal room. There are more than 160 other trust funds, but none of the others are protected by legislation insuring that any interest lost in the name of preventing default would eventually be paid back to those funds. As a result, President Clinton will be loathe to touch that money, knowing it would create an outcry.
Even more complicated is the question of how to keep the markets happy. So far, investors have shrugged the whole situation off as inside-the-Beltway maneuvering. As long as Mr. Rubin keeps sending reassuring signals that he can meet the next payment, that view is unlikely to change.
But the minute the markets get nervous, Mr. Rubin and his sparring partner, Speaker Newt Gingrich, may quickly run out of options. Neither wants to be blamed for causing a market run, which could be felt by ordinary investors, holders of variable-rate mortgages and allies who hold hundreds of billions of dollars in Treasury securities.
In private, Mr. Rubin's aides seem most worried about foreign investors. The fear is that those investors will simply not want to take the risk of getting involved in the crossfire between Congress and the White House. They could voice their protest with their checkbooks, parking their national reserves in other currencies -- German marks, Japanese yen or the currency of a country that does not allow domestic politics to cast a pall on its creditworthiness.
The reaction of foreign investors, in the end, could be the measure of how much the debt-limit argument has affected American power in an age in which markets speak as loudly as military might.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE MARKETS;
Debt Bill Veto Brings Relief As Federal Default Is Avoided

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
President Clinton's veto of legislation to raise the Federal debt ceiling was greeted yesterday with relief by investors and financial markets.
Although the bill Mr. Clinton vetoed would have temporarily increased the Government's borrowing authority, it would also have taken away the Treasury's flexibility to avoid default by juggling funds. If Mr. Clinton had signed the bill, once the temporary increase expired, the threat of default would have been more intense than it is now. 
 Traders and investors have known for days that by tapping into various Government trust funds it administers, the Treasury could remain current on interest payments without increasing the borrowing authority.
But uncertainty remained about the Treasury's ability to tap into those funds until Mr. Clinton rejected the Republican bills yesterday. Now the Treasury can make payments due tomorrow and on Nov. 30. With this flexibility, Wall Street analysts predict that the Government is likely to avoid default without raising the debt ceiling through the middle of next month, at least. But at some point, the Treasury will face default unless the debt ceiling is raised.
In response to the veto, traders and investors bid up the price of outstanding securities yesterday, and pushed the yield on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction of prices, down to 6.27 percent from 6.33 percent on Friday. The rally followed two successive days of falling prices and rising interest rates at the end of last week, when talk about default reached its zenith.
Playing politics with the debt ceiling is an old game, but the current impasse between Congress and the White House is so deep-seated that Wall Street is focusing on the potential of a default as never before.
Because the struggle is widely viewed as having more to do with political differences than with the economic ability of the United States Government to honor its debts, some analysts and money managers believe that the effects of a default would last only as long as the crisis itself. And those effects would be more than offset, these people argue, by the benefits of an agreement to balance the Federal budget by 2002.
But others are not so certain. James R. Capra, president of Capra Asset Management, a money management firm in Rye, N.Y., said yesterday that failure to veto the bills "would have increased the probability of default." He added, "And I am not sure I would want to endure three or four days of half-point increases in interest rates."
A default, even if temporary, would in all likelihood force a reassessment at financial institutions worldwide of the wisdom of holding debt issued by the United States.
"If you default for five seconds, the next time you can default for five days," said William Gross, a managing director at the Pacific Investment Management Company, a money management firm based in Newport Beach, Calif., with $70 billion in debt securities issued by the United States and other sovereign governments in its portfolio.
With yesterday's veto, Mr. Gross said, the "chances of default are about as close to zero as you can get for the next several months." He continued, "But if you told me the odds were higher than that, there is no doubt I would be selling securities, because it would have a disastrous effect on capital markets in the United States for decades to come."
While the danger of default has receded for now, money managers could get nervous again if the Treasury's ability to maneuver to avoid a default is challenged in court.
"If there is a restraining order placed on the Treasury, the market would get more worried," Mr. Capra said.
At the least, a default would likely force big buyers of Treasuries and other Government securities, like mutual funds, to question the wisdom of future investment in those securities.
Under the terms of the Investment Company Act of 1940, after default, directors at mutual fund companies would have to dispose of holdings of Government debt unless such sales were seen as not being in the best interests of the fund.
As of the end of September, figures from the Investment Company Institute show that mutual funds held nearly $375 billion worth of Government securities that potentially would be effected by a default.
In addition to forcing a review of current holdings, a default would preclude the purchase of any new debt securities by some of the biggest mutual fund companies.

HEADLINE: With 6 Boys and a Football, Tiny Texas Towns Stay Alive

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: ACKERLY, Tex., Nov. 11

 BODY:
This cotton-farming town on the Texas prairie has lost three of its four cafes, all three gas stations, both pharmacies, both barber shops, the three-story Coleman Hotel and its picture show. It has lost more than two-thirds of its peak population and about half its school football team.
But only half. 
 All of which goes to explain why nearly the entire town of 243 people turned out in a rattling West Texas wind on Friday night to watch the undefeated hometown Mustangs take on the undefeated Klondike Cougars for the Division 5-A championship of the state Six-Man Football League.
Six-man football, a throwback to the Depression years, is enjoying a resurgence here on the Great Plains, in a broad arc of the country curving from eastern Colorado down into the remote reaches of far West Texas. Paradoxically, the sport is growing in popularity precisely because in the past few decades these towns have been losing people.
"We used to play 11-man ball here," explained 92-year-old Cartis White, a retired cotton farmer. "But we're running out of boys."
The six-a-side game is played on a smaller field than regular football and the scoring is slightly different, with field goals counting 4 points and the value of points after touchdowns reversed. Every player is eligible to receive a pass, and the pace and high scores seem more akin to basketball.
The fans here in Ackerly -- the younger ones huddled in blankets against the wind, the older ones seated in the heated cabs of pickup trucks that ring the 80-yard field -- insist they would not go back to 11-man football even if they could.
"I love this game," said Zelda Bilbo, the principal of the elementary school. "I watch the Dallas Cowboys on TV and I think, 'What's going on there? There are just too many guys out on the field.' "
In Texas, where Friday night football is a revered institution, 84 public high schools, from Cotton Center to Lazbuddie and Sierra Blanca to Buena Vista, are now preserving the ritual by playing six-a-side football. Under state regulations for six-man ball, schools must have 79 or fewer students enrolled in grades 9 through 12. (Ackerly has 59.)
In the past 15 years, 27 schools have shifted to six-man ball and at least six more Texas schools are expected to switch next fall. Several dozen more schools in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and New Mexico have six-man teams.
Although the towns are tiny, the interest tends to be intense and some games, like the championship here, drew several hundred more people from surrounding counties.
In September, at a sort of Super Bowl exhibition of six-man football, 7,832 people turned out to watch the Mullin, Tex., Bulldogs play the Warriors of Weldona, Colo., two towns whose combined population is 343. The Colorado boys won, 58-44.
But big cities and the suburbs barely follow the sport, and many feats of athletic achievement on the small gridiron garner virtually no notice outside the farm and ranch communities where they happen.
"There are some amazing stories," said Granger Huntress, the editor and publisher of the Huntress Report, the weekly bible of six-man football in Texas.
"Petey Salaiz just eclipsed 10,000 yards rushing for his high school career this weekend," Mr. Huntress said, referring to a superstar on the Mullin Bulldogs. "It's incredible, the numbers he's running up. But nobody's talking about it, because it's six-man football."
A similar lament can be heard from the players themselves, who have no less natural talent or brawn than many schoolboys in other Texas towns where 11-man games are attended by college recruiters.
"There's not much chance of getting recognized when you play six-man, I guess," said Josh Richter of Ackerly, a 16-year-old tailback with a blond crew cut and bulging muscles who dreams of playing college ball for Texas Tech. "Not many people have ever heard of it."
On the day of the big game here, wisps of cotton from the harvest blow through the town like snow and gather on the vacant lots and near the empty buildings of Main Street.
"That there used to be the hardware store, and the building next door was a drug store with a soda fountain in it," said Laferne Webb, the assistant postmaster, pointing in the direction of some boarded-up buildings.
"There used to be a lot of stuff here, but now there's hardly nothing at all," she said of the town that is about 70 miles south of Lubbock.
In a wide region here known as Texas's Rolling Plains, all 28 counties lost population between 1980 and 1994 except Scurry County, which had a net gain of 10 people, according to United States Census figures.
At the sole surviving cotton gin in a town that used to have five, the consensus among farmers is that Ackerly has lost people because of "progress" of a sort -- farms are far more mechanized and efficient.
"It used to be that 100 acres was a good-sized family farm," said M. E. Dyer, an Ackerly resident for 72 of his 75 years. "Now my son, he's farming 1,800 acres of cotton, and that's about an average-sized farm these days."
Joe Zant, 62, paused from a battle between his swatter and a fly to add with a small laugh, "But he doesn't make any more money than if he had 80 acres."
Others said people had left the dusty plains simply because they did not need to live here anymore. "Supermarkets and paved roads, that's what did us in," Mr. White said.
As the afternoon wears on, an enormous dust storm blows in from the north, turning the big sky from blue to brown.
But none of the town's economic problems or the quickly dropping temperatures seem to matter much once it is time for the pep rally at the Sands Independent District School.
The gymnasium is packed with people of all ages and the crowd goes wild when Eric Herm, a 1992 graduate of the school whom defensive coordinator Jerry Gooch calls "the epitome of football," rises to speak.
Mr. Herm played fullback and middle linebacker and led the Mustangs to the state semifinals in 1991 before making the Abilene Christian University team as a walk-on.
"I know your heart is going 100 miles per hour right now," Mr. Herm told the Mustang players. "Every weight you lifted, every sprint you ran, every drop of sweat that came out of your head is not going to mean anything if you get beat tonight."
The Mustangs had enjoyed a ferociously successful season, winning all nine games, eight under a special "mercy rule" in six-man ball that ends the contest early if a team builds up a 45-point lead at any point after halftime. Its last five victories had been 52-6, 49-0, 49-0, 46-0 and 50-0.
Asked in the locker room why the team had done so well, the players turned solemn.
"Dedication," offered 17-year-old Dallas Hopper, a running back and linebacker.
"Attitude," said Jessie Cuellar, the team's kicker and both an offensive and defensive end.
At kickoff time, the wind is howling and the ball will not even stay on the tee. Despite the cold, it is a beautiful starry night in Texas and the moon is rising. The time for football has come.
The game starts well for the Mustangs, who score the first two touchdowns, the second one on a Dallas Hopper back-flip into the end zone.
The Mustangs carry an 18-14 lead into the locker room at halftime, but after that, fortunes turn. The game is all Klondike -- itself a powerful 9-0 team, four games won under the 45-point rule. Tanner Etheredge, a 190-pound Cougar who can run, pass and kick the ball into the end zone, turns the Mustangs' dream to nightmare, and Klondike wins, 40-24.
In the lockroom after the game, the Ackerly players are disconsolate, but all is not lost. With a 9-1 record, the team still makes the bi-district playoffs, and it is just possible they will get a rematch with the Cougars.
"You don't have a choice, guys, you have to get through this," said Billy Barnett, the head coach and high school principal. "You're going to deal with setbacks all the way through your adult life, and times like this are going to help you through it."
Outside, the fans are already talking of revenge in the playoffs.
"This town still has great spirit," said Leon Bodine, 86, a retired cotton farmer. "What's left of it does, anyway."

HEADLINE: New Subway Fare Brings Headaches but No Chaos

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Michael Williams, who is raising five children on a messenger's wages, stood in the morning cold at 125th Street in Harlem and called the $1.50 subway fare murderous. On Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, Pentland Phillip, 78th on line and late for his trip to the unemployment office, said he felt "no better than a slave." In Flushing, Queens, Norma Chassagne said the fare increase for the subways and buses should have been a nickel, although she said she would pay $2 a trip if the system actually worked.
Bedlam was averted yesterday on the first working day that the new fare took effect. But lines to buy tokens were still long and subway riders were grumpy about handing over an extra 25 cents per trip. As they swept through turnstiles during the morning rush hour, riders seemed particularly moved to gripe about service, provoked by the day's inconveniences and the added cost to their daily lives. 
 "They want $1.50; we want the subway clean," said Anthony Lombardi, 65, of Queens, who added that he had spent 40 years riding the subway. "On the 8:30 G train from Forest Hills, there was one car filthy, garbage all over. Food. Bags. Coca-Cola. Pigs.
"We have got to do something about this as New Yorkers. This is robbery, a dollar and a half. This is a disgrace."
Transit Authority officials, who had braced for calamity along with the rest of the city, absorbed the fury and clung to a diluted, tenuous victory. There were no major disruptions.
"Chaos didn't come," said Carol Meltzer, chief station officer for the Transit Authority.
The Transit Authority had averted the predicted chaos by deploying 300 extra token booth clerks and 75 additional supervisors and opening 250 extra windows. And at 50 of the busiest stations, tables were set up alongside the booths to handle sales of the new tokens.
But there were pockets of problems across the city. At the Jamaica station in Queens, people waited 40 minutes to purchase tokens. At the Utica Avenue station in Brooklyn, lines extended out both exits and onto the streets, where an instant, although joyless, entrepreneurial spirit took hold and people sold tokens to the desperately late for premium prices. Customers at several stations said clerks declined to sell them more than two tokens at a time.
As a result, some people said they missed job interviews, jury duty, college classes and more. A panel of Federal judges will hear arguments today as they decide whether the fare should be returned to $1.25 until a ruling is made on whether the increase is discriminatory. But some were so exasperated by yesterday's experience that even the prospect that the fare increase might be overturned did not sound appealing.
"Back to the old prices, and with refunds given out -- that's a fiasco I don't want to be a part of," said Valerie Vaggart, a paralegal in Brooklyn.
Again and again yesterday, people sounded the same theme: any increase in costs hurt, but a greater expense for increasingly inadequate service was a sham.
Last year, the Transit Authority cut 1,500 jobs, with the elimination of 1,500 more, many of whom will be maintenance and cleaning workers, scheduled for next year. The Transit Authority has also this year instituted the first widespread cutbacks in service in decades, with nearly a dozen subway lines operating less regularly, if at all. A recent survey of those lines by The New York Times indicated that they were not even functioning at their reduced level.
Kim Husbands, who works at a retail jewelry store in Manhattan, filled out a postcard for Gov. George E. Pataki at an event staged at Rockefeller Center by the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for subway riders. Her card read: "I would rather walk home four nights a week than to give to your pet monopoly another penny."
Mr. Williams, who makes $7 an hour and is raising five children in the Manhattanville projects in Harlem, called his plight at the turnstiles "suicide without the gun."
"It's no win as far as poor people go," Mr. Williams said. "The service is miserable, there are delays every morning, overcrowded, nasty trains. You can't sit down half the time, and you stand a good chance of getting your pocket picked. If you ride the train after midnight, you take your life in your hands."
The scenes at stations throughout the city yesterday varied greatly. Some stations, perhaps because of the advance bulletins of impending madness, were almost eerily empty and undistressed.
Other stations were packed and tense, with many turnstiles still inoperable, token vending machines not working and police officers standing guard over the makeshift tables set up with new tokens. People with tokens were sneered at by those on line. At other stops, it was a proselytizer's paradise, the audiences captive by circumstance and not belief.
In Brooklyn, Yvonne B., who has sold scarves and hats outside a stop on Eastern Parkway for five years, expanded her inventory yesterday to include new tokens she had bought in bulk. She charged $2 and had a steady supply of business yesterday but may not have won many long-term customers.
The workers manning the additional token tables, many of whom were supervisors pressed into duty, sounded like carnival barkers. "New tokens only, no exchanges," one supervisor shouted on the No. 2 line in Brooklyn. "Give me your old token and 25 cents right here, don't stand in line," another hollered at the Main Street stop in Queens.
The clerks, scores of whom worked double shifts, said they absorbed quite a bit of abuse. They were cursed and had their math skills and even their politics questioned.
"We're the low man, and they treated us like it was our fault," said Monica Goodlett, a clerk at the Archer Avenue station in Queens. "Every last clerk is being affected by this emotionally. The stress and strain is too much."
The assortment of dramas was comic and serious, much like the subways themselves. One rider in Flushing mistakenly tried to jam a $10 bill into a fare box and was kindly told by a supervisor that, "we don't want that much more from you."
At 157th Street in Manhattan, a token clerk who was experiencing chest pains continued to sell tokens as he waited for a replacement. As paramedics waited to take him to the hospital, panic grew on the token line.
"Officer, what's going on with this man?" one man cried out. "He's going to leave the booth?"
"He's going to have a heart attack, man," a police officer answered.
"Officer, what's going to happen to us?" the man shouted back, and the crowd grew anxious.
But within seconds, a replacement clerk arrived.

Graph: "AT A GLANCE: Transit Fare's Journey to the Courts"
 
THE BACKGROUND -- Last month, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a set of fare increases for its mass transit system. The increases, which took effect on Sunday, raised the price of subway and bus tokens by 25 cents, to $1.50, a 20 percent increase, while the price of trips on the suburban commuter rail lines rose about 9 percent.
 
THE LAWSUIT -- Shortly after the new fares were approved, the New York Urban League and the Straphangers Campaign filed a Federal lawsuit, saying that they violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The suit contended that because the percentage increase for suburban riders was lower than it was for bus and subway passengers, the new fares "had the effect of discriminating against the predominantly minority riders" of the New York City subway and bus system. The suit also argued that the distribution of transit subsidies by the state unfairly favored the predominantly white riders of the suburban rail lines.
 
THE INJUNCTION -- Last Wednesday, Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. of Federal District Court in Manhattan issued a preliminary injunction against the M.T.A., blocking the fare increase until a full trial is held on the civil rights lawsuit. The judge said that it appeared that the fare increase would have a disproportionate impact on black and Hispanic passengers in New York City and that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their case once it came to a full trial. He also said the injunction was necessary to prevent "irreparable harm" to the riders who would be forced to buy the new $1.50 tokens.
 
THE APPEAL -- The next day, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit blocked the injunction, pending a full hearing today. The court seemed to accept the argument by the M.T.A. that if the court ultimately rolled back the increase, there would be no irreparable harm, because the additional money riders would have to pay for the new tokens could be refunded. The judges ordered the agency to develop a refund plan.
 
THE FUTURE, PART 1 -- Another three-judge panel will hold a full hearing today on whether to overturn or uphold Judge Patterson's injunction. If the panel finds in favor of the M.T.A., the injunction is dead and the fare increase that took effect on Sunday stays in effect. But if the injunction is upheld, the fares would roll back to $1.25, and the M.T.A. would have to refund riders for the excess costs of the new token. The appeals court ruling could come as early as Thursday, but next week is considered more likely.
 
THE FUTURE, PART 2 -- No matter what happens after today's hearing, Judge Patterson will hold a trial, possibly by the end of the year, on the merits of the civil rights case. If he follows the logic of his ruling on the injunction and finds that the fare increase violates civil rights law, he can order the M.T.A. to return the fare to $1.25. But if he accepts the arguments of M.T.A. lawyers, the fare increase will remain in effect.
 
THE FUTURE, PART 3 -- However Judge Patterson rules, either side can appeal. (pg. B3)

HEADLINE: Bankers Trust Shuffles Top Management

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Bankers Trust New York Corporation has reassigned top executives of its $200 billion asset management business, people at the bank said. The bank's executives declined to comment.
The reorganization -- the second in two years -- comes as Bankers Trust is trying to increase profits by increasing the amount of assets it actively manages, the people said. About half the assets Bankers Trust manages, or $100 billion, are in passive investments, such as tracking stock indexes, which earn lower fees. 
 Ian Martin, who runs funds management at the profitable BT Australia Ltd. unit, will now oversee asset management worldwide, a new position, the people said. Frank Minard, who is chief executive of Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management in New York, will oversee American Funds Management.
The current head of American Funds Management, Ivan Wheen, will be transferred to Singapore to oversee Bankers Trust's business strategy in Southeast Asia, the people said.
In September 1993, Mr. Wheen, then head of securities trading in London, was promoted to oversee the global investment management unit, which includes the roughly $180 billion in funds managed in the United States.
The bank had hoped he would parlay his trading skills into using Bankers Trust's expertise in complex derivatives to bolster returns from managing assets for pension funds, big companies and other investors. In the past year, however, high-profile derivatives losses by several of the bank's clients led institutional investors to shy away from derivatives, people at the bank said. Derivatives are contracts whose performance is linked to the underlying performance of other securities, interest rates or indexes.

HEADLINE: Traders Focus on Budget Impasse, but Dow Keeps Rising

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stocks were little changed yesterday even as the Dow Jones industrial average reached a new high for the fourth consecutive session.
"There were crosscurrents throughout the day, but the market reached an equilibrium," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president of Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. "It was almost an exact carbon copy of Friday's action." 
 Wall Street remained concerned about the budget impasse in Washington. A rally in bonds, which came after the Treasury Department announced plans to stave off a debt default this week, provided stocks with some support.
Shares of financial and banking companies were weighed down, though, by worries that the impasse on the budget and the nation's debt limit would prevent the Federal Reserve from lowering short-term interest rates in the coming months. Technology stocks were also weaker yesterday.
The Dow inched up 2.53 points, or five-hundredths of 1 percent, to 4,872.90. Among the broader market measures, the Standard & Poor's index of 50 stocks eased 0.42 point, to 592.30, and the Nasdaq composite index, rich in technology issues, slipped 5.41 points, to 1,058.46.
Nasdaq's member brokerage firms were unable to update prices for 15 minutes near the end of the day as a flaw at its computer center in Trumbull, Conn., shut down the system. This year, Nasdaq has suffered a number of such incidents, which it has attributed to heavy trading volume.
Declining issues exceeded advancers on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,253 to 1,027. Big Board trading was once again modest, with turnover of 295.8 million shares, compared with 298.7 million shares on Friday.
The mixed performance came as bond prices rose sharply. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 25/32 , and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, dropped to 6.27 percent, from 6.33 percent Friday.
Some technology stocks fell on profit taking yesterday. Shares of Micron Technology Inc. declined 3, to 61 5/8; those of Sun Microsystems Inc. plunged 5, to 84 7/8; Texas Instruments Inc. gave up 1 5/8, to 62 1/4, and Motorola Inc. fell 1 3/4, to 66.
Shares of financial-services companies were also weaker. J. P. Morgan & Company closed at 76, down 1 1/8; the Nationsbank Corporation closed at 69, down 3/8, and the First Union Corporation closed at 53, down 1/4. Wells Fargo & Company, which yesterday announced a sweetened bid for First Interstate Bancorp, fell 5 a share, to 210 3/8; First Interstate fell 1 3/8 a share, to 133 3/8.
A number of money managers rotated funds into consumer-product stocks, and the Morgan Stanley consumer-product index rose 0.42 point to 592.30. The Coca-Cola Company increased 1 1/8 a share, to 73 7/8, and the Procter & Gamble Company advanced 1 3/8, to 84 3/8.
Some oil companies, which had in recent days shown declines, turned upward. Shares of the Mobil Corporation closed at 106 1/8, up 2, and those of the Exxon Corporation closed at 76 3/8, up 7/8.
The Kmart Corporation, the day's most active stock, gained 5/8 a share, to 8 1/4, on reports of a new $20 million advertising campaign. The Vigoro Corporation, which plans to be acquired by IMC Global Inc., jumped 9 3/4 a share, to 55; IMC Global fell 1 5/8 a share, to 73.
Shares of Videolan Technologies Inc. hit a new high of 47 1/2 before going into an unexplained steep decline at midday and finishing the session at 37, down 7 7/8. The company, which became publicly owned in August, is demonstrating its developmental desktop multimedia products this week at the Comdex electronics show in Las Vegas, Nev.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Asia Guide Calls Local Partners Key to Success

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 13

 BODY:
When Jim Rohwer was writing about Asia from the genteel surroundings of the London offices of The Economist, he was convinced he knew what he was doing. It turned out, he confesses now, that he did not.
"I realized within three or four months of arriving in Asia that I understood nothing about it at all," he said recently. "The same is generally true about Western business people who haven't set foot here." 
 After four years in Asia, three for The Economist, the weekly news magazine owned by Economist Newspaper Ltd., and the last as the chief economist for the CS First Boston Corporation, Mr. Rohwer now seeks to share his epiphany with Western readers. (Asians already pretty much know what he has discovered.) In short, he wants to explain why Asia has become, in his words, "the miracle" of late-20th-century free markets and economic development.
In a new book, "Asia Rising: Why America Will Prosper as Asia's Economies Boom" (Simon & Schuster), Mr. Rohwer explores the fundamental causes of Asia's prodigious growth and suggests how America's economy, and companies, can benefit from the jarring transformation of the global economy.
His analysis and suggestions might trouble Westerners, but that discomfort is essential, he said, if they are to grapple with Asia's complexities.
Indeed, the successful companies here, the ones that are defining how business is done and how economies are shaped, are not the multinationals of the United States and Europe, but the great conglomerates of Asia, like the Charoen Pokphand Group of Bangkok, Thailand, which have been built mostly by a vast diaspora of Chinese-born business families. Moreover, his analysis largely diminishes Japan's role in Asia, a view that runs counter to most judgments about growth in the region.
Mr. Rohwer is emphatic that his work is not a prescription for American companies, but he does believe there is one fundamental tenet that emerges from his book. "The biggest single thing for companies to do is to figure out how they can plug themselves into local conditions," he said. "Mostly that means finding the right partner, someone to guide you through that maze in Asia."
Yet, he cautioned, "this is very much a book of strategy more than a book on how to do it."
In an interview, Mr. Rohwer called Asia's success dependent on "being open, especially in terms of trade, investment and technology transfer. Second, it's linked to not providing protection -- social protection, protection from competition, protection from change. And third, it is having a very small role for government. The family is central and not government institutions in absorbing the shock of change."
Across Asia, government spending accounts for a very small share of gross domestic product, usually less than 20 percent, Mr. Rohwer said, compared with Western economies in which it ranges from 30 percent to 50 percent.
"How did this develop? These countries were under threats to their survival," he said. "Their backs were to the wall and they had choices of fighting or collapsing. Secondly, America's role in the cold war of defending them gave them a stable structure. There also was a tremendous amount of American generosity. But far more important was the willingness to protect these countries and absorb their exports. And this was grounded in very strong family-based societies, where learning and hard work were highly valued.
"And last -- and this is the thing Americans have the hardest time understanding -- most places are run by highly authoritarian governments that unlike authoritarians in Africa or the Middle East were actually committed to the national interest."
Economies that have thrived under the apparently paradoxical combination of political and social authoritarianism and market freedoms are apparent: Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and China. In Mr. Rohwer's view, the countries destined to follow these examples are Indonesia, which is well on the road to sustained economic growth, and Vietnam.
The great Asian failure, Mr. Rohwer argues, is India, which has too long practiced oppressive planning and a cloistered approach to economic development. As a result, he said, India has been left behind.
Driving the growth, Mr. Rohwer said, have been the multitude of Chinese families that turned small businesses into vibrant conglomerates across Asia. Together, the World Bank estimates that this "greater China" had a gross domestic product of $2.5 trillion in 1990, nearly half that of the G.D.P. of the United States in 1990.
"It's one of the most interesting business phenomena in the world," he said. "Scattered across Southeast Asia are 50 to 60 million Chinese. They have as a group created one of the most successful business empires in the world. It's the business equivalent of a neural network and the Chinese have come to dominate business, finance and commerce throughout Asia, outside Japan, even though they are a minority."
For American companies, Mr. Rohwer contends, Asia is the future. But protectionist impulses in the United States could damage the possibilities for American companies. Indeed, he said, the emergence of a huge Asian middle class augurs both great opportunity for American business -- and great competition.

HEADLINE: Mexico to Break Up State Rail And Sell It, Starting Early in '96

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Mexican Government announced today that it would break up its creaky 16,000-mile railroad system into four lines that would be sold to private investors, probably including American companies, starting next year.
In announcing the terms of the railroad privatization, Carlos Ruiz Sacristan, Mexico's communications and transportation minister, said the first bids would be accepted early in 1996. The concessions are to last at least 50 years. 
 Breaking up the current rail system, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico, is intended to reassure potential United States buyers, who had expressed interest in profitable lines that started at the Texas border, but did not want to invest in money-losing lines south of Mexico City. Mexican investors were concerned that selling the entire system to one buyer would have simply changed a public monopoly into a private one.
Of the four lines envisioned, one would serve northeastern Mexico, including the busy route from the Texas border to Mexico City. Another would serve northern and western Mexico, including Guadalajara. A third would travel the southeast below Mexico City, and the fourth would handle traffic in the capital itself.
Some big Mexican construction companies have registered an interest in taking part in the railroad privatization, and some of them have established joint ventures with rail companies in the United States.
An issue of concern involves the railroad's work force, which includes 55,000 active employees and 45,000 retirees. Mr. Ruiz said that the Government would assume responsibility for pensions but that potential buyers would have to negotiate layoffs directly with the railroad workers' union.
In the equity markets here today, the main Mexico City stock index fell 56.03 points, or 2.43 percent, to 2,254.07, on low volume as overnight interest rates rose to 75 percent. It was a bad day, as well, on the broader market, where 52 issues declined and only 7 rose.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE PRESIDENT;
Budget Crisis Jeopardizes Clinton's Diplomatic Plans

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
For months, President Clinton planned to devote late November to foreign policy. First there would be a six-day visit to Japan to discuss trade in Asia and to renew the Japanese-American security alliance. Next would come a swing through Great Britain and Ireland to highlight America's commitment to peace in troubled regions.
But with Mr. Clinton and Congress on a collision course that threatens to lead to a prolonged Government shutdown, White House officials made some quick political calculations about the trip to Japan on Thursday: 
 Could Mr. Clinton afford to be seen at a state dinner at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo at the same time Federal workers idled at home and default loomed?
Yet, could he risk offending the Japanese by skipping the visit at a time that relations between the two powers have been strained by American economic espionage and the abduction and rape of an Okinawa teen-ager by American servicemen?
Would he look like a hostage of the Republican Congress if he canceled his plans?
With those considerations in mind, the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, announced today that Mr. Clinton's six-day trip to Osaka and Tokyo would be compressed into one long weekend of diplomacy.
Mr. Clinton is now scheduled to leave Washington at 11 P.M. on Friday. He will be in Osaka for a Sunday meeting of the leaders of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum and in Tokyo on Monday to meet with Prime Minister Murayama and attend a state dinner with Emperor Akihito.
After dinner, Mr. Clinton will immediately board Air Force One, returning to Washington by 2 A.M. Tuesday because he crosses the international dateline.
While no one knows how long the budget deadlock will continue, Mr. Clinton tellingly let it slip that his second trip might be endangered.

HEADLINE: From Chickens to Chemicals;
Family Conglomerate Finds Fast Growth in China

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: SONGJIANG, China

 BODY:
Under their adobe tile roofs, the barracks seem to stretch to the horizon in this bleak suburb of Shanghai. Inside, hundreds of thousands of chickens shuffle about noisily, and aromatically, pecking at feeding machines, plumping themselves for the city's woks.
A few hours to the north, black motorcycle frames move along an assembly line. The motorcycles bounce off the line, their gleaming red tanks emblazoned with the word "Xingfu," or "Happiness." 
 These two wildly different enterprises are fragments of one of Asia's largest and most successful business empires, the Charoen Pokphand Group, based in Bangkok, Thailand. From chickens to shrimp, petrochemicals to motorcycles, telecommunications to retail marketing, the C.P. Group, as it is known, embraces a cornucopia of industries. Its investments swaddle the globe, but its most dominant presence, by far, is in Asia. The group, barely known in the United States or Europe, is probably the largest foreign investor in China.
It is just such family conglomerates, not American or European multinationals, that are shaping Asia. They feed its people, build roads and houses, put up phone lines and power stations, open stores and malls -- in short, weave the very fabric of Asia's phenomenal economic expansion. Family empires from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines, many of them run by overseas Chinese, have moved aggressively and steadily throughout Asia, establishing themselves as the core of the region's economic growth.
C.P.'s approach has been deceptively simple. In China it began with the basic idea of a chicken in every wok and, from there, branched out in every imaginable direction.
"In 1979," said an animated Sumet Jiaravanon (pronounced Soo-MEHT GEE-rah-wahnon), the group's pencil-thin president, "we saw that China was very poor. But we knew, we overseas Chinese knew, that China would be very important one day.
"We knew the Chinese ate only one-quarter of a kilo of meat per year," continued Mr. Sumet, who, along with his brother, Dhanin Chearavanont (TA-ninn GEE-rah-wahnon), oversees the group. "The market potential was enormous."
Mr. Dhanin put it more succinctly. "C.P. is always looking for opportunity," he said. "We saw opportunity in Taiwan. When Suharto came to power we went to Indonesia. We always see opportunity first."
One secret of the ability of C.P. to gain access to these markets is that it builds personal ties, said Thirayuth Phitya-Isarakul, a C.P. director and head of the company's agribusiness group. "Our business has to be seen as important by the local government," he added. "We are bringing in technical know-how, management skills and low costs. So they never think we are trying to cheat them."
Across China, C.P. has absorbed crippled local enterprises and involved local officials.
From its first venture in southern China in 1979, C.P.'s agribusiness group has grown to 80 companies throughout China, including feed mills, breeder farms, broiler chicken farms, processing factories, even chicken fast-food shops. Of 3 billion chickens eaten in China last year, C.P.'s companies produced 300 million. And this does not include the other investments by C.P., which elevate its outlay in China toward the $1 billion mark.
The group's beginnings were far more modest.
In the 1920's, a young man named Chia Ek Chor left Shantou in southern China and moved to Bangkok. He took with him seeds from his family's farms, for the cabbages, parsnips, radishes, turnips and cauliflower so loved by Chinese, but so scarce throughout Southeast Asia. Bangkok's Chinese community welcomed him and his seeds, which he began to sell, and the brother he left behind became his supplier.
It remained a modest family concern until 1953, when Mr. Chia's eldest son, Jaran Chiaravanont, set up a feed mill for chickens and registered the expanding businesses under the name Charoen Pokphand.
Next came chickens -- raising and processing them for a population starting to shake off poverty. The first international link came in 1970 with Arbor Acres, a leading chicken breeder based in Connecticut. Exports followed, then feed mills and chicken breeding in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and China.
Then it was real estate, petrochemicals, trading and retail stores, and shrimp farming. In recent years C.P. has expanded into telecommunications and motorcycles.
In the last three years, annual revenue at the group's publicly traded companies has doubled, to $6.5 billion. More than 65,000 people draw C.P. paychecks in 20 countries. Fourteen companies are publicly traded, six in Bangkok, one each in Taipei and Shanghai, two in Jakarta and three in Hong Kong. And shares of Ek Chor China Motorcycle trade on the New York Stock Exchange, where they closed yesterday at $11.625.
The Telecom Asia Corporation, a joint venture with the Nynex Corporation, has a market capitalization that is now about $6.6 billion but at times has approached $10 billion, greater than that of Nynex. And the families of Mr. Dhanin and Mr. Sumet -- grandsons of the founder -- are the wealthiest in Thailand, and among the wealthiest in the world. Forbes magazine puts their combined net worth at about $5.5 billion.
C.P.'s success and its spectacular growth have depended on people like Chingchai Lohawatanakul, president of C.P.'s Aquaculture group.
"I joined C.P. in 1964 as a clerk," Mr. Chingchai said. And later, "I became a technician in the feed mills."
In Asia in the 1980's, C.P. saw a rapidly rising consumption of shrimp, in addition to chickens. Mr. Chingchai was put in charge of aquaculture, spending three years building an operation that started in Taiwan, then the world's largest shrimp producer. But that business later collapsed in Taiwan and China, because of disease-ravaged farms. After that, "I thought that the shrimp business was very, very risky," he said. "I was afraid for my job."
But last year, Mr. Chingchai found a place to raise shrimp, 60,000 acres in southern Sumatra, one of the Indonesian islands, and he is hiring 15,000 farmers and building towns and villages for them. When he is done, he intends to be Asia's biggest shrimp producer. It may take years, but as Mr. Sumet said simply, "Our goals are long term."
China was seen as a very long-term prospect.
When Mr. Sumet went to Shenzhen in 1979 to look at the site of C.P.'s first exploratory investment, he was stunned. "There was nothing," he recalled. "There were fishermen and a few fields. Nothing else. But I had some confidence in the Chinese Government to change, one step at a time."
"If you want successful economic development and a successful business, you need technology, capital and the market," he said. "In Thailand, we organized farm families into groups, we brought in technology, we guaranteed loans to farmers, we provided breeders and purchased the chickens they raised. We processed the chickens and sold them. It was completely integrated."
"We brought this model to China," he said. From his offices in a golden-mirrored tower near Hong Kong's harbor, his walls filled with ceremonial pictures of himself with China's leaders, from Deng Xiaoping on down, he said he expected China to become C.P.'s largest market.
Mr. Sumet attributes C.P.'s fairly easy growth in China to the inflexibility of non-Asian companies. "American and European companies have adapted themselves to a very sophisticated legal-based society," he said. "In China there is no law. There is no system. It is a government by individuals, by people."
Mr. Thirayut, the C.P. director, said American companies in particular were unlikely to succeed in Asia.
"For Western companies," he said, "once they don't make a profit for three years they can't go on. High executives shift very often from company to company. Our top executives work for 20, 30 years." Mr. Thirayut, who began 32 years ago as a clerk, added, "The reason everyone works so long for this company is that it is still like a family."
A recent study by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade pointed to a number of reasons for the dominance of Chinese families in Asian business. "Most ethnic Chinese," the report said, "are culturally empathetic with one another, write the same language and have a range of community mechanisms" that make things easier."
Of course, C.P.'s skepticism about American business does not preclude joint ventures, as witness the project with Nynex to install 2.6 million fiber optic lines in Bangkok.
"C.P. has traditionally been viewed as based on agriculture," said Ajva Taulananda, the president of Telecom Asia. "But Thailand needs telephones."
After winning a Government license -- a license that critics suggest was secured by illegal contributions to Government ministers, which Mr. Ajva denies -- C.P. teamed up with Nynex.
"The chances of Nynex getting the license were zero," said Frederic V. Salerno, the vice chairman of Nynex and of Telecom Asia. "The people over there are almost family."
Since 1992, the joint venture has installed 1.4 million lines and, after a slow start, signed up 700,000 customers. When the Thai Government telepone company -- which will take possession of the lines, but not the revenue, after the project is completed -- tried to manage customer subscriptions, it floundered. C.P. put 24-hour subscription desks in its chain of convenience stores and solved that problem.
Already, Telecom Asia is moving into cable television; video on demand and videotext are next.
And, Mr. Dhanin said, C.P. is taking this telecommunications expertise to other countries, starting with Indonesia and the Philippines.
The group has defied many efforts to analyze its operations and performance. Ravi Narain, who heads China and Hong Kong research for Peregrine Brokerage Ltd., said it was hard to see C.P.'s operations clearly because of "a constant flow of asset injections from other parts of the group."
Kent Chan, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said simply, "They are too complicated."

HEADLINE: Tremors in Saudi Arabia

 BODY:
It is too early to draw firm conclusions about the explosion that rocked Saudi Arabia's capital yesterday, destroying a United States-run National Guard training building and killing four Americans. They were part of a group of about 100 Americans training Saudi forces in the use of weapons imported from the United States. Two obscure Islamic groups claimed responsibility. Both Washington and Riyadh continue to investigate the incident.
The attack is a reminder of the inherent vulnerability of the American position in Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil producer and the largest pro-Western state in the Persian Gulf region. As the gulf war made clear, the Saudi regime depends on American military protection against larger neighbors like Iran and Iraq. Yet the regime, while it remains firmly in control, has seen its grip challenged in recent years by the radical brand of political Islam that is sweeping the Middle East. 
 Some Saudi Islamic groups are home-grown, others receive substantial support from Iran and Sudan. In recent months these groups have threatened violence, issued ultimatums against the presence of Americans and carried out at least one terrorist operation.
Under present circumstances, Washington has little choice but to maintain close relations with the Saudi monarchy. The United States economy depends on benign Saudi oil pricing policies. Yet despite big arms purchases from the United States, the sparsely populated kingdom is incapable of defending itself against much larger neighbors.
Saudi political considerations rule out basing large numbers of American troops on Saudi soil. So Washington sells enormous quantities of advanced weapons and helps train Saudi troops.
The regime faces increasing challenge at home as well as from abroad. Open political discussion is largely limited to issues concerning religious doctrine and practice, especially the role of women. But more prosaic issues, like corruption and the management of fiscal resources that have been less flush since the oil price drop of the mid-1980's and the huge expenses of the gulf war, are often at play beneath the surface.
These challenges push American policy in two potentially conflicting directions. To reduce the risk of future upheavals Washington needs to encourage a more open political system and more prudent economic management, as well as more effective self-defense. Yet to avoid provoking Islamic sensitivities, it needs to keep its advice and its presence low-key. It will not be any easier to maintain that balance after yesterday's attack.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Gain As Treasury Will Resume Its Auctions

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury virtually removed chances of a default this week with an 11th-hour announcement yesterday that it would resume its auctions. Prices rose immediately, for the first time in three days, as investors rushed to buy Government securities.
Traders said the announcement by the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, erased early losses brought on by the President's veto of a bill that would have raised the debt ceiling. Word of the veto led to selling as investors sought to protect themselves against a possible default. The Treasury's announcement of the revised auction plans not only overcame concerns of a default this week, but also led to short-covering, which contributed to the rally. 
 The Treasury went ahead with its regular weekly auction of $29.2 billion in three-month and six-month bills yesterday and prepared for the sale today of $31.5 billion in nine-day cash management bills and $26 billion of 36-day cash management bills. Tomorrow the Treasury will sell $18.75 billion of new one-year bills. Occasionally the Government sells the cash management bills to meet cash flow shortages when it needs to meet interest rate and principal payments.
Traders said the Treasury's revised auction schedule would allow the Government to make the $102 billion of payments due on Wednesday and Thursday, and end concern for now. Next week the Treasury will sell $18 billion of three-year notes on Monday and $13.5 billion of 10-year notes on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 25/32 of a percentage point, to 108 2/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.27 percent, from 6.33 percent on Friday when the market felt the pressure of a threatened Government default.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the Administration was able to stop the clock on a default and gain some time by disinvesting. The Treasury said it was lowering obligations to two Government employee funds to avoid exceeding the current debt limit; that also buys some time to negotiate a compromise on the budget impasse.
Mr. Chan noted that the dollar had gained strength, and the Commodity Research Bureau index, which is considered a barometer of future inflation pressures, fell to 242.82, down 1.05 points, "which was music to the ears of the credit markets."
Mr. Chan cautioned, however, that "if the legality of using Government trust funds to circumvent the debt limit is successfully challenged, then sentiment is likely to move back the other way with a frenzy." And the outcome of a political struggle can be hard to predict, he added.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist CS First Boston, said it was clear that "a default would bring a fall in the dollar and a rise in interest rates," and that the longer-term implications were still not known. "While the Treasury has come up with an interesting way of meeting its obligations," he continued, "we're not sure what the ultimate resolution of the budget debate will be."
Indeed, he said, the parties in the budget debate appear to be moving farther apart.
The supply of new issues to market, Mr. Alexy said, should not weigh on prices, since it had all been scheduled to come to market anyway and was delayed. "The demand," he said, "is there."
Rates rose at yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month bills. To delay reaching the debt limit, foreign central bankers were prohibited at yesterday's auction from purchasing any bills in excess of the maturing bills they already held.
The average rate for a three-month issue rose to 5.43 percent from 5.36 percent, while a six-month issue went to 5.33 percent from 5.29 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's bill auctions:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.627	97.305	Discounted Rate	5.43%	5.33%	Coupon Yield	5.60%	5.57%	High Price	98.635	97.310	Discounted Rate	5.40%	5.32%	Coupon Yield	5.57%	5.56%	Low Price	98.627	97.305	Discounted Rate	5.43%	5.33%	Coupon Yield	5.60%	5.57%	Accepted at low price	67%	30%	Total applied for	$48,661,399	$55,138,793	Accepted	$14,602,216	$14,801,569	Noncompetitive	$1,371,613	$1,164,828	
 
Both issues are dated Nov. 16, 1995. The three-month bills mature on Feb. 15, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on May 16, 1996.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Edges Up After Treasury Takes Steps to Avoid a Default

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday after the Clinton Administration took steps to avoid a default on debt payments this week.
The dollar's gain against the yen was helped in part by large trades by hedge funds. But against the German mark, the dollar retreated from earlier gains. Political and economic uncertainty in the United States typically bolsters the mark. 
 On Thursday, the dollar fell sharply as anxieties over an impasse on the United States budget finally affected world currency markets. But the dollar recovered somewhat on Friday on confidence that a debt default by the United States could be avoided.
Yesterday, the Treasury Department announced that it would sell $137 billion in new securities during the next nine days, more than enough to pay off $102 billion in principal and interest due this week.
The Administration's maneuvers "addressed the market's immediate concerns about the default threat by using extraordinary measures to avoid the absolutely unacceptable possibility of default," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney Inc.
The Treasury's plans set off a rally in the bond market, driving the yield of the 30-year Treasury down to 6.27 percent, from 6.33 percent on Friday. That surge also bolstered the dollar.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 101.91 yen from 100.90 yen on Friday. The dollar edged up to 1.4185 marks from 1.4176 marks and to 1.1441 Swiss francs from 1.1390 Swiss francs. The British pound slippped to $1.5529 from $1.5665.
In other trading, the Mexican peso, which had dragged the dollar down last week, weakened yesterday. The peso settled at 7.77 pesos to the dollar, from 7.55 pesos to the dollar on Friday.
While the currency markets expressed relief that the United States had avoided default at least this week, concern over the budget impasse remained.
Still, market participants also feel that the United States is, relatively, not in a bad position economically. Its accumulated public debt, as a percentage of gross domestic product, fares favorably in comparison with other leading industrial countries.
"Certainly the market feels the U.S. has a foreign debt problem, but the public debt problem has been overstated," said John Rothfield, an international economist with Nationsbanc-CRT in Chicago. "This isn't a bad problem for the U.S. to have."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Pacific Vision in Search of Reality

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Leaders of 18 nations in the Pacific region will meet in Osaka, Japan, this week in an effort to keep their grand vision of a vast trans-Pacific free trade zone from unraveling.
President Clinton and the 17 other leaders of the countries belonging to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC, met a year ago in Bogor, Indonesia, and announced a "declaration of common resolve" to achieve "free and open trade and investment" among themselves by the year 2020, with the industrial nations in the group realizing that goal 10 years earlier. 
 This year, APEC members are to draw up an agenda for action, one that will turn the vision into reality. But achieving free trade is expected to be a far more painstaking process than enunciating the goal.
Already, there are signs that the "common resolve" at Bogor is dissolving. Japan, the host country this year, is eluding any commitment to fully open its politically sensitive rice market. South Korea, China and Taiwan also want exemptions to enable them to continue protecting their farmers.
"We think in the process of liberalization we have to be practical and pragmatic," said Katsuhisa Uchida, representative for international trade and economics in Japan's Foreign Ministry.
But the United States and Australia argue that if some countries are allowed to make exceptions, others will as well, leading to an unraveling of the free trade plan.
"If you exclude any sectors, either directly or by fuzz words, you create a political dynamic that will ultimately erode APEC," an American official said. He added that with a free trade deadline 15 or 25 years away, the group's members already had flexibility. "Why water down the principle at the beginning?" he asked.
There are other disputes over how to actually liberalize trade and whether the benefits of lowered barriers should be available to nations outside the regional forum.
Unwilling to give up on last year's grand declaration so soon, the APEC members are likely to work out compromises on all these questions. Regarding agriculture, the wording is expected to allow some flexibility; with industry, it is likely to retain the principle that the goal of free trade should apply to all sectors.
Japan, which already has a reputation as an unfair trader, is under particular pressure to engineer a compromise, lest as host country it is blamed for a failure of APEC.
Subcabinet-level officials from the 18 nations are meeting in Osaka today and Tuesday to try to arrange a compromise. What they cannot resolve will be passed on to foreign and trade ministers, who will meet from Wednesday night through Friday. The heads of government will convene for an informal summit meeting on Sunday in a guest house on the grounds of Osaka Castle.
But the so-called action agenda mainly lists the principles to be followed in achieving free trade. If that is proving difficult, then truly troublesome problems might be seen at next year's meeting in the Philippines. By then, each country is to have come up with a specific plan to eliminate its tariffs and other barriers.
APEC was started as an informal discussion group in 1989. The fact that its somewhat awkward sounding name, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, does not end in "association" or "organization" or a similar noun suggests the founders' reluctance to create a formal institution. But gradually, APEC is becoming that.
A big step came at the 1993 meeting in Seattle, when President Clinton elevated what had been a round of ministers' talks into one involving the heads of state. On windswept Blake Island, the leaders, dressed in casual clothing, met in an Indian long house to endorse Mr. Clinton's vision of an Asian-Pacific community.
The next year, clad in batik shirts and meeting in a colonial-era palace 40 miles south of Jakarta, the leaders issued the Bogor Declaration, at once audacious and meaningless.
It was audacious in that it aimed to create a free trade zone among nations that account for more than half the world's economic output and more than 40 percent of total trade.
But the timetable for freeing trade, by 2010 or 2020, was so distant that it seemed like something the leaders could proclaim and not have to worry about carrying out. As one Prime Minister quipped last year, the Sultan of Brunei was the only leader of the 18 at the meeting with a chance of still being in office in 2020.
There are numerous other obstacles. APEC covers countries as geographically distant as Chile and South Korea, Australia and Canada. Its members vary from China, with 1.2 billion people, to Brunei, with less than 300,000. The group encompasses economic superpowers like Japan and the United States, and poor nations like Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.
Moreover, APEC is still a voluntary organization with no legal authority. If anything is accomplished, it will be by peer pressure rather than by a legally binding trade treaty or agreement. Malaysia, for instance, has said that it will not be bound by the 2020 deadline.
For the Asia-Pacific region as a whole, free trade is seen as a way of accelerating growth in an already dynamic area. The nations of East Asia are getting so big and prosperous that they can no longer rely for growth solely on exporting products to the United States, but must trade more among themselves.
For the United States, APEC seemed like a way of opening the markets of East Asia to its exports.
But some analysts think that the United States is already lowering its expectations of what it can accomplish with APEC and may instead stick to tough trade negotiations with particular countries, which have greater appeal to voters.
To allay such suspicions, President Clinton is taking great pains to come to Japan, planning two days in Osaka and Tokyo on Sunday and Monday, despite the budget crisis with Republican leaders of Congress.
Aother concern is that business executives may lose faith if action toward Pacific trade liberalization is too slow. "The business community hasn't seen any tangible results of the APEC process yet," said Takeshi Kondo, general manager of economic and political research at Itochu, a giant Japanese trading company. "We don't need any dramatic statements. We had one last year and the year before that."
The members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum are the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Australia and New Zealand. Asian members are Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.

Yankees Are No. 1, On Payday, at Least

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Yankees and the Mets stood in stark contrast to each other today in baseball's salary standings. In a season when the average major league salary dropped more than 5 percent, the Yankees had a runaway No. 1 average salary and payroll that were more than four times the Mets' figures, which ranked 27th.
Payroll figures, which have everyone's attention in baseball because of the continued economic impact of the labor dispute, were presented to the general managers today at the start of their annual meetings. The general managers are most immediately affected by the figures because club owners are constantly telling them to reduce their payrolls. 
 Computed by the Player Relations Committee, the figures show the Yankees with a 1995 payroll of $54,889,849 and an average salary of $1,960,351; the Mets had a $13,040,444 payroll and an average salary of $465,730. Only the Montreal Expos were below the Mets with a $12,956,557 payroll and a $404,892 average salary.
The P.R.C. figures were not quite complete. Bonuses earned for post-season awards were not included because not all the awards have been given. But when those bonuses are included, the figures won't change significantly.
The total payroll of the 28 teams rose slightly, by $19 million, from 1994 to 1995 for the players who were on rosters or disabled lists on Aug. 31. But that was because there were more players this year than last. The average salary computed to $1,089,621, or 5.6 percent less than last year's $1,154,486.
Even if, say, $3 million in bonuses were added, the average still would have dropped slightly more than 5 percent.
Looking ahead to his first signing season as the new Yankees' general manager, Bob Watson said: "The P.R.C. figure of $55 million will be less. I haven't got a definite number on dollars I'll have at my disposal to spend. That should come in the near future."
In terms of real dollars spent on salaries, the Yankees don't have to spend less than they actually did this year to have a smaller payroll. Although their total read nearly $55 million, it was really "only" $49 million because the 1995 payroll was inflated by their acquisition of David Cone three-fifths into the season.
Because of the computation method used by the P.R.C. and the Players Association, if a player is traded, his entire salary is charged to his new team no matter when the trade is made. Furthermore, a prorated share of a player's signing bonus also is charged to the new team, even if the former team had paid the entire bonus.
That was the case with Cone. When the Kansas City Royals signed the pitcher in December, 1992, they gave him a $9 million signing bonus, payable immediately. Yet a third of that bonus was charged on the Yankees' payroll, as was about $3 million in salary that the Toronto Blue Jays paid him for the first three months of the season.
Subtract $6 million from the payroll, and the Yankees' average salary would have been $1,746,066, which would have been second to Atlanta's $1,856,937.
Cone was listed as the Yankees' highest-paid player at $8 million, a $5 million salary and $3 million from the signing bonus. Ruben Sierra was next at $6.2 million, though he, too, was a late acquisition. Jack McDowell, at $5.4 million, was the highest-paid member of the Yankees who spent the entire season with the team.
The Mets had only three players at $1 million or more, and the salaries of Pete Harnisch, John Franco and Jose Vizcaino amounted to less than $7 million combined. The Mets had nine players at the $109,000 minimum, more than the Expos' seven.
Before the general managers heard from John Westhoff, Lou Melendez and Barbara Ernst, they had other visitors today.
At the start of the first day of meetings, Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, and Rob Manfred, the owners' chief labor lawyer, gave them an update on the labor situation and said the clubs soon would make a new proposal to the union.
Randy Levine, the clubs' new chief labor executive, arrived in town later in the day and is scheduled to meet with the general managers Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Biodiversity Study Sees More Species in Danger

BYLINE: By TIM HILCHEY 

 BODY:
HUMAN activities like farming, logging and commercial fishing are endangering plants, animals and entire ecosystems at much higher rates than ever before in recorded history, according to a report issued by the United Nations Environment Program.
The document, the Global Biodiversity Assessment (Cambridge University Press, $44.95), is being described by the United Nations as the first comprehensive, peer-reviewed report ever to examine earth's biodiversity. 
 "This is the first time that a thousand scientists from more than 50 countries have gotten together to write a single document on the state of biological diversity," said Robert T. Watson, a member of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy who headed the Global Biodiversity Assessment project.
Since genetic variation is the basis for evolution, diversity of genes and species "affects the ability of ecological communities to resist or recover from environmental change, including long-term climatic change," said a summary that accompanied the report.
The document is being released today at the second Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which is being held in Jakarta, Indonesia. Some 1,000 governmental officials worldwide are attending the two-week conference, which will end on Friday.
Although the United States Senate has not ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity, which was signed by some 160 countries at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, Dr. Watson and other representatives of the Clinton Administration are attending the meeting.
"There's an educational issue here and the U.S. and other rich nations must lead by example," Dr. Watson said in a telephone interview. "We should not only conserve and protect our environment for moral, ethical and esthetic reasons, but also because there is more economic value in the protection of biodiversity than in its destruction."
Just as scientific reports on ozone depletion and global climate change have helped nations agree on policies to address these issues, Dr. Watson said, the contributors hope the biodiversity assessment will help people, from policy makers to farmers and fishermen, reach the three main objectives of the biodiversity convention: "the conservation of biological biodiversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from utilization of genetic resources."
Among its many findings, the report concludes that at least 4,000 plants and 5,400 animals are threatened with extinction; that species have recently become extinct at 50 to 100 times the average expected natural rate; that only some 1.75 million, or about 13 percent of the 13 million to 14 million species on earth, have been scientifically identified, and that economic markets continue to underestimate the role biodiversity plays in major areas like air and water quality, global climate and scientific efforts to produce higher yielding, pest-resistant crops.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: INCOME TAXES;
Capital Gains Cuts Would Be Retroactive

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Investors and families could see part of the Republican tax cut soon after they filed their returns next spring under a tentative agreement reached by House and Senate negotiators, people familiar with the Congressional negotiations said today.
A 50 percent cut in capital gains taxes for individuals would be effective on Jan. 1, 1995, under a preliminary deal struck in long, closed sessions over the weekend to fuse separate House and Senate tax bills, those people said, and the Republicans' $500-per-child-tax credit would be retroactive to Oct. 1, 1995. 
 The negotiators refused to describe the tentative agreement in public. But Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the Ways and Means Committee, said, "I think the investment community is going to be pleased with the final product."
Analysts at the Congressional Budget Office are evaluating the package. Individual provisions could be changed if the measures add up to more than the Republicans' seven-year, $245-billion target for the tax cut. Both Bob Dole, majority leader in the Senate, and Representative Dick Armey, majority leader in the House, had been strong advocates of putting at least part of the tax cut into voters pockets before the 1996 election.
Parents could claim a fourth of the credit -- $125 -- on their 1995 returns for each child younger than 18. But refund checks covering the credit would not be mailed out until next Oct. 1 in order to shift the cost into the 1997 budget year.
The per-child credit would total $147.6 billion in seven years. Single parents with incomes below $75,000 and two-parent families with incomes below $110,000 would be eligible for it.
The seven-year cost of the cut in the tax rate on capital gains would be $35.7 billion. The negotiators accepted a House proposal to index such gains to eliminate the effects of inflation, but not until 2001. The maximum capital gains tax rate for individual investors would become 19.8 percent and the corporate tax rate on capital gains would be cut to 28 percent, not the 26 percent sought by the House.
Other provisions are:
$11.7 billion to expand Individual Retirement Accounts. That includes a new type of I.R.A. in which contributions would be taxable but earnings would accumulate tax-free. Eligibility for traditional deductible I.R.A.'s would be expanded, but not as much as under the Senate bill. Nonworking spouses would be eligible for a full $2,000-a-year I.R.A. contribution.
$11.8 billion for estate-tax breaks. The estate-tax exemption would be increased to $750,000 in six years from $600,000 and family-owned farms and businesses would get a bigger break, although not much as in the Senate version.
$8 billion to reduce the marriage penalty that hurts dual-income couples.
Another provision would increase the deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed to 50 percent from 30 percent.

HEADLINE: Clinton Makes Case to Congress For Putting U.S. Troops in Bosnia

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Wednesday, Nov. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton made his strongest and most detailed case to Congress on Tuesday for why 20,000 American troops should be sent to help enforce an eventual peace settlement in Bosnia, but acknowledged that he could not predict the number of casualties the United States might suffer in the course of the operation.
Mr. Clinton laid out his views in a nine-page letter to Representative Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, the Speaker of the House. The letter was dated Monday and released on Tuesday. And at an Air Force base near Dayton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Balkan leaders for 12 hours on Tuesday in an effort to move them closer to peace. 
 After three rounds of talks that touched on all core disputes over land and territory, Mr. Christopher failed to resolve any of the issues.
All major issues "remain on the table," a State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, told reporters early this morning after the talks ended past midnight. "The parties are going to have to work harder."
Shortly before midnight, Mr. Christopher left for a meeting in Osaka of 18 countries that make up the Asia-Pacific economic forum. Mr. Burns held open the possibility that Mr. Christopher might cut short his trip and return to Dayton from Osaka if an agreement was likely.
On Tuesday, Mr. Burns said the United States was prepared to have the talks continue into next week -- or even longer if necessary.
In his letter, Mr. Clinton said that American participation in the NATO-led operation would cost about $1.5 billion for one year. In testimony before Congress last month, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the operation would cost between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.
Mr. Clinton also estimated that the United States would have to spend between $500 million and $600 million over several years for an international effort to rebuild Bosnia.
And as far as troop withdrawal was concerned, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that one year was an estimate, not a fixed deadline.
"We believe that approximately 12 months would be adequate to accomplish" the tasks of the NATO force and provide a self-sustaining peace, "although we cannot make that final judgment until the terms of the agreement are defined," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton stressed that the final size and cost of the American troop deployment could only be determined after the parties make peace. "It is impossible to provide detailed information about aspects of a settlement that does not yet exist," he wrote. "I must reserve my decisions until the actual details of the agreement are clear."
Mr. Clinton did not offer any concrete proposal about how the United States would pay for the operation, except to say that he has not decided whether to ask Congress for a supplemental appropriation.
Aside from the financing issue, the issue most likely to elicit criticism from Congress is the fact that Mr. Clinton says he simply cannot predict how many American soldiers might die while keeping a still-undefined peace in Bosnia. The President argued that, given the size of the NATO-led force, the high quality of American and NATO troops and equipment, and the rules of engagement, "We would have created conditions that would offer the minimum possible risks to our soldiers."
But he did not gloss over the potential for casualties, saying, "It is not possible to make meaningful casualty predictions since casualty models for peace operations do not exist."
The proposal to send American troops to Bosnia has little support in Congress at the moment, as evidenced by a letter to Mr. Clinton on Monday from Mr. Gingrich and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, saying that support in Congress for the mission "is virtually nil."
On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton invited 40 leading lawmakers of both parties to meetings at the White House to win Congressional support, and on Thursday, Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American delegate to the United Nations, will begin a four-city speaking tour to make the Administration's case.
Even as the three Balkan Presidents argued over territorial demands, constitutional arrangements, elections and NATO implementation of a peace agreement, human rights issues have risen to the top of the agenda, complicating the talks.
Unknown to the American negotiators, on Tuesday President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia promoted an officer who was indicted on Monday as a war criminal by the International War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague.
Reuters reported from Zagreb that Mr. Tudjman promoted Gen. Tihomir Blaskic, the commander of the Bosnian Croat militia, as an inspector in the Croatian Army.
Asked about the promotion of the indicted officer, Mr. Burns told reporters that the United States was unaware of the action and that it had therefore not been raised by Mr. Christopher.
Judge Richard Goldstone, the chief prosecutor for the United Nations-sponsored tribunal, issued a strong warning on Tuesday against any peace deal for the former Yugoslavia that would shield suspected war criminals from trial. He told reporters in the Hague that any amnesty for the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and the Bosnian Serb military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, would be "abhorrent."
Mr. Goldstone will conduct two days of meetings with senior Administration officials in Washington today and on Thursday to air his complaints about the failure of the United States to turn over all relevant intelligence data for use in his cases.
Although there is no fixed deadline for the talks, American negotiators had hoped to conclude a peace agreement before President Clinton left for a meeting of 18 nations in Osaka on a trans-Pacific free-trade zone.
While some American officials, including Mr. Burns, the only official who is authorized to speak about the negotiations, seem to believe that the talks will continue for days, other officials say they could be concluded by the end of the week.
"We're at one of those breakdown-breakthrough moments," said one European official close to the talks.
A senior member of the Bosnian Government delegation said on Tuesday that he was not pleased with the American team, charging that American negotiators were exerting undue pressure on his Government as well as breaking the American-imposed news blackout by giving anonymous interviews to the press.
In particular, he said, American officials were mischaracterizing the Bosnian Government as inflexible on the status of the capital, Sarajevo, and on the issue of a strip of land between Serbia and Banja Luka, the largest Serbian-held city in Bosnia.
"We can't sit back and let them play this game," the official said. "They are trying to deprive us of the moral and political support we have in the United States with their so-called press embargo, that they themselves are violating."
Mr. Clinton's letter was a response to a lengthy letter from Mr. Gingrich written on Oct. 26 that asked for more detailed information about the Administration's plans to send troops to Bosnia.
Mr. Clinton reiterated his view that the United States must take a leading role in the NATO-led peacekeeping force both to prevent the war from spreading and to preserve NATO as an institution. Although he pledged that Congress would have ample time to debate the issue before American forces are sent, he added that a "small" number of communications and other support troops would be sent even before Congress acted.
His letter was met with skepticism by a number of Republicans, some of whom questioned the cost estimates.
"Mr. President, where's your black top hat and magic wand?" said Representative Bob Livingston, the Louisiana Republican and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Mr. Livingston also disputed the $1.5 billion estimate for the troop deployment, saying Pentagon officials have told him the operation would cost at least twice as much.
Mr. Clinton insisted that the United States would not allow "mission creep" that could result in a nation-building role for the troops, saying that they would not deal with the return of war prisoners or refugees, or retrain civilian police.
If there is a "significant breakdown" in compliance with the military aspects of the peace agreement, Mr. Clinton said, NATO's political body, the North Atlantic Council, would consider changing the operating procedures of the NATO peace force; if there were a "total breakdown in compliance," the allies agree the force would be withdrawn.

Don't Cry, This Land Is Rich in Kims and Lees

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
Thirty years ago, the future seemed bleak for Sang Hyun Kim, a poor farm boy from South Korea, so he packed his bags and headed for Argentina, in search of the great American dream.
Today, it seems that Mr. Kim, who once worked on an Argentine peanut farm, has found that dream. Now 52 and an insurance entrepreneur, he is one of 35,000 South Korean immigrants who make up a prosperous and closely knit population here that is often the envy of other Argentines. 
 Since arriving in 1965, Mr. Kim, who speaks Spanish like a native, has brought nine of his siblings from Korea to Argentina, and all of them now own thriving businesses.
"In Korea, there were too many people and too few economic opportunities," Mr. Kim said. "When I arrived in Argentina, I thought it was a paradise, like virgin territory ripe for the harvesting if you were willing to work hard. And Koreans work very, very hard."
Indeed, the success of South Koreans in Argentina is particularly evident in the garment districts of Once and Flores here, where textile and retail businesses displaying Korean signs are quickly overshadowing establishments started decades ago by Jewish and Armenian immigrants.
The South Koreans operate more than 1,000 businesses in Argentina, including textile factories, electronics stores, pharmacies, real estate agencies, newspapers and a cable television channel, according to statistics provided by the South Korean Embassy. There are also 300 Korean cultural, athletic and business associations and 30 Protestant churches with predominantly Korean congregations.
Several shop owners in the largely Jewish garment district, speaking on condition of anonymity, complained that the South Koreans were "taking over the neighborhood."
The shop owners accused the South Koreans of selling merchandise at unfairly low prices because they reduced their costs by working 12 to 14 hours a day and hiring cheap labor from Bolivia.
Sociologists here say South Koreans represent the latest wave of skilled immigrants to come to Argentina since the huge influx of immigrants from Europe at the turn of the century.
To ease overcrowding in South Korea in the early 1960's, its Government sent missions to South America to forge immigration policies for its citizens. To persuade countries to accept South Koreans, the Government allowed its citizens to take as much as $40,000 with them to South America. The first to immigrate to South America went to Brazil in 1961. Argentina, Paraguay and Chile received the next wave four years later.
Many South Koreans chose to go to Argentina because there were fewer other Asians there, and thus what they saw as greater entrepreneurial opportunities.
From 1965 to 1985, about 6,000 South Koreans came to Argentina, and by 1985 the number had swelled to 50,000. But in the late 1980's the number of South Koreans in Argentina declined as many left for North America during the hard economic times caused by hyperinflation.
The sociologists attribute the success of the South Koreans to their entrepreneurship, access to shared credit and employment of family and cheap labor from neighboring countries.
"It is a community on the rise, both socially and economically," said Jorge Balan, a sociologist for the Center for Studies of State and Society, a think tank.
"Their great community cohesion and large families make them thrive in an informal economy. They contribute to the notion that we are still a place where immigrants want to come."
Still, settling in Argentina, where 90 percent of the population is of European stock, has not come easy for some South Koreans, who complain that they have encountered discrimination, which they say is partly owing to their race and partly to their good fortune here.
"There is discrimination because I am Korean, because I have an Oriental face," said Gunbae Kim, who came to Argentina three years ago and now imports mannequins from Korea.
He said, for example, that a Korean driver might be stopped more often than a native Argentine would be by a policemen looking for a bribe, even if the driver had not committed a traffic violation.
Adrianna Kim, 24, who runs a wholesale garment shop, said that after 10 years here, she feels basically at home.
"There is not so much discrimination in the streets, but there is always somebody who doesn't treat you well," she said. "At times, I did feel discrimination when I was at school."
Mr. Balan, the sociologist, said he believed that Koreans are experiencing the same amount of discrimination that other recent immigrants have felt in Argentina and in other countries.
"People don't throw tomatoes at them, but Koreans receive the same animosity and prejudices that the Jews had to go through," he said.
Perhaps some of that animosity toward Koreans stems from the current downturn in Argentina's economy and record level of unemployment.
"It's nice to have people from abroad but let Argentines get jobs first," said Victor Angel Orona, a taxi driver.
The image of South Koreans was hurt badly two years ago when local newspapers published a series of reports accusing several South Korean garment factories of operating sweat shops in which undocumented Bolivians were forced to work like "slaves."
Nico Kim, a 25-year-old student, who owns a film developing shop in the upscale Northside, said Argentines seem to see the Koreans as a monolith.
"Like in every race, there are good and bad Koreans," he said. "As people generally despise what they do not know, when some Koreans do something bad, there is a tendency to think that all Koreans are the same."
Now that the South Korean population has attained economic success in Argentina, its leaders say they are starting to focus their efforts on increasing education and political power.
Key Sung Cho, South Korean Ambassador to Argentina, said a major goal of South Koreans here is to send the second and third generations to college and eventually run a few candidates for public office.
Tony Kuo, who came to Argentina 22 years ago and owns a retailing shop, said that while his ethnic heritage is important to him and that he sends his children to a Korean school on the weekends, he is proud to be an Argentine citizen.
"When I returned to Korea in 1992, I missed Argentina," Mr. Kuo said. "The only reason I would leave Argentina is if I lose my business."

HEADLINE: Balkan Equation: Flawed Peace Hurts Less Than War

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The Balkan conflict has always been a three-way puzzle. Put one piece in place and another would be dislodged. Through more than four years of diplomacy, the reconciliation of Serbs, Croats and Muslims has proved impossible.
But now that the last difference between between Serbs and Croats has apparently been settled with an agreement on Eastern Slavonia, the political landscape has changed. For if Serbs and Croats really want and have reached peace, the potential for the Muslim-led Bosnian Government to fight on appears limited. 
 This is the grim equation faced by the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, in peace negotiations that began Nov. 1 here. He knows that the successes of the Bosnian Army against the Serbs this year have come only with the decisive support of Croatian forces. Without the Croats, who now appear to have little reason to continue the fight, even the long-term military outlook for the Bosnian Government may be dim.
A strong incentive to settle has thus been engineered by the Clinton Administration. More war now could be costly to the Bosnian Government, while peace, even an unsatisfactory one, would bring economic benefits and western military assistance. Beyond all the intractable difficulties over territory and governance that have stalled the talks in recent days, this somber realization suggests that an agreement may in the end be reached.
Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said today that "self-interest" should propel the parties toward a settlement. For the first time since the Yugoslav wars began in 1991, this may indeed be true.
Initially, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia was ruthlessly committed to defending the Serbs of Croatia and joining the land they inhabited with Serbia. The "Croatian nation" could secede from Yugoslavia, he said in March 1991. But, he added, "I want to make it completely clear that it should not occur to anyone that a part of the Serbian nation will be allowed to go with them."
To prove that point, the town of Vukovar in Eastern Slavonia was flattened by the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army and then captured in November 1991. Fighting laid waste to vast areas of Croatia and forced large numbers of Croats from their homes. About 30 percent of Croatia fell into Serbian hands during the 1991 Croatian war, only to be given up with scarcely a whimper during the last six months.
This surrender has amounted to an extraordinary, largely unexplained shift by Mr. Milosevic. To compare the sheer volume of munitions expended during the three-month siege of Vukovar with the Serbs' quiet agreement on Sunday to give up the town and the surrounding area to Croatia within the next two years is to gain a sense of the huge political journey undertaken by the Serbian President.
It is this journey that has opened the way to peace in the Balkans. If Serbia had fought against Croatia for Western Slavonia in May or for the Krajina in August, if it had decided to fight for Eastern Slavonia rather than give it up, then negotiations would never have come this far.
But Serbia seems committed, at least for now, to ending the Balkan wars. As a result, the decades-old conflict, sometimes overt, sometimes concealed, between Serbs and Croats seems to have been settled.
In the process, the Serbian minority in Croatia, about 13 percent of the population at the beginning of the war, has been reduced to about 3 percent. Like every resolution now envisaged in the Balkans, this was a settlement built on widespread eviction and killing.
But it is a settlement nonetheless, and it now begs the question: Can Bosnia's Muslims afford to fight on if the dominant forces in the area, the Serbs and Croats, are really committed to peace?
The Bosnian Government, its forces strengthened by 42 months of war and its determination reinforced by repeated Serbian atrocities against Muslim civilians, will not be pushed easily into an accord. It may calculate that the Serbian-Croatian agreement is tenuous and that the Bosnian Government's Croatian allies will eventually be ready to fight again to extend the territory of the Muslim-Croat federation.
Moreover, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, in particular, retains a deep emotional commitment to the unity of Bosnia as a multiethnic state, a commitment he has shown repeatedly here, officials said. Any peace proposal that appears to open the way for the permanent division of the state will therefore face great obstacles. Talks in Bosnia have made scant headway in recent days.
But there are some hard numbers at work, and they are now militating for peace. When Yugoslavia was founded in 1918, the Muslims accounted for 6 percent of the population. When it fell apart 73 years later, they accounted for 9 percent. The Muslim-led Bosnian Army cannot reasonably hope to prevail if confronted by Serbian resistance and Croatian passivity.
Croats and Serbs tore Yugoslavia apart and made war inescapable. Their reconciliation, in turn, however bitter it may be, may make peace inevitable.

HEADLINE: Catholic Bishops Urge Congress to Reject Social Cutbacks

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The National Conference of Catholic Bishops today urged Congress and the President to reject the limits on welfare and the cuts in the earned income tax credit that emerged this week from the Congressional reconciliation process.
The bishops also affirmed the major themes in the pastoral letter on economic justice passed 10 years ago, and they elected as president and vice president of their conference two bishops known for their commitments to fighting social and economic inequities. 
 The bishops' belief that poor people, children, immigrants and the unborn are threatened by the changes arising from Capitol Hill has injected a strong note of urgency and unanimity into a semiannual meeting of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops that otherwise promised to be a monotonous series of administrative tasks.
"If the Congress does not reject this fatally flawed legislation, we urge the President to veto it," the bishops said in a letter to all senators and representatives. "While the label is reform, the reality is cutting resources and shifting responsibilities."
The bishops objected in particular to the provisions mandating family caps in welfare payments, the reduction of the earned-income tax credit by $32 billion, measures making legal immigrants ineligible for some public benefits and "the block granting of a major share of Federal programs that protect and rescue children from abuse and neglect."
The cumulative effect of these changes, as well as cuts in the food stamp program and plans to replace guaranteed welfare and Medicaid benefits to all who qualify with lump-sum grants to the states, "will be devastating to poor and working families," the letter said.
Although written in the name of the conference, which brings together some bishops from all 188 dioceses, the letter was signed by Auxiliary Bishop John H. Ricard of Baltimore, chairman of the bishops' Domestic Policy Committee, and Roger Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles, who heads the bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities.
The letter challenged proponents of the welfare family cap who "insist that young women will base their decisions about childbearing on the availability of welfare assistance, and then claim that the denial of assistance will not influence their decision to end the lives of their unborn children."
The semiannual meetings of the Catholic bishops have increasingly become affairs where the prelates follow an agenda prepared well in advance, and work their way meticulously through piles of reports and proposals.
Last June some of the bishops complained that this style was making the conference more of a place for bureaucratic housekeeping than for addressing pressing problems of both church and society.
This concern may have been reflected in Cardinal Mahony's request on Monday to alter an agenda heavily weighted with reports on the pensions of retired bishops, the sale of church-owned television property and the translation from the Latin of certain prayers at Mass.
He called for a statement "in response to the current unprecedented dismantling by Congress of essential health care, educational and social service programs."
The statement will be presented and debated on Wednesday, but it has already given the gathering a new life and coherence. What might have been a routine document marking the 10th anniversary of "Economic Justice for All," the conference's pastoral letter on the American economy, took on immediate relevance.
In a passage Bishop Ricard quoted on the floor here, the anniversary document warns that "the power and productivity of the U.S. economy sometimes seems to be leading to three nations living side by side" -- a nation of the prosperous, a nation of those "squeezed" and perpetually insecure and a nation of the desperately poor.
Insisting that the economic debate is mired in "false choices and ideological polarization," the anniversary document juxtaposes themes from different ends of the political spectrum in what has become virtually a signature motif of bishops' statements:
"Our tradition emphasizes both rights and responsibilities, works for increased charity and insists on greater justice, advocates greater personal responsibility and broader social responsibility. We recognize the vital roles and limits of markets, government and voluntary groups.
The document underlines the word "and" in each sentence. All but two bishops voted in favor of it.
Although the appointment of more conservative bishops by Pope John Paul II has made the bishops' conference less adventurous and more riven by theological disputes, the bishops' concern for issues of social and economic welfare remains a strong factor of unity and continuity.
That was reflected in the election today of Bishop Anthony M. Pilla of Cleveland as the conference's new president and Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza of the Galveston-Houston area as its vice president.
Both bishops have the reputation of being centrists. Bishop Pilla has undertaken a major project joining the urban and rural parts of the Cleveland diocese with the suburbs to build a sense of common well-being.
Bishop Fiorenza, who is 64, heads a diocese in which roughly 6 out 7 Catholics are Hispanic. He was was chairman of the bishops' committee that oversaw the Campaign for Human Development, a program that distributes more than $10 million collected in parishes to local antipoverty projects around the country. As current vice president of the bishops' conference, Bishop Pilla was expected to succeed William Cardinal Keeler of Baltimore in the top post. But Bishop Fiorenza's election as vice president -- and quite likely as president three years from now -- signals that although the conference has grown gradually more conservative over the past 15 years, its leadership will remain centrist and pastoral in outlook.

HEADLINE: Returning From Decline, 42d Street Is Now a Magnet for Merchants

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In the latest sign that the long-stalled revitalization of 42d Street is close to becoming reality, developers said yesterday that 18 merchants had leased space in buildings at the intersection of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, and that a bidding war had broken out for space in another building nearby.
On the growing list of entertainment companies that want space on the street -- the fabled block between Broadway and Eighth Avenue -- is RKO Pictures, a major Hollywood studio. The developers said they hope to lease space for a complex of theme restaurants, which would be called the RKO Hollywood Palace. 
 The complex would be sandwiched between two other entertainment projects already under contract -- a Madame Tussaud's wax museum and a movie complex operated by the American Multi-Theater Company.
But the negotiations with RKO, first reported yesterday in The New York Post, comes amid a flood of bids by restaurant operators, theaters and others hoping for a spot on a street that for decades had been a tawdry reminder of urban decline.
"I have never seen such extensive interest among tenants, or such interesting interest," said Bruce Ratner, president of Forest City Ratner, a development company designated by city and state officials to renovate three theaters and to build new commercial space along a 370-foot strip on the south side of 42d Street, midway between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.
Mr. Ratner said RKO was one of 20 companies that had submitted proposals for restaurants or what he called off-beat attractions. Final selection is to be made and construction begin by July, he said. At the intersection of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, a development group that includes the Prudential Insurance Company of America and George Klein, a Manhattan builder, is completing the renovation and new construction of 19 stores. Nearly all the stores are already committed to retailers and restaurants, the developers said yesterday.
"The interest has been extrordinary," said Michelle Demilly, a spokeswoman for the development group, Times Square Center Associates.
Foot Loose, a clothing store specializing in socks and leg wear, opened on Monday, the first of the new stores to do so. Others that have signed on for space at the intersection include Old Navy Clothing Company, a clothing store chain owned by The Gap; Hansen's Brewery, a German pub; Alien New York, a virtual reality emporium, and Magic Max, a magic store. A delicatessen, theater gift shop and a branch of Ferrara's, the cafe based in Little Italy, are also among tenants soon to move to the 42d Street corners, Ms. Demilly said.
She said all 19 stores would be occupied within six months.
The growing momentum toward a revitalized, family oriented entertainment strip on 42d Street comes after two development milestones in the last year.
The first came a year ago when Mr. Klein and Prudential agreed to renovate the 19 stores clustering around the intersection of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue intersection, and to contribute more than $10 million for the renovation of historic 42d Street theaters, in an agreement that indefinitely postponed their plans for huge office towers at the intersection.
That plan, hatched in the early 1970's, involved huge long-term property tax breaks for the developers. But the office project was delayed by dozens of lawsuits, and ultimately by the steep economic downturn and office glut that emerged at the end of the 1980's.
More important, according to government officials and developers, was a commitment signed in July by the Walt Disney Company to renovate the New Amsterdam theater, on the south side of 42d Street, as a base for its own productions like "Beauty and the Beast."
Since then, Disney has joined a partnership with the Tishman Urban Development Company, to build a hotel at the northeast corner of 42d Street and Eighth Avenue.
Given a stamp of approval by Disney, developers say, 42nd Street has become a powerful magnet for other companies.
"Before Disney came in, just about the only expressions of interest in the theaters were mud wrestling clubs," said Cora Cahan, president of the New 42d Street Inc., a not-for-profit group designated by the state in 1990 to supervise the renovation of six historic 42d Street theaters. "Now the street has been reinvented."
Since Disney first expressed interest in the New Amsterdam a year ago, all but two of the nine 42d Street theaters have been committed in long-term leases. Besides Disney's, the largest commitment has been by Livent, a Toronto-based production company that plans to renovate and combine the Lyric Theater and the Academy Theater for musical productions.

HEADLINE: Divorced Father's Case Raises Difficult Issues Of Who Pays Tuition

BYLINE: By LINDA MATHEWS 

 BODY:
When Amber Kline turned 18 in 1992, her father, Philip, went to court in Pennsylvania to terminate the order that required him to pay $375 a month for her support. He argued that she had become an adult, in the eyes of the law, and that he should not be forced to put her through college or contribute in any way to her living expenses.
Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Legislature was taking a different view of parental obligations. In 1993, the Legislature enacted a law that made divorced parents responsible for their children's college expenses, or at least as much of those expenses as the parents could afford. 
 That law, Act 62, did not discourage Mr. Kline. "I'm not big on having the government in my face, telling me what to do," he said recently.
Mr. Kline, who owns a company that sells industrial equipment, broadened his original case to challenge the new statute, and last month he won a ruling from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the law violated his rights and the rights of all divorced parents under the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.
The state Supreme Court, on a 4-to-2 vote, adopted Mr. Kline's reasoning that since parents who are still married to each other cannot be ordered to pay their children's college bills, parents who are divorced should not be subject to such orders.
The court's ruling applies only to Pennsylvanians, but it is being studied elsewhere. That is because the issue of who should be responsible for paying college expenses is debated not only by the children of divorce and their parents but also by matrimonial lawyers, college financial aid offices and state legislatures.
Across the country, the picture is confused. A divorced parent's obligation to a college-age child often depends on where they live. At least nine state legislatures have decreed that noncustodial parents, usually fathers, can be ordered to help pay for college. In other states, including New York and New Jersey, state courts routinely require parents to pay for college if they have the means. But in New Jersey, the Legislature is considering reversing that rule and freeing noncustodial parents from any obligation.
The parent's duty may also depend on where the child goes to college. Even if there is no legal obligation, most private colleges, in distributing financial aid, demand that both parents help meet a child's expenses. Public universities, on the other hand, ask only the custodial parent to help.
Legally, in most states, parents are required to support only their minor children. As soon as a child turns 18 or graduates from high school, the obligation of parents, married or divorced, vanishes. But in an era when most high school graduates go on to college, there is a widespread expectation that children will depend on their parents financially into their early 20's.
Ultimately, that is what happened to the Klines. After not speaking with Amber for eight years, Mr. Kline reconciled with her during the litigation. Now 21, she works for him at Philip H. Kline & Company, and he voluntarily pays her tuition at Kutztown University.
But the Klines are hardly typical.
The children of divorce are less likely to attend college than children from intact families. A 1992 study by the Federal Department of Education showed that 71 percent of the offspring of intact families went to college, as opposed to 54 percent of those whose parents were divorced. Money was a major obstacle for the children of divorce; their family incomes were consistently lower than those of intact families, and only 6 percent of the custodial parents said they expected their former spouses to help pay college bills.
"Clearly, the children of divided families face greater economic and emotional obstacles in pursuing post-secondary schooling," said Albert Momjian, a Philadelphia divorce lawyer and past president of the Pennsylvania chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. "That's why you have state legislatures getting involved, and why it seems to us there's a rational basis for these laws."
Like divorce lawyers, college deans complain that they get caught up in battles over whether both parents will pay the bills.
"This is one of the most difficult issues facing financial aid administrators," said David F. Charlow, director of student financial planning at Columbia College and the School of Engineering. "There are parents who act as if they have divorced their kids as well as their spouses."
Jim Tilton, director of undergraduate financial aid at Yale University, said, "We've seen more and more of these cases in the past two or three years, perhaps because of the sheer number of divorces."
In unraveling the problem of how much each parent should pay, colleges get very little guidance from the courts. "Often, there was no agreement when the marriage broke up about whether the noncustodial parent would contribute to the cost of college," said Cynthia A. Rife, assistant director of financial aid at Stanford University.
"But our view is that it doesn't matter whether the parent has a legal obligation to contribute to the child's expenses," Ms. Rife added. "We think there's a moral obligation for each parent, both the custodial parent and the noncustodial parent, to contribute."
Nearly all private colleges and universities follow the same rule. "If the parent is involved in the child's life after the divorce, then he's morally obligated" to help pay college bills, said Mr. Charlow, the Columbia financial aid director. "A parent can't choose to be involved in some aspects of a kid's life and uninvolved in other aspects."
Exceptions to that rule are rare. "Only if there is a history of abuse or a long-term history of nonsupport and noninvolvement do we say, 'Forget it,' " said James S. Miller, financial aid director at Harvard College.
But when a parent who can afford to pay something "absolutely balks," Mr. Charlow said, "that unwillingness won't result" in a bigger scholarship.
"Instead, we work with the other parent to figure out a strategy for the family to cover the bills," he said. "Sometimes it means the student or the custodial parent takes a bigger loan."
At a high-cost private college, a typical financial aid package includes a scholarship, which is an outright gift that need not be paid back, as well as a loan and a part-time job for the student. Both parents are also expected to contribute from their current income, savings or assets, and the student must use some savings or summer earnings.
Colleges have not always been so insistent that both parties to a divorce pitch in. "Ten years ago, we never asked a noncustodial parent to contribute," said Ms. Rife of Stanford. "Our policy changed for pragmatic reasons. We need to stretch our funds further. There are more people who need financial aid."
Public universities are less insistent that both parents contribute. The University of California at Berkeley, for example, expects only the custodial parent to help pay for college and makes no effort to pursue the noncustodial parent, even if that parent's income is higher.
The university follows the example of the Federal Government, said Richard Black, director of financial aid at the university. The form students fill out to qualify for Federal grants and loans -- the Free Application for Federal Student Aid -- requires information only about the income of the custodial parent and, if he or she has remarried, the stepparent. Nothing is expected from the noncustodial parent.
"If an absent parent says, 'No, I'm not paying for my kid to go to Harvard or Columbia,' the family has a fallback position," said Mr. Black, the author of "The Complete Family Guide to College Financial Aid" (Perigee). "They can send the kid to Cal or the State University of New York or the public university in their state. Public universities see ourselves as the place that will guarantee a talented kid a first-rate education for relatively little money, no matter what his parents contribute."
Chris Knickerbocker, director of student financial aid and employment at SUNY Binghamton, said the SUNY system had what she called a "don't-ask, don't-tell" standard. "We don't ask for information about the noncustodial parent even if we know he could afford to pay," Ms. Knickerbocker said. "And we don't tell him what he should pay."
The Federal standard is so loose, Ms. Knickerbocker said, that "if you're Donald Trump and you have a student in college, you can get some Federal financial aid in the form of a loan."
College administrators say that divorced parents are far less likely to help with college bills if they have been estranged from their children. That was the case with Mr. Kline, who said he did not "see or even talk to my children for eight years after I separated from my wife."
Mr. Kline had adopted Amber and her brother, Jason, soon after he married their mother, Bonita, in 1977. The Klines then had a child of their own, Rebecca, now 15, before separating in 1984.
He blames his former wife, who has remarried and is now known as Bonita Curtis, for discouraging contact but admits that he was also responsible for losing contact.
"I was just boiling over with anger, especially when the kids told me they didn't want to see me again," Mr. Kline recalled. "Their mother put them up to it, and although I'm not angry anymore, I don't think I'll ever completely forgive her."
Mrs. Curtis declined to comment.
Mr. Kline first tried to modify the $850-a-month support order for the three children when Jason, now 23, reached college age. A court reduced the amount by $100, but ordered Mr. Kline to continue to pay $375 a month for each girl. He renewed his legal attack when Amber finished high school. That request led to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision.
Mr. Kline reconciled with his children soon after a hearing where Amber burst into tears on the witness stand while describing her troubled relationship with her father. "I decided she wasn't faking it, that she really believed I didn't want to see her," he said. "And I figured it was up to me to set things right."
He said his relationship with all three children was now better than ever. Amber lives with her mother and helps with receiving and shipping three days a week at Mr. Kline's business while attending art classes part time. Mr. Kline also pays her tuition at Kutztown and has helped her buy a car.
"Everything has turned out wonderfully, far better than I would ever have predicted," Amber Kline said.
Jason, who graduated in June from West Chester University, works as a geographer and mapmaker in California.
If Jason were to go to graduate school, "I would help him in a minute," Mr. Kline said, and "there's no doubt that I will help pay for Rebecca's college."
"What I objected to all along was that the burden of supporting the kids seemed to be entirely on me," he added. "I could afford to support them. I could afford to send them to college. But I hated the idea that a court was meddling in my business."

HEADLINE: Putting the Squeeze on Small Discounters

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

DATELINE: MOHEGAN LAKE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Leaning against her shopping cart, surrounded by bright orange going-out-of-business signs, Maryann Dickman gave her eulogy for the Jamesway discount store here in northern Westchester County.
"I liked it here once," said Mrs. Dickman, an office manager from nearby Putnam Valley. "But everything's changed. There's no selection, they haven't kept it up at all, and the quality isn't good. Wal-Mart is a half-hour away and Jamesway is five minutes, but I would rather go to Wal-Mart. I just like it. Even my husband finds it better." 
 The Jamesway Corporation, the 34-year-old company that was until recently one of the country's largest regional discount chains, is now unloading everything from the simulated-wood desks in its corporate offices to the economy packs of toilet tissue and the racks they are stocked on in its 90 stores.
Jamesway is just the latest and worst example of what has happened during the last few years to nearly every discount store in the Northeast, the birthplace of regional discounting. Each of the largest chains -- Bradlees, Ames, Caldor and Hills -- has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at some point, and it is almost certain that at least one of them will join Jamesway in the retailing graveyard.
The conventional wisdom is that Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discount giant that has plodded its way into the region in recent years, has consumed its competitors' market share. Much of the remainder was lapped up by the Kmart Corporation, which won over shoppers with price cuts that grew deeper as its own fortunes faltered, and by "category killer" specialty stores like Bed, Bath and Beyond and the Sports Authority, which focus on one type of merchandise.
But in fact, regional discount chains have also shared a myriad of other problems: dingy stores, mediocre customer service and critical strategic errors, like the relentless accumulation of more and more stores in the late 1980's with money that would have been better spent on inventory and distribution systems, and a seeming inability to reshuffle merchandise to better serve rapidly evolving consumer preferences.
A close look at Jamesway, which sought Chapter 11 protection twice before finally going under this month, reveals a company that was a victim of poor retail conditions, bad management and perhaps a touch of hubris -- all things shared by its ailing competitors.
"There are so many factors in place with the failure of discount stores," said Peter Schaeffer, a retail analyst at Dillon, Read. "You can't just say anymore, 'Oh, it will turn around.' Because I don't think it can."
In a recent interview at Jamesway's corporate headquarters in Secaucus, N.J., Kevin Kulinowski, vice president of operations, recalled Christmas 1990, a moment he now views as the turning point for the company.
The economy was in disarray, joblessness was growing and Jamesway's previous business decisions were starting to catch up with it. "I remember we had two promotions right before Christmas, and one Sunday everything was 20 percent off," he said. "We had tons of business and made no money. And I thought to myself, 'O.K., this is how we are going to do things from now on.' "
Wal-Mart, whose enormous size lets it spread fixed central costs and gives it tremendous buying power and muscle in securing prime real estate -- to say nothing of low prices -- was still a threat looming in the distance. But by 1990 it was already winning an important technological war that other discounters did not seem to know was on.
"Wal-Mart has the most advanced inventory technology in the business and they have invested billions in it," said Kurt Barnard, president of the Barnard Retail Marketing Report, a trade publication. "Even Herb Fisher did not take into consideration that the future was destined to have technology as its central role," he said of the late and much beloved founder of Jamesway, Herbert Fisher.
With a few keystrokes, Wal-Mart's distribution workers can figure out what items are needed by any of the company's stores -- and then see to their speedy delivery. By contrast, Jamesway's antiquated methods of tracking stock hurt the company badly as customers' likes and dislikes changed toward the end of the decade, and as the need to unload inventory became more urgent.
"What we never knew in this company was what actually sold," said John Sipala, a senior vice president who is now the company's chief financial officer.
Consequently, merchandise that moved well was suddenly put on sale, which resulted in a needless surrender of margins. And popular items were eliminated; one day, for instance, Jamesway decided that it would no longer sell yarn, to the great vexation of many of its elderly customers.
Instead of inventory systems, Jamesway and its competitors spent their profits on real estate in the 80's. By the end of the decade, the company had placed 90 discount stores throughout the Northeast, some in the backyards of Kmart and Caldor.
Likewise, Ames Department Stores Inc., based in Rocky Hill, Conn., went into 32 months of bankruptcy protection in 1990 as a result of debt created by the 1988 purchase of the former Zayre chain of discount stores. Bradlees, based in Braintree, Mass., also expanded, adding a sprawling store in Manhattan even when other discounters were already sinking.
But asking discounters why they continued to open new stores is akin to asking New Yorkers why they stand in the gutter while waiting to cross the street: It doesn't get them any where faster, but it creates a comforting illusion of progress. "There was this urge to compete, to be bigger, to get the leases before the competition," Mr. Kulinowski said. "And now we're all paying for it."
Now, as the discounters face financial crises, the storefronts are ballast, too small to entice a Wal-Mart or Target to acquire them. And the names themselves lack the cachet that would draw buyers.
Simple esthetic questions also plague the discounters. Stores like the one here were ignored, left with a dated feel that was only deepened by poor lighting, unattractive floor designs and piped-in elevator music.
"We didn't put a lot of money into remodeling stores," Mr. Sipala acknowledged. "It's amazing how when a customer feels good in a store, they want to spend money there."
Nor did customer service enhance the shopping experience. "It was always a hassle here," said Robin Vogt, as she cruised the discount toy aisles here with her husband, Don. "There was never anyone at the cash register. No one was helpful."
By the time the discounters finally got around to reacting to Wal-Mart and Kmart, the "category killers" stepped in, with their huge inventories of discounted specialty merchandise.
And department stores, deeply wounded in the consolidation fever that struck in the beginning of the 1990's, began beating discounters at their own game. They brought down prices and overhead, largely through the consolidation of giant operations, and started snacking on discounters' market shares.
During times of turmoil, Jamesway clearly needed good leadership. In 1990, the company's president, Arlie Lazarus, left, and Mr. Fisher temporarily came out of retirement. From there, four different presidents came through the door, including Peter Hollis, who had lost credibility in the retail community with mishaps at Ames, where he was president, and other discounters. None of the men were seen to have the merchandising panache or the interpersonal skills of Mr. Fisher.
Now that a pattern has been set with troubled discounters, suppliers and the factors that buy their receivables have begun running for lifeboats in situations that just a few years ago would have left them merely tapping anxiously on the deck.
The Caldor Corporation, for example, filed for Chapter 11 in September, surprising some investors who thought the store was more liquid than some of its competitors. But suppliers, reacting to Wall Street gossip that placed Caldor executives at the bank looking for debtor-in-possession cash, quickly pulled the plug on the company.
Bradlees Inc., though perhaps in worse shape than Caldor, may have been similarly shoved into bankruptcy.
"The Northeast has become sort of a burial ground," Mr. Barnard said.
Some chains are making attempts to shed or narrowly focus their discount-store image in an effort to differentiate themselves from competitors. Venture Stores Inc., a 25-year-old chain based in Fallon, Mo., has ditched its no-name merchandise and will try to upgrade its image by focusing on name-brand sports apparel and private label cookware. Kmart is test-marketing a new "pantry concept," hoping that potato chips and other consumable goods will bring in new customers.
Both plans are suspect, relying on products with slim margins or on creating whole new images for familiar stores. "But if you're standing on the window ledge of a four-story building and it's burning, you can jump and you might die, but if you stay, you'll burn to death," said Barry Bryant, senior director of institutional equity sales at Rodman & Renshaw Inc.
Many retail experts believe that in the end regional discount stores are undergoing an organic cycle, with the strongest and fittest surviving and the weakest dying a necessary death. As it is, today's struggling chains in the Northeast are really survivors of an earlier round of consolidations in the 1970's and 80's, when Zayre, Arlan's Department Stores and Mammoth Mart Inc. went out of business.
"Regional department stores have a reason to be," said Mr. Schaeffer of Dillon, Read, "because they can offer local tastes. But there is no need for regional discounters. Motor oil is the same in New York as it is in Florida. Now they can offer the assortment that Wal-mart does, but they can't offer the price, and the bottom line is, the consumer is getting sick of being ripped off."

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Cuts Commercial Bank Premiums

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation decided today to virtually eliminate deposit insurance premiums for most commercial banks after concluding that its insurance fund had enough money to cover bank failures in the coming months.
Bankers welcomed the unanimous decision by the agency's board, which will take effect on Jan. 1 and save them $946 million a year in premiums. Industry lobbyists waged a vigorous campaign to eliminate the premiums, arguing that they were unnecessary after the Bank Insurance Fund late last spring reached its Congressionally mandated target of $1.25 in reserves for every $100 of insured deposits. 
 Ricki Helfer, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., said premiums needed to be reduced because of the banking industry's current health, the economy's strength and the expectation of F.D.I.C. examiners that few banks would fail soon. Premiums will still be collected for some banks with risky business practices and less solid finances. Still, the income from premiums as a share of insured deposits will fall to the lowest level in the 62 years of Federal deposit insurance.
Consumer activists and even some of the board's members criticized the decision. "Under a better system, we would be allowed to build up a surplus in better times that we would run off in bad times," said Jonathan L. Fiechter, the acting director of the Office of Thrift Supervision and one of the four sitting members of the F.D.I.C.'s board.
But Mr. Fiechter voted for the premium reduction anyway, saying that current law left the board with little choice once the fund had clearly met the target for reserves.
Ralph Nader, the consumer activist, contended that the $25.08 billion now in the Bank Insurance Fund could be exhausted easily by the collapse of one or two of the giant banks now forming from the industry's many mergers, leaving taxpayers with the burden of paying for any further failures. Today's decision "is a prescription for another round of corporate bank welfare," he said.
For complicated political reasons, savings institution executives welcomed today's fee reduction even though it did not immediately help them and could even hurt them in the short run. The savings industry's insurance fund, which the F.D.I.C. also oversees, has only 37 cents in reserves for every $100 in insured deposits, and is growing slowly.
As a result, even healthy savings institutions are paying 23 cents in premiums for every $100 in deposits and will continue to do so. Healthy banks paid roughly the same premium until last summer, when it was reduced to 4 cents for every $100.
The latest reduction in bank fees gives banks a temporary competitive advantage over savings institutions. But legislation now moving through Congress would impose a one-time assessment of $5.7 billion early next year on savings institutions to bring their insurance fund up to the target of $1.25 for every $100 of deposits. So savings institutions have an incentive for premiums to be as low as possible once the target is reached.
The F.D.I.C. board voted today to eliminate the remaining 4-cent premium and replace it with a $2,000 fee for each healthy bank regardless of size -- the lowest assessment that the agency is allowed by law to collect. The board puts 92 percent of the nation's banks, with 94.6 percent of the nation's insured deposits, in its top category of financial health, for which premiums will be virtually eliminated.
The healthiest banks are those with good records of avoiding risky business practices and with high ratios of capital -- their cushion against losses -- to assets. The F.D.I.C. also reduced slightly but did not eliminate the premiums for banks with less capital and with business records that are not so safe.
Premiums for the weakest, riskiest banks will fall to 27 cents for every $100 of insured deposits from 31 cents; premiums for the weakest savings institutions will stay at 31 cents.

HEADLINE: Most Retailers' Profits Shrink as Competition Heats Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The fierce competition that has kept consumers awash in bargains has taken a heavy toll on retailers, industry figures showed today.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest chain, eked out a modest increase in profits for its third fiscal quarter, but the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the J. C. Penney Company and the Woolworth Corporation all posted declines. 
 In another sign of a possibly dispiriting holiday sales season, the Commerce Department reported today a larger-than-expected sag in retail sales during October, with nonautomotive goods recording the biggest decline since February.
"We're losing steam on the consumer side," said Bob Buchanan, senior retail analyst at NatWest Securities in New York. "It's down, heading into the most important period of the year."
Meanwhile, a later though narrower gauge suggested that colder weather may have stirred consumers a bit. A Johnson Redbook Service survey found that store sales climbed 2.2 percent during the two weeks ended Saturday, compared with the period a month earlier.
But the mood remained subdued as industry analysts cited a number of trends that weighed down retailers while providing consumers with hope for large preholiday discounts.
High consumer debt and lagging incomes leave little room for splurging on gifts, while the aging of the baby-boom generation -- its elders turn 50 next year -- means less spending for the stylish products of youth and more need to think of college tuitions and nursing homes.
Clothing sales have been particularly hard hit, suffering also from the trend toward more casual business and other apparel at a time of ferocious foreign competition.
"We've got just too many apparel stores," said Karen Sack, who analyzes stocks of retailers for Standard & Poor's. "These companies cannot raise prices."
The two-tenths of 1 percent decline in retail sales last month came in spite of the strong housing market, reflected in the number of existing and new homes changing hands. Typically, the repair and decoration associated with moving generate substantial spending but this did not occur in October.
Merchants selling furniture and other goods for the home saw volume fall eight-tenths of 1 percent while those selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes had a sales drop of four-tenths of 1 percent.
The only category of durable goods to show an increase was in automotive sales, which rebounded seven-tenths of 1 percent following a 2 percent decline in September. Since producers previously reported selling fewer cars last month, the rise reflected a combination of price increases, more sales of higher-priced models and seasonal adjustments, analysts said.
Excluding the automotive sector, retail sales in October slumped five-tenths of 1 percent, the worst performance in eight months.
Among nondurables, or items not expected to last three years, sales increased at only drug and variety stores, up eight-tenths of 1 percent, and food stores, up seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Sales dropped 2.4 percent at stores selling apparel and accessories, 1.5 percent at gasoline service stations (partly reflecting lower prices), 1.1 percent at department stores and other outlets selling general merchandise, and three-tenths of 1 percent at bars and restaurants.
The figures are adjusted for seasonal variation and for holidays but not for inflation. In the latest 12 months, retail sales increased 3 percent -- but only half of this is higher volume because inflation for consumer goods ran at 1.5 percent for the year that ended in September.
The Commerce Department, which said it would not issue any more economic reports until the Government reopens for normal business, trimmed its estimate of the rise in September retail sales to one-tenth of 1 percent from three-tenths of 1 percent, while raising its estimate of August sales by the same amount to seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Meanwhile, Wal-Mart used its muscle to capture customers from mostly weaker competitors, enabling it to report an earnings gain of 4.1 percent in its fiscal third quarter. Net income totaled $612 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $588 million, or 26 cents, in the third quarter of 1994.
The company, which has long enjoyed double-digit profit gains, is investing heavily in new stores in this country and abroad, Ms. Sack said.
Sales at the discount giant's 1,965 Wal-Mart stores rose 12 percent, to $16.2 billion, while Sam's Wholesale Club sales rose 3 percent, to $4.7 billion.
But Dayton Hudson, whose largest property is the Target chain, saw its earnings decline 34.3 percent. Net income totaled $44 million, or 45 cents a share, down from $67 million, or 86 cents, in the comparable 1994 quarter. Revenues, however, advanced to $5.6 billion, 10 percent higher for all stores and 4 percent higher on a same-store basis.
The Minneapolis-based company called Target's performance "solid" while Mervyn's was "slightly below plan" and the department stores were "weak."
For J. C. Penney, based in Plano, Tex., quarterly earnings slipped 12.4 percent. Net income fell to $240 million, or $1 a share, from $274 million, or $1.11, a year earlier.
"While we are disappointed with our third-quarter performance, our expenses are under control and our inventories are in line with current sales expectations," James E. Oesterreicher, vice chairman and chief executive, said.
Sales edged down four-tenths of 1 percent, to $5.1 billion. Analysts said Penney had lost apparel sales to Wal-Mart and Sears, Roebuck & Company, both of which have been significantly stepping up their efforts in soft goods.
At Woolworth, earnings slipped 8.1 percent. Net income fell to $34 million, or 26 cents a share, from $37 million, or 28 cents, in the comparable 1994 quarter. Revenue dropped 1.1 percent, to $2.1 billion.
Analysts said profits, about a nickel below Wall Street expectations, were hurt by weak back-to-school sales and the need to cut prices.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan Says Its Banks' Woes Aren't as Bad as They Seemed

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Despite the Japanese banking industry's much publicized difficulties, the Ministry of Finance announced today that the industry's operating profits had soared and that total bad loans were below its previous estimate.
Today's announcements seemed aimed both at trying to reshape the ministry's image, which has been tarnished recently by the Daiwa Bank scandal, and at improving the view abroad of Japanese banks. 
 "We can't change the criticism and opinion immediately," Sei Nakai, a senior banking official in the Ministry of Finance, said today. "But by repeating this kind of practice, we'd like to gradually resume our trust not only among the Japanese people, but among the people all over the world."
The new figures, which the ministry said were based on reports from financial institutions and local governments, seem to suggest that the bad-debt problem is not as large as many foreign bankers had thought. Still, a skeptical foreign banking community, which has recently tightened credit and raised the interest rates on loans to Japanese institutions, is not likely to be convinced immediately.
Mr. Nakai said that bad debts at the end of September totaled 37.4 trillion yen, roughly $367 billion.
The ministry once put the total amount of bad debt as high as $490 billion and the amount of unrecoverable loans at $98 billion to $147 billion. But those figures, the ministry emphasized today, were simply estimates and were not based on data from individual institutions.
Bad debts include those in which repayment is late but is expected eventually. In the new numbers, the bad debts estimated to be unrecoverable, or never to be repaid, rose from previous estimates, to 18.29 trillion yen, about $179 billion. That is the equivalent of 3.9 percent of the national economic output last year.
Some foreign analysts have estimated that bad debts could run as high as $650 billion, but Mr. Nakai disagreed today.
"They are wrong," he said. "We have collected reports from all the banks, and if their report is a false one, then they will be subject to our penalty."
Partly because of the recent scandal at Daiwa Bank, where a New York-based trader hid $1.1 billion in losses for more than 11 years, foreign institutions have become increasingly suspicious of Japanese accounting practices and financial statements.
"The biggest problem is this concern that banks do not always disclose accurate numbers," said Paul Heaton, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets (Asia) Ltd.
The ministry also released preliminary figures today showing that all banks' net operating profits for the six months that ended in September rose nearly 50 percent, to $33 billion.
Net income for the six months, however, was up just 2.8 percent, to $4.6 billion. The disposal of bad loans reduced the large operating profits.
Partly out of embarrassment, many Japanese banks have hesitated to disclose all their bad debt and reworked loans; many foreign analysts say such figures are crucial in evaluating the creditworthiness of an institution.
But some creditworthy Japanese banks may want to increase financial disclosure voluntarily to distinguish themselves and shave off some of the "Japan premium" that foreign banks charge on loans to Japanese banks.
Both the ministry and the Bank of Japan, the central bank, have called upon the banking industry to increase disclosure and publicize its plans for disposing of bad debt.
"Now is the time for individual financial institutions to specifically present the way and the timing for the disposal of bad loans," Toshihiko Fukui, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, said Monday.
The Bank of Japan has been helping the banks by keeping interest rates low. When asked today about the central bank's virtual subsidy to the banks, Mr. Nakai of the Finance Ministry replied that a similar policy was adopted in the United States in the early 1990's.
"We have just started," he said.

Some Philadelphia hotels withhold a magazine from rooms of travel agents at a convention.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
EACH month free copies of Philadelphia magazine are put in the guest rooms of Center City hotels in Philadelphia, but the November issue was withheld from a number of hotels last week.
The reason? The American Society of Travel Agents was in town for a weeklong convention, its first in Philadelphia, and some hoteliers as well as the president of the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau, Tom Muldoon, regarded the magazine's cover article inappropriate for the 6,300 delegates. 
 Titled "The Issue Is Race," the cover features a photograph of two boys, one black and one white, with the black boy's arms around the white boy. "The civil rights movement was 30 years ago," the cover says, concluding, "In 1995, why can't Philadelphians see beyond black and white?"
Mr. Muldoon did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment. But R. C. Staab, a bureau spokesman, said that Mr. Muldoon did not ask hoteliers to bar the magazine. "He asked them to read it first and decide whether it was appropriate to put in rooms," Mr. Staab said. He added that Mr. Muldoon described as "inaccurate" an article titled "Tourist Trap," which contrasts the Convention Center (which the magazine said was widely perceived as "upscale and white") with the nearby Gallery shopping mall (widely perceived as "downscale and black").
Several hotels put the magazine in rooms, as usual, but the Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, Latham and Warwick did not. Jim Beley, the general manager of the Ritz-Carlton, said yesterday: "I don't think of it as censorship; it was an issue of economics. We didn't feel the content was appropriate at a time when the city has invested so much to bring A.S.T.A. here, in hopes of attracting tourists and convention business."
Eliot Kaplan, the editor of Philadelphia magazine, said of the timing: "We weren't even thinking of A.S.T.A. We saw the issue as an attempt to open a dialogue on race. But apparently in parts of the birthplace of freedom, you still can't have a dialogue about it."
 
A Security Riddle
With airports security at its tightest since the Persian Gulf war, the following sounds like an example of that Churchillian "riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma":
After being dropped off at the ramp at the Delta Air Lines terminal at New York's Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 14, Leif Wassermann, the commercial attache at the Danish Consulate in New York, said he walked upstairs to the ticket counter and, after checking in to get his boarding pass, went directly to the gate to board Flight 68 for Copenhagen -- without passing through metal detectors or undergoing a security check of any kind.
In a letter to Ronald W. Allen, Delta's chairman, Mr. Wassermann described himself as "amazed, anguished and shocked with the lack of security at Delta J.F.K." In a subsequent telephone interview, Mr. Wassermann said he saw security checks at other entrances to the terminal, but none along the route he took from the ramp to the gate. Nor was he mollified by a letter from Delta that arrived on Monday, essentially saying that it is impossible to board a flight without passing through a security screen.
"I can't explain how I did it," Mr. Wassermann said, "but why after I wrote Delta a letter and followed up with two phone calls, didn't they ask me to come out to the airport and show how I did it?"
Told of Mr. Wassermann's story earlier this week, a Delta spokesman, Bill Berry, reacted with incredulity. More than a month ago Delta began demanding identification of every adult passenger, even on domestic flights, rather than leaving it to the discretion of individual ticket agents, as Federal laws allows. "I can't believe it," Mr. Berry said. "It just doesn't seem possible."
Yesterday Mr. Berry said that Delta security officials at Kennedy ran a series of tests and insisted that security was not breached and could not be breached unintentionally. "They wonder if Mr. Wassermann is thinking of the more obvious, two-step security procedures used in Europe," Mr. Berry said, "compared with what is often a one-step procedure used in exiting the U.S."
In any event, Mr. Berry said that Delta's chief of security at Kennedy would soon telephone Mr. Wassermann and invite him to the airport.
 
Airlines Are Rated
Only two United States airlines ranked among the top 20 in Conde Nast Traveler's latest poll: Midwest Express, in 15th place, and Alaska Airlines, No. 17. Midwest Express, based in Milwaukee, scored high in cabin comfort, as well as service and food. Alaska, based in Seattle, scored high in punctuality, scheduling and baggage handling.
Singapore Airlines was voted the top-ranking carrier and Swissair second, reversing last year's first- and second-place finishes. Quantas, Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific rounded out the top five.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Anxiety Over Budget Impasse Lowers Dollar vs. Yen and Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened broadly yesterday, hurt by growing investor nervousness over the budget impasse in Washington and new pessimism about the Mexican economy.
Currency traders said the lack of progress to reach a budget compromise, which forced a partial shutdown of the Federal Government, was creating increased anxiety among holders of dollar-denominated investments. 
 Although the Treasury took strong steps on Monday to avert default on payment of its credit obligations, which helped reassure the financial markets, the effects of those steps were seen as temporary. Yesterday, currency traders looked for hints that the crisis would soon be over, but found none.
"I'm surprised that anybody wants to hold dollars," said Elena Shperling, chief currency trader at the New York branch of the Banco di Sicilia. "It's not that the Treasury is in such grave danger. But the Government looks pretty bad to outsiders. A lot of people in Europe are wondering what's going on here."
Wayne Grigull, director of foreign exchange sales at Merrill Lynch & Company, said, "I think the market is impatient for something substantive to come out of Washington." When traders saw no progress, he said, "they sold the dollar."
In New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 101.51 Japanese yen from 101.91 yen on Monday. It also fell to 1.4130 German marks from 1.4185 marks and to 1.1407 Swiss francs from 1.1441 francs. The British pound rose to $1.5601 from $1.5529.
Traders followed the Treasury bond market, which was also looking for signs of progress on the budget. Treasury prices ended mixed yesterday.
The dollar was also undermined by concern about the Mexican economy, stemming from revised Mexican Government predictions of lower growth.
Despite peso buying by the Mexican central bank, the peso fell yesterday to a rate of 7.81 to the dollar -- a closing low -- from 7.77 to the dollar on Monday.
Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said the Mexican economy would shrink 6 percent this year, not 5 percent as he had said earlier. He predicted a 3 percent growth rate in 1996. Many private economists consider that optimistic.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Are Mixed In Partial Federal Closing

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, as the Government partly shut down its operations. The impasse in Washington over budget proposals and extending the debt ceiling kept downward pressure on the long bond, while intermediate and shorter maturities were mostly higher.
Traders noted that the stalemate between the Administration and Congress has dominated trading in Government securities in recent days and disrupted the sale of new Treasury securities. Sales resumed yesterday after Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin announced a revised schedule of auctions and the use of two Government employees' funds to remain under the current debt ceiling. 
 The 30-year bond fell 6/32, to a price of 107 28/32 to yield 6.29 percent, up from 6.27 percent on Monday.
Yesterday the Treasury sold $57.5 billion of 9-day and 36-day cash management bills. The Government occasionally sells such bills to meet cash flow shortages when it needs to meet interest and principal payments.
The Government found yesterday just how expensive borrowing could get when there was so much uncertainty and nervousness in the credit markets. The average rate for a 9-day bill was 5.77 percent and 5.64 percent for a 36-day bills. Traders said the rates were higher than those at the weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, reflecting the premium investors are demanding for the Treasury's use of their money during this crisis.
Today the Treasury will auction $18.75 billion in new one-year bills. Last week's delayed quarterly refunding will be early next week. On Monday, $18 billion in new 3-year notes are to be sold, and on Tuesday $13.5 billion in 10-year notes. Late in the day, in when-issued trading ahead of next week's sales, the 3-year was offered at a price to yield 5.54 percent and the 10, at a price to yield 5.92 percent.
The partial Government shutdown will also affect the release of economic data, since some of the offices that compute the data may have to close. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that October retail sales were down two-tenths of 1 percent.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said those numbers were "clearly on the weakside," adding, "It was another piece of evidence indicating slower consumer spending in the fourth quarter."
Mr. Fine said, "If this continues as expected, it will give more credence to a Fed easing on Dec. 19, which I continue to expect."
The Labor Department will be releasing October's consumer price report today, and the Fed, which is meeting today will also release October industrial production and capacity utilization. But the Commerce Department has postponed today's business inventories report for Septmber, as well as Friday's housing starts for October. Tomorrow the Labor department will not be releasing its initial weekly claims for unemployment insurance.
Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the market reacted favorably to the weaker-than-expected retail sales data, and that the official furlough of Government workers had little impact on the market.
"The Street," Mr. Hamilton said, "was unable to hold its better posture however, due to profit taking and a somewhat greater-than-expected weekly Redbook data." Yesterday the Johnson Redbook said retail sales rose two-tenths of 1 percent for the two-week period ended Nov. 11.
Mr. Hamilton said today's activity should remain somewhat sidelined pending the outcome of the F.O.M.C. meeting and any resolution to the continuing Government budget partial shutdown.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 9-day and 36-day cash managment bills:

HEADLINE: Contemporary Art Lags at Auction

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Last night's driving rain and high winds didn't keep the droves of passionate art collectors and dealers from Christie's salesroom. Standing room was three deep as the crowd watched the contemporary-art market continue to struggle.
Gone was the crackle and excitement of last week's Impressionist and modern art sales. Last night's auction was a tepid affair that totaled $14.5 million, far below Christie's estimate of $19.8 million to $26 million. Of the 60 works for sale, 46 found buyers. 
 "Clearly this was a different market from last week, but we knew that going into the sale," said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in New York, who was the evening's auctioneer. "On the whole it was a very solid sale, but with some obvious disappointments."
The material last night was just a bit too familiar: 25 percent of the works offered had been auctioned within the last 10 years, most of them in the boom years of the late 1980's. Artists who were stars of the 80's fared badly; works by Eric Fischl, Jeff Koons and Julian Schnabel barely raised any bids. And estimates were still a bit too high: few works sold for more than their low estimates, and many brought far less.
"Nothing went gangbusters," said Joan Washburn, a Manhattan dealer. "The sale was flat. It reflects the market in general."
An obvious dearth of star-quality works has been the contemporary-art market's biggest problem for five years.
Last night's auction highlighted more works from the 1950's and 1960's, a smart move, but even these contemporary classics had their ups and downs. The biggest success came about halfway through the evening when Barnett Newman's "Word II" (1954), a hard-edged Color Field painting, sold for $3 million, right at the low estimate and a record for the artist. The buyer was believed to be Samuel J. Heyman, a New York collector who is the chairman of GAF Corporation.
By contrast, the evening's most expensive painting, Jackson Pollock's "No. 1, 1952," from the collection of Frank Stanton, the former president of CBS, failed to sell. The drip painting, a rich tangle of yellow, red, white and black, was expected to bring $4 million to $6 million. Mr. Burge came within a hair's breadth of selling it. Several people were interested, but no one would budge beyond $3.3 million. "By tomorrow it will have been sold," Mr. Burge said.
(Final prices include the auction house's commission: 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
The Pollock wasn't the only 1950's painting unsold. Willem de Kooning's "Duck Pond," a 1958 landscape from the "Parkways" series, didn't find a buyer, either. The painting, with broad strokes of yellow and blue, was estimated at $700,000 to $900,000. Bidding never went past $500,000.
Several works last night were being sold by Shigeki Kameyama, a Japanese collector and dealer, who spent top dollar for many of them at the height of the market. Last week, at Christie's sale of Impressionist and modern art, Mr. Kameyama sold Picasso's "Mirror" (1932) for $20 million. He had bought the painting in 1989 for $26.4 million.
Among the works he sold last night were Claes Oldenburg's "Bacon and Egg," a 1961 relief. Christie's had estimated it would bring $180,000 to $250,000. It sold for $288,500 to an unidentified bidder. The work set a record for the artist when Mr. Kameyama bought it at Sotheby's in New York in May 1989 for $495,000, well above its $300,000 estimate. A year later, Sotheby's tried to sell it again, but it failed to sell.
Mr. Kameyama was also selling George Segal's "Subway" (1968). In 1989 he bought the life-sized environmental sculpture at Christie's in New York for $528,000. Last night the estimate was $250,000 to $350,000; the work sold to an unidentified bidder for $310,500.
While prices for many artists have obviously plunged over the years, Calder has been recession-proof. His "Wheat," a standing mobile circa 1948, which Mr. Kameyama bought seven years ago at Sotheby's for $150,000, was expected to sell for $80,000 to $120,000 last night; a telephone bidder paid $217,000.
Another Calder standing mobile, "Laocoon" (1947), provided a welcome competitive moment. Four people vied for the work, estimated at $750,000 to $950,000. It finally sold to Eli Broad, the Los Angeles-based collector, for $992,500. It wasn't the mobile's first appearance at auction. In 1990 it failed to sell at Sotheby's. Back then, bidding never went higher than $1.6 million.
Another work that performed well was Robert Rauschenberg's "Glider," a 1962 silk screen. Estimated at $800,000 to $1.2 million, it sold to an unidentified bidder for $827,500.
At several fleeting moments, the salesroom came alive. Many people competed to buy Robert Graham's "Fountain Figure II," a 1983 bronze sculpture of a man jumping. Estimated at $50,000 to $70,000, it sold for $112,500, a record for the artist. A gem of a Warhol, "Red Airmail Stamps," a 1962 silk screen, went to an unidentified bidder for $178,500, almost twice its high estimate of $100,000.
There were also some bargains. Clyfford Still's "1955-D," a large Color Field painting of a modulating field of fiery red, failed to sell at Christie's five years ago, when no one was willing to pay more than $1.1 million. Last night, it carried an estimate of $700,000 to $900,000. Jeffrey Deitch, a New York dealer, snapped it up for $684,500.
"It was an erratic night," Mr. Broad said. "Certainly the great locomotive energy from last week was not enough to pull contemporary art to a new high ground. But who knows? Tomorrow is another night." The sales continue tonight at Sotheby's.

Federal Workers Sent Home
Because of Budget Impasse
Nearly half the civilian functions of the Federal Government halted as President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress remained at loggerheads over spending priorities and appeared to put off any resolution until next week. "We are at an impasse," Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said. Some 800,000 employees were suspended. [Page A1.]
 
The Treasury's long bond slipped in price in reaction to the shutdown, sending the yield up to 6.29 percent from 6.27 percent on Monday. The Government sold $57.5 billion of cash-management bills to meet its shortage. [D18.]
 
Stock prices also fell in reaction. Technology stocks, particularly chip makers, tumbled, sending the Nasdaq composite index down 17.84 points to 1,040.62. The Dow industrials eased 1.09 points, closing at 4,871.81. [D8.]
 
Intervention for Mexican Peso
The peso weakened to a little over 12 cents, but rebounded when the Mexican central bank intervened for the second time this month. A budget speech by Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz, insisting that Mexico would stick to tight fiscal policies, did not impress investors. [D6.]
 
For Retailers, a Sad Season
Retailers are taking a drubbing from the competition that has kept consumers awash in bargains. Retail sales slipped two-tenths of 1 percent in October. Wal-Mart had a modest profit, but Dayton Hudson, J. C. Penney and Woolworth had declines. [D4.]
 
New Competition
In Cellular Service
The Washington area is becoming the first market in the nation where cellular telephone users will be able to choose a carrier from three wireless phone networks, rather than just two. The question is, will anybody care? Billions of dollars hang on the answer, which will not come for some time. Sprint and American Personal Communications are offering a novel service using a new band of microwave frequencies. [D5.]
 
Banks' Bonus: No Premiums
The F.D.I.C. decided to end deposit insurance premiums for most commercial banks, on grounds that its insurance fund has enough money to cover failures. Banks will save nearly $946 million in yearly premiums. [D2.]
 
Delay Urged on Single Currency
The exclusive use of a single European currency should not go into effect until 2002, the European Monetary Institute recommended. [D7.]
 
USAir, a British Albatross
British Airways' shares have suffered even though the carrier is regarded as one of the world's best run. The reason is its investments in other airlines like USAir, from which UAL backed away on Monday. [D6.]
 
Japanese Bank Profits Rise
Japanese banks' operating profits soared, and the industry's bad debts were below previous estimates in the six months though September, the Finance Ministry said. [D6.]
 
A Mutual Fund for College Savings
Investors in A.I.G. Children's World Fund, American International's new fund for college savings, will receive all their original investment back if they stay with the fund 10 years and reinvest all dividends. [D5.]
 
The City of Brotherly Contention?
Philadelphia hoteliers worked so hard to attract a convention of the American Society of Travel Agents that some decided not to put out free copies of Philadelphia magazine. It criticizes the city on race relations. Edwin McDowell: Business Travel. [D6.]
 
Developing an E.D.S. Identity
Electronic Data Systems is turning to Bates Worldwide to help it develop an image beyond the company that Ross Perot founded and sold to G.M. Advertising. [D7.]

HEADLINE: Endless Recess

 BODY:
While educators are calling for higher standards and more demanding classes, tens of thousands of New York City teen-agers are being shut out of class altogether, given short schedules for only a few hours of instruction a day. The system not only allows these students to fail, it practically begs them to drop out.
The city has long allowed high school students to take a light schedule for a handful of good reasons, such as needing only a few credits to graduate, or participating in a vocational school work-study program. But this year 77,000 students, 28 percent of all high school students, are in school for less than the 5 1/2 hours the state requires. Surely there are not 77,000 youngsters with plausible reasons to leave early. 
 The suspicion, indeed the near-certainty, is that high schools are giving students fewer classes because this year they suffered budget cuts that in some cases exceeded 20 percent. School buildings around the city are jammed, and classes frequently have more than the 34 students allowed under teaching contracts. The United Federation of Teachers contends that some of its members have been told by their principals that they must choose between putting students on short schedules and enduring even more overcrowded classes.
State law requires that students attend high school for seven 45-minute periods a day, one of them for lunch. But in some New York City schools, a full third of the student body are taking fewer classes, sometimes three or even two. The Board of Education appears to have very little information about who these students are and why their class load has been cut back. Indeed, officials are unable even to say whether the number of short schedules has grown over the last few years.
Anecdotal information suggests that the students given short schedules are often the very ones who need more, not less, attention. They are the youngsters who failed several courses in the preceding year, who had unusual stretches of absence early in the school year or who registered after school began.
Insuring students a full day of school is a bottom-line requirement for city government. If the high schools do not have enough teachers to do the job, the board must hire them, or find administrators who can be reassigned to teaching duty. If the board does not have enough resources, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani must find the money elsewhere. If the Mayor continues to insist that there would be plenty of resources if only the board streamlined its bureaucracy, he has an obligation to work with the new school leadership to find economies.
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and State Education Commissioner Richard Mills have been outspoken in their calls for tougher high school standards and graduation requirements. Those ideas, no matter how commendable, seem remote from the reality of a system that cannot give 77,000 of its students a full day in class, and where the response to children in educational trouble is to tell them to spend less time in school.

Keep It Simple

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At an American base in Hohenfels, Germany, the U.S. Army has set up a remarkable training facility -- a mini-Bosnia. The Hollywood-like set consists of villages with burned-out cars, shot-up houses and NATO soldiers in costumes playing different roles, including the mayor, refugees, black-marketeers, snipers, a CNN reporter and warring factions. Units of the U.S. Army's First Armored Division, which will be the backbone of the U.S. peacekeeping force in Bosnia, have to spend time practicing in the villages and are scored on how few of their men get hit by pretend snipers using laser guns. Secretary of Defense William Perry told me that the motto of the U.S. commanders running mini-Bosnia is that "the scrimmage should be harder than the game."
A month ago President Clinton implied that if the Bosnian factions negotiating in Dayton, Ohio, reach an agreement, U.S. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia would be like the U.S. peacekeepers separating Egypt and Israel in the Sinai Desert, who spend their days counting camels. That no longer seems to be the Administration's approach. The argument now, which Mr. Perry laid out in an interview, is that this mission is going to be dangerous, and that even with a peace accord there will be some local pockets of opposition -- but it is worth doing because to not go in will lead to more killing in Bosnia, a spreading of the war and a debasing of American leadership. 
 "The problem I don't want to have to deal with," said Mr. Perry, "is, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You told me it was going to be a Sunday school picnic, and what happened? Somebody's shooting at us after we get there. . . .' It is not that I am callous about the risks. It's that I recognize the risks of not going in are greater." Those risks, he added, involve "not just feeling bad about the continuing slaughter in Bosnia. There's a very real danger of this war spreading beyond Bosnia." Anyone who blocks this mission, said Mr. Perry, "is now saying 'I want the war to continue in Bosnia.' "
If anyone is sitting back waiting for the Administration to make that one knockout argument for sending troops to Bosnia that will wow the public and Congress so effectively that their reservations will melt away, he is waiting in vain. Mr. Perry's blunt talk is the argument.
Will it sell? I think the U.S. public can be persuaded -- reluctantly, very reluctantly -- to send troops to Bosnia to support a peace accord, provided that the risk of casualties is minimal and the U.S. mission is confined to simply separating the parties and consolidating the cease-fire. That is a mission people can intuitively understand -- separating combatants, preventing further massacres and giving the parties enough security so they might start relating to each other differently.
Where, I think, the public will draw a line is anything that goes beyond simple peacekeeping into nation-building. If the parties will only agree to sign the peace treaty if the U.S. contributes forces to separate the warring factions, that is one thing. If the parties will only sign the peace treaty if the U.S. contributes forces to put Bosnia back together again -- to guarantee elections, to guarantee constitutional arrangements, to guarantee a return of refugees, to hunt war criminals, to impose arms control measures -- that is going to be a hard sell. Those are all worthy goals. And U.S. diplomats, using economic leverage, should be assigned to promote them. But they will have to be achieved by the parties, at their own speed.
The Bosnia peacekeeping debate highlights the disconnect in America today between the foreign-policy elites and the public. The elites see all sorts of opportunities in Bosnia -- from finding new ways to cooperate with Russia to finding a new mission for NATO and U.S. troops in Europe. The elites believe that because the cold war is over we can do all of these things. But the public believes that because the cold war is over we don't have to do all these things.
Bridging that gap is the Administration's challenge. I think it is bridgeable -- barely. But the message to U.S. negotiators now trying to work out a Bosnia peace deal has to be: Keep it simple. Any U.S. peacekeeping mission that requires an expert from the Brookings Institution to explain is going to be a problem. Don't negotiate a deal in Dayton that you can't sell in Dayton.

HEADLINE: School Money Is Serving Social Needs

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Much of the increased school spending in the last 25 years has gone not to regular classrooms but for educating disabled children, counseling and other social welfare functions, an economists' group said today.
Researchers said the study by the Economic Policy Institute helped show that schools handled many tasks beyond academics. Their arguments dispute claims by conservatives that regular school spending has jumped dramatically while learning has plummeted. And the study drew immediate criticism. 
 "Certainly, special education accounts for a piece of the growth," said Chester Finn, a former Reagan Administration education official who works for the conservative Hudson Institute. "But even when you discount that, the growth in spending is very substantial, and schools have not improved."
An Economic Policy Institute researcher, Richard Rothstein, disputed that, saying, "The widespread belief that there have been vast new amounts of money poured into regular education with no results is just wrong."
In addition to fueling fights over school spending, the findings worried advocates for disabled children, who have already said that they are concerned about what they call slipping support for a 1975 Federal anti-discrimination law.
"Our kids are not using more than their share of resources, when you look at individual districts," said Jamie Ruppman, a mother in Fairfax, Va. "And what's the alternative? Denying them education?"
Parents and superintendents in a handful of districts have begun disputing the amount they must spend on mentally and physically disabled students under the 1975 law.
Schools in Westchester County, N.Y., for example, have questioned whether they must send children to a special school for the blind and disabled at a cost of $175,000 a year.
Mr. Finn noted that more children each year were being classified as learning disabled. "Once a child is classified, they have essentially a prior claim on the school budget before anything else is paid for," he said. "How fair is that?"
Mr. Rothstein spent three years examining spending in nine school districts from 1967 to 1991. In that time, actual average school expenditures climbed to $5,000 per student from $687.
When accounting for inflation through the Consumer Price Index, that translated to a 100 percent increase in real spending. But arguing that the index does not reflect the labor intensiveness of schools, Mr. Rothstein substituted a price index focusing on the service industry. Under that measure, which Mr. Finn criticized, expenditures rose by 60 percent since 1967.
Of the new spending, the Economic Policy Institute study found that 38 percent went to educate disabled children, while 19 percent went to educate other special groups, including vocational students or pregnant teen-agers in alternative programs.
The study looked at spending in Anne Arundel County, Md.; Bettendorf, Iowa; Boulder, Colo.; Claiborne County, Tenn.; East Baton Rouge, La.; Fall River, Mass.; Los Angeles; Middletown, N.Y., and Spring Branch, Tex.
The Economic Policy Institute, founded in 1986 by the economists Lester C. Thurow and Robert B. Reich, who is now Labor Secretary, received money for the study from the Metropolitan Life Foundation, an affiliate of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of New York.

Owners Seeing No Set Pattern in Market

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 14

 BODY:
During a discussion of the free-agent market last week, a club executive brought up Dante Bichette and the new contract he recently accepted that kept him out of the market.
"He might be the m.v.p. and he got $11 million," the executive said, suggesting the money seemed low for a player in Bichette's position. "Is that going to be the going rate for top players?" 
 Bichette agreed to the Colorado Rockies' offer of $11.1 million for three years, an average of $3.7 million a year. The same question might have been asked the other day when Atlanta gave Marquis Grissom a new contract for $4.8 million a year for four years.
Emerging from their second day of meetings today, general managers saw the signings differently but generally agreed that whether the contracts were good signings for the clubs or good signings for the players, they would not have a significant impact on clubs and free agents in their coming negotiations.
"I think it's still to be determined," Gord Ash of Toronto said of the market. "There's the situation with the basic supply and demand. Some of the players probably will sign relatively quickly for the dollars we've seen. But there probably will be a number of players still available. It's kind of wait and see."
Dan Duquette, Boston's general manager, said he sees each case as an individual negotiation. "But," he added, "the signs I've seen so far are related to the overall income in the industry, and the income has been down a little bit."
Considering the year Bichette had -- a .340 batting average and a league-leading 40 home runs and 128 runs batted in -- under normal circumstances he could reasonably have expected to be pursued as a free agent with offers in the $5 million-a-year neighborhood.
But he has a chronically bad left knee, and the ailment is noted in his contract in the form of a higher salary for the third year if the knee has not limited his playing time before that season.
Grissom, on the other hand, had his second-worst season, a .258 batting average and 29 stolen bases, and he was 11 days short of being eligible for free agency. He might have fared better financially waiting a year, figuring he would have a better season and then he would be an attractive free agent. But he wanted a long-term contract now.
Even though some agents and general managers saw those signings as beneficial to the clubs, Bob Quinn, the San Francisco Giants' general manager, perceived them otherwise.
"Heck, no," Quinn said when asked whether he thought those signings would set the going rate for players this winter. "It depends on the financial wherewithal of the club in question as to whether or not they can afford the player. Atlanta and Colorado are two fairly successful clubs, financially speaking. There are those who don't have the wherewithal to do what those clubs did. You know what your constraints are and you have to act fiscally responsible as it pertains to your club, not what Colorado or Atlanta or anyone else can do."
Obviously, some free agents believe the market will bear much more economically for top players.
Craig Biggio, Houston's second baseman, became a free agent after rejecting the Astros' four-year, $20 million offer. He clearly believes he can do at least that well in the open market, and with teams like the Yankees and the Mets competing for him, he just might be right.
But Joe McIlvaine said he did not foresee the Mets becoming involved in a bidding war for any player. "You have to be prepared to offer him what you think you can offer him," the Met general manager said. "If that's acceptable, fine. If not, then you have to think of another way."
Bill Bavasi of California took the same position in discussing the Angels' pending negotiations with Chuck Finley, the free-agent pitcher they would like to keep.
Ash, the Blue Jays' general manager, said he thought the market could move slowly.
"There's this aura of normalcy that's crept into the business because of the World Series and the television contract," he said, "but you have that same concern of where are we going laborwise. I think there's still a large degree of uncertainty."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE MARKETS;
Wall St. Tries To Handicap Budget Fight

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
As politicians on both sides dug in their heels, analysts and economists on Wall Street began yesterday to gauge the likely impact on financial markets of a protracted impasse in passing a Federal budget.
While a long delay would be a serious disappointment, Wall Street economists and analysts said yesterday that it would not necessarily be all bad news for financial markets. 
 Despite the partisan wrangling, Wall Street is optimistic that compromises on proposed tax and spending cuts will be reached within several weeks and that threats of Government default -- an event that is almost uniformly feared -- will not reappear.
But the divisions that separate the two sides in Washington are so deep that many analysts are beginning to think that the only deal possible is what is called a continuing budget resolution, which would keep the Government going through the rest of the current fiscal year at a somewhat lower level of spending than the level in last year's budget.
"The House of Representatives is polarized," said Edward McKelvey, a vice president and senior economist at Goldman Sachs & Company, adding that the chances of the budget debate continuing into next year's Presidential elections are about one in three.
"On the right, there are a core of Republicans who are disinclined to compromise on the deficit," he said. "And on the left, you have Congressional Democrats whose allegiance to the President isn't that strong. It remains to be seen whether the leadership in the House, the Senate and the White House can produce a deal that will be acceptable to the two poles."
Louis v. B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, a Wall Street economic consulting firm, said, "The initial reaction in the bond market to that sort of a scenario would be pretty negative."
Mr. Crandall said long-term interest rates would probably rise by one-quarter of a percentage point if Congress and the White House failed to adopt a long-term budget.
The Republican majority insists that its plan would achieve a balanced Federal budget by 2002. The Democrats say that the cuts and too drastic in the Republican plan and that some of the savings would go to a tax cut for the wealthy.
But as the year progresses, interest rates would probably reverse direction, Mr. Crandall and others said, as the effects of a slight reduction in Government spending and the absence of off-setting tax cuts worked their way into the economy and slow it down. Bond traders like slow growth because they believe that means inflation will remain in check.
A stalemate on the budget is also likely to slow moves by the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates, which would help spur economic growth.
Recent data, including yesterday's weak retail sales report for October, suggest that the pace of economic activity is slowing in the fourth quarter.
Under other circumstances, analysts said, the numbers might be sufficient to persuade the Federal Reserve, whose policy makers meet in Washington today, to cut short-term interest rates immediately. But the continuing uncertainty about the budget effectively rules out that option, the analysts said.
In a report sent to clients last night, Mr. McKelvy and other economists at Goldman Sachs said: "We believe that Fed officials will wait for the outcome of the budget debate before easing monetary policy further.
More important, the implications of no budget deal for economic growth and inflation suggest that the next round of easing would not be the last."
Efforts to curb Government spending have been applauded by Wall Street in the past, and the current effort has been taken particularly seriously, if only because it is led by a Republican-controlled Congress.
At least some of the recent drop in interest rates has been due to a perception on Wall Street that momentum in Washington to balance the budget was building. But economists say the positive impact has been less than what Republican leaders in Congress claim.
In 12 months, long-term bond yields have fallen by nearly two full percentage points, to 6.28 percent yesterday.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
Federal Workers Go Home as Budget Impasse Stiffens

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Nearly half the civilian functions of the Federal Government ground to a sputtering halt today as President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress remained deadlocked over spending priorities and appeared to push off any possible resolution until at least the end of the week.
It was a day of dueling televised oratory, fitful negotiations and mutual accusations of bad faith, and the price was the closing of Government offices, parks, museums and laboratories and the furloughing of some 800,000 employees, who reported for work only to be sent home, their desks eerily empty and their suites dark by midmorning. Vital functions, from mail delivery to air traffic control, continued uninterrupted. 
 Nevertheless, thousands of Americans who needed Government services that seemed vital to them -- locating tax records, applying for Social Security benefits, obtaining passports -- found themselves frustrated and sometimes furious because of a battle in Washington that most did not profess to understand. [Page B9.]
"We are at an impasse," Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, told reporters late this afternoon, after his second meetings of the day with Congressional budget leaders on Capitol Hill. "I believe we are looking at a situation in which they are going to continue to try to put their budget together, send it to the President and the President will veto that budget."
Late Monday, Mr. Clinton vetoed a stopgap spending measure that would have kept the Government running until the end of the month because, he said, the Republicans had attached unacceptable conditions and cuts in programs he favors.
At midafternoon, Mr. Clinton appeared in the White House briefing room to accuse the Republicans of putting "ideology ahead of common sense and shared values." He said he vetoed the temporary spending measure, and another that would have extended the Government's borrowing authority until mid-December, "because America can never accept under pressure what it would not accept in free and open debate." He vowed to "continue to fight for the right kind of balanced budget," and added, "It is my solemn responsibility to stand against a budget plan that is bad for America."
He had no sooner finished speaking than an angry Speaker Newt Gingrich accused him of "deliberate misrepresentation" and "a phony argument about fantasy cuts." And Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said Mr. Clinton "didn't make it any easier" to get an agreement to keep the Government running. Both sides said they could not predict when the shutdown, the fifth since 1981 but apparently the most serious, would end.
The temporary spending authority is needed because only 3 of the 13 annual appropriations bills have been passed by Congress and signed by Mr. Clinton, and an interim measure to keep the Government running expired at midnight on Monday. On Wednesday, the Government is expected to exceed its $4.9 trillion ceiling on borrowing, but Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has taken emergency steps to raise cash in the meantime.
All day today, wispy suggestions for compromise evaporated in the heat of the Republicans' insistence that Mr. Clinton accept their goal of balancing the Federal budget in seven years, and of Mr. Clinton's equally emphatic insistence that the Republicans strip any temporary spending or borrowing measures of amendments embodying their longer-term budget priorities, like curtailing the growth of spending for Medicare.
Mr. Gingrich said tonight that he would prepare separate legislation to reopen the parts of the Government whose absence is producing the most complaints.
Tony Blankley, a spokesman for Mr. Gingrich, said tonight that the legislation would provide money for these essential services through September 1996. "We will target the legislation very precisely to programs and services that every American agrees should be continued," he said.
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, responded skeptically. "That's about the 10th idea we've heard today," he said. "We're not sure any of them are serious. The President's view is that we need to restore Government services to the American people and to do it across the board, not piecemeal."
At one point today, the back-and-forth debate grew so absurd that Mr. Gingrich proposed as an olive branch a measure sure to draw Mr. Clinton's fire. He offered to present temporary spending and borrowing provisions without conditions, but said he would attach them to the sweeping budget bill that Congress hopes to send to the White House by the end of the week. Mr. Clinton has repeatedly vowed to veto that measure as unduly harsh on programs for education, health care, the elderly, children and the environment, and the White House made it clear that any such move by Mr. Gingrich would also fail.
White House aides agreed that Mr. Gingrich's proposal appeared to make it all but certain that no progress could be made on resolving the short-term credit-and-spending crisis until Mr. Clinton went through the ritual of vetoing the Republicans' broader plan to balance the budget by 2002, thus effectively blocking all the major provisions of their Contract With America.
Only then, both sides suggested today, might real negotiations on both the short- and long-term disputes bear fruit. The President's veto could come by the weekend.
Though Mr. Clinton expressed concern about the disruption and hardship the shutdown is causing, Mr. McCurry said it might be lengthy if the Republicans refused to bend.
"The President just now has told you that those priorities reflected in that budget will not be accepted," Mr. McCurry said. "And he has point-blank told them that this President is willing to give up his Presidency on that proposition, rather than accept those budget priorities."
At stake are intense and deeply divergent arguments about the direction of the country, on the eve of the 1996 election year. Republicans hope to paint Mr. Clinton as intransigent and not committed to balancing the budget, while he seeks to portray them as cruelly dismantling three generations of social programs.
Each side has been convinced that it has the political merits on its side, though initial opinion surveys have found that more Americans blame Congress than the President for the impasse and that the Administration's bare-knuckles attack on the specifics of the Republicans' spending plans appears to have borne fruit.
The Republican and Democratic parties sought to drive home their positions in dueling advertisements. The Democratic National Committee this week began running a 30-second nationally televised commercial that purports to tell "the truth on Medicare."
The narrator says: "Republicans threaten to close the Government down if the President won't cut Medicare and education. No deal. The President will do right by our elderly and our children. Threat or no threat." Party officials would not disclose how much money they are spending on the commercial.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, paid for a full-page advertisement published today in USA Today that features a grainy photograph of the Washington Monument and this headline: "This morning, the President spent $607 million and closed the Washington Monument. It would have been cheaper to balance the budget."
An hourlong meeting this morning on Capitol Hill between Mr. Panetta and the leaders of the Congressional budget committees produced little more than an agreement to meet again this afternoon, and after the second meeting, both sides acknowledged a deadlock.
Some of the discussion revolved around what is likely to be the essence of any eventual compromise on the overall budget: the two camps' differing assumptions about how the economy will perform in the coming years. Mr. Clinton's projections are rosier than those of the Congressional Budget Office, though only a bit, but they are less optimistic than some private economic forecasts.
But such small distinctions translate over time into great differences in the depth of spending cuts needed to produce a balanced budget, and the White House had made it clear that adjusting them was the only way that Mr. Clinton could preserve his priorities and Congress protect its own.
So far, however, House Republicans in particular have been unyielding. This afternoon, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, held a news conference with charts purporting to show Mr. Clinton as favoring annual deficits of $200 billion far into the future, while the Republicans would produce balance. Mr. Clinton contends that his plan would balance the budget in nine years and that the differences are purely a matter of underlying assumptions.
The Senate minority leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said that the bipartisan Congressional leadership had a good discussion about the issue with Mr. Clinton in the White House late Monday but that "it really led nowhere."
"We're not any closer today than we were 24 hours ago," he added.
Like other Congressional leaders and White House aides, Mr. Daschle said he saw few prospects for even an interim solution soon, and he went so far as to predict that Congress's planned Thanksgiving recess would be canceled.
"We'll be here next week," he said, "carving up more than one turkey."

Dow Soars Past 4,900; S.& P. 500 Sets Record
The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 4,900 for the first time, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set a record. Benign news on last month's inflation rate put traders in a buying mood.
The Dow climbed 50.94 points -- more than 1 percent -- to 4,922.75, for its 57th high this year. The S.& P. 500 rose 4.67, to 593.96, and the Nasdaq composite edged higher. [Page D10.]
 
Treasury Averts Default
The Treasury averted default by tapping two civil service retirement funds to cover interest payments on the Federal debt. Congress and the Administration made no progress in resolving their basic disputes over spending levels and priorities. [A1.]
 
Giant Buyouts Offered at AT&T
In the latest sign that corporate job cuts are becoming a fixture on the business landscape, AT&T said it was offering 77,800 managers -- half its supervisory work force -- financial incentives to leave by Jan. 13. The company is breaking itself into three pieces. Only a small number of managers is expected to take the offer, but the plan sent shivers of insecurity through AT&T's managerial ranks. [A1.]
 
Generic Drug Merger Falls Apart
Plans to create a large generic drug company collapsed when Ivax of Miami and Hafslund of Norway ended their merger agreement, which would have created a company with $2.5 billion in combined sales. But the companies agreed to a number of licensing and collaborative agreements, an approach that analysts found preferable. [D2.]
 
Cholesterol Drug May Help Heart
A potent cholesterol-lowering drug can prevent heart attacks and deaths in men who are apparently healthy but have elevated cholesterol levels, new research shows. The finding is applicable to at least one-quarter of American men. The drug, sold as Pravachol by Bristol-Myers Squibb, is one of a new class of such drugs. [A1.]
 
Japan's Trade Gap Shrinks
Japan's trade deficit with the United States narrowed 44.2 percent in October from a year earlier, its biggest decline in more than five years, as auto exports fell. [D6.]]

On-Line Ads, on the TV
America Online's new television commercials may be outstanding or may be egregious, but in any case, they are the most eye-catching effort in the young business of marketing computer online services.

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs Past 4,900 for First Time With a 50.94 Surge

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average soared past 4,900 for the first time yesterday, and the broader-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set a record.
Benign news on inflation put traders in a buying mood, even though the Federal Reserve took no action on cutting interest rates at yesterday's meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee and the debt squabble in Washington was unresolved. In addition, four rounds of computer-guided "buy" orders in advance of tomorrow's double-witching options expiration helped push the stock market upward late in the day. 
 Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers, suggested the Fed would be ready to reduce rates once an agreement had been reached to balance the Federal budget. "Such a move would make the total return on stocks more competitive than the return on bonds."
Bond prices and yields showed little movement during the day. The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 6.29 percent.
The Dow climbed 50.94 points, or more than 1 percent, to 4,922.75, its top level of the day and its 57th new high this year. It surged through the 4,800 milestone just two months ago. Although a gain of 50 points or more is supposed to set off a New York Stock Exchange rule that curbs stock-index arbitrage, the 30-stock average did not pass the 50-point mark until the market had closed, when last-minute orders were reflected in the final prices.
The S.& P. 500 rose 4.67 points, to 593.96, surpassing the record of 593.26 it set last Thursday. The Nasdaq composite index increased 1.23 points, to 1,041.85.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines on the Big Board, 1,194 to 1,060. Trading was heavy, as 376.1 million shares changed hands, compared with 354.4 million shares on Tuesday.
"It appears that in early November investors found those rose-colored glasses that they've worn for the better part of the last year, which had been temporarily misplaced in October," said Charles G. Crane, senior vice president of Spears, Benzak, Salomon & Farrell. "Rotation could become a weekly event."
Consumer-product stocks, which traditionally have stable earnings whatever the economic environment, were yesterday's standouts. McDonald's rose 1, to 43 3/8; Philip Morris increased 1 3/4, to 89 5/8, and Coca-Cola advanced 1/4, to 74 1/4. The Morgan Stanley Consumer Index advanced 2.52 points, or almost 1 percent, to 276.14.
Drug stocks, perceived as defensive issues, also finished higher. Eli Lilly closed at 99 1/2, up 2 1/2; Pfizer closed at 60 7/8, up 1 7/8, and Merck closed at 60, up 3/4.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Moves Lower as Traders Await Outcome of Budget Fight

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped yesterday on increasing concerns over United States budget negotiations, but it was also hurt by the renewed ascent of the German mark against other European currencies.
The dollar received some support in the afternoon, however, after the Federal Reserve, as expected, left short-term interest rates unchanged. 
 The American currency slumped during Asian and European trading sessions, as players chose to stay clear of it amid an increasingly tense budget battle between the White House and Congress.
"The big move came overnight," said Tim Hughes, chief dealer at National Bank of Detroit. "Everybody is waiting to see what will happen with the budget situation."
Some currency traders said they were concerned that a prolonged impasse would hurt the chances for a big reduction in the budget deficit.
"The risk of watered-down deficit-cutting could be quite negative," said Amy Smith Beaumont of IDEA Inc. "That's what people fear the most."
Marc Chandler, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said, "Even though it seems clear the U.S. Government is not going to default, people are still concerned about the budget."
In New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 101.38 Japanese yen from 101.66 yen on Tuesday. The dollar also slipped to 1.4062 marks from 1.4141 marks and to 1.1377 Swiss francs from 1.1419 Swiss francs. The British pound edged up to $1.5570 from $1.5586.
In other trading, the mark flexed its muscles against the pound, Swiss franc and other European currencies, adding to the pressure on the dollar. But the dollar benefited from a rally in the French franc against the mark.
The franc, and French financial markets, rallied after Prime Minister Alain Juppe pledged sharp spending cuts in France's welfare system as well as a new tax to wipe out accumulated debts.
Analysts praised the package, saying Mr. Juppe had paved the way for a stronger franc by putting the emphasis on cost-cutting and efficiency.
"It's not a new dawn," said Christopher Potts, an analyst at Cheuvreux de Virieu in Paris. "But it's a little better than expected; there is something for everyone in this."

HEADLINE: Fed Maintains Rates, Though More Signs of Sluggishness Emerge

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Despite mounting evidence of some economic slowing, the Federal Reserve decided today against lowering interest rates, which would have made borrowing less costly at the start of the holiday shopping season.
Analysts generally attributed the decision to the Federal Government's stalemated budget negotiations and to the absence of compelling evidence that the economy needs to be spurred, though it is less robust than during the summer. 
 "It looks like they're waiting until some of the uncertainty over fiscal policy and the economy is cleared up," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan. "It's debatable whether the economy needs any stimulus."
Others disagreed, pointing to weak retail sales and heavy levels of consumer debt, and to fresh figures released today that showed flat industrial production and subdued inflation in October. Consumer prices were up three-tenths of 1 percent in the month, a bit more than expected, but not enough to bother economists.
The central bank has cut short-term interest rates only once this year, by one-quarter of a percentage point in early July, after a 12-month pre-emptive strike against inflation in which it had doubled the Federal funds rate, the benchmark overnight lending rate for the banking system, to 6 percent.
The Fed signaled its decision today with its customary terse statement: "The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 1:30, and there will be no further announcement."
Representative Pete Stark of California, the ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, expressed dismay at the result, which left the Federal funds rate at what he regarded as an overly restrictive 5 3/4 percent.
"The negative indicators are starting to pile up," he said. "The Fed should have taken action today."
One possibility is that the Open Market Committee has decided to lean toward an easing of monetary policy, without actually cutting interest rates. That would give Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, discretion to make a cut before the next scheduled meeting, on Dec. 19, should he think conditions warrant it.
Most analysts expect the Fed to cut rates at that meeting, assuming that there is some progress toward reducing the Federal budget deficit, and that there is not a sudden burst of economic vigor. A surge of growth seems unlikely, even though the fourth quarters of 1992, 1993 and 1994 all turned out to be the strongest of the year by a wide margin.
This year the quarter has gotten off to a weak start. The latest evidence was the Fed's report today that production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell three-tenths of 1 percent in October.
That was the first decline since April, though several months have shown negligible gains or no increases and the September result was initially reported as a modest decline that was revised to a small gain. The severity of the October decline, however, was magnified by a strike at the Boeing Company, without which it would have been just one-tenth of 1 percent.
Nonetheless, analysts found little comfort in the report, which also showed that factory output was down two-tenths of 1 percent and about unchanged excluding the aircraft strike.
"Production was weak across the board," Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. "This traces back to the fact that inventories were not drawn down in the third quarter. Consequently, industrialists are adopting a cautious posture, keeping production lean until the existing stocks are sold off."
He said the possibility of slack consumer demand in the coming weeks was "an additional disincentive" to stepped-up output.
A decline in the assembly of motor vehicles, to an annual rate of 11.6 million from 12 million, was the biggest factor in the weakened output of consumer goods.
The Fed's report also showed that the utilization rate, which represents the percentage of capacity at which industry is operating, fell to 83.6 percent last month from 84.1 percent in September. That matched the July pace as the lowest of the year and was nearly two points below the cyclical peak posted in December 1994 and January 1995.
The operating rate is closely watched as a sign of possible future inflation. While inflationary pressure ebbed in industry, at the consumer level, prices edged up last month.
The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index climbed three-tenths of 1 percent on an overall basis as well as with the erratic food and energy components excluded.
While the increase was a bit bigger than expected, analysts found little to fret about, noting that some of the chief contributors -- airline fares, apparel and meat -- could be expected to reverse course in November.
"We do not believe this signals significantly higher inflation," Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a St. Louis consultancy, told clients.
Energy prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent, after three months of declines, while food prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent, after an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in September. Meat prices jumped 1.2 percent, but Patrick C. Jackman, a senior compiler of the index, said he knew of no reason for this to continue.
Prices of medical care rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the same rate as in September, with professional services showing less rapid gains and medical commodities rising more rapidly.
In the New York area, consumer prices moved up two-tenths of 1 percent in October and 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, compared with 2.8 percent for the nation as a whole.
Unlike the Federal Reserve, which generates its own budget and is operating normally despite the partial shutdown of the Government over the budget dispute, the Labor Department will issue no further figures until its statisticians are recalled to work. Mr. Jackman said that if the shutdown extended into next week, the report on consumer prices for November would be jeopardized. Only about half the data had been collected before today.

Duramed Pharmaceuticals faces some harsh terms to raise cash.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
WHEN a company has significant financial problems, but great hopes for the future, it can find itself facing harsh terms to raise cash. That is what has happened to Duramed Pharmaceuticals, which disclosed yesterday that despite making big concessions on terms, it had not raised all the money it needed.
Duramed said it had raised $10 million by selling convertible preferred stock. The amount was far less than the $25 million that the company was trying to sell, and it was forced to make already generous terms even more generous. The company added that it hoped to sell $15 million more within 90 days. 
 Duramed, based in Cincinnati, is in a difficult position because it badly needs money. If it does not pay $7 million it owes to its bank by the end of this year, it must start paying interest rates of 36.4 percent and more. "It's a pretty severe penalty," conceded Tom Arington, Duramed's chairman and chief executive, in an interview early this week.
But yesterday, in announcing the sale of the preferred stock, the company said the money would go to capital expenditures, the development of products and expenses for a drug on which the company has pinned its hopes: a generic version of Premarin, or conjugated estrogen, which is used by many women to fight the effects of menopause and to prevent osteoporosis. No mention was made of paying the bank. Asked about that, a company spokesman said Duramed hoped to renegotiate the loan agreement.
Approval of the conjugated estrogen drug is bitterly opposed by American Home Products, the company that makes the prescription drug. It argues that the generic version proposed by Duramed does not include an ingredient called Delta 8,9 DHES. Duramed says there is no evidence that ingredient has any effect, and notes that the Food and Drug Administration has classified its presence in Premarin as being an impurity.
Duramed stock has risen and fallen on hopes of approval of its drug, climbing from less than $7 in mid-1994 to a high of $25.50 last July, just before a meeting of an F.D.A. panel that it was hoped would conclude that American Home Products' complaint was invalid. Instead, the panel said it did not have enough information to rule, and the stock fell back. Yesterday, it fell 75 cents, to $15.75, in Nasdaq trading.
To the bulls on the stock, approval is likely to come soon and open the way to big profits. Bears, illustrated by a rising number of short-sellers, question whether it will be approved at all, and doubt the profit estimates if it is approved.
While awaiting F.D.A. action, the company must keep functioning with a relatively small sales base of other drugs. It came very close to going broke a few years ago as a result of production problems and regulatory issues, and pleaded guilty to three misdemeanors in connection with the testing and manufacturing of drugs.
Duramed's deal with Provident Bancorp calls for it to begin paying a big penalty on $7 million of its borrowing if that money is not paid back by the end of the year. The rate, now prime plus 2 percent, or 10.75 percent, would rise to 36.5 percent, and, if the money is still not repaid, gradually escalate to 53.6 percent.
In the preferred stock sold yesterday, it was the conversion rate that was the most unusual. Instead of fixing the conversion price at the outset, that price will be set later, based on the market price of the common stock. The timing is at the choice of the holder of the preferred.
Those who bought the preferred will get an 8 percent dividend payment for up to two years. After 90 days they may convert half of it to common stock; after 120 days, all of it can be converted.
The conversion price will be 15 percent below the average common stock price over a 10-day period ending 2 days before the holder asks for conversion, but not lower than $7.50 or higher than $20. Those figures are down -- an advantage for the buyer -- from the range of $10 to $25 the company had sought.
The floating below-market conversion price is the beauty of the deal for buyers who believe in the company. If Duramed does get F.D.A. approval, causing its share price to leap, the preferred holders who act quickly can convert at a price based on trading before the approval was known.
On the other hand, delays that depress the share price only make the eventual conversion more attractive -- and more dilutive to existing shareholders -- by allowing the holder to get more common shares. And any time the conversion is made it will be at a discount to market, so that there is little risk of loss if the stock stays above $7.50.
A generous deal. But when a company otherwise must pay usurious interest rates, it has little choice.

Treasuries Little Changed As the Fed Lets Rates Stand

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.
While the outcome of the Fed's policy-committee meeting was expected, it did hold down prices by turning the market's attention back to the impasse on the Federal budget and debt limit, as well as to the next Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting. 
 "In terms of the Fed easing, the question is now whether they will ease at the Dec. 19 F.O.M.C. meeting," said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Money Watch in New York, a market research and analysis firm.
The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to 10727/32 , leaving its yield unchanged at 6.29 percent.
Treasury prices were also weighed down by a report on consumer prices for October that was above expectations. The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts had expected an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent. The core rate, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy prices, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the month.
"What the C.P.I. numbers did underscore," Mr. Palash of MCM Money Watch said, "was that there are still inflation risks in the economic outlook."
"In particular, with retail inventories on the lean side there shouldn't be a lot of discounting during the upcoming holiday season," he said. As a result, the inflation rate could end the year at 3 percent, up from 2.7 percent in 1994, he said.
"Bottom line, it suggest that the low inflation numbers we saw over the summer might have been a lag effect of the economic slowdown in the spring," Mr. Palash added.
Other data released yesterday were October industrial production output, which fell three-tenths of 1 percent, and capacity use, which fell to an 83.6 percent rate. The production number had been forecast as being down two-tenths of 1 percent and capacity was forecast at an 83.4 percent rate.
Yesterday, the Treasury sold $18.75 billion of one-year bills, with an average rate of 5.15 percent, down from 5.30 percent last month and the lowest since almost 18 months. The sale of the bills was well received, traders and analysts said, but it had little effect on the overall market.
The Treasury plans to resume its delayed quarterly sales of three-year notes and 10-year notes next week. The three-year notes will be sold on Monday, in addition to the regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills. The 10-year notes will be sold on Tuesday.
In-when issued trading yesterday, the three-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.59 percent and the 10-year notes at a price to yield 5.96 percent.
The Treasury auctions were made possible after Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin tapped $60 billion out of two Federal retirement trust funds yesterday, enabling the Government to pay its debts through the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Do tax cuts raise revenue? The supply-side war continues.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
FISCAL conservatism is in: Polls show that most Americans are willing to forgo tax cuts to balance the budget. But supply-side economics, the good-news gospel that equated low tax rates with high tax revenues and rapid growth, is still alive and kicking. And the economists delivering the latest variation on the theme are hardly wild-eyed evangelicals.
One is Martin S. Feldstein, a Harvard professor and former adviser to President Ronald Reagan who ironically was hounded from the White House by supply-side zealots. The other is Daniel R. Feenberg, a widely respected expert on tax data. Their study, released by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research, calculates that raising the taxes of the rich in 1993 collected just one-third of the revenues expected if taxpayers had not changed their economic behavior. 
 Are they right? Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers told a meeting of tax specialists in Washington last week that the two men "have no basis whatsoever for their conclusions." And details of the Treasury's rebuttal, provided by Eric Toder, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis, buttress Mr. Summers's contention. But the controversy is a reminder that the war over the efficacy of progressive taxes is far from over.
The deficit reduction package pushed through Congress in 1993 raised the top Federal income tax bracket to 36 percent from 31 percent for families with taxable incomes between $150,000 and $250,000, and to 39.6 percent for those with incomes over $250,000. In addition, the ceiling on the Medicare payroll tax was eliminated, effectively raising the marginal tax rate by 2.9 percent for incomes over $135,000.
By contrast, the levy on the merely affluent did not change. Mr. Feldstein and Mr. Feenberg suggest that this group offers a suitable control for a natural experiment in the effect of higher rates on tax revenue.
If the adjusted gross income of the rich (here defined as those with adjusted gross incomes exceeding $200,000) had marched in lockstep with that of the upper middle class ($50,000 to $200,000), it would have grown by 2.9 percent. In fact, the taxable income of the $200,000-plus group fell short by $31 billion. So instead of collecting an extra $16 billion in taxes from this group, Uncle Sam received just $5 billion.
What's more, the higher tax rate widened the gap between what rich people earned and what they kept, supposedly inducing them to work less. Mr. Feldstein and Mr. Feenberg estimate that the deadweight loss -- the income never earned that was not offset by the estimated value of the gain in leisure -- equaled $17 billion. Put it another way: in adding a dollar to tax revenues, the law reduced national income by $3.
It is a plausible story, but is it true? One problem, Mr. Toder says, is that the estimate critically depends on the base year. If 1991 (rather than 1992) is compared with 1993, there is no shortfall in expected income and thus no shortfall in revenue or loss in output.
Another problem is the possibility of tax-shifting. President Clinton was elected in November 1992. If high income earners anticipated higher tax rates in 1993 as a consequence, they presumably would have tried to realize the income in 1992. And there is evidence they did.
Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan's business school, cites a New York State survey showing that two-thirds of Wall Street's year-end bonuses were paid in December 1992, in contrast to the one-third typically paid before the New Year. Mr. Toder adds that a heretofore obscure statistic from the Commerce Department's national income accounts suggests that, all told, $20 billion was shifted.
By the Treasury's reckoning, then, most of the income that Mr. Feldstein and Mr. Feenberg argue was effectively destroyed by higher tax rates was realized a year early. The rest, Mr. Toder estimates, was transformed from ordinary income to capital gains, which was excluded from the Feldstein-Feenberg calculation because the tax rate did not change.
Mr. Feldstein is not about to pack up his computer files and abandon the fight. He argues that no one else has an adequate explanation for the interruption in 1993 of the trend toward ever-increasing income concentration. And he says that an another way of pinpointing income-shifting back to 1992 -- tracking changes in fourth-quarter estimated tax payments -- does not confirm the Commerce Department's results.
Truth is, there is too much room for interpretation in studies of taxpayer behavior to change many minds. The original supply-side Pollyannas were almost certainly wrong: tax revenues never recovered after the cuts in the early 1980's. But economists still do not know what price America pays for sharply progressive income taxes in terms of distorted incentives and slower growth.

HEADLINE: Russians Vie for Votes, and Anything Goes

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin cherishes his stodgy, button-down reputation. He is not young, he is not funky, and he most definitely does not "rock the house."
And that is why it was a bit surprising that Mr. Chernomyrdin's campaign hired the American rapper Hammer to enliven the image of Our Home Is Russia, the centrist political party.
Against a glowing red, white and blue Our Home Is Russia backdrop at the Rossiya concert hall, Hammer bellowed, "We feel like bustin' loose!" His bewildered audience, mostly made up of middle-aged Russian bureaucrats and campaign workers, did not. 
 The campaign for Russia's parliamentary elections, which are scheduled for Dec. 17, has begun, with about 5,000 candidates struggling for the attention of voters. And although almost all of them are wrapping themselves in patriotism, nationalism and fierce anti-Western slogans, their campaigns have gone completely Hollywood.
In television advertising, sex, money and fear-mongering are far more prominent this year than issues and platforms. Although Russia has experimented with American-style campaign tactics before, this campaign is beginning to look like a Soviet propagandist's worst caricature of the American democratic process.
Some politicians, like the extreme nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, are selling themselves with the kind of erotic imagery usually reserved for car advertisements and music videos. Others, including the popular nationalist general, Aleksandr Lebed, are using slick, scary spots about crime and corruption. And almost every party is using celebrities. Pop stars and actors are not just endorsing candidates, they are running for office on almost every party list.
Even the Communists are not immune to showbiz. Nikolai Gubenka, a popular actor and theater director, is a top party candidate.
The obscure nationalist party My Fatherland is led by a dissident general, Boris Gromov, and one of its candidates is Iosif Kobzon, a flamboyant crooner who was denied a visa to the United States because of allegations that he had mob connections. When asked at a press conference on Tuesday why he was running, Mr. Kobzon replied, "Honestly speaking, who the hell knows?"
Forty-three parties will be on the December ballot, competing for 450 seats in the lower house of Parliament. Of that number, 225 deputies are elected from party lists and the remaining 225 are chosen from among independent candidates.
"Except for the Communist Party, there is such weak party identity in Russia that candidates have to sell personalities, not political platforms," said Michael McFaul, an expert on Russian politics at Stanford University. "It becomes Hollywood glitzy -- what personality can make us famous?"
Our Home Is Russia is known as the "party of power" because it is made up of Government officials, is backed by the major Russian banks and has political clout and money, but it has fared poorly in most public opinion polls.
The party has recruited Nikita Mikhalkov, the Oscar-winning actor in "Burnt by the Sun" and the movie's director, as well as Ludmila Zykina, a famous anthem singer who was the Soviet Kate Smith.
Its managers are chasing the vote of the disaffected youth in a way that would make Gary Hart blush.
"We have to use different, unusual means to wake the voters up," said Yuri Shuvalov, 30, a campaign strategist.
Besides Hammer, the campaign has hired Kool and the Gang and other American pop groups as part of its costly "cultural initiative."
Hammer said he was never told that his three concerts were part of a Russian political campaign. He had never heard of Mr. Chernomyrdin.
"What party is this?" he asked worriedly in a quiet moment backstage. "Is it a radical extremist group?" Assured that it was a centrist movement backed by President Boris N. Yeltsin, Hammer regained his poise. "If America can do business with them," he said jauntily, "Hammer can do business with them."
Hammer has done less business of late and his star has been fading since the rise of gangsta rap. His last tour was in 1991, and that one was cut short, and his latest release did not register on the Billboard chart of the country's top 200 albums.
One Russian entertainment figure who is close to the campaign said that Hammer alone was paid $150,000 per concert.
Spending limits and advertising rules were vague and only vaguely observed in Russia's 1993 elections. The Russian central election commission has issued new spending guidelines for this election year, giving each party 80 million rubles, or about $17,000, to cover election costs, and imposed an 11 billion ruble, or $2.5 million, spending limit.
But this year, as before, there are few reliable mechanisms for monitoring campaign fund-raising and spending. Parties are required to report foreign income, but need not identify Russian backers.
The central election commission is supposed to monitor campaign spending and use of broadcast time every 10 days, but inspection and enforcement rules are loose. The commission seems to be relying mainly on tattletales to spot cheaters.
"We are sure we can catch violations because every electoral bloc and movement will inform us about abuses by their rivals," said Parmen Shenshin, the commission's press secretary.
But in contrast to the 1993 campaign, when Mr. Zhirinovsky took advantage of his rivals' inexperience, flooded the airwaves with clever ads and won 22.8 percent of the vote, the Government has drawn up rules to restrict and control the use of airtime.
The state-owned television and radio stations, including ORT, Russia's largest network, which was formerly state-owned and is now partly owned by a consortium of banks sympathetic to the Government, will each give free airtime to all parties -- a maximum of one hour a month. They also will sell additional, paid, airtime to campaigns, but ORT has determined that candidates and parties can only buy three minutes of additional airtime. Candidates and their parties are free to buy airtime on Russia's private networks, but only ORT is broadcast nationwide.
If many of the candidate's paid advertisements look like flashy MTV videos, the taped appeals on free airtime that began appearing today looked more like late-night public-access television. Politicians like Yegor T. Gaidar of the democratic Russia's Choice party, and Ivan Rybkin, the Speaker of Parliament, running with his own centrist party, fumbled with their notes, fidgeted in their pockets and looked in the wrong cameras.
Though all the major parties are producing slick television advertisements that concentrate on image more than substance, Mr. Zhirinovsky still leads the pack. His first television advertisement, broadcast on the Moscow channel last week, features a sexy cabaret singer, purring a love song to him ("The world would be so boring without you/you are my idol") as she teasingly unzips her blouse. Behind her, a giant screen flickers with clips of Mr. Zhirinovsky in action, including the time he flung a glass of orange juice in the face of his opponent during a televised debate.
Despite his contempt for the West, General Lebed's advertisements also owe a lot to Madison Avenue. One shows money being placed in an outstretched hand, with a voice-over saying, "They warned bureaucrats not to take bribes." The next shot is of jail bars clanking shut, with the general's own distinctive deep voice saying, "We already warned you."
Even Grigory A. Yavlinsky, an economist and the leader of Yabloko, a democratic party, is preparing advertisements that are "substance-lite." He will not appear in them.
"People already know who he is," said a campaign strategist who declined to be identified. "We want something happy and unusual. We don't want our propaganda to be too serious; we want it to be interesting."

HEADLINE: 2 Towns, Symbols of Serbian Killings, Snag Balkan Talks

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The towns of Srebrenica and Zepa are symbols of the Serbian slaughter of Muslim civilians during the Bosnian war. Now, with the negotiations to end the conflict at a critical phase, the towns have become symbols of the price of peace.
Officials involved in the talks said today that the recovery of Srebrenica and Zepa, eastern Bosnian towns overrun by the Serbs this summer, was among the territorial demands on which the Muslim-led Bosnian Government has refused to compromise. The Serbs will not relinquish the towns because they are determined that their territory adjoining Serbia be as cohesive as possible. 
 "The Bosnians are still asking for Zepa and Srebrenica, and of course the moral reasons are clear and absolutely justifiable," said one official. "But there comes a time when you have to chose between some absolute justice and moving forward in peace."
This territorial conflict, officials said, was among those that blocked a 14-hour effort on Tuesday by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to bring the two-week-old negotiations to a conclusion. At times, the officials said, a breakthrough appeared within reach, but in the end it became clear that it was not.
"We had the sense that they were trying to rush us to a closure," said one Bosnian official. "We feel more comfortable now that some of that pressure has been removed and we have the time to work through these very important territorial issues."
Western officials said the new goal was to end the talks over the weekend. Mr. Christopher, who has gone to Japan for economic talks, is planning to return on Friday in order to be present for the end of the talks.
"We are not going to go into next week," one American official said.
But bridging the remaining gaps will not be easy. The issue of Zepa and Srebrenica, enclaves where several thousand Muslims were killed this summer, bringing the war and United States policy to a turning point, illustrates the difficulty of trying to end a war whose wounds are still raw.
It also seems to demonstrate that, for all the recent protestations and determined efforts of American officials, peace and justice are largely irreconcilable at this late stage.
Put bluntly, Bosnian control of Srebrenica and Zepa now makes no sense politically or diplomatically, because the towns would be vulnerable islands surrounded by Serbs and the likely seeds of renewed violence.
But by every standard of morality or justice, Bosnian control of the towns makes complete sense, because they were the scenes of Serbian atrocities against Muslim civilians. Many of those victims had already fled the Serbian onslaught of 1992 and were among the few survivors of the once-thriving Muslim communities in eastern Bosnian towns including Bijeljina, Zvornik, Rogatica, Vlasenica and Foca.
Those towns, now inhabited almost exclusively by Serbs, are the living symbols of what Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott this month described in unusually candid terms: "In a word -- and it is the right word -- it is genocide in our time, genocide on the continent of Europe."
Yet, after 42 months of fighting, the United States seems inclined to set aside the genocide issue in order to focus on the hard facts and thus prod the parties to make peace.
"We will not forget the past," said one Western official. "But our aim now should be the creation of a territorially coherent Muslim-Croat federation and taking it from there. Instead of focusing on guarantees for the future, the Bosnian delegation often seems to focus on symbolism."
The Bosnian official said the postion of his Government was that a map prepared in 1994 should remain the basis for negotiation until a new map is agreed on. The 1994 map, he pointed out, accorded Srebrenica and Zepa, and much land around them, to the Bosnian Government.
But that plan has been largely superseded by military changes on the ground. Victories against the Serbs by the Bosnian and Croatian armies have reduced the Serbs' share of territory from the 70 percent they held when the 1994 map was drawn up to about 48 percent. As a result, the map has quietly been discarded by American and European officials.
Those officials said that the Bosnian Government has not been asked to give up any of the land it now holds. But, they added, its claims to towns now controlled by the Serbs appear almost impossible to satisfy if peace is to be achieved.
In principle, Bosnia is to be divided between a Muslim-Croat federation with 51 percent of the territory and a Serbian republic with 49 percent, overseen by a central government.
Other territorial issues, including the status of Sarajevo and the extent of a Serbian corridor south of the town of Brcko, also remain unresolved, the officials said. But progress was made by Mr. Christopher, particularly on a compromise for Sarajevo.
"These people are so close to a deal and so unwilling to make it, it's just unbelievable," said one official. "Sarajevo could have been settled last night. But the Bosnians grew up in war, they've known nothing else, and their political survival was forged in it. They're not yet reconciled to the fact that they will have to give up claims to certain land."
Of course, those claims could still be pursued, but only through a prolonged war.
The western officials said Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, had emerged as the key figure -- or "swing vote" -- in the Bosnian delegation. A brilliant, whimsical man, with a Hamlet-like tendency to speak in riddles, Mr. Silajdzic is deeply committed to the idea of a single Bosnian state in which Muslims, Serbs and Croats live together.
He is profoundly cognizant of the "genocide" of which Mr. Talbott spoke this month and deeply reluctant to accept any compromise -- such as abandoning Zepa and Srebrenica -- that would appear to condone it. But he also knows that prolonging the war will only make the multiethnic society he wants less and less likely, while Islamic extremism is almost certain to grow.
The officials said Richard C. Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary of State who has led diplomatic efforts to end the war since August, would now focus his efforts on securing a compromise from Mr. Silajdzic.
The theme of justice will certainly be an important one in these discussions. American officials have insisted in recent weeks that the compromises necessary for a settlement would not be accompanied by any compromise on the activities of the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
But tension between the court's activities and Western political goals have risen in the last week as indictments were handed down to three officers of the Serbian Army and several Bosnian Croats. If followed up the chain of command, those indictments might eventually lead to the highest political authorties in Zagreb and Belgrade. Despite the indictments, the Croatian Government promoted a general on Tuesday who had been indicted on Monday for crimes against humanity.
 Washington responded today by criticizing Croatia and its President, Franjo Tudjman, for the promotion of Gen. Tihomir Blaskic.
Judge Richard Golstone, the tribunal's prosecutor, arrived today in Washington to discuss those issues and to press the Clinton Administration to hand over all relevant intelligence data to the tribunal. The State Department has promised to cooperate, but Judge Goldstone has recently complained of delays and apparent omissions.
Clearly, the court's actions will be important to American officials in trying to convince the Bosnian Government that justice will not be entirely forgotten in a settlement. But it is still unclear how convincing such arguments may prove in that only one of the more than 50 people indicted is in custody in The Hague.
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the military leader, were indicted this summer, but have continued in their posts. Their fate is the still object of intense negotiation here.

HEADLINE: Japan Torn Between U.S. And Asians

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Nov. 15

 BODY:
As the most advanced nation in East Asia, Japan has long seen itself as a bridge between the industrialized world of the West and the developing economies of Asia. Now, as the host of this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, Japan is playing such a role and is finding itself caught in the crossfire of competing camps.
As trade and foreign ministers of the 18 member countries began meeting here tonight, one focus was whether Japan would be able to exercise the leadership needed to move the economic forum toward its goal of achieving free trade among its members by 2010 for developed nations and 2020 for developing ones. There are doubts about whether Japan is up to the task. 
 "This is a very good opportunity for Japan to show it can take initiatives which other Asia-Pacific nations can accept or welcome," said Susumu Yamakage, a professor of international relations at Tokyo University. "But the Government doesn't seem to take the initiative."
Rather than push toward free trade, Japan's critics say, it is trying to slow progress toward that goal.
Japan is trying to win flexible treatment to allow it to protect its rice farmers. Although some officials say Japan still intends to meet the 2010 deadline for opening its rice market, Tokyo's stand has drawn criticism from the United States, Australia and some other countries that say no exceptions should be allowed to the free trade goal.
At the same time, the countries that also want to protect their farmers, particularly South Korea and China, are not very happy with Japan either.
President Kim Young Sam of South Korea threatened to cancel a meeting here later this week with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama because a Cabinet minister had said Japan "did some good" during its occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945. The minister, Takami Eto, resigned on Monday, so the meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Murayama will go on.
The main task at this year's economic forum is to set out the ground rules for achieving free trade. Officials said today that members were getting closer to compromises on the remaining disputes.
"We have begun to close any gaps that existed when we arrived," a senior United States official said.
To be sure, many officials, including the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, say Japan is doing a good job in moving the agenda toward completion.
Japan's difficulty reflects the fact that there are two camps in the forum. The United States, which sees it as a means to break down trade barriers, favors the free trade deadline and wants to make the forum into an institution with some binding force. Other backers of free trade include Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong.
But many of the developing countries of East Asia, led by Malaysia and China, remain suspicious of the free trade goal. They want to keep the economic forum more of a voluntary organization.
Japan is probably more in the Asian camp. Instead of a bold free trade goal, it has been more interested in using the forum to foster economic development in Asia and improve things like customs clearance procedures.
At this year's meeting, Japan is planning to announce that it is giving 10 billion yen, or about $100 million, to the forum to help train people in the developing Asian nations about intellectual property protection, customs procedures and other areas.
The United States at first expressed concern about this program, "Partners for Progress," fearing that it was an effort to help Japan dominate the region economically. But as Japan has said the money would go only for specific projects aimed at promoting free trade, Washington now says it welcomes the program.
Japan's situation at the economic forum somewhat mirrors its foreign policy in general.
Until now, most of Japan's focus has been on the United States. But with trade tensions never seeming to abate, some Japanese Government and industry officials have urged Japan to link its future more with fast-growing Asia. Already, Japan exports more to East Asia than to the United States, and its companies have built factories and supply networks throughout the region.
Still, while Japan likes to think of itself as the leader of Asia, it is not well accepted by other Asians. Almost every month, it seems, a Japanese politician angers other Asians with an ill-considered remark defending Japan's behavior in World War II. And Asian countries, while thankful for Japanese investment and foreign aid, would like to see Japan open its market more to their products.

Japan's Trade Surplus With U.S. Shrinks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 44.2 percent in October, the biggest decline in more than five years, as Japan's auto exports dropped and its imports of automobiles, office equipment and meat rose, the Japanese Finance Ministry said today.
It also said Japan's global trade surplus fell 42.4 percent in October, the biggest decline since January. 
 The declines were bigger than economists' expectations, and the dollar rose in Asian trading today.
"I think this news will gradually work to boost the dollar," said Masahiro Yamaguchi, the manager for foreign exchange at Tokai Bank.
A shrinking surplus is good news for the dollar because it leaves fewer dollars for Japanese exporters to sell for yen.
The Japanese trade surplus with the United States totaled $2.66 billion in October, compared with $4.77 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said. It was the fifth consecutive decline and the biggest since April 1990, when the surplus shrank 46.5 percent, the Finance Ministry said.
The ministry said Japan's global trade surplus fell to $5.33 billion, from $9.25 billion a year earlier. The declines exceeded economists' expectations.
The decline in the surplus was accentuated by a sharp fall in the export of seagoing ships and a surge in meat imports, said Akio Egawa, a ministry official. While coming months may remain volatile, the general trend of the trade gap is one of contraction, he said.
"Continued modest growth in the U.S. and Europe should keep the surplus falling, although growth in Asia may act as a partial brake on the decline," said Ronald Bevacqua, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company in Tokyo.
Japan's trade surplus with the European Union fell 28.2 percent last month, while the surplus with Asia rose 3.5 percent.
In October, worldwide imports to Japan jumped 17.8 percent, to $29.9 billion, compared with comparable period in 1994. Exports rose 1.7 percent, to $35.23 billion, the ministry said. But exports of autos fell 20.5 percent.
The strong yen put a damper on Japanese exports. Exports to the United States fell 8.9 percent in October, their biggest decline since April 1990.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE POLITICS;
A Murky Impasse: Data vs. Principle

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Sooner or later, President Clinton and the Republican Congress will find a way out of the entanglement that has caused much of the Government to close down. What is blocking the bill giving the Government authority to spend money temporarily is a disagreement over dollar amounts and economic projections. When differences can be boiled down to numbers, politicians can usually find ways to split the difference and save face.
But it is nearly impossible to fathom the elements of a long-term solution to the division between the President and his Republican opponents. Here, the dispute is over principle -- over what role the American Government should play in the lives of its citizens. Compromising on principles is much more difficult than compromising on numbers. 
 First, consider the immediate impasse.
The departments and agencies do not have money to spend because Congress has not approved the necessary appropriations. On Monday, the lawmakers passed a temporary spending bill. The President vetoed it because it would have also raised Medicare premiums.
Republican leaders then said they would not insist on the Medicare provision if Mr. Clinton would agree to balance the budget in seven years, using the accounting procedures of the Congressional Budget Office. Mr. Clinton did not say "no" absolutely to the number of years. In fact, at a news conference on Oct. 19, he said that producing a balanced budget within seven years was clearly possible. But he insists on using the accounting methods of his appointees at the Office of Management and Budget.
This is not a small distinction. Balancing the budget under Congress's terms would require $349 billion more in spending cuts or tax increases over seven years than it would using the Administration's methods.
Neither has juggled the books. The expert forecasters at the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget have made slightly different judgments about how much the economy will grow each year, what the rate of inflation will be and how much more medicine will cost. Projecting what the economy will be like seven years from now is hardly an exact science.
The Administration predicts average growth of 2.4 percent or 2.5 percent a year; Congress predicts 2.3 percent. The Administration predicts that prices will rise 3.1 percent most years; Congress figures 3.2 percent. Congress guesses that without changes in the law, Medicare costs would rise 10.3 percent a year and Medicaid 10 percent; the comparable Administration figures are 9.8 percent and 9.2 percent.
In any one year, the differences are tiny. But compounded over seven years, they become huge. By the Administration's reckoning, Mr. Clinton's budget proposals would lead to balance in 10 years. By Congress's accounting, his proposals would result in continued deficits of more than $200 billion a year.
Prudence might dictate giving more credence to the more conservative estimates of the Congressional Budget Office. This is not because its estimators are more honest or skillful but because over the years, unexpected developments in spending and revenues have worsened the deficit outlook more often than they have improved it.
For instance, neither of this year's estimates allows for a recession before 2002, an event that would make achieving a balanced budget far more difficult. The last recession ended in 1991. Since World War II, the country has never gone 11 straight years without a recession.
Still, if Congress and the President are ever going to reach an agreement on the budget, they will have to agree on the same forecasts. If Congressional leaders accept slightly more favorable projections, Mr. Clinton might find a way to adopt a program that, at least on paper, would lead to a balanced budget in seven years.
That would permit approval of a temporary spending measure. And furloughed Government employees could go back to work.
But now consider the long-term problem.
An agreement on a temporary spending bill would not solve the fundamental policy differences between the President and the Republicans. Further, the public name-calling and finger-pointing this week might have worsened the prospects of a long-term solution to the battle of the budget.
"What we've had is a premature outbreak of hostilities," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution, a research group. "Both sides have locked themselves into positions, reducing their flexibility."
The real fight will come after Congress passes its big budget bill, expected by the end of this week, and the President vetoes it. The changes embraced in this legislation and in other measures the President is sure to veto this fall would be as great as any Congress has ever tried at once -- as sweeping as those at the beginning of the New Deal in 1933 or the Great Society in 1965. This is what is at stake:
Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, would be placed on a fixed annual budget. For the first time in 30 years, retired people would not be guaranteed all the medical care they wanted, or needed. In fact, the Republicans would allow retirees to opt out of the Medicare system altogether if they wished.
There would no longer be certainty that every child and every pregnant woman would be cared for under Medicaid, which covers health bills for the poor and most of the nation's nursing home expenses, or that long-term care would be found for every aged invalid.
The 60-year-old commitment that every destitute person could go on relief and receive Federal assistance would be abandoned.
Income, capital gains and estate taxes would be reduced, benefiting wealthy investors and middle-income families with many children, but forcing much deeper cuts in Government spending than would otherwise be necessary to reach a balanced budget.
Rules governing the environment would be weakened, permitting more economic development and offering less protection to natural resources.
Federal efforts in education, employment training and technology development, which Mr. Clinton wants to expand, would instead be scaled back.
This is the core of the Republican revolution -- a smaller Federal Government, more authority for the states, more reasons for poor people to lift themselves out of poverty, fewer restraints on economic activity by individuals and businesses.
It would cut to the heart of Democratic Party principles in place for generations and undermine what is sure to be the platform of Mr. Clinton's campaign for re-election.
Both sides seem to believe they have the upper hand politically. So they are prepared to put these issues to the voters next year. That makes compromise problematic, to say the least.
"They will only compromise," said Stanley E. Collender, a Federal budget expert at Price Waterhouse, "when they think it is in their interest to do so."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE LEGISLATION;
Republicans Reveal Details Of Agreements on Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress today disclosed details of tax cuts that would primarily benefit large middle-income families and investors, even as they prepared to take final action on a huge bill to balance the Federal budget in seven years.
The tax cuts, totaling $245 billion over seven years, are part of the budget bill, and they significantly increase the difficulty of balancing the budget. But the Republicans say they are irrevocably committed to both goals, cutting taxes and eliminating the deficit. 
 Over seven years, the budget bill would cut $270 billion from projected spending on Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly; $170 billion from Medicaid, the health program for the poor, and $81.5 billion from welfare programs. The bill would also impose new limits on Federal aid to college students, farmers, veterans and other beneficiaries of other Government programs.
Unveiling the tax cuts approved by Republican negotiators from the House and the Senate, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said today: "We want to strengthen America's families. That's why we target the lion's share of this relief to families. Seventy-two percent of the tax reductions in this bill go to families."
The bill includes a tax credit of $500 for each child under the age of 18. The credit would be available to people with adjusted gross incomes up to $75,000 a year and couples with incomes up to $110,000, Mr. Archer said.
The credit would be retroactive to Oct. 1, 1995, so families could claim one-fourth of the credit, or $125 for each child, on their 1995 tax returns. A $125 tax credit reduces a person's tax liability by $125, and families with more children would obviously receive more benefit from this provision.
Refund checks covering the tax credit would be sent out in October 1996, just before the Presidential and Congressional elections. But Mr. Archer said, "It's not timed to fall before next year's election." Rather, he said, Republicans want to "move the cost" into the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, 1996.
Mr. Archer said families would have to file separate forms to claim the new tax credit, because it was too late to include the change in regular tax forms. The future of the tax credit is uncertain because President Clinton has vowed, for other reasons, to veto the budget bill of which it is part.
The huge budget bill would overhaul most farm subsidy programs, particularly for grain and cotton crops. It would eliminate the current system of paying farmers not to plant some fields and paying larger subsidies when crop prices fall. Instead, farmers would receive fixed payments, though slightly smaller, regardless of prices and how much they grew.
But budget negotiators chose to make relatively few changes in the Federal programs benefiting sugar and peanut farmers, and no changes were made in the dairy program.
The dairy industry won a special exemption from budget cuts. House and Senate budget negotiators had planned $800 million in dairy subsidy cuts over the next seven years. But when New York Republicans threatened to vote against the budget if the cuts went through, the House and Senate leadership granted a special waiver to agriculture budget negotiators. The leaders told them to leave the dairy program unchanged.
Other farm subsidies will not be cut to offset the waiver. The leadership agreed to find the savings elsewhere, aides said.
Speaker Newt Gingrich said he would try again, after Thanksgiving, to change the dairy program. "Obviously it is unfair for one part of American agriculture to block reform in its programs as we are pursuing change across the rest of American agriculture," he said.
The proposed child tax credit would cost the Government $148 billion over seven years, lawmakers said. The next biggest item of tax relief is the Republican plan to cut the maximum tax on capital gains, which represent profits from the sale of stock, property and other assets. For individuals, the top rate on such income would be reduced to 19.8 percent, from the current 28 percent.
Mr. Archer said this change would "stimulate the creation of new high-paying jobs" and benefit nine million taxpayers, of whom six million have incomes less than $100,000 a year.
The conferees accepted a House proposal to change the computation of capital gains so that investors would not be taxed on the portion of such gains attributable to inflation. But the bill delays this change to the year 2001.
Congressional tax experts said the reductions in capital gains taxes, taken together, would cost the Government $36 billion over seven years.
Mr. Archer and other Republicans said the tax bill also included these provisions:
Two million more people would become eligible for individual retirement accounts. In addition, a new type of I.R.A. would be created. Contributions to such accounts would not be deductible, but people could make tax-free withdrawals from them to help pay the costs of college education or long-term care, retirement expenses or the first-time purchase of a home.
Those who have sold their homes at a loss would, for the first time, be able to deduct up to $3,000 a year as a "capital loss."
Families adopting children could obtain tax credits of $5,000 for each child to help offset adoption expenses.
Taxpayers who incur expenses in caring for ill parents at home could take a deduction of $1,000 for each such parent. There would also be new tax breaks for people buying insurance to cover the cost of nursing home care. Insurance companies and nursing homes have long advocated such tax breaks.
Self-employed people would eventually be allowed to take tax deductions for half of the cost of health insurance. Corporations can deduct the full cost of such health benefits for their employees.
In addition, the bill would reduce the "alternative minimum tax" paid by some companies, especially manufacturers, that would otherwise have enough tax breaks to wipe out their tax liabilities.
Referring to this change, Mr. Archer said: "Companies that depreciate tools and technology needed to create more jobs will not be penalized at the end of the year by paying a punitive penalty tax on the purchase of that equipment and the depreciation. This will go a long way toward making us more competitive in the international marketplace."
House and Senate negotiators accepted a proposal in the House bill that would allow some companies to withdraw surplus money from their pension funds to help pay other costs. But the bill sets more stringent standards than the House proposed for such withdrawals, and the money could be used only for health care and other employee benefits.
Mr. Archer said the tax bill would end a tax credit now available to developers of housing for low-income families. It would also end the earned-income tax credit for low-income workers who have no children, he said.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
TREASURY TAKES RETIREMENT FUNDS TO AVERT DEFAULT

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Thursday, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Treasury Department averted a national default on Wednesday by tapping two civil service retirement funds to cover interest payments on the Federal debt.
But Congress and the Clinton Administration made no progress in resolving their basic disputes over spending levels and priorities that kept the Government partly shut for a second day. 
 Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said he had resorted to "extraordinary" actions, more sweeping than any required of his predecessors, in taking $61.3 billion from the retirement funds and replacing them with i.o.u.'s that do not count against the national debt limit of $4.9 trillion. He took enough to pay $25 billion in interest due on Wednesday and to meet bills coming due in the next few weeks.
"Based on current projections," he said, "those amounts enable operations to go forward through late December." But he added, "This is no way for a great nation to manage its financial affairs."
Because of the impasse with Congress, President Clinton on Wednesday canceled his weekend trip to the Asian economic conference in Osaka, Japan. Vice President Al Gore will go instead. White House officials said Mr. Clinton decided he simply could not afford to be out of the country at such a delicate moment, but the cancellation is sure to worsen what has already been a badly strained year in Japanese-American relations. [Page A7.]
Republicans and Democrats each accused the other of manufacturing a crisis through intransigence and political opportunism, but no end was in sight. And on the second business day of the partial shutdown -- longer than any in the past -- Mr. Rubin said he had to take very broad steps to protect the nation's credit.
Mr. Rubin urged Congress to pass new legislation to raise the debt limit and to drop the provisions that led the President to veto a debt bill on Monday night. They included regulatory changes and a prohibition on the sort of actions that Mr. Rubin took on Wednesday to keep the Government afloat.
Congress was not focusing on the debt, but on ways to ameliorate the practical and political effects of the spending halts that have closed some Government offices and kept 800,000 Federal workers home.
The House passed a new stopgap spending bill shortly after midnight today, but included terms that Mr. Clinton said would require him to veto it. Speaker Newt Gingrich had told reporters this morning that the shutdown "could easily last 90 days."
Mr. Clinton, asked about that time estimate in an interview on the CBS Evening News, said he would not give in to the Republicans' "huge cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment." He added, "I'm not going to do it, even if it's 90 days, 120 days or 180 days."
"If we take it right into the next election, let the American people decide," he continued. "If the American people want the budget they have proposed to be the law of the land, they're entitled to another President, and that's the only way they are going to get it."
On Capitol Hill, Republicans, stung by criticism from Mr. Clinton and Congressional Democrats that they had fallen far behind schedule on passing the regular spending bills, started pushing those bills along.
The House and the Senate passed a measure financing the Departments of State and Treasury after deleting a provision barring "political advocacy" by recipients of Federal grants, an issue that had stalled the bill for 10 weeks. The $23.2 billion measure, once it is signed by the President, will put 190,000 employees back to work.
The Republicans also met to try to break a deadlock over abortion that is holding up the military spending bill, and they sent Mr. Clinton a $13.1 billion bill for the Transportation Department that they passed two weeks ago but held at the Capitol to avoid the publicity of a possible veto. Mr. Clinton signed the bill, and now 4 of the 13 regular appropriations bills have been signed into law, while another has been vetoed.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland said, "Federal workers are at home for just one reason: we haven't gotten our work done."
The White House-Congress impasse also intruded on the Republican Presidential race. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader who is the front-runner in the race, is considering whether to put off a planned weekend trip to Florida, where the Republicans are holding a straw poll for the Presidential primary. The Florida straw poll is considered by many to be the most important event in the campaign for the rest of 1995.
At a breakfast on Wednesday, Mr. Gingrich told reporters that Congress might start to pass narrow spending bills to reopen Government services that the public needed, such as passport and veterans offices and offices for making Social Security and Medicare applications.
"We'll start finding those parts of the Government that the country misses and reopen them," he said. "Those that the country doesn't miss, we probably won't open."
But that plan was quickly dismissed by Congressional Democrats and the White House. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, called it "only the latest in a series of silly ideas emanating from the Speaker's office."
The new Republican stopgap spending plan drew scorn from the President. The Republican bill was very similar to the one he vetoed on Monday morning. But the new version, while retaining cuts of up to 40 percent in some programs, omits a section increasing the Medicare Part B premium, covering insurance for doctor and laboratory bills. Democrats attacked that provision loud and long.
But the Republicans insisted on retaining a provision committing Mr. Clinton to a seven-year balanced budget as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office. The President's veto insisted that such calculations would force him to accept Republican priorities, and he told CBS News on Wednesday that he still found that approach "highly objectionable."
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said: "We will talk to the President about how to balance the budget in seven years. We will not talk to the President about whether to balance the budget in seven years."
Mr. Gingrich, at a news conference, said, "The President, having yesterday said 16 times in five minutes that he was for a balanced budget, ought to now, frankly, sign on in getting to a balanced budget."
The House passed the bill, 277 to 151, but the total for the bill was 12 votes shy of the number needed to override a veto. Forty-eight Democrats joined 229 Republicans in voting for the bill. Voting no were 3 Republicans, 147 Democrats and 1 independent. The Senate will consider it later today.
The Speaker made another promise on Wednesday that the House failed to carry out. He told reporters that it would pass the $12.1 billion bill for the Interior Department and other agencies so national parks and museums could reopen. But Republican defections caused the House to reject the bill on Wednesday night, for a second time, because of provisions favoring mining and logging on public lands.
The bill was sent back to House-Senate conferees on a 230-to-199 vote as 48 Republicans joined 181 Democrats and 1 independent in opposing it. Fifteen Democrats joined 184 Republicans in backing the bill.
Passage would have been no more than a political gesture anyway. The President has vowed to veto it because of its cuts in programs for American Indians, the arts and endangered species.
At the White House, Michael D. McCurry, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, described the impact of the partial closure this way:
"There were 28,000 people who would have made applications for Social Security benefits that didn't. There were 1,613 people, on an average day, who would make claims for compensation and pension benefits. And they didn't get served yesterday."
He said 726,000 people would have visited national parks, 55,000 tourists would have visited the Washington Monument or museums here, 22,000 people would have got passports and 700 people would have joined the armed services.
"So, did we make it through the day?" he said. "Yeah, we made it through the day, but that's a lousy way to do business."

His friends had predicted that their fourth for coffee and cigarettes this morning would show his stripes as a "liberal pinko commie," and when Neil Dempsey slid into the booth at Mount Clemens Coney Island restaurant, he did not disappoint them.
"I support the President," Mr. Dempsey said, ignoring their smoky guffaws to take his stand on the impasse in Washington. But as he detailed his objections to the Republicans' tactics and his fears of higher Medicare and other health care costs, his friends just kept grinning. 
 "You ought to put a commission together," chortled Ken Flynn, from across the table. "Maybe put Hillary in charge of it."
While Mr. Dempsey got little empathy from his old friends, interviews here in the capital of right-leaning, blue-collar Macomb County, just northeast of Detroit, suggest that he is far from alone. Among these people, President Clinton's position on Medicare appears to be attracting sympathy his way.
Voters here are viewed by pollsters and pundits as archetypal "Reagan Democrats," but no Democratic Presidential candidate has carried this overwhelmingly white county since Hubert H. Humphrey did in 1968. Still, voters retain an independent streak. Mount Clemens is also the home of Representative David E. Bonior, the House minority whip, who is Speaker Newt Gingrich's chief antagonist in the House.
And polling here last month showed that most voters in Mr. Bonior's district, which includes most of Macomb and all of smaller St. Clair County, are unhappy with the Republican-controlled Congress.
"I'm not a Clinton fan at all, but I have to support him on this one," said Bill Visnaw, the owner of Bill Visnaw's Styling Barbershop, who voted for Ross Perot in 1992 and approves of the Republicans' Contract With America. He said he thought Medicare needed fixing, but not during a budget fight.
"To use the budget, the expiration of it, as a lever -- this is supposed to be something that is sat down and thought out and discussed and compromised on," Mr. Visnaw said. "Gingrich seems to be on the rampage, flexing a little too much power."
Views here of the standoff in Washington seemed to turn less on whom voters support than on whom they blame less. Some seemed chagrined to discover that they saw Mr. Clinton as the lesser malefactor.
"I never liked him -- I can't stand him -- but right now I'd vote for him over what's running," said one woman, who added that she worried about Medicare as she neared retirement from a job with the county. She declined to give her name. "Not the way I talked about Clinton," she said.
The one universal sentiment was frustration over the impasse, widely seen not as a clash of principles but as a means to score political points.
"The way we look around the world, we look like a bunch of little boys in the sandbox," said Mr. Flynn, one of the group in the restaurant who were chiding Mr. Dempsey.
Mr. Flynn, who runs a real estate agency, added, "The only thing Republicans and Democrats agree on in this thing is that 60 percent of the Medicare cost is fraud." But Mr. Dempsey, a banker, glimpsed a chance to get a little of his own back and demurred. He said he could not imagine that "Republican doctors" were overcharging. "I just can't," he said.
Behind the cash register, Nick Raptis, 66, said he was willing to pay a little more for his Medicare benefits, even though he already worked part time to get by. "I think Clinton should give in on some things," he said. "I don't mind paying more for Medicare, if it will help them."
Because the local economy is underpinned by parts plants supplying the healthy automobile industry, Macomb County is booming, with an unemployment rate of only 4 percent. Voters here rate crime and drugs as their top concerns.
But in an opinion poll last month for The Detroit News, far more voters said they worried most about "health care reform, including Medicare and Medicaid," than said they worried most about Federal taxes, the deficit, or the economy.
Only 40 percent gave the Republican-controlled Congress a positive rating. "I think that has to be the Medicare issue," said Bernie Porn, president of EPIC/MRA, which conducted the poll. Similarly, he said, a statewide poll by the firm last month showed Mr. Clinton taking a lead of 50 percent to 38 percent over the Republican front-runner, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, because of elderly voters, Mr. Porn said.
Mr. Bonior has been highlighting Medicare here. "We've been harping on that issue for like six or seven months, and it's now coming to a head," said Leo R. Lalonde, chairman of the Macomb County Democratic Committee.
But Susy Heintz, the leader of the state Republican Party, waved off the apparent success. "It's a nice scare technique to use on the public, and in a way it's worked well," she said. "But I don't think in the long term it's good for the country or that it will work."
She said similar tactics had driven down the approval ratings of Michigan's Governor, John Engler. But Mr. Engler, a Republican, stuck to plans to cut back Michigan's welfare system, and his ratings have rebounded to above 60 percent -- including in Mr. Bonior's district.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Hong Kong's Future

BYLINE: By Philip Taubman 

DATELINE: Hong Kong

 BODY:
Hong Kong residents like to talk about their insurance policies, but not the types that cover cars, homes or health. In Hong Kong, insurance means protection against China. The most popular policy is a foreign passport.
The transfer of Hong Kong from Britain to China on July 1, 1997, promises to be a great test of China's maturity as a world power. If China takes possession of Hong Kong while letting the city retain its entrepreneurial spirit, fair judiciary, free press and incipient democracy, Beijing will reassure a world wary of its Communist leaders. If China erases the rule of law in Hong Kong and strangles civil liberties, the city's commercial energy may not survive and China's place among nations will be compromised. 
 Even a brief visit here makes clear that China has everything to gain by leaving Hong Kong intact. Half of China's exports are shipped through Hong Kong, and two-thirds of foreign direct investments in China already pass through Hong Kong businesses and financial institutions. Most Hong Kong manufacturing companies have moved their factories to southern China in recent years, transferring jobs and wealth as they went. The Hong Kong stock market promises to be a primary source of capital for new and growing Chinese companies. As Chinese commercial centers like Shanghai struggle to achieve world-class rank, Hong Kong is there right now, alongside New York, London and Tokyo.
Business leaders like Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, have great faith in the strength and durability of the city's capitalist character. The traders, bankers, brokers and builders of Hong Kong cannot imagine why China would want to spoil such a powerful engine of economic growth. In economic terms they are right, but they may underestimate the political hazards ahead.
The British implanted a free press and judiciary in Hong Kong. After a century and a half of imperial rule Britain has belatedly introduced a touch of democratic governance in recent years under the leadership of Chris Patten, London's 28th and last Governor of Hong Kong.
While Mr. Patten has not turned Hong Kong into a democracy, he has uncorked a desire for greater self-determination among its citizens, and made it possible for progressive local political leaders like Martin Lee, the chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, to step forward as 1997 nears.
The danger is that China, skittish about political dissent and democratic process, will roughly toss aside Mr. Lee and others like him and enforce strict ideological conformity in Hong Kong. That could quickly chill relations between Beijing and Washington, where many in Congress are spoiling for a fight with China, and shake foreign investors' confidence in Hong Kong. From there, it would not take much to panic the Hong Kong real estate market, and with it the city's wealth.
Resentment about Hong Kong runs strong in China, and the Chinese Government has made clear it has no intention of preserving Mr. Patten's innovations, including an increase in directly elected seats in a local legislative body that has given citizens some say in city governance. Chinese officials say dissent will be tolerated in Hong Kong, provided it is not part of an effort to undermine the Government in Beijing. That sounds like a formula easily interpreted to stifle free expression.
Hong Kong is an economic phenomenon, one that a practical and increasingly commercial China can appreciate and preserve. But Hong Kong is also six million people who have lived in a more open and tolerant society than the one they will join in 1997.
Under terms of the transfer, China agreed to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years, except in matters of foreign affairs and defense. "One country, two systems" was the way the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping described the plan when Britain and China reached agreement in 1984. It will be a sad day for Hong Kong and a senseless loss for China if Beijing fails to honor Mr. Deng's word. PHILIP TAUBMAN

HEADLINE: A Bad Budget Bill Gets Worse

 BODY:
The face-off between President Clinton and the Republicans over the debt-ceiling and temporary spending bills is a sideshow compared with the negotiations over the permanent budget going on among Republican leaders of the House and Senate. They are hammering out a reconciliation measure -- a mammoth package of cuts in entitlements, like Medicare and Medicaid, and skewed tax cuts that would bring the budget into balance over seven years. Judging from news leaks, they have seized some of the worst parts of the separate bills passed by the two houses.
Whatever bill the G.O.P. sends to the White House for the President's signature this week or next will be vetoed. Both sides want to look tough before their constituents. But the provisions of the initial bill will set the boundaries for further negotiations with the Administration. That is why decisions that the Republican leaders have made this week on taxes, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and agriculture are disheartening. 
 Taxes. The leaders have, as expected, embraced the unaffordable $245 billion cut passed by the House and Senate. Then they took an unnecessary cut in the tax on capital gains and made it substantially worse. They applied the tax break to old investments, which is nothing more than a wasteful giveaway to wealthy investors. They have also reportedly decided to index the capital gains tax for inflation, starting in 2001. That would open an enormous loophole: Investors would be allowed to correct the amount of income they report for inflation, but would not be required to correct their reported deductions for the cost of their investments. Finally, the leaders have settled on huge cuts in tax credits for working poor families, effectively raising their taxes.
Medicaid. The House would abolish Federal guarantees of health insurance for the poor. The Senate would guarantee coverage for pregnant women, poor children and the disabled. The conferees apparently will drop the disabled. Exactly what health benefits, if any, the women and children would be entitled to receive is unclear.
Medicare. Besides approving recklessly large cuts, the conferees are likely to adopt rules that would allow doctors who are not in business with each other to discuss what prices they charge and what services they will insist patients buy under an unusually loose set of antitrust rules. That is good for the doctors, and bad for everyone else.
Agriculture. To their credit, the Republicans may propose dismantling key components of the welfare system -- price supports, import limits and production quotas -- that has kept farm income elevated. But the powerful dairy industry will get off without a nick, retaining the bizarre system that keeps milk prices high, especially in the Northeast. The conferees apparently plan to cut school lunches for needy children so they can maintain subsidies to farmers of up to $250,000 per person in each farm household.
Welfare. Conferees have reportedly settled on huge cuts in food stamps and removed them as a safety net for the long-term unemployed. They plan to cut most aid to legal immigrants and propose changes to throw more than 300,000 poor children out of the Federal program for the disabled.
The conferees appear headed toward a viciously unbalanced budget. According to Administration estimates, the House G.O.P. budget will take about $900 worth of benefits, on average, from families earning less than $30,000, but only $155 from families earning above $100,000. At the same time it will cut taxes by virtually nothing on the low-income families, but cut them by about $1,600 for high-income families.
The existing entitlement programs and taxes will remain in place until Congress passes a bill that the President signs. If the Republicans insist on extreme measures, Mr. Clinton should veto that bill until the day he stands for re-election.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Reflections on Luck and Lucking Out

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

LUCK: The Brilliant Randomness of Everyday Life
By Nicholas Rescher
237 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $19.
 
THE LUCK BUSINESS: The Devastating Consequences and Broken Promises of America's Gambling Explosion
By Robert Goodman
273 pages. Marvin Kessler Books/The Free Press. $23.
Such is the attraction of luck in our lives that a book called "Luck: The Brilliant Randomness of Everyday Life" sounds appealing from its title alone. Yet Nicholas Rescher, a philosophy professor at the University of Pittsburgh, reminds us here that much more is needed for a good book than luck. 
 With his wordily prosaic style and his meandering organization, he unluckily succeeds in making the subject of luck dull. Or is it that luck matters so much that little about it remains to be explored? Certainly we already know, as Mr. Rescher reminds us, that "success or failure in situations of competition and conflict often hinges on matters of fortuitous happenstance." Or that "there is enormous scope for luck in warfare."
Eventually, Mr. Rescher does wend his way to the slightly less obvious conclusion that life without luck would be unbearable for humans. "Our psychological and emotional condition is such that we would not want to live in a preprogrammed world, a world where the rest of our fate and future is preordained and indeed prediscernible in the realities of the present," he writes. "Even at the price of falling victim to chance and haphazard, we yearn for novelty and innovation, for a liberation from an inevitability programmed by the settled determination of the past."
Yet such is the power of his prose to snuff out the promise of surprise that one finds it a struggle to remain awake long enough to arrive at this conclusion.
Further pitfalls of luck become evident in Robert Goodman's new book, "The Luck Business: The Devastating Consequences and Broken Promises of America's Gambling Explosion." Mr. Goodman, who teaches environmental design and planning at Hampshire College, was director of the United States Gambling Study, and the results of that survey of legalized gambling as a strategy for economic development inform his well-reasoned book.
What he learned is that a decade or so ago Las Vegas's success as a gambling enterprise began to inspire other locales to copy it as a way of reviving economically depressed communities. As a result, between 1988 and 1994 the number of states authorizing casinos to operate rose to 23 from 2, and the total yearly casino revenues went to $15 billion from $8 billion.
But what the new gambling locales failed to allow for, he reasons, was that Las Vegas attracted tourists from out of state and that the enterprises their money nourished did not compete with an existing developed economy. Moreover, he adds, "those tourists who either had or would develop pathological gambling problems took their problems -- such as losing their jobs, getting involved in criminal activities to pay off debts and a host of other costly consequences -- back home with them."
By contrast, Mr. Goodman writes, gamblers who go to Atlantic City, for example, tend to be "day trippers" from other parts of the state, so that "instead of providing a jump start for local economic development," the Atlantic City casinos actually drain resources from enterprises that already exist. Moreover, Mr. Goodman concludes, because these gamblers live in the state, New Jersey has to bear the costs of problem gambling generated by the casinos.
These drawbacks are obvious, he says, but the lesson has failed to sink in. More and more American communities have turned to legalized gambling as a superficial solution for shrinking revenues from a dying industrial base. As Indian communities (like the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in Ledyard, Conn.) have won the right to run high-stakes gambling establishments (like the hugely successful Foxwoods Casino), neighboring locales have competed to protect themselves.
Yet never does the impulse for legalized gambling come from any grass-roots popular movement, Mr. Goodman found. The pressure always comes from above, from the highly organized gambling industry. And once communities succumb, they must begin to behave like bad poker players chasing their losses. "They legalize new games or they get rid of restrictions and betting limits on their old ones," the author writes. "As the chasing process progresses, more hard-core forms of gambling are rapidly legalized in a copycat race by state after state. As each state's gambling menu expands, its gambling policy begins to spin out of control, and governments and state residents soon find themselves with gambling enterprises they never imagined when their process of legalization first began."
Near the end of his compelling study, Mr. Goodman steps back and reasons that the lust for legalized gambling has risen as the prospects of succeeding through hard work have declined in this country. And deplorably enough, in his view, governments, instead of discouraging speculation, are now promoting the fantasy of getting rich on a bet, as witness New York State's advertising slogan: "All you need is a dollar and a dream."
Since he is not opposed to gambling in all forms, Mr. Goodman proposes a lottery in which some of the income is lent to local businesses. Such linking of legalized gambling to a form of industrial policy sounds appealing if only because something would be created, in contrast to present forms of legalized gambling, where, in the author's view, nothing is created and money is taken from the poor.
Further, such a lottery as he proposes would put luck in the proper place that Branch Rickey, the late baseball executive, once assigned it when he made his shrewd observation that luck at its best is "the residue of design." Which comment, when you stop to think about it, pretty well sums up the wisest things that both these books have to say on the subject of luck.

Dow Soars to 4,969.36, Its 58th Record This Year
The stock market barreled ahead, once again, extending record closings of the Dow Jones industrial average to 58 so far this year, just one shy of the 20th century record of 59 set in 1925 and 1964.
The Dow soared 46.61 points to close at 4,969.36. The S.&P. 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes also gained ahead of today's double witching. Airline and banking stocks rose, while technology shares lagged. [Page D6.]
 
The bond market also strengthened as the yield on the long bond fell to 6.22 percent, nearly a two-year low. [D16.]
 
Russia Will Repay $32.5 Billion
Russia agreed to repay $32.5 billion in loans taken out by the former Soviet republics. By signing a rescheduling agreement in Frankfurt with 600 creditor banks, Moscow ended its financial isolation and virtually guaranteed it would be able to borrow on world capital markets. [D6.]
 
Upheaval at MCA Music Unit
The chairman of MCA Inc.'s music division, Al Teller, quit suddenly and was replaced by Doug Morris, who was dismissed a few months ago as head of Time Warner's music division. The upheaval came after months of building of MCA by its new owner, Seagram. [D5.]
 
Republicans Complete Budget Bill
Republicans completed their plan to erase the Federal budget deficit by 2002, while overhauling scores of social programs. Both houses approved a new Republican-sponsored temporary spending bill to finance Government agencies and bring all Federal employees back to work. But the measure competed for attention with the continued dueling between G.O.P. leaders and President Clinton, who has vowed to veto the bill. [A1.]
 
Pacific Free Trade Zone Planned
A pan-Pacific free-trade zone spanning countries with more than two billion people and over half the world's economic output would be created under voluntary guidelines agreed to by 18 Asia-Pacific nations. [A9.]
 
Physicians' Earnings Slide
Doctors' incomes are falling as managed care organizations tighten their grip on the nation's health-care system. The American Medical Association said the median earnings of all physicians dropped 3.8 percent last year to $150,000, from $156,000 in 1993. [A1.]
 
Medical school slots should be slashed by 20 to 25 percent over the next 10 years, a study by the Pew Health Professions Commission recommended, contending that a surplus of doctors was driving up medical costs. [D2.]
 
Behind CBS's '60 Minutes' Decision
CBS canceled a "60 Minutes" interview with a tobacco company executive last weekend because of fear of being sued under a legal theory called tortious interference with contracts, legal experts said. [B14.]
 
Media analysts' warnings that aggressive news coverage is in jeopardy were recalled by the image of CBS lawyers overpowering "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. [B14.]
 
More Utilities Flock to Australia
More American utilities are ready to make major investments in Australia. Pacificorp of Oregon agreed to buy Powercor for $1.6 billion, and Entergy of New Orleans is said to be set to buy Citipower for about $1.16 billion. [D18.]
 
Denver Officials Criticize Levitt
Denver officials accused Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the S.E.C., of being "prejudiced and biased," and argued he should be barred from considering a pending enforcement action concerning the sale of Denver International Airport bonds. [D15.]
 
Nuclear Tests Cut Beaujolais Sales
The ballyhoo over Beaujolais nouveau was upstaged this year in many places, including Japan, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, by boycotts to protest French nuclear tests in the Pacific, dealers said. [A10.]

HEADLINE: Medical Schools Are Urged To Cut Admissions by 20%

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
In a move that would radically change the system of training doctors in this country, a panel of national health care experts called yesterday for slashing the number of medical school slots by 20 to 25 percent over the next 10 years, asserting that there is an oversupply of doctors that contributes to the inefficiency of medical care.
The recommendation by the Pew Health Professions Commission comes with an added sting -- the proposal that these cuts be achieved by closing entire schools and training programs, an echo of the closing of military bases. Any such closings are sure to face opposition in communities that are economically dependent on medical schools. 
 The 21-member commission also recommended trimming the physician surfeit by significantly scaling back doctor training programs, better known as residency programs, primarily by cutting the number of positions open to graduates of foreign medical schools.
The report by the Pew Commission comes as Congress has voted far-reaching cuts in public subsidizing of graduate medical education through the Medicare program and as health care experts are lamenting the poor distribution of doctors that leaves some areas with a glut and others in dire need.
The recommendations also run counter to a surge in applications to medical schools. Last year, 45,365 people applied for the roughly 16,000 slots in American medical schools, a record number of applicants and more than double what it was eight years ago.
Experts say that the current ratio of doctors to patients nationwide is about 250 per 100,000, well above the 150 to 100,000 ratio that many consider optimum. If the medical education system keeps growing at its current pace, experts say the ratio will reach 290 for every 100,000 people over the next decade, causing inefficiency and inflated costs.
"We've added 150,000 doctors over the last decade, and areas with a shortage of doctors have increased from 2,110 to 2,271," said Richard D. Lamm, the former Governor of Colorado, who is chairman of the commission. "The fact is there is an oversupply of doctors and oversupply of our educational training that has to be set right to respond to the changing health system. Anybody who tries to keep unnecessary military bases, or unnecessary hospitals or medical schools, is asking for inefficiency and trouble."
The commission -- which includes former government officials, medical educators, public health professionals and insurance company executives -- was started five years ago by the Pew Charitable Trusts to research health care issues and to make policy recommendations. Other members include William Gradison, president of the Health Insurance Association of America; Pamela J. Maraldo, past president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and Dr. John P. Howe 3d, president of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.
Although the panel has no power of enforcement, experts say that its recommendations are likely to be taken seriously.
Medical school administrators and doctors said that adopting the panel's recommendations would cause a maelstrom in the world of medical academia. The proposals were embraced by some as painful but necessary and criticized by others as drastic and destabilizing.
"Are the Pew Commission's recommendations necessary? Yes," said Dr. Jane Henney, vice president for health sciences at the University of New Mexico. "Will they be easy to put in motion? No. But should that be done? Yes."
Dr. Ralph Snyderman, dean of the medical school at Duke University, said that what the commission accurately recognized was that "the upheaval in health care delivery must reach into the academic world."
Duke has already decided to cut its residency program, which now trains 495 doctors annually, by 30 percent over the next four years in response to marketplace shifts and an expected drop in Medicare training subsidies.
Dr. Snyderman said that while he might quibble with some of the numbers the panel proposed, the report was "an important document that will focus attention on a subject that many are reluctant to face."
But Dr. Jordan J. Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges, called the Pew report "a misguided policy and an affront to reason."
He agreed that it was necessary to reduce the number of residency posts for foreign medical school graduates. At the end of last year, there were 23,499 international medical graduates training in the United States, double the number of five years ago.
"But there is no factual basis to justify this drastic level of cutbacks in American medical school slots," he said. "It would dismantle a system that has done nothing but respond to the needs of the American people."
The panel also called for raising the number of primary care practitioners in the country, with the goal of achieving an even balance of specialists and generalists. Graduating medical school students are already pushing the balance in that direction.
Recognizing the devastating impact that these recommendations would have on inner-city and public hospitals -- since they depend on residents, primarily graduates of foreign medical schools, to deliver much of the front-line care to their impoverished patients -- the panel also proposed expanding the National Health Service Corps, a federally financed program that sends health professionals to underserved areas.

HEADLINE: Doctors' Incomes Fall as Managed Care Grows

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
For the first time in the 14 years that the American Medical Association has been keeping track, doctors' incomes are falling as managed care organizations tighten their grip on the nation's health care system.
The median earnings of all physicians, from front-line general practitioners to highly paid specialists like brain surgeons, dropped 3.8 percent last year to $150,000, from $156,000 in 1993, according to preliminary results from the A.M.A.'s latest annual survey. The median income -- the point at which half of all doctors make more and half make less -- had risen 2 percent in 1993 and had surged 7.9 percent in 1992. 
 And with managed health care spreading, some say the outlook for physicians could become even grimmer. Edward O'Neil, executive director of the Center for the Health Professions at the University of California at San Francisco, said managed care companies in the state were projecting charges 20 to 30 percent below current levels over the next three to five years.
"It's not just California," he said. "In places like Georgia, the Pacific Northwest and Minnesota, they are saying that to be competitive, we've got to go with this 20 to 30 percent range of reductions."
The pressure on pay comes mostly from outside the profession: employers are demanding lower insurance premiums, and insurers are leaning on health care providers to cut costs.
But another factor is at work from within: an explosion in America's doctor population over the last 30 years. The number of physicians has soared to 660,582 today, or 252 for each 100,000 Americans -- not counting Federal Government doctors -- compared with 266,045, or 139 for each 100,000, in 1965.
Thrown on the defensive, many doctors are fighting back by joining medical groups, by selling their practices to hospitals and investor-owned management companies or by organizing their own health maintenance organizations. Others are retreating to backwaters that desperately need them, or even dropping out of the job market.
Still others struggle along, often at surprisingly low compensation levels. Although few tears are likely to flow for the millionaire California specialist who recently retired to Mexico rather than absorb a 50 percent drop to $500,000 a year, many people are likely to feel sympathy for doctors like Andrea Leeds, a Bellmore, L.I., pediatrician.
Dr. Leeds, a daughter and sister of doctors, said she could double her income, to $71,000, by returning to school teaching, which she gave up for "a calling rather than a career" that includes treating children in emergencies at 2 A.M.
Under the latest insurance company payment schedules, she said, "I won't be able to maintain the level of care I am giving, just to make the overhead costs" in the home office that took all her savings to build and furnish.
One company is offering a low $7 a month, or $84 a year, for each child enrolled aged 2 or older. "What am I supposed to do if the child comes in to see me four times?" Dr. Leeds asked. "I am a board-certified pediatrician with top credentials, but I am still viewed as surplus by the insurance companies. They say they have enough physicians."
Many doctors say the insurers push them to deny care to sick patients, but advocates for managed care say that on the contrary, it enhances the quality of care by promoting preventive medicine, tracking successful treatments and eliminating tests and procedures deemed unnecessary.
Health maintenance organizations in many parts of the country say they are still assuring handsome incomes to primary care physicians like Dr. Leeds. But in markets dominated by the H.M.O.'s, like San Diego, the payers have stomped on the revenues of both primary and specialty doctors.
Companies that were paying H.M.O. premiums of $120 a month for each employee two years ago are paying $105 now, and some are down to the low $90's, said Dr. Donald C. Balfour 3d, president of Sharp-Rees-Stealy, a big San Diego medical group with 285 physicians, including 114 in primary care.
The health-maintenance organizations passed along most of the cuts to hospitals and doctors. Dr. Balfour said the revenues of his group had gone "downhill" for two years and were expected to fall by 5 to 10 percent in 1996. When revenues fell short for the year that ended on Sept. 30, the Sharp-Rees physicians swallowed an 8 percent pay cut.
Still, primary care physicians in big San Diego medical groups earn $150,000 a year, well above the national average for that group, and specialists earn even more. Dr. Balfour conceded that there was "not a lot of sympathy" for people making that much money, but, he said, "our physicians obviously work very hard to achieve that."
Deeply concerned about rising health costs, employers have increasingly embraced managed care restraints that essentially reduce the doctors' former freedom to call the shots in ordering tests and treatments for patients. Now the employers are forcing the H.M.O.'s to lower prices.
"Everyone is going to get less money except the C.E.O. of the health plan," said Dr. James Hay, a family practitioner who heads a group of 80 doctors, North County Physicians Medical Group, in Encinitas in San Diego County.
"California and a few other places like Minnesota led the country in managed care," Dr. Hay added, "but it's coming much faster everywhere else. Now the health plans can establish managed care very quickly, in a year or two."
Rob Levy, a consultant in Atlanta with the Foster Higgins benefits consulting firm, said, "We're seeing prices fall in almost every market for both managed care premiums and compensation to physicians."
In Baltimore, for example, which is rapidly moving to managed care, primary care doctors who do not have partners "are coming to us, concerned that their incomes are going down," said Scott Rifkin, an internist who is chairman of the Doctors Health System, a doctor-owned company that manages physician practices.
Primary care doctors -- mainly family physicians, internists and pediatricians -- who got more than half of their gross income from managed care patients lost 15 percent of their income this year, according to a recent survey of 89 big physician groups, H.M.O.'s, hospitals and health care systems. The survey was conducted by Ernst & Young, the benefits-consulting and accounting firm.
Experts take such studies with a grain of salt. Even James A. Rodeghero, the Ernst & Young consultant who directed the study, warned that the decline could reflect "a statistical blip." Although it covered 10,520 doctors, the study was not rigorously designed to reflect the entire profession.
Even so, other surveys reported a similar trend. For example, a study by the Hay Group, also a consulting firm, of big medical organizations that include 25,000 doctors showed pediatricians' incomes down 1.5 percent this year from 1994, and internists down 1.3 percent. But earnings of family-practice doctors rose 1 percent.
Doctors' pay slipped last year even as American households enjoyed a slight increase in income, of seven-tenths of a percent, albeit from a much lower base, to a median $32,264, from $32,041 in 1993, according to the Census Bureau. The A.M.A. said its preliminary results also showed that the average incomes of physicians fell last year, also by about 4 percent.
Mr. Levy said many primary care doctors were defending their incomes by joining medical groups, negotiating multiyear salary arrangements and selling their practices to hospitals and physician management companies like Phycor Inc., Caremark International and Medpartners Inc.
Medical associations in many states are helping doctors to organize their own H.M.O.'s, hoping to eliminate the middleman and deal directly with employers. Many hospitals are trying a similar tack. Lobbyists for the physicians and hospitals recently persuaded Congress to encourage these ventures in the pending Medicare legislation.
Doctors in a group "have more negotiating clout" with the H.M.O.'s on fee schedules or the flat monthly rates per enrollee that are increasingly popular, said Paul B. Ginsburg, a Washington-based economist who heads the Center for Studying Health System Change. Also, there are more physicians to share the costs of treating patients with expensive illnesses.
Some are moving away from areas where managed care is rampant and the squeeze on physicians is strong. At least 50 doctors left the Sacramento, Calif., region last year, for example, for rural corners of Northern California, Montana and other states.
In Los Angeles, Dr. Marvin Kazmin said he "saw the handwriting on the wall" at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center when the hospital omitted him and 40 fellow urologists from a new managed care group that it organized last year.
"Either I moved or I retired," he said. "I was too peppy to quit." Dr. Kazmin, 61, moved to Mercy Hospital in Willard, Ohio, a semirural area where he is now the sole urologist for miles around.
At Phycor, Joseph C. Hutts, the chairman, said primary care doctors' incomes were rising in the company's 44 medical groups across the country. But he said specialists' incomes were flat.
Both the Ernst & Young and Hay Group studies showed many specialists' incomes rising this year, after a decline. But James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, said "the big gap between generalists' and specialists' " incomes would probably narrow. American specialists' earnings are about 2.5 times those of general practitioners, compared with a much smaller 1.5-to-1 ratio in Europe and Canada.
"This is not going to be a lot of fun for people," said Gail Wilensky, who heads a Congressional advisory commission on Medicare payments to physicians. "A lot of individuals who have not done anything wrong are going to find themselves on the short end of the stick.
"It happened in the defense industry and in corporate America when companies were attempting to downsize," she added. "But people in health care thought it would never happen to them."

HEADLINE: Asian Nations And U.S. Plan Freer Trade

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Despite some misgivings, ministers from 18 nations in the Asia-Pacific region agreed today on voluntary guidelines for a pan-Pacific free-trade zone spanning countries with more than two billion people and over half the world's economic output.
American officials say the agenda strongly reaffirms the goal of achieving free trade by 2010 for developed nations and by 2020 for developing ones, and makes it clear that all industries should be covered. 
 "The train is gaining speed," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. "No derailment at all -- in fact, just the opposite. We have made a major step forward here at Osaka."
Others say the guidelines are not that strong.
On the principal of allowing for "flexibility," the free-trade camp says this means that countries can delay lowering trade barriers until close to the target date but must still meet the deadline. But critics say such "flexibility" constitutes a way to escape any commitments.
"I believe there will be several different interpretations of what has been agreed," said Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of China.
The document does not even define what is meant by "free and open trade." While that might seem to mean no tariffs, the forum's goal is only to reduce tariffs, not eliminate them. "That could mean zero," an American official said. "It could mean something more than zero."
Moreover, the agreement is not binding and the organization has no means of enforcement. It would not be a formal free-trade zone like the European Union, but would rely on voluntary action and peer pressure, with all the members scrutinizing and discussing one another's plans. This has been called a "unique" Asian way.
Free trade, at least in theory, should allow for faster growth in already booming East Asia. American officials hope that lower trade barriers will allow American companies to export more products, creating more jobs in the United States. Already, Mr. Kantor said, more than two million American jobs are linked to exports to Asia.
But the luster from the success in forging the guidelines was dimmed by the announcement that President Clinton will not attend Sunday's meeting of the leaders of the nations that make up trade forum. Vice President Al Gore will come instead, while the President stays home to deal with the budget crisis. It was Mr. Clinton who convened the first such summit meeting, two years ago in Seattle, thus raising the prominence of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Officials from Japan and other nations said they understood the cancellation was not meant as a snub.
The announcement of the cancellation came just as trade and foreign ministers convened today to approve the "action agenda" for turning last year's free-trae vision into reality.
The agenda, which will not be made public until after the leaders meet on Sunday, lays out the basic principles by which the countries will strive to lower trade barriers. It also lists 15 areas to be covered by liberalization efforts, including tariffs and government purchases. Each country is supposed to announce a plan for reducing its own barriers at next year's meeting, in Manila.
Up until only a few days ago, there was a concern among supporters of the free-trade vision that some countries would win exceptions for sensitive industries; China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan had been seeking exceptions for agriculture. Other countries would also then demand exceptions, setting off a chain reaction that would unravel the effort.
Rafidah Abdul Aziz, the Minister of International Trade and Industry of Malaysia, was quoted by the Kyodo News Service as calling the agenda a "comedown" for "hard-liners who have insisted on free trade, regimented deadlines, targets and hard and fast rules.
To arrive at today's agreement, the ministers had to overcome other sticking points. Japan, which had been criticized as lacking leadership, won praise for its role in guiding the members to compromise.
One sticking point was a dispute between the United States and China. China had wanted language stating that the benefits of lower trade barriers would apply to all members without discrimination. But Washington said it could not agree to lower trade barriers automatically for China because United States law requires that the decision on granting favorable trade status to China be reviewed every year.
The agreed wording states that members "will apply or endeavor to apply" the principle of nondiscrimination, which gives Washington a way out and means that China's trade status will still face yearly reviews.

HEADLINE: China Rebukes Four Other Nuclear Powers on Arms Control

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Issuing a major policy statement on arms control, China tonight sharply rebuked the United States, Russia, Britain and France for continuing to develop "nuclear weapons and outer space weapons, including guided missile defense systems," while seeking in some cases to deny the peaceful use of nuclear technology to the developing world.
The policy document, issued by the official New China News Agency, said the world's major nuclear powers "on the one hand, vie with one another in dumping their advanced weapons on the international market, even using weapons transfers as a means to interfere in other nations' domestic affairs." 
 "On the other," it continued, "they resort to discriminative anti-proliferation and arms control measures, directing the spearhead of arms control at the developing countries."
Without mentioning Taiwan, the document implicitly warned Washington that Beijing regards continuing arms sales to the island as interference in China's internal affairs.
For the first time, the policy declaration also appeared to express China's formal opposition to an American proposal to deploy ballistic missile defense systems in Asia to protect Japan and American military forces there, principally against North Korea.
Beijing fears that such a missile defense system could undermine Chinese strategic nuclear forces, which were developed to hold American, Japanese and Russian targets at risk of retaliation in any nuclear conflict.
Chinese officials were alarmed when President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a communique in May saying Washington and Moscow should cooperate in developing ballistic missile defenses.
In a larger context, China's policy presentation was made to a world and regional audience that is very much concerned with fundamental security questions in Asia. They include the rising military tensions between China and Taiwan; the territorial conflicts in the South China Sea, where there are rich deposits of oil, and China's competition with Japan for regional dominance. The role of American forces in Asia is connected to each one of these issues.
China's policy statement may have also been timed in part to blunt the international criticism that will resume when Beijing detonates its expected third underground nuclear warhead this year, part of a final series of tests leading up to the conclusion in 1996 of a nuclear test ban treaty, which China has pledged to sign. Preparations at the Lop Nor testing range in the far west of China have been observed by American reconnaissance satellites, foreign diplomats here say.
Concerning its own nuclear cooperation with such countries as Iran and Pakistan, both of which have nuclear weapons programs, the document pledged that China would combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction. But it asserted, "There must not be a double standard whereby anti-nuclear proliferation is used as a pretext to limit or retard the peaceful use of nuclear energy by developing nations."
China defended its level of military spending, which has increased about 50 percent, taking inflation into account, since the late 1980's, according to estimates by Central Intelligence Agency.
"China needs a peaceful environment in order to be able to devote itself completely to its socialist modernization program," the document said. "As long as there is no serious threat to China's sovereignty or security, China will not increase its defense spending substantially or by a big margin. It will never threaten nor invade any other country."

HEADLINE: Broad-Based Stock Rally Is Continuing

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Although President Clinton and Congress are still at an impasse over the debt ceiling, the stock market nevertheless barreled ahead yesterday, extending its broad-based rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which soared 50.94 points on Wednesday, surged an additional 46.61 points yesterday to a high of 4,969.36. When the Dow scores its next gain -- assuming it does so this year -- it will have tied the 20th-century record of 59 new highs in one year, previously achieved only in 1925 and 1964. 
 Among the other major indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.38 points, to 597.34, its second consecutive record. The Nasdaq composite index increased 2.63 points, to 1,044.48.
"The market continues to kick over negatives and climb a wall of worry," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president of Fahnestock & Company. "The battle of the budget so far has not been enough to pull the market down."
The bond market also strengthened yesterday, amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth after the two sides in Washington resolve their differences. The 30-year Treasury bond jumped 31/32, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slid to 6.22 percent, from 6.29 percent Wednesday.
A round of computer-assisted "buy" orders related to today's double-witching options expiration was a factor in the stock rally. Options on both stocks and individual stock indexes will expire at the end of today's session.
One result was heavy volume, with yesterday's turnover on the New York Stock Exchange at 423.3 million shares, up from 376.1 million shares on Wednesday. Big Board advances topped declines by 1,535 to 809.
Traders were attracted to the shares of both McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, which have been holding talks regarding an exchange of assets or a merger. McDonnell Douglas climbed 4 3/8, to 90 5/8, and Boeing advanced 1 7/8, to 75 7/8.
Airline stocks benefited from the general market optimism. Delta Air Lines added 3/4, to 69 1/4; AMR, the holding company for American Airlines, gained 1 1/4, to 67 1/4, and UAL, the holding company for United Airlines, rose 5, to 190.
Money center banks, which usually have an increase in earnings when borrowing costs are in transition, were strong. Citicorp picked up 1 3/4, to 67 1/4, and BankAmerica advanced 1 1/8, to 60 1/2.
Portfolio managers also turned to oil issues, which have generally lagged behind the overall stock market. Royal Dutch/Shell closed at 127 1/2, up 2 1/8; Mobil closed at 107, up 2 1/8, and Triton closed at 53 1/8, up 1 1/8.
In contrast, many technology stocks dropped on profit taking. Micron fell 1 5/8, to 55 1/4; Intel declined 1 7/8, to 62 7/8; Apple gave up 1 1/16, to 39 15/16, and Compaq lost 1 5/8, to 50 1/4. Microsoft, which was downgraded by Goldman, Sachs, dipped 4 1/8, to 89 7/8.
Some retail stocks were also lower. Kmart, which reported a wider-than-expected loss for its fiscal third quarter, fell 1/8, to 7 5/8 and was the most active stock on the New York exchange. J. C. Penney dropped 5/8, to 46 3/8.
Norton McNaughton slumped 2, to 14, after announcing that it expected lower fiscal fourth-quarter profits. And Material Sciences, which was downgraded by Dillon, Read, declined 2 5/8, to 13.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Ignoring Budget Impasse, Gains on Stock and Bond Rallies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against other leading currencies yesterday, bolstered by rallies in American stock and bond markets.
The dollar was aided in its climb against the Japanese yen by a sizable cut in Japan's trade surplus. It was helped higher against the German mark by falling interest rates in Europe. 
 But strong gains for stock and bonds helped turn the attention of currency traders away from the battle in Washington over the budget. The rising markets increased demand for dollars to buy the securities.
"You've got to think that all this budget impasse has little effect on them, that a budget deal is inevitable," said Margaret Kudaraskas, senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data in Boston. "Clearly, they must be thinking that."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.61 points yesterday, to 4,969.36. Treasury prices also surged, driving the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.22 percent, from 6.29 percent on Wednesday.
"The demand for U.S. dollar-denominated assets usually supports the dollar," Ms. Kudaraskas said.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 102.09 yen from 101.38 yen on Wednesday. The dollar edged up to 1.4069 marks from 1.4062 marks and to 1.1385 Swiss francs from 1.1377 Swiss francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5557 from $1.5570.
The dollar began its rise in Asian trading.
In Japan, the Government reported that its trade surplus plunged 42 percent in October and 44 percent with the United States alone. That was the fourth consecutive monthly decline in the overall trade surplus compared with October last year.
A narrower trade surplus means that Japanese exporters have fewer dollars to sell for yen when they take profits home.
In Europe, economic data released yesterday indicated that lower interest rates were forthcoming. Indeed, the Netherlands and France cut rates yesterday, following Denmark, which lowered rates last week. Traders said that there was speculation that Britain and Switzerland could follow suit.
Traders subsequently reversed their recent move into the German currency.
In comparison, despite signs of some weakening, the "U.S. economy seems to be motoring along at a fairly good pace," said John Rothfield, an international economist at the Chicago office of Nationsbanc-CRT. "That seems to be good for the dollar," he said.

HEADLINE: St. Croix Journal;
For One Island, Storms Bring a Tourism Windfall

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: FREDERIKSTED, V.I., Nov. 10

 BODY:
About 40 students from Eulalie Rivera Elementary School came to greet two cruise ships at the pier here with gifts for the captains and songs and dances for the passengers. The students hoped to get a chance to board the ships, the Star Princess and the Regal Princess, but they had a mission first: charm the tourists into a repeat visit.
"Welcome! -- To our island! -- St. Croix!" the students cheered, stepping and clapping as about 3,000 travelers poured from the ships. 
 This winter season, St. Croix, one of the three United States Virgin Islands, expects to get more than four times its usual number of visitors because of damage in September by Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn to more popular travel destinations in the Caribbean. And as the misfortune of others creates an economic boom here, this island of more than 60,000 people is determined to seize the moment and a bigger piece of the growing Caribbean tourist business.
"St. Croix is probably going to have its best tourist season in six years," said David L. Edgell, tourism commissioner for the United States Virgin Islands.
Six years ago, Hurricane Hugo devastated St. Croix just as the island was poised to build up tourism and catch up with its two sister islands, St. Thomas and St. John. In 1994, 1.7 million people visited St. Thomas and St. John, compared with 193,000 who came here, bringing a combined $1 billion a year to the American territory.
Now, two other hurricanes have restored St. Croix's momentum by causing only moderate damage here but wreaking destruction in St. Thomas, Antigua and the divided island of St. Martin/St. Maarten. Two major hotels in St. John, which tourists usually reach through St. Thomas, are still closed.
As cruise lines look for substitutes, they are delivering two to three ships a day to St. Croix with up to 6,000 passengers. The island expects 370 calls from cruise ships, up from 80 last year.
The welcome mat is out throughout the island. In Frederiksted, the port city, economic depression is being lifted by signs like the one in a vacant corner storefront announcing, "Coming soon. Colombia Emeralds International." The business is one of 26 planned new stores and restaurants in Frederiksted and Christiansted.
In Cane Bay Beach, to the north, Philip Lipari was renovating his Cane Bay Beach Bar and expanding the kitchen. "This is a chance for us to shine and we need to take advantage of it," Mr. Lipari said.
St. Croix may not have the commercial appeal of St. Thomas, with its duty-free shopping, or the beauty of St. John, most of which is an unspoiled national park. But as the biggest of the three United States Virgin Islands, St. Croix is less crowded and more relaxing than St. Thomas, its residents say. It also offers great snorkling like St. John, they note, and less predictable Caribbean attractions, like West Indian and Danish colonial historic sites.
St. Croix's residents tend to attribute their island's lack of recognition relative to other Caribbean islands to government neglect and inadequate marketing in the United States. Some also said the island's business community had not been as aggressive -- or greedy -- as its counterpart in St. Thomas.
"St. Thomas sometimes has eight ships and St. Croix has not had one," said Myron Woodley, a taxi driver. "If you love your neighbor so much, why don't they say, 'Let's divert one ship to St. Croix?' What I'm saying is, let's share."
But the rivalry may be evening out. The territorial government is in the midst of a push to lure more tourism to St. Croix and recently authorized casino gambling on this island only. More hotels are planned, the airport is undergoing a $16 million expansion and a new 122-passenger catamaran ferry is scheduled to start island tours and runs to St. Thomas before Christmas.
There has also been a scramble to diversify attractions to fill visitors' days. On a recent morning, tour operators at the pier sold a stop at Mount Pellier Hot Domino Club, a restaurant that boasts beer-drinking pigs. A welcoming board at the Frederiksted pier listed round-trip taxi fares around the island: "Christiansted, $10," "Buccaneer Beach, $14" and "Kmart, $6."
Kmart?
"Some tourists want to go there," a cab driver said with a shrug.
Visitors like Robert and Anna Scinto, honeymooners from Connecticut and veterans of five cruises, said they would come back.
"It's a little bit quieter," Mr. Scinto, 37, said. "It's nice."
Mrs. Scinto, 32, said, "The shopping is not of the quality of St. Thomas, but for a peaceful beach day, it was perfect."
Many in St. Croix worry that cruise ships will flock back to St. Thomas when that island is again deemed suitable. But at least one line has decided on St. Croix as a regular stop for the 1996 winter season for some of its ships even before this year's hurricanes.
"We thought it'd be very attractive for our passengers to visit all three of the U.S. Virgin Islands," said Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Princess Cruises. "We think it's a good selling point."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Soar; Yields Near A 2-Year Low

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Technical buying, optimism on the budget battle and another sign of economic weakness combined yesterday to drive Treasury prices sharply higher.
The rally pushed the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.22 percent, from 6.29 percent on Wednesday, the lowest level in nearly two years. The price of the 30-year bond ended at 10820/32 , up 31/32 . 
 Prices of shorter-term maturities also rose. The price of the two-year note rose 3/32 , to 10010/32 , for a yield of 5.45 percent, down from 5.50 percent, and the 10-year note rose 18/32 , to 10413/32 , for a yield of 5.90 percent, down from 5.97 percent.
Overseas buying before the opening of the United States market gave prices a jump-start, prompting the covering of short positions. Short- sellers sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back at a lower price. When prices rise, as they did early yesterday, the short-seller needs to buy securities to limit his losses.
"A lot of hedge funds went home short yesterday afternoon and they got squeezed pretty good by that uptick overnight," said James Hale, senior fixed-income strategist at MMS International.
Foreign investors might have bought Treasury securities, analysts said, after learning that President Clinton had canceled his trip to Japan this weekend for a major Asian-Pacific regional meeting, interpreting the move as increasing chances for a compromise on the budget.
Prices were further bolstered after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia released its survey of regional conditions, which suggested continued weakness in manufacturing. The Philadelphia Fed's index of current manufacturing business activity fell sharply in November, to 7.9, from 25.5 in October. The November new orders and shipments indexes also fell from October levels.
The data provided further evidence of moderate economic growth and inflation and kept alive hopes that the Federal Reserve could reduce short-term interest rates in coming months. That possibility depends on a budget agreement being reached. Traders remained optimistic yesterday, even as a partial shutdown of the Government entered its third day.
Treasury prices surged after the release of the Philadelphia Fed report, piercing important resistance levels and setting off a technical rally, which sent bonds to their session highs.
"As we continued climbing, the technical picture turned extremely bullish," said John Canavan, an analyst with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc.
The positive tone of the bond market was reinforced by a sluggish November survey from the Home Builders Association, a trade group, and by a strengthening in the dollar. The Home Builders' housing market index fell 7 points in November, to 50, from October.
In the corporate debt market, prices followed Treasury securities higher.
The debt of McDonnell Douglas surged in price, with yields falling 5 to 10 basis points, dealers said, on a report in The Wall Street Journal that the company was in talks with Boeing on a merger or business combination. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Georgia Gulf Corporation priced $100 million in 10-year notes yesterday, its lead underwriter, Goldman, Sachs & Company, said. The notes, which are noncallable, have a 7.625 percent coupon and were priced at 99.735 to yield 7.663 percent, or 175 basis points over a comparable Treasury security. The notes are rated Ba1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: Pataki Will Not Open Books on Inaugural Fund

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki took office last January with the most lavish inaugural party in state history, a three-day pageant of feasting and music for 13,000 people. Despite its splendor, he used no government money for the event.
The Governor paid the bill by establishing a private corporation that solicited donations to a special inaugural fund. And as the Governor and his aides set it up a year ago, they made two promises. They pledged to abide strictly by state campaign finance laws, and they promised to open the fund's books to the public. 
 A year later, they have done neither.
The inaugural fund collected an estimated $500,000, donated by lobbyists, campaign contributors and businesses. Interviews with many of the companies that contributed the money show that at least five companies, and probably several more, gave far more to the inaugural fund than state campaign finance limits allow. Two companies gave $25,000 to the event, five times the maximum allowed under state campaign laws.
And according to state records, N.Y. Inaugural '95 may have used some of its money for political purposes. The fund gave $25,000 to the state Republican Committee late last year.
At the same time, despite requests from lawmakers and journalists over the last six months -- including one today -- the Governor's office has refused to make the inaugural committee's records public. In fact, the Governor's aides dissolved the corporation late last month -- just three weeks before they would have had to file an annual report that would have included information about its operations. Because the corporation was dissolved before the one-year deadline, no report will ever have to be filed.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said today that the inaugural fund would not release the names of contributors. She said it was a private corporation and not required to make such disclosures. In fact, she said, the information was kept from the Governor, too.
For "ethical reasons," she said, the corporation's former chief officer, Robert E. Boyle, a member of Mr. Pataki's cabinet, decided that it was best that Mr. Pataki and the rest of his cabinet not know the names of people or organizations that gave to the inauguration.
Told that some of the contributors' names had been printed in the official inaugural program, Ms. Mucha said, "I didn't know that." Later, she said that the program listed only "a small fraction" of the contributors.
Ms. Mucha also said the fund's $25,000 contribution to the state Republican Committee was to repay the party for its help in organizing the inauguration. But the party reported spending only $7,415 during December, the busiest period for inaugural preparations, and an itemized list published by the committee did not show that any of the money was spent on the inauguration.
The inaugural fund's activities have stirred a debate over the propriety of allowing the Governor or his aides to solicit, without public disclosure, large sums of money from companies that routinely do business with his office.
"What it does is it cements a relationship -- a potential payback relationship -- between the donors and the celebrant," said Ellen S. Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that studies the role of money in politics. "There are no limits on how much you can give to these accounts. The more you can give, the more insidious it is."
Critics contend that the inaugural should have been subject to state campaign laws not only to prevent conflicts, but also because it played a fundamentally political purpose: to promote Mr. Pataki and to burnish his image after a mud-spattered campaign.
A Democratic lawmaker charged today that N.Y. Inaugural '95 was established solely to circumvent state campaign restrictions and should be investigated for possible violations of state election laws.
"This was really an account created for the benefit of a political candidate who happened to have won an election," said State Senator Richard A. Dollinger, Democrat of Rochester.
Contributors countered that they were not trying to curry favor with the new Governor. They said they were driven by a public-spirited desire to make the inauguration open to as many people as possible.
"It allowed all of the citizens of Albany to partake in the inaugural," said Gene Swanzey, director of governmental affairs at Chase Manhattan Bank, which contributed $7,000 to the event, $2,000 more than the state campaign maximum. "It was amazing, if you walked all along that mall and saw all the citizens. It reminded me of Andrew Jackson's inauguration."
Mr. Pataki was certainly not the first politician to raise private funds for his inaugural. Presidents have been doing it at least since the late 1970's. In 1992, Bill Clinton's inaugural committee raised $2.5 million from corporations and borrowed another $17 million in interest-free loans. The Clinton inaugural committee released a full list of contributors.
But in New York State, previous governors held swearing-in ceremonies in legislative chambers or private offices, while Mr. Pataki's was in an Albany sports arena, attended by 13,000 people. The event included a laser light show, a performance by the Albany Symphony Orchestra and a 19-gun salute.
In a three-day period, there were also performances of children's music, private parties for the Governor's friends, a black-tie gala and a "People's Reception" with dozens of food vendors and musical groups in the underground concourse of the Empire State Plaza.
Charles A. Gargano, who as Mr. Pataki's campaign finance chairman helped raise $14.5 million for last year's race, was chairman of the committee that organized and raised money for the inauguration. Mr. Gargano is now State Commissioner for Economic Development.
But interviews with more than a dozen companies that contributed to the inauguration shows that many were not major contributors to Mr. Pataki's campaign. Almost all, however, have direct interests in state government, whether as regulated industries, advocates for new legislation or as vendors selling products and services to the state.
For instance, Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical company, gave $25,000 to the inaugural corporation, five times the campaign contribution limit.
Bristol-Myers has contracts worth about $1.7 million with the state to provide medical products and other services. It is also regulated by several state agencies. Recently, the company asked the State Department of Environmental Conservation to curtail a program that requires it to pay the salaries of two full-time state workers who monitor pollution at one of its Syracuse plants.
Charisse Richardson, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers, said the company did not expect favorable treatment in exchange for its contribution. "We have been supportive of both parties and will continue to be in the future, provided they undertake efforts that are in the best interest of the state and provide growth opportunities for our company," she said.
Chase Manhattan and three other companies also said they gave inaugural donations that exceeded campaign limits. They were the New York State Business Group-Conference Associates, a Patchogue company that sells health insurance to small businesses, $25,000; Chemical Bank, $10,000; and AT&T, $10,000.
The state deposits millions of dollars from pension funds and other accounts at Chase Manhattan Bank, and it uses Chemical to administer low-interest loan programs for small businesses. AT&T provides phone services worth about $2.4 million to a variety of state agencies.
Despite their vow to abide voluntarily by campaign finance laws, officials with N.Y. Inaugural '95 did not ask contributors to keep their donations within state campaign contribution limits, people who assisted in fund raising said.
"It was up to the individual companies" to decide how much to give, said Richard Alteri, president of the Cable Television Association of New York.
At a time when Mr. Pataki was considering making deep cuts in health care spending, doctors and health care companies were among the biggest contributors. The Medical Society of New York State gave $11,200, while the members of the New York State H.M.O. Conference gave a total of $25,000.
The Coca-Cola Company and the Pepsi-Cola Company were both corporate sponsors of the inauguration. Officials with Coca-Cola said they donated about 100 cases of soda for the event. Pepsi-Cola would not disclose what it contributed.
Last June, Mr. Pataki signed a budget that included a cut in soft-drink taxes that will eventually be worth $26 million a year. Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola lobbied aggressively for the cut.
Construction companies also gave. Jerome A. Gannon, president of A-J Construction Company in Manhattan, and Angelo Silveri, president of Silverite Construction Company in Hicksville, L.,I., belonged to the inaugural committee. Both companies have said that they are interested in getting state contracts, though neither has succeeded yet.
Other contributors included Fleet Bank, $5,000, Pfizer Company, $5,000, Kodak, which donated photographs, and International Paper, which donated paper products.

HEADLINE: Man Is Charged With Impersonating Priest

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
During the summer months, he sat outside the Mount Carmel Roman Catholic Church in the Bronx and befriended young people in the predominantly Italian neighborhood. In clerical garb, he spoke to them in the erudite words of the Jesuit priest he claimed to be and in the gentle tone of one capable of infinite compassion.
"He spoke about God and religion like he was a real priest," said Gina Demalijaj, a church employee. 
 Yesterday the man, who called himself Father Giustino Visconti and said he taught canon law at nearby Fordham University, was arrested and charged with criminal impersonation and grand larceny.
In the last five years, the police said, the man -- whom they identified as John Fortune, 35, an unemployed man with no religious training -- performed a baptism, said as many as five Masses and heard confessions in the Fordham section of the Bronx.
In addition, the police said, he bilked a 52-year-old widow, a mother of three, of her retirement savings.
Mr. Fortune's double life came to an end yesterday afternoon when the police stopped him near his apartment and handcuffed him, in his priest's clothing, on the corner of East 196th Street and the Grand Concourse.
It began at least five years ago, when Mr. Fortune met the widow through a mutual friend, Police Capt. John Creegan said at a news conference last night. The widow, a mother of three who retired as a kitchen helper at a home for the elderly, turned to Mr. Fortune for guidance. Mr. Fortune gradually became a part of the family and began investing the widow's retirement savings -- $12,000 in all, the police said.
Meanwhile, about four years ago, Mr. Fortune became a well-liked fixture at Mount Carmel at 627 East 187th Street, where he introduced himself to the pastor as a visiting priest from Fordham and was invited to say Mass, Ms. Demalijaj said. But Mr. Fortune stumbled and made mistakes in the liturgy, she said, raising doubts about his background. Though the pastor did not report him to the police, Mr. Fortune was no longer asked to say Mass, she said. Still, he continued to visit the church until last year.
With his initial success in his impersonation, Mr. Fortune apparently grew more confident and reckless, the police said. Early this year, at a small chapel, he baptized a baby. But the parents began to suspect an impostor when their repeated requests for the baptismal certificate were not met.
The widow, meanwhile, had heard rumors that he was an impostor. She finally believed them last June, Captain Creegan said, after she asked him to perform her son's marriage -- and Mr. Fortune canceled at the last minute.
Mr. Fortune, who the police said had apparently not held a job in years, told a detective who arrested him that he had studied philosophy in Rome for three years. "He seems to be a wanna-be priest," Detective John Scianimanico said.

HEADLINE: Religious or Not, West Bank Settlers Feel Betrayed by Israel

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: GANIM, West Bank, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The unthinkable became reality last week for the 33 Jewish families of Ganim when armed Palestinians took charge of nearby Jenin.
What if the Palestinian police tried to stop them, as they were allowed to do under the peace agreement that brought the police to Jenin? Something akin to a groan passed through the clutch of residents gathered outside the administration office of the small, armed Israeli settlement in the north of the West Bank. 
 "It's a creepy feeling," confessed Mihal Bronstein, a nurse who has lived in Ganim for 14 years, including the seven when the Palestinian uprising made traveling outside the enclave dangerous and just living there tense. "They're terrorists, not police. They were trained in terror camps, and now the Government has decided to call them police!"
The people of Ganim are hardly the bellicose settlers of Hebron who speak of Palestinians as "foreigners" and spew the violent religious ideology that fired Yigal Amir, the confessed assassin of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Secular for the most part, most of them came as much to take advantage of inexpensive housing in a striking hill-top setting within commuting distance of the Israeli city of Afula as to fulfill the romantic Zionist dream of building pioneering settlements in the Promised Land.
 
United in Opposing Peace Agreements
 But secular or religious, the 147,000 Israeli Jews who people the archipelago of 145 settlements across the West Bank have become united in a sense of betrayal by the Labor Government and in opposition to the peace agreements with the Palestinians.
Though the peace agreements reached so far leave the settlements intact -- and in fact improve their lot somewhat by bringing them new "bypass roads" that connect them more safely with Israel -- the fears and passions of the settlers are at the heart of the bitter dispute that has severed the nation, and that cost Mr. Rabin his life.
"We have to be careful of using words like 'betrayal' these days, but there's a clear divide today in Israeli society between those looking for a new Israel of Israelis and those looking for a Jewish Israel, between 'Yisraeli' and 'Yehudi' -- Israeli and Jew," said Yechiel Leiter, 36, a settler originally from Scranton, Pa., who serves as a spokesman for the Yesha Council, which represents settlers in the West Bank and Gaza.
The distinction he drew was between a vision of Israel as the modern, prosperous, secular state of which Tel Aviv is the spiritual capital -- the vision with which the left wing is associated -- and a Jewish state in the biblical Land of Israel of which religious nationalists dream, including the West Bank regions of Judea and Samaria, with Jerusalem as its heart.
"The debate is over the national character of the country, not where the final borderline is drawn," Mr. Leiter said. "The horns are locked over much, much broader issues than drawing a line in the sand or Oslo 1 and 2," he said, using Israeli shorthand for the two Israeli-Palestinian agreements reached so far. "The debate is over the very core of our existence."
That is not what they had in mind when they came out here, Mihal Bronstein and her husband, Alan, acknowledged. Mr. Bronstein regarded himself as a liberal when he left Los Angeles 25 years earlier to cast his lot with Israel, and he met his wife in a left-wing kibbutz.
 
'Ideology Comes With Being Here'
 Now Mr. Bronstein carries a gun when driving to Israel, and would not dream of voting for the Labor Party. "The ideology comes with being here," he explained. "Living here grows on you."
The Bronsteins moved to the young settlement of Ganim in 1981, when moving to the West Bank was the thing to do; housing was cheap, mortgages were easy, the Palestinians were relatively peaceable and, most important, settling in the historic Jewish lands of Judea and Samaria carried the romantic aura of pioneering Zionism and the blessing of the Government and the nation.
Then in 1987, the intifada, as the Palestinian uprising against Israel is known, turned benign neighbors into dangerous enemies. A Ganim settler named Motti Biton was killed by Palestinians when he stopped at an Arab store, and many others found their cars stoned.
Wire fences were thrown up around settlements, and both men and women learned to use and carry guns. New bypass roads were built for millions of dollars. Today, Ganim children are bused to grade school in another settlement under military escort, an hour each way.
In 1992 a Labor Government came to power under Prime Minister Rabin and began treating the settlers not as a national vanguard, but as a nuisance -- a drain on the army and an obstacle to peace with Palestinians. Mr. Rabin called the settlers "crybabies," and he declared that their settlements "add nothing, absolutely nothing, to Israel's security."
He called the West Bank "the territories," not Judea and Samaria, and he drew a line between "security" settlements, like those in the Jordan Valley and around Jerusalem, and "political" settlements, which were built under the ideology of his predecessor, Yitzhak Shamir, who promised to settle Israelis "to the horizon's edge." Mr. Rabin froze housing construction, and "political" settlements lost special benefits like tax and mortgage incentives.
In Ganim, a row of completed houses have stood vacant since 1992. Suddenly, the proud outposts of Jewish redemption in Judea and Samaria found themselves a neglected archipelago of 145 isolated, armed and bitter hilltop islands, neglected and alienated by the brash, commercial Israel of Tel Aviv with its punk haircuts and cosmopolitan cafes.
The Jewish settlements are hard to miss in the rugged, hilly West Bank countryside. They sit atop the hills, their ordered rows of red-tile roofs setting them sharply apart from the haphazard old Arab villages dotting hillsides or valleys. At night, bright halogen lights identify the Israeli hilltops.
Last week, when the Israeli Army pulled out of Jenin under the September agreement with the Palestinians and Palestinian soldiers moved in with flags, portraits of Yasir Arafat and automatic weapons, Israeli soldiers stopped settlers from traveling into the new Palestinian zone. It was partly for their own sake, but partly because neither side wanted them there any more.
It is that humiliation, that sense of being thrust aside in a new, secular Israel, that is really the crux of the settlers' angst, more than any specific aspects of the agreements.
In fact, the risk that any settler will get stopped by an armed Palestinian policeman is negligible. Under the current agreement, the Palestinian police will have authority only in their own cities and villages, which settlers have been avoiding in any case for several years now, and which they will now be able to detour around altogether.
The agreement, moreover, follows in broad outlines what most moderate settlers had advocated for years -- granting the Palestinians self-rule in Arab-populated areas while keeping overall security in Israeli hands, and keeping the settlements intact.
"If they keep to the current plan, I can live with it," said Yisrael Harel, a founder of the Yesha Council and editor of a settler newspaper, Nekudah. But like many settlers, Mr. Harel believed the Rabin Government was really moving toward abandoning the settlements and the greater dream of the Land of Israel.
 
Arab Sovereignty Is Not Acceptable
 "The late Prime Minister didn't say it openly," Mr. Harel said. "In the talks we had he hinted that he was not going to uproot the settlements, that his solution was that those areas would be transferred to the Palestinians, and we would be welcome to stay where we are if we were willing to accept another sovereignty.
"I will not. I did not come to this country for this, those Americans didn't come from the luxury of the United States to the hills of Judea and Samaria, to intifada, to be under Arafat's sovereignty."
The reference to Americans was not chance. While Jews who came from the United States form a relatively small share of settlers, between 8 and 12 percent, they have been prominent in organizations and protests. The reason, according to Yehudit Tayar, a native of Chicago and a resident of the Beit Horon settlement, northwest of Jerusalem, is that Americans are taught, "If you believe in something, you have to go out and be active, not sit on the sidelines."
Mrs. Tayar's history suggests another explanation, that those Jews who leave the comforts of America to come to Israel are usually not interested in the alternative comforts of Tel Aviv, but in fulfilling a quest.
"There's a link between why you come and who you are," she said. "It's not a religious question, but a Jewish question. I'm here because I'm Jewish, and if I'm Jewish, I seek to live in the most meaningful place for me -- Jerusalem, or Hebron, or Yesha," she said, referring to the settlements.
Americans have also figured prominently among the militant religious nationalists in Hebron, though none of those rounded up after Mr. Rabin's death have been from the United States. A settler from Brooklyn, Baruch Goldstein, achieved infamy when he opened fire on Muslim worshipers in Hebron last year, killing 29.
To David Wilder, a resident of the Qiryat Arba settlement adjacent to Hebron who is originally from New Jersey, Hebron is the "front line" in a struggle for the Land of Israel.
"If Hebron falls, then Jerusalem would fall, and the entire Jewish state," he said. "This is the front line."
Though they grab the most publicity, neither the militants of Hebron nor the activist Americans are typical. Settler leaders deny that there is a stereotypical settler at all.
According to Mr. Leiter of the Yesha Council, about 35 percent of the Jewish settlers are religious, a term that in the Israeli context refers to strict adherents of Jewish law, and about 65 percent are secular. The religious, he said, virtually all moved to the settlements out of conviction, while about half of the secular settlers came for ideological reasons and the rest for the economic advantages.
Rabbi Abraham Tzuriel is one of those who came for religious reasons, to settle near the site of the ancient Jewish capital, Samaria. Eight years ago the young rabbi, now 32, settled at Shavey Shomron, a religious settlement whose name means "Returnees to Samaria."
A gentle father of five, he dreamed of peaceful coexistence with Arabs.
Gazing over the rolling Samarian hills in the evening light, he ponders now the political shifts that had transformed the settlers from pioneers into "enemies of peace."
But he would never leave, he said. "The dream hasn't changed," he said. "It's the reality that's always changing."

Map: "A CLOSER LOOK -- Dividing the Land: Who Gets Control"
Israeli and Palestinian authorities have agreed on a plan to cede Israeli authority over nearly a third of the West Bank. Virtually all the 1.8 million West Bank Palestinians live on that land. All of the Jewish settlements and about 50,000 Palestinians are in the 70 percent that will remain under total Israeli control.
 First, eight cities are being turned over to the Palestinians. Israel has withdrawn from Jericho and Jenin. By Dec. 31 five others will be turned over. The eighth city, Hebron, is to be under Palestinian control by March.
 Those cities are 3 percent of the land in the West Bank. Sometime in 1996 Israel will turn over civil control of another 27 percent of the land, which includes 465 Palestinian towns and villages. Israel will retain responsibility for military security in this area. Under the agreement, Israel keeps complete authority over the remaining 70 percent of the West Bank.

HEADLINE: For Pequots' Point Man, No Task Is Too Small;
Casino Boss Drives Hard, Whether to Expand to Bridgeport or Ease Wedding Plans

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 16

 BODY:
On a recent morning, G. Michael Brown, the top executive in the Mashantucket Pequot Indians' gambling empire, barked orders to an ever-changing audience of lawyers, accountants, architects and lobbyists as he juggled a series of projects that would make rival developers' eyes bulge.
Rising outside his office at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in eastern Connecticut was a 17-story, 1,229-room hotel, supposed to be the largest in New England under a single roof. Next door, work on the nation's first smoke-free gaming rooms was on schedule for a New Year's Eve opening. 
 And there was the intense lobbying drive to win approval from a hostile Legislature for an $875 million casino in Bridgeport -- an issue that is to come to a vote on Friday in the State Senate with the outcome very much in doubt.
But when a call came from a tribal member who was having trouble getting a reservation at the casino for her daughter's wedding, Mr. Brown dropped everything. "Clear that up immediately," he snapped at an assistant. "Find out what's going on."
Minutes later, Mr. Brown called the concerned mother and promised her a beautiful wedding.
This is how things work at Foxwoods, the nation's most profitable casino. On the one hand, Mr. Brown is the driving force behind a gambling juggernaut and the point man in the tribe's efforts to expand to Bridgeport. On the other, he is an employee of the 370-member tribe and answerable to them.
It is this tremendous wealth and influence concentrated in the hands of a small tribe and its advisers that has some lawmakers balking at extending the Pequots' gambling franchise to Bridgeport. They fear that they will be creating an economic Frankenstein's monster by giving the Pequots one of the most desirable gambling sites in the nation, an hour from New York City and its tens of thousands of passionate gamblers.
"If we win this," Mr. Brown remarked, "we would control more gaming business than any other casino company in the world."
The opposition, though, is not just about gambling. Asked for his view on the resistance to the tribe's proposal, Mr. Brown responded bluntly: "Racism."
"People don't want these rich Indians making more money," he said. "If we were General Dynamics and were going to build a factory there, they'd be hugging us and lining up to offer tax abatements."
Overcoming this opposition is the latest challenge to the quirky marriage between Mr. Brown, a gruff former New Jersey prosecutor, and the Pequots, a tribe that once had been thought extinct, who together have created Foxwoods, a casino that this year has already attracted more visitors than the combined population of New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago.
Until three years ago, Gerard Michael Brown, known to friends and colleagues as Mickey, had never imagined running a casino. Today, he is paid about $1.5 million a year, making him roughly the 15th-highest-paid gaming executive in the country. He manages every aspect of Foxwoods, from checking ticket sales for a Cyndi Lauper concert to looking for a an Arizona resort to house 30 of the casino's highest rollers for a Super Bowl junket.
While Mr. Brown's predecessor left under fire over failing to heed the tribe's advice, the seven-member Tribal Council just renewed Mr. Brown's contract. Richard (Skip) Hayward, the council's chairman, described him as "someone you can trust with your life."
Mr. Brown, 53, does not fit the popular image of a casino chief. His wardrobe of pin-striped suits comes from A.& S. in New Jersey, where he goes once a year and has the same employee, a woman named Ethel, pick them out. Home is the same modest two-story Cape Cod in Sea Girt, N.J., he has owned for 20 years, where he spends weekends. For work, he rents a two-bedroom town house in Mystic, Conn.
"I drink Coors Lite beer and like steak," he said. His one concession to affluence: a 1995 Cadillac Seville "with everything on it."
Mr. Brown is emblematic of a new generation of gaming executives who are more likely to have accounting degrees and ties to law enforcement than a shady past and a showman's panache. He spent much of his career prosecuting mobsters, not mingling with them.
Still, some lawmakers insist that the industry is corrupt. "Don't tell me the mob isn't involved," said State Senator James T. Fleming, a Simsbury Republican who is the Senate majority leader. "It's a dirty, dirty business."
Told of the comment, Mr. Brown shrugged. Foxwoods, he said, is the most "vigorously controlled gaming entity in the world," and his staff includes a retired F.B.I. senior agent and a former New Jersey deputy attorney general.
It has been his mission for more than a decade to show that casinos can be run cleanly. After winning a mob trial in 1980, in which he heralded the conviction of four gangsters as proof that the Mafia is "not a figment of Hollywood's imagination," he became New Jersey's chief regulator of the gaming industry in Atlantic City.
When a new state administration came in, Mr. Brown went into private practice, advising gambling companies on how to keep their businesses free of corruption.
The Pequots became his client in the early 1990's, seeking his help to turn their bingo hall into a full-fledged casino. Eventually, he was called in to broker a deal with Lowell P. Weicker Jr., then the Governor and a staunch foe of gambling, who told Mr. Brown at their first meeting, "I would not bring my dog to Atlantic City -- that's what I think of you and what you've done down there."
But weeks later, the tribe and Governor Weicker had struck a deal that suited both their interests. In exchange for a 25 percent cut of slot machine revenue, the Governor gave the Pequots a monopoly on slot machines in the state, undercutting efforts to allow other casinos in Connecticut.
The deal laid the foundation for the current success of Foxwoods: 50,000 visitors a day, about 10,000 employees, the largest single contributor of revenue to the state's budget.
Now, the tribe wants to extend its monopoly to Bridgeport.
So for the last two months, Mr. Brown has desperately tried to convince a skeptical Legislature that his casino plan is too good for them to pass up. What started as an unwinnable fight, with only 3 of the 36 state senators behind them, now faces a vote in the Senate that will likely be decided by a few votes.
The turnaround is due, in large measure, to the relentless campaign the Pequots have waged. Every day, two of their lobbyists, from the law firm of Robinson & Cole, which receives $100,000 a month, prowl the halls of the Capitol. Limousines carrying Tribal Council members, lawyers and Mr. Brown make daily runs to Hartford to meet with legislators and the Governor. And the tribe has run television commercials and sent out a direct mail appeal.
Most important, whenever the process has appeared to be derailing, Mr. Brown has been there, ready to promise the state more money. In waging the legislative battle, the tribe has raised by $1.1 billion the amount it would pay over the next 10 years, to $3.4 billion.
And for much of the last two days, Mr. Brown has been closeted with lawmakers and the Legislature's lawyer, rewriting the bill, trying to address the concerns of various legislators.
But the critics remain. State Senator George C. Jepsen, a Stamford Democrat, brushed aside the millions the Pequots had offered, saying, "This amount is nothing compared to the resources they have."
State Senator William I. DiBella, a Hartford Democrat who is undecided on this issue, dismissed Mr. Brown's charges of racism and said there were serious concerns about giving the tribe too much clout. "Would we be giving them an economic power that would make them an overbearing presence?" he asked.
These are arguments that Mr. Brown has heard repeatedly over the last few weeks, and his response is almost rote. The Pequots live in Connecticut, care about it and will keep pumping their profits into the state, he says.
Mr. Brown grants that he will be disappointed if they lose the Senate vote. But, as he acknowledges, even a defeat will be a victory, with Foxwoods still the only casino in the state. And on the evening after the vote, his life will go on.
"Win or lose, I'm having dinner with Tony Bennett Saturday night," he said. "And on Sunday, I'm at the Patriots game."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Calm in the Eye of the N.F.L. Storm

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH 

 BODY:
From the outside looking in, it appears that chaos reigns in the National Football League. There are franchise shifts, lawsuits and an owner's revolt in Dallas.
From the inside looking out, Paul Tagliabue sees it differently. The league's commissioner considers the upheaval in the league's economic and geographic landscape a natural consequence of its success. 
 "Over all, I think that most of what we're going through now is a product of growth, expansion and success," Tagliabue said. "You wouldn't like to have those issues happen during play of the season. I don't mean to minimize the issues out there, but sometimes we tend to look at things too narrowly and not understand what the process of growth in a sports league is."
But consider the growing pains. Just this year, two N.F.L. teams have changed cities and two more have set the wheels in motion. The Los Angeles area, the nation's No. 2 television market, is without a team. Last week the Browns announced they were moving from Cleveland, a bedrock of pro football tradition for half a century, to Baltimore for a new $200 million stadium with a 30-year, rent-free lease. Yesterday the Oilers announced they were relocating from Houston to Nashville to play in a new $292 million, 65,000-seat stadium to be completed by 1998.
Other teams are reportedly considering changes of venue -- the Chicago Bears to a new stadium outside Gary, Ind.; the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to Orlando, Fla.; the Seattle Seahawks possibly to Los Angeles. All of it could happen next year.
Add to this the more than $1 billion in lawsuits that pit the Raiders against the league, the league against the Dallas owner Jerry Jones, and Jones against the league, his fellow owners and NFL Properties, the marketing arm of the league.
As he begins his second term as N.F.L. commissioner, Tagliabue, 54, is shepherding changes that will significantly alter the league as it heads into the next century. These problems are part of that process, he said, the 1990's version of the ones that confronted the league in previous decades.
"Houston talked a few years ago about going to Jacksonville," Tagliabue said yesterday in a wide-ranging interview at the league's Park Avenue headquarters. "Houston has had a stadium problem for a number of years. Over all you have to keep some perspective on these things. We had similar stadium issues in the 80's. We had those three moves in the 80's. Go back to the 70's, people thought there was 'turmoil.' You had the Giants going to the Yale Bowl. That wasn't exactly regarded as normal times.
"What we're dealing with is the normal process of growth and the fruits of success, frankly."
Tagliabue said the court's ruling in the 1982 Raiders case, affirming the team's right to move from Oakland, Calif., to Los Angeles, influenced the league then and now.
It was the threat of a $2 billion antitrust lawsuit by the Missouri Attorney General's office that forced the league to reconsider its initial no-vote on the Rams' move to St. Louis this past May. That threat looms as well with both the Browns and the Oilers. And it is powerful.
" '60 Minutes' just pulled a show on Sunday night," Tagliabue said. "Mike Wallace and Morley Safer were on 'Charlie Rose' saying they did it because of the threat of litigation. I'm sure The New York Times pulls stories every day because of the threat of libel lawsuits. It doesn't mean that you are in a state of crisis or a state of turmoil. That is part of your business."
When he was asked whether the threat of lawsuits had lessened his authority as commissioner, Tagliabue replied sternly: "No. I don't think it has lessened my authority any more than it lessened Pete Rozelle's authority when we litigated the players association in the Mackey case in the mid-70's."
When Tagliabue took the job in 1989, there were five items on his personal "to-do" list: to achieve labor peace; secure a lucrative and diversified television package; maintain the appeal of the game; expand the league, and get new stadiums as they were needed around the league.
With a rich television contract running through 1997 and a collective bargaining agreement through 1998, with scoring up and two expansion teams competing this season, it's the stadium issue that threatens to turn the league upside down. Some N.F.L. owners, seeking new sources of revenue, are becoming modern day Forty Niners.
But Tagliabue points out that the teams are moving to cities that were identified by the league as attractive sites for relocation. He said of the 12 locations that the league considered viable for expansion in 1993, five were considered top areas -- St. Louis, Baltimore, Jacksonville, the Carolinas and Tennessee.
"So, there is logic there in terms of the strength of the markets," he said.
From that perspective, Tagliabue can't stand in the way of owners who seek to relocate to those markets. Those moves would do nothing to damage the league's stability, he said. However, the relocations create hardened feelings among the loyal fans that teams leave behind.
The move from Cleveland is particularly wrenching for Browns fans who had loyally supported the team for the past 50 years. Tagliabue said it would be "jumping ahead" to talk about putting another team in Cleveland.
"The big 'if' is whether this move goes forward or not," he said. "Until we have the kind of report that I filed on the Rams and Raiders earlier this year and until we get to that league meeting in January, it is premature to assume that this is over and done with."
Asked to deal hypothetically with a Browns move to Baltimore, Tagliabue said he would have to get assurances from Government entities there that a total renovation would be made to Cleveland Stadium before he could make assurances about getting another N.F.L. team for the city. He said there are meetings scheduled for December with Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White and other city officials.
Any immediate placement of N.F.L. teams in cities that have lost them would have to come from the existing teams. Tagliabue said there won't be another round of expansion until the turn of the century.
After filing a $750 million antitrust lawsuit against the N.F.L. and NFL Properties, Jerry Jones said his plan to generate new sources of revenue through increased marketing by individual teams would head off the need of owners to seek a quick cash infusion by seeking new stadium deals in other cities.
"Jerry's views aggravate the problem and don't help solve the problem because there are two underlying realities about a sports league that you have to recognize to be successful," Tagliabue said. "You have to operate in markets of different sizes. And No. 2, winning and losing is cyclical. And by definition you're always going to have losing teams in a sports league. You have to sustain your stability in individual markets even when you are losing."
Tagliabue said he thinks a settlement of the lawsuits involving Jones is possible.
"When you say Jerry wants to dismantle Properties, it is a disservice to Jerry," Tagliabue said. "Jerry wants to build something new, which is what we have been doing here."
Tagliabue looks at all these issues confronting the league and puts them in historical perspective.
"If you go back 10 years we had the U.S.F.L. and other issues," he said, referring to the United States Football League. "Twenty years ago we had work stoppages and players strikes in the N.F.L. and the draft being ruled illegal. Going back 30 years, we had the A.F.L.-N.F.L. war. You always have issues. That is part of the reason this job is challenging."

HEADLINE: CHELSEA DAWNING;
Digging for Flea-Market Treasures

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
London has Portobello Road and Paris the Marche aux Puces. In New York City, Chelsea is where many shoppers go for flea-market wares, collectibles and affordable antiques. What began almost 20 years ago as a one-block flea market, on the Avenue of the Americas from 24th to 25th Streets, has mushroomed into a three-block affair, from 24th to 27th Streets. It has also spilled around the corner: on 26th Street east of Avenue of the Americas, an old Con Edison power substation now holds something called the Annex, four parking lots filled with 400 to 500 open-air booths.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Over the years, a host of indoor antiques malls have opened in the neighborhood. Now there are such haunts as the Garage, at 112 West 25th Street; the Metropolitan Art and Antiques Pavilion, at 110 West 19th Street, and the Chelsea Antiques building, at 110 West 25th Street. As in the flea markets, the quality and selection at these indoor emporiums vary from week to week. Some days it's possible to find good pieces at bargain prices, other days it seems as though all the junk in the world has landed in Chelsea. 
 The weekend is when most of the action takes place. But a few spots, like the Chelsea Antiques Building, are open during the week, too. Buyers range from serious collectors, who are neighborhood regulars, to decorators shopping for clients and young couples furnishing their first apartments.
Often a celebrity makes a surprise appearance. Last weekend, Michael Jackson and an entourage of security guards arrived at the Garage in a nondescript van for an afternoon of shopping. Other recognizable regulars include Drew Barrymore, Barbra Streisand, Brad Pitt, Joanne Woodward and Bette Midler.
"Chelsea has become very vibrant," said Alan Boss, who owns and runs the two-year-old Garage, the open-air Annex Antiques Fair and Flea Market and the Metropolitan Art and Antiques Pavilion, which he opened in 1992. "Despite the shaky economy, I've noticed an upsurge in attendance."
Mr. Boss said that the charisma of outdoor markets is what drew everyone to Chelsea in the first place, but that now his Garage -- two 10,000-square-foot floors -- is filled with 125 dealers from Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Connecticut. From time to time, European dealers from places like London and Amsterdam have exhibited, too. The merchandise in the Garage is similar to that in the outdoor flea market.
Whether outdoors or in, the shopping atmosphere is friendly. Dealers are more than happy to hear that magic sentence: "What's the best you can do?" And buyers invariably harbor secret fantasies of unearthing a discarded treasure that could be worth a fortune.
"The demographics of buyers have changed in tandem with the American economy," Mr. Boss said. "Decorative arts is the byword, rather than high-end antiques. So dealers now are trying to keep things accessible." That's not to say there isn't the occasional highly priced gem: a sapphire and platinum necklace can still command $10,000 to $15,000. But that kind of expensive item is not as easy to find as it was during the boom years of the late 1980's.
Many of the seasoned dealers cite a change in buyers over the years. With tourism rising in Manhattan, there are more foreign shoppers, and it's not unusual to hear many languages being spoken.
The three-block Avenue of the Americas flea market is usually their first stop. Here, it's possible to find everything from vintage clothes to bedroom sets and martini shakers. It's also a great spot for antique silver. On a recent Saturday, there were Victorian silver candlesticks for $40; silver ashtrays for as little as $10; silver Victorian picture frames from $4 to $35.
Furniture tends to vary a lot from week to week. There's usually a selection of 1920's wrought iron garden furniture and the odd sofa and chairs. Painted chests and vanities are usually plentiful, too.
One of the biggest categories by far is jewelry, everything from metal Victorian chokers and earrings to 1940's watches and Art Deco bracelets. Around the corner, at the Weekend Antiques Show on 25th Street, just east of the Avenue of the Americas, is a newer mart, with variations on the merchandise carried on the avenue itself. Silver is a big seller here, too. An Art Deco silver candy dish comes with a $225 price tag; a Gorham serving platter can be had for $165. Porcelains from the 19th and 20th centuries come in every shape imaginable, from dancing couples to cows. So do salt and pepper shakers, dating from World War II to the 1970's. Downstairs, along one wall, are prints and lithographs marked "Investment Grade Art." A recent selection included Chagall prints from $350 to $600 and a Francis Bacon lithograph for $475.
The Chelsea Antiques Building, at 110 West 25th Street, is open daily from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. and consists of 12 floors (11 of them for dealers and one devoted to the Lubin Galleries Auction House.) There's also a little cafe for snacking. The building bills itself as "12 floors of exceptional estate treasures."
The assortment of goods is enormous. There's everything from grandma's standard oak Victoriana to Steuben glass and jewelry, from Russian icons to advertising tins and collectible toys, from Esthetic Movement and Art Nouveau lighting to vintage cookie jars. One particularly interesting floor is an antiquarian book arcade, a consortium of more than 62 dealers managed by the Bohemian Bookworm, run by Myrna Adolph-Morris and Ronald Morris, her husband. The business, which began almost three years ago, has every title computer-filed for easy access.
"We have a free search service," Mr. Morris said, adding that among current popular titles were Charles Dickens's "Christmas Carol," priced at $25 to $400 depending on the edition and its condition; Diana Vreeland's "DV," which sells for $65 to $75, and her "Allure," priced anywhere from $400 to $600. Detective stories are also hot. Patricia Cornwell's early works can fetch as much as $300.
"We came here because we wanted to take a chance and see whether antiques and fine books could mix," Mr. Morris said. "This area is proliferating. New Yorkers could do very well just shopping in Chelsea. All it takes is a discerning eye and patience."

LOWER ESTIMATE FOR SHIPMENTS OF WINDOWS 95

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose, Calif., reduced by a third yesterday its forecast of Windows 95 shipments this year, saying sales of the Microsoft Corporation's operating system were slower than expected. Dataquest, a unit of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, said that Microsoft would ship fewer than 20 million copies by the end of the year, down from a projection of 30 million. Microsoft's shares fell $4.125 yesterday, to $89.875, as about 12.2 million shares were traded on Nasdaq. The slide was attributed primarily to a reduction in the stock's rating by Richard Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company. Mr. Sherlund said Microsoft faced "a serious threat" from smaller, more nimble companies in Internet software.

HEADLINE: U.S. Should Embargo Nigerian Oil for Hanging

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The trial, conviction and hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa by the discredited Nigerian regime of Gen. Sani Abacha (front page and editorial, Nov. 11) has provoked international outrage within Africa and beyond, including President Clinton's withdrawal of our Ambassador from Lagos and discussion of a condemnatory resolution by the United Nations Security Council.
But the United States can and should go further. The only language the Abacha regime understands is that of money and force, using the latter to divert the nation's oil revenues into private coffers as Nigeria's civil society continues to deteriorate. Let us hit this military strongman where it counts. 
 We should impose economic sanctions and an oil embargo immediately, and watch as the noose of political opposition and economic austerity tightens around General Abacha's neck. With our oil imports responsible for nearly half of Nigeria's petroleum revenues, an embargo would have immediate consequences.
Ken Saro-Wiwa should not be allowed to have struggled and died in vain. Poet, novelist, critic and activist in company with the likes of Wole Soyinka, Mr. Saro-Wiwa showed how oil, once Nigeria's lifeblood, has become the bad blood of rampant political corruption, financial fraud and environmental degradation.
And now, with his execution (following the military government's genocidal campaigns against the Ogoni people), Nigeria's oil revenues have become blood money.
Moreover, General Abacha's crackdown is just beginning. Mr. Saro-Wiwa's unconscionable death by the gallows represents a Mobutu-style leadership in the making, with wider purges of critics and pro-democracy activists -- many already jailed -- soon to follow. General Abacha must go. A few extra cents at our gasoline pumps is a small price to pay.

HEADLINE: Beijing Journal;
For 6, You Too Can Be a Sichuan-Style Sardine

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 16

 BODY:
"Hey, don't you know how to ride a train?" the woman on the Beijing subway yelled as she pushed past two peasants so overloaded with luggage that they were blocking the door. "Move over and make room for those of us who want to get off!"
It is rush hour in the Chinese capital and Beijingers, like so many surly sardines, are trying to get in and out of their frightfully overburdened subway system. 
 Riding on a mere 26 miles of underground track, the dilapidated trains of the Beijing subway are now carrying 1.46 million people a day. An estimated 70 percent of them are the transient laborers who have flooded the city to work at thousands of construction sites.
The Beijing system carries about 40 percent of New York City's passenger load, but on only 4 percent of New York's track miles. The average rail car here, designed to carry 180 people, now consumes about 300 passengers during rush hour.
Full body contact and brief, terrifying stampedes for the door are part of commuting life now, along with stale air and, perhaps, the whiff of a cow patty still wedged in the shoe leather of a visiting farmer.
"Most of the young women in my hospital don't take the subway because so many country bumpkins ride the subway, and they wear dirty clothes and carry dirty luggage," said Zhang Mei, a 27-year-old nurse from Beijing Hospital.
"You can't wear your pretty clothes and take the subway. By the time you get to work, your pretty clothes are filthy."
Her eyes narrowed as she spied her adversary.
"Look at those teen-agers," she said. "They are the typical bumpkins I am talking about."
The unkempt teen-agers are from Sichuan Province, population 105 million. Their hair stands as a tangled rebellion above ruddy cheeks. Each carries a quilt stuffed in a plastic fertilizer bag, standard luggage for frugal peasants who don't mind sleeping on sidewalks.
"We are all from Sichuan, but I don't want to give you my name," a 19-year-old said, in the thick patois of the southwest. "We do odd jobs and we live near the railway station," he said, quickly disappearing into the crowd.
Now that the harvest is over, the migrant population flooding into Beijing will push toward the two million mark and the capital's public transportation system, already overloaded, is approaching its limits.
"This job can be very tough," said 32-year-old Qi Yuan, who wore a smart, aquamarine uniform on the platform at a subway stop named Build the Nation. Her job is to yell at passengers to "hurry up!" and "don't push!" as they enter and exit the trains. When the doors stop banging against the body parts hanging over the threshold, Ms. Qi holds up a green paddle that serves as the "all clear" signal to the train conductor.
"When a train comes in, so many people rush the entrance that it can be dangerous," she said. "A lot of these country people simply don't know the safety rules and sometimes they get into fights over the seating."
Many Beijingers today attribute much of the surliness in the city to the clash between China's rural and urban populations as the country's economic boom sends more and more surplus farm laborers to the cities.
The "waidiren," which literally means "outsiders," are blamed for rising incivility, petty crime, drug addiction and the offense that really steams any Beijinger: bicycle theft.
This week the Beijing Youth Daily criticized the lack of "civilized behavior" in the subways. The semi-official newspaper lamented the fate of a ticket collector named Ms. Wang, who tried to apprehend four youths who dashed past the ticket booth without paying.
When she caught up with them, "instead of paying, the youths hit Ms. Wang and pushed her down into the rail pit, where she was so seriously injured that she was unconscious for more than two hours," the newspaper said.
Landing in the rail pit, the newspaper pointed out, is a loathsome predicament as many passengers find it a convenient place to spit and throw garbage.
While New Yorkers this month are howling over the $1.50 they now have to pay to ride one of the largest subway systems in the world, they might consider what becomes of a system that never raises its fares.
For one thing, it never becomes a system.
Beijing's subway, now 30 years old, could more aptly be described as a line with a loop and a lot of unfulfilled aspirations. It costs only 6 cents to buy a ticket to ride from one end to the other, or in a continuous loop. The eastern part of the city has no service; neither does the north nor the south.
The Beijing government has repeatedly suggested fare increases to finance operations and expansion, but the central Government, fearing a negative reaction from the masses, has demurred. A modest expansion that began in 1993 is already a year behind schedule.
A master plan that would more than triple the size of the current system gets reprinted in the newspapers every few years, but remains unfinanced.
To Beijingers of 50 and over, it is a well-known secret that when Mao Zedong first ordered construction of the subway in 1965, the project was part of his elaborate preparations for nuclear war, which he feared would be launched by the Soviet Union.
Initially, many Beijingers thought it strange that a single underground rail line was built from the western edge of downtown to the mountain range that flanks the city, a lopsided route that was inconvenient to more than half the city's dwellers.
But word spread from thousands of workers that Mao was using the subway construction to mask the building of an underground highway, parallel to the subway line. This highway would allow the Communist Party leadership to flee the city in the event of nuclear attack.
The highway is now used to ferry the leaders out to their golf resorts and weekend bungalows in the Western Hills.
As for the straphanging masses, many have moved above ground to join the gridlock on Beijing's once placid boulevards and others, like Li Li, a 27-year-old city accountant, travel off peak when they can.
At 10:43 A.M. one day this week, Miss Li was just heading for the office, more than two hours late.
"That's one of the advantages of working for the Government," she said in a tone that lacked the slightest trace of surliness. "We don't earn big money like those who work for foreign companies, but we don't have stress because we don't work very hard."

HEADLINE: Yugoslav Army Reported to Aid Bosnian Serbs Despite Promises

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG with KIT R. ROANE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
As President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia negotiates a peace settlement in Dayton, the army under his control is rebuilding the Bosnian Serb military in violation of Mr. Milosevic's own pledges, American and United Nations officials said today.
Yugoslav Army technicians have replaced the communications links blown up by NATO warplanes in air strikes two months ago and have repaired some of the air defense systems, the officials said. 
 The Yugoslav Army has also been routinely sending helicopters and transport planes loaded with supplies to the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka, United Nations officials said.
American officials, however, said NATO radar had not picked up any flights into that airfield by transport aircraft. The officials said they have spotted some helicopters, and assume that others are flying low enough to evade detection.
American officials said they believed that the resupply of the Bosnian Serbs was on a comparatively small scale. "While we don't like it, it's wrong, and it's illegal," one official said, "it's not enough to justify torpedoing the peace process."
Another official said: "It's happening. But we don't think they're bringing in the heavy stuff. We don't think they're bringing in more howitzers and tanks."
A confidential United Nations report dated Oct. 30 -- two days before the peace talks opened at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside Dayton -- says that United Nations military observers on the ground have spotted "regular flights of military transport aircraft and helicopters into Banja Luka at night." Those flights have continued into this month, a United Nations official in the region said.
The report said the Bosnian Serb army's communications systems "have been resurrected by the Yugoslav Army, whose personnel are involved."
The document, which was signed by a senior military officer serving with the United Nations, said the Yugoslav Army was supplying spare parts to maintain the Bosnian Serbs' small fleet of warplanes.
Yugoslav Army technicians, the report said, were working on the planes at the Banja Luka airfield.
While the United States vociferously protested the Yugoslav Army's efforts to help the Bosnian Serbs rebuild after the NATO bombing, the criticism has been muted since the peace talks began.
One senior official speculated that Mr. Milosevic was allowing some ties between the Yugoslav Army and Bosnian Serb Army to persist as a means of preserving his credentials with his own military while he makes significant concessions in the peace talks.
"He has to tolerate a certain amount of activity to maintain control," one official said. "He's got to watch his back."
Mr. Milosevic promised to end such assistance to the Bosnian Serbs earlier this year in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions against his country. But American officials with access to intelligence reports say that, while Mr. Milosevic did not keep his word, he has curtailed the flow of fuel and ammunition in recent months.
The Yugoslav Army's continuing supply of arms and expertise to the Bosnian Serb military raises questions about both Mr. Milosevic and the stability of any peace treaty.
American officials acknowledge that the ultimate success of their peace effort depends largely on whether Mr. Milosevic delivers on his latest assurances in ways he has not done in the past. American officials argue that there are several reasons to believe that he will do this, including the proposed presence of a 60,000 NATO troops in Bosnia to enforce any peace plan and his desire to end his isolation from other countries.
Still, it remains unclear how the peace agreement would address the issue. A senior American official said the proposed peace settlement would bar the Yugoslav Army from sending military supplies and assistance to the Bosnian Serbs.
But Pentagon officials have made it clear that the international force will not be involved in patrolling the international borders, disarming the combatants, or blocking arms shipments.
American officials said they have circulated proposals to the parties that would set numerical limits on various categories of weapons each side could keep in its arsenal, just as the United States and Russia have reduced their conventional forces in Europe. Monitoring these limits, however, would probably be left up to international organizations like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The United States is likely to be the nation to bring the sides to parity by training and arming the Bosnian Government. A Bosnian official said today the European nations were resisting this proposal.
Paradoxically, deployment of the 60,000-member international force might actually make it easier for the Yugoslav Army to move military supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
A principal demand of the Bosnian Serbs has been for the widening and safeguarding of the narrow corridor of land across Northern Bosnia through which most of the fuel and supplies from Yugoslavia have been flown or trucked. Croat and Bosnian government forces consider this stretch of land to be one of the most strategic in Bosnia, and have shelled and attacked what is called the Posavina corridor for most of the war.
The United Nations put monitors at the narrowest point of the corridor on Nov. 7, and during three days reported seeing large convoys of fuel trucks that are believed to have originated in Serbia. The monitors, a United Nations official said, were removed a few days later at the request of the Bosnian Serb Army.
The United Nations official said military observers in the region have spotted two types of transport helicopters flying into Banja Luka and some flights by fixed wing aircraft.
"These guys are mainly flying at night," he said. "But some of them are bold enough to come in during the day. We don't understand why NATO says they don't see them, because they are plainly visible and carrying Yugoslav Army inventory."

Congress and White House In Talks to End Impasse
 As the first cracks developed in the deadlock between the White House and Congress that has partly shut down the Government, the House of Representatives gave final approval to the mammoth Republican legislation to reverse the course of the American Government, and the Senate began its final debate on an identical bill. 
 President Clinton repeated that he would veto the bill. But top White House officials were at the Capitol negotiating a way to break the impasse and continue Government spending into December. [Page 1.]
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed as market participants awaited signs of progress on the budget negotiations. [38.]
 
Approval of Fat Substitute Backed
 The F.D.A.'s Food Advisory Committee recommended approval of a fat substitute, olestra, made by Procter & Gamble, despite testing by the company that showed some adverse gastrointestinal effects on people who consumed the product. The committee's recommendation is not binding, but the agency generally accepts its advice. [11.]
 
Brouhaha at CBS Grows Nastier
 The in-fighting grew nastier at CBS, where a management decision to block an interview on "60 Minutes" with a former tobacco- industry executive has led to widespread debate and recriminations. Morley Safer, a correspondent on the program, accused his longtime colleague, Mike Wallace, of using deceit to get him to complain publicly about the cancellation. [10.]
 
A Shift at RJR Nabisco Holdings
 RJR Nabisco Holdings said H. John Greeniaus, the 50-year-old food-marketing expert who has overseen the company's tobacco operations as well as its food business since July, would refocus his efforts entirely on food. Some analysts said the company might be preparing to spin off the food business, as the financiers Carl C. Icahn and Bennett S. LeBow have demanded. [37.]
 
California Threatens Insurers
 In California, where insurers and regulators have been at loggerheads since voters approved a proposition in 1988 giving the regulators powers to set profit targets and order price cuts and rebates, the state's Insurance Department threatened reprisals against companies that miss a meeting next week to discuss their progress. [37.]
 
Prudential Settlement Approved
 A Federal judge in Manhattan gave final approval to a $110 million settlement by Prudential Securities with thousands of investors participating in a class action lawsuit. The suit accused Prudential of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy in its fraudulent sale of limited partnerships in the 1980's. [36.]
 
Hewlett-Packard Net Up; Stock Off
 Hewlett-Packard reported a 42 percent profit jump to $678 million, or $1.29 a share, for its fourth quarter, exceeding analyst estimates, but Wall Street was not happy. The profit margin was under pressure, because much of the growth came from personal computers, which have lower margins than other computers, and the stock fell $4.75 to $88.50. [36.]
 
Polish Economy on Stable Course
 Poland's fiercely contested presidential runoff election is likely to make little difference to investors or to the country's economic outlook, business executives and analysts say. The country's economy has matured, and foreign investment is growing rapidly. [36.]
 
Fed Was Unanimous on Rates
 The Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted 11 to 0 to leave the target for the Federal funds rate at 5.75 percent on Sept. 26, minutes of the meeting showed. The rate, which applies to overnight bank loans, is the Fed's main vehicle for influencing interest rates. [38.]

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: MEDICAL CARE;
In G.O.P. Plan, Some See a Widening Gap Between Sick and Healthy

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB 

 BODY:
Along with reinventing the way medical care is provided to the elderly and poor, the Medicare and Medicaid legislation agreed to by House and Senate negotiators would profoundly change the nation's health insurance system, allowing companies to vastly increase the marketing of an encyclopedic array of policies to the nation's sickest people.
Republicans and other proponents hail the changes as fostering competition, creating greater personal choice and containing costs. But many critics, including consumer advocates and Democrats, fear that the changes would push the healthy and sick into different forms of coverage, which would tear at an underpinning of insurance: that the healthy subsidize the less healthy in plans to which they all belong. 
 The agreement was reached on Thursday by negotiators for the Republican majorities in the House and Senate, after the two chambers passed differing versions of legislation that would slash $435 billion in anticipated growth in seven years from Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, and Medicaid, which covers many poor people, the disabled and residents of nursing homes. The revised legislation is expected to be voted upon by both houses shortly.
Under the Medicare provision, 37 million elderly Americans would be allowed to leave the traditional Medicare program and use money from that program to sign up for managed care plans; plans of various sorts run by doctors; plans offered by unions and associations; traditional plans where members pay for each service they receive, or medical savings accounts, a favorite of Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican leadership.
They could also more easily buy "dread disease" policies, which insure against specific illnesses like cancer, but which have been strongly criticized by consumer groups.
To Republicans, opening this marketplace of options would hold down health care costs by making the elderly more responsible for their medical choices. "What comes out of all of this is a more innovative way to deliver more health care to more people at lower costs," said Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who heads the House Commerce Committee.
But critics worry that healthier Medicare recipients would join private plans, which would court them actively, leaving most of the sickest people isolated in the Government-run program. This, they say, could threaten the viability of the traditional program over time by causing escalating deficits. One result, they say, would be lower payments to doctors and hospitals that could lead them to leave the program.
The critics also contend that cuts in anticipated growth in Medicaid would lead states to curtail their rolls, creating what some social scientists predict would be millions more uninsured.
Republicans strongly dispute this, maintaining no one would lose insurance.
Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, a Washington research center, was not as hopeful.
"Insurance companies and public programs will become leaner and quite literally meaner," Mr. Aaron said, "not because they're run by mean people, but because competitive pressures will force them to be so."
President Clinton has vowed to veto the final legislation. In an interview before the negotiators reached their agreement, Mr. Clinton's special assistant for health care, Chris Jennings, said the President had "grave concerns" about medical savings accounts and the prospect of "millions more uninsured" as a result of changes in Medicaid.
 
 
 
Encouraging a Shift To Private Plans
A hallmark of the Medicare legislation is the encouragement of private health plans, which now cover 10 percent of the program's recipients, grouped in a few regions.
Under the legislation, the elderly would be able to take an annual credit, on average more than $4,500, and use it to buy coverage. If the beneficiary signed with a managed care plan, the money would probably cover an annual payment for services at least equal to those under current Medicare, but access to doctors would probably be limited.
The Government would provide selection advice to recipients, monitor the plans' marketing and administer enrollment.
Larry Mayewski, an analyst with A. M. Best & Company, an insurance rating agency, estimated conservatively that 30 percent of Medicare recipients, or more than 10 million people, would enroll in the plans. Others predict more than twice the interest. Plans would likely try to entice consumers by offering more benefits than Medicare, like prescription drugs and eyeglasses, that would obviate the need for the supplemental policies that 70 percent of the program's recipients now buy.
But many experts fear a balkanization of healthy and sick.
A 1993 study of Medicare recipients who had joined health maintenance organizations found that healthier people disproportionately were attracted to the plans, causing the Government to lose rather than save money. Indeed, critics say, plans often target the healthy by offering items like credit for exercise classes.
While the managed-care industry disputed the findings of the 1993 study, Randall S. Brown, of Mathematica Policy Research Inc., who headed the effort, said he believed that sicker recipients stayed in the conventional program to insure that they could keep their own doctors, which is often impossible in managed care plans.
"If you're an 80-year-old person and you suffered a heart attack three years ago and a doctor saved your life, you're not going to give up that doctor for $50 a month," Mr. Brown said.
The ability of private associations to organize coverage for their members is a particular concern to many who are critical of the privatization, because, they say, groups representing the more affluent, who are generally healthier, could negotiate for better coverage. This would cause their members to leave the general pool even more quickly.
Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, also said that cost figures almost compelled private plans to seek out the healthy.
In 1993, when the average Medicare expenditure per person was $4,030, the average for the healthiest 90 percent of recipients was only $1,430; the average for the sickest 10 percent was $28,000.
Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare during the Bush Administration, said, "This is probably the single most serious technical problem we have to deal with, but the answer isn't to say, 'My God, we can't have choice.' "
Rather, Ms. Wilensky said, the Government should calibrate more finely payments for the elderly that reflect their health status. If healthier people sign with private plans, she said, they should take reduced sums with them, while sicker people should be credited with a total that reflects their cost of care.
Many professionals say that such analyses, while being explored, are extremely difficult to execute well.
 
 
 
Individual Approach To Containing Costs
 If some experts worry that managed care plans would skim healthy recipients from the conventional Medicare program, many of the large plans are concerned that the healthy would be skimmed from them by medical savings accounts.
These accounts have been championed by the Golden Rule Insurance Company of Indiana, whose political action committee contributed $621,775 to the Republican and Democratic National Committees since 1991, according to the public interest group Common Cause. All but $46,000 went to Republicans.
Since 1985, the committee has given $309,526 to Congressional candidates, including Mr. Gingrich. In addition, Golden Rule was the sponsor of a television show presided over by Mr. Gingrich, and company officials gave $35,000 this year to Gopac, the political committee Mr. Gingrich headed until last May.
The Speaker praised the savings account idea in his recent book.
Under the legislation, Medicare recipients could buy a high deductible plan, contributed to by Medicare, as long as they opened a medical savings account that the program could help fund with money left over after the insurance premium was covered. Interest on account balances would be tax free and surpluses could be rolled over each year.
Account money could be spent on anything, but nonmedical expenses would be subject to income taxes.
To proponents, the concept would work wonders at containing costs, because the elderly would have incentives not to seek unneeded care -- and would also have the security of catastrophic coverage.
"What medical savings accounts do is give seniors more control over their health care dollars," said Merrill Matthews Jr., health policy director of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas research group that has championed the idea and that also receives contributions from Golden Rule. "It gives them the ability to benefit financially from being a prudent health care shopper."
A study commissioned by the center, which included assumptions that its author wrote involved "significant uncertainty," predicted that the savings accounts would result in Medicare savings of $134 billion to $195 billion over seven years. But the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would cost taxpayers $4 billion in that time.
Although Mr. Matthews said the accounts would be popular with sick and healthy alike, the budget office estimated that only 2 percent of Medicare beneficiaries would be interested and that they would likely be among the healthiest.
E. Richard Brown, head of the American Public Health Association, which represents public health professionals, said that in addition to siphoning the healthy and putting the traditional Medicare program at risk, the account concept "creates all the wrong incentives, incentives for people not to get preventive care" by allowing them to keep money they do not use.
The bill would also broaden the range of policies that could legally be sold to the elderly. And, in the eyes of critics, it would weaken a requirement that other policies include cautionary statements that they could duplicate coverage under Medicare or other plans.
Gail Shearer of Consumers Union, an advocacy group, said this provision would open up the sale of hospital indemnity and dread-disease policies to older people. Because these policies are more profitable to insurers than other types of insurance, Consumers Union has called them the worst buy in the market. State insurance commissioners have also criticized these policies.
From the mid-70's to the late 80's, scandals erupted in many states when older people, pressured by fear-mongering sales tactics, bought stacks of these policies, which often proved worthless.
Proponents of these policies argue that many plans have provided extra money for co-payments, deductibles and compensation for lost income. The excesses, they say, were caused by a few bad apples, and, they maintain, Congress never intended to simply outlaw the policies when it enacted safeguards five years ago.
Aflac, a Columbus, Ga., insurance company whose political action committee has contributed at least $1.76 million to candidates since 1987, is the country's largest cancer insurance carrier and has lobbied to relax restrictions on these policies.
 
 
 
Some See Millions Becoming Uninsured
In the Medicaid proposals, the $170 billion cut in projected spending over seven years has led many experts to fear that millions would become uninsured. The Urban Institute, a Washington research organization, estimated that more than eight million people who would have been covered by Medicaid in 2002 would likely be without insurance because hard-pressed states would be forced to keep them from the rolls.
In a recent paper for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Kenneth E. Thorpe, of Tulane University, estimated that the number of people with no health insurance could rise from today's roughly 40 million to as many as 66 million in 2002, when changes in Medicaid are combined with the rising number of employees who do not receive coverage through work.
Congressional Republicans headedly dispute these findings.
"Nobody wants to increase the number of uninsured people -- that would be crazy," said Mike Collins, spokesman for the House Commerce Committee. "We believe the basic premise of these studies is flawed and states, by utilizing managed care options, will be able to deliver a lot more bang for the buck."
John Holihan, an author of the Urban Institute study, said the use of managed care had figured in the study's computations.
"What we're getting more and more from people," Mr. Holihan said, "is that our assumptions are optimistic."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Poland's Vote No Big Worry For Investors

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Nov. 17

 BODY:
In a measure of Poland's economic maturity, the outcome of Sunday's fiercely contested presidential runoff election is likely to make little difference to investors or the country's economic outlook, business executives and analysts say.
Only two years ago, the idea of a former Communist as president would have unnerved investors. But for the last year, a former Communist, Jozef Oleksy, has served as Prime Minister, and Poland is headed for its fourth consecutive year of robust growth. Foreign investment is flowing in at a faster rate this year than last. 
 "We keep on investing and we're still closing deals," said Jacek Siwicki, senior vice president of the money management firm of Enterprise Investors, shrugging off the significance of the election. "The Polish system becomes more and more like the Italian system. The politicians fight each other and the economy goes on regardless."
Both President Lech Walesa, and his strong challenger, Aleksander Kwasniewski, a Communist turned social democrat, promise to continue the market-oriented economic policies of the last five years. Both eagerly want Poland to join the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which are regarded as the signature of acceptance from the West.
Mr. Siwicki, whose company has invested $270 million for the Polish American Enterprise Fund, a private corporation created by the United States Government to encourage Polish development, said he detected little apprehension among foreign investors about the possibility of a former Communist becoming Poland's President.
For most voters, the election revolves around symbols of the past. Mr. Walesa, 52, is viewed as the man who as head of the Solidarity movement ejected the Communists. Mr. Kwasniewski, 40, is seen as a university student who joined the Communist Party, became a top official, and now says the Communist era is dead and buried.
Many Walesa voters favor the President because they are uneasy about having former Communists control Parliament, the prime ministership and the presidency. The party of Mr. Oleksy and Mr. Kwasniewski, the Democratic Left Alliance, is composed of former Communists and dominates Parliament.
But business leaders, particularly those heading foreign companies, say ideology matters little. It was the Government, headed by Mr. Oleksy, that influenced exchange rates and inflation. The president's power is largely limited to the right to initiate and veto legislation.
If Mr. Kwasniewski wins, it is unlikely that his presidency will dampen economic growth, which is expected to exceed 6.5 percent this year, business leaders said. Reservations about Poland among foreign investors began to fall away this year, with $1 billion pouring in during the first five months compared with $1.3 billion for all of 1994. Exports were up nearly 39 percent in dollar terms in the first half of 1995 and industrial production rose 13 percent in the same period.
"With stable growth and a huge market, Poland is seen as the place to be," said Louisa Vinton, editor of Business Eastern Europe, a weekly report on finance in the region. "Kwasniewki's party are reform Communists and they know a good system when they see it. If he wins, the wheels will keep on moving in the way they have."
The head of GE Capital's new office here, Leslaw Kuzaj, said he was confident that the economy would continue to grow whatever the result.
"We won't have any problems either way -- if Kwasniewski wins or Walesa wins," he said. "Both candidates have declared their openness to the West. In the very beginning of the transition everything was so fragile but now we see a steady course."
Mr. Kuzaj said that with the Polish economy "so closely tied to the West, it's really unthinkable that the guy who wins can change course."
"The only thing we could expect," he added, "is some slowing down but I don't see that because everyone wants to join the European Union."
The Gerber Products Company, one of the early foreign investors, has doubled production of baby food at its plant in the southeast in the last year, and its managing director, Ryszard Wojtkowski, himself a former Government official, said that the company's growth would continue whoever was president.
If Mr. Kwasniewski wins, it is possible that privatization of big Government-owned entities -- already off to a slow start -- may falter a bit more, Mr. Wojtkowski said. Similarly, the former Communist may have to heed the trade unions' worries about job cutbacks. But these were matters of shading, he suggested.
In the stock market, which has been in a slump since mid-September, there are few signs of discomfort from investors about a former Communist gaining the presidency.
"We had an autumn conference for investors and we asked what they thought if Kwasniewski won," said David Young, director of Wood & Company, a brokerage house run by Americans. "They didn't see that much difference. They look at his policies, they see that he knows what he's doing, that he knows how to handle himself with the unions."

HEADLINE: At Bosnian Peace Talks, the Tunnel With the Light at the End Is Very Long

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, has a new joke: "You know what Dick is short for?" he asks, referring to Richard C. Holbrooke, the American mediator at the Bosnian peace talks here. "Dictator!"
Over the last several days Mr. Holbrooke, an Assistant Secretary of State, has tried every shade of bullying diplomacy to bridge the differences between Serbs, Muslims and Croats. He has harassed his interlocutors day and night; he has cajoled; he has wined and dined. 
 But differences that have killed more than 200,000 people remain.
"The parties have a very clear sense that it's now or never," said one senior official. "But it's still possible they will choose never."
That choice, in all likelihood, has to be made this weekend. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived this evening, and he is expected to remain until the end of the talks.
With the talks in their third week, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. George A. Joulwan, the commander of NATO forces in Europe, came to Dayton today for a one-day visit. Their presence, officials said, is intended as much to convey a sense of American power and that power's determination to achieve a settlement, as to deliver any 11th-hour formula for peace.
Bosnian officials said they asked Mr. Perry for a memorandum setting out how American military assistance would be provided to the Bosnian Army after any settlement. The United States has indicated it would be ready to assist the Muslim-Croat federation to achieve a balance of power with the Serbs.
The officials said Mr. Perry expressed understanding but made no firm commitments.
Other, deeper problems remain: land and justice.
In a letter sent today by the Foreign Minister, Muhamed Sacirbey, to Mr. Holbrooke, Bosnia demanded that "any agreement, and especially as it relates to any potential easing of sanctions, must include a commitment from the parties to fully cooperate and comply with the war crimes tribunal and its orders." Among those indicted by the tribunal is the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and his military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic.
The Clinton Administration has taken the position that those indicted must be "excluded from the political process" in Bosnia. The Administration is also insisting that those who sign any peace accord must "cooperate" with the tribunal.
But the Bosnian Government says this falls far short of ordering compliance. Bosnia insists that any state harboring the suspects face economic isolation until those indicted are handed over to the tribunal.
Territorial issues remain even more difficult. Throughout Yugoslavia's disintegration, not an inch of territory has changed hands through anything but force.
The Serbs have now promised to yield Eastern Slavonia, the last part of Croatia they still hold. But that is not yet done. And Mr. Holbrooke and his aides are still trying to persuade Serbs and Muslims to cede Bosnian land now in the interests of peace.
The land the Serbs have to give up lies in eastern Bosnia. At the very least, officials said, the Serbs have to provide the Government with a corridor to link Sarajevo with Gorazde, the one surviving Muslim enclave.
But the Serbs' position, as summed up by one official, has been, "Don't worry, we'll let people come and go from Gorazde." Of late, after more than three years of siege, the Serbs have indeed done that -- but the Government wants access to Gorazde that it controls and can secure.
Inch by inch, therefore, Gen. Wesley Clark, the official on Mr. Holbrooke's team who deals mainly with "map questions," has been trying to fashion an acceptable corridor. This effort has made some progress but is still a long way from success.
A central problem is that the Serbs, who seek complete control of eastern Bosnia, have deep misgivings about Gorazde's remaining a Government-controlled city. Mr. Milosevic, according to one person who has spent time with him, regularly refers to it with a vulgarity as "that place at the end of the world."
The land the Government has to cede lies around the narrow corridor south of Brcko that connects Serbia with Banja Luka, the main Serb-held city in Bosnia. The Serbs want to widen the corridor; the Government would prefer to eliminate it and thus gain access to the Sava River. "If the Gorazde corridor is still a sticky issue, the Brcko corridor is even stickier," one official said.
Behind these arguments lies the fact that the logic of war is far from eliminated in the minds of officials here: some of the worst fighting and worst massacres of the war have taken place in the last six months.
Gorazde is more than a mere town: it is, for the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, a potential strategic gateway to eastern Bosnia and cities from which hundreds of thousands of Muslims have been chased. If Sarajevo can supply Gorazde, which already has an arms factory, the balance of power in the area may eventually shift.
Similarly, the Serbian corridor at Brcko is more than a strip of land: it is the last slender strand by which President Milosevic's vision of an enlarged Serbia hangs after the loss of Serb-held territory in Croatia. If this connection to Banja Luka is lost or remains vulnerable, the Serbs may prove unable to keep the 48 percent of Bosnia they still hold.
Mr. Holbrooke has been trying to push a vision of peace as healer. He is asking the Balkan leaders to look forward rather than back, to honor the dead through construction of a civil society rather than with a long struggle for revenge.
To this end, Mr. Holbrooke took Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, out to dinner Wednesday at L'Auberge, a giant leap from the fast-food places that surround Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where the talks are being held. The Assistant Secretary of State ordered caviar; he talked of the future.
Afterward Christopher Hill, another member of Mr. Holbrooke's team, was dispatched to Mr. Silajdzic's suite, clutching a map. The Prime Minister in an excellent mood. Compromise was in the air. But in the light of day, old difficulties keep returning.

HEADLINE: Trenton Seeks H.M.O. Disclosure Of Doctors' Financial Incentives

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
In an effort to strengthen the hand of patients dealing with the state's rapidly growing health maintenance organizations, New Jersey health officials today proposed requiring that H.M.O.'s disclose any financial incentives they offer participating physicians to hold down medical expenses.
The proposed disclosure rules were among a series of provisions made public today as the state announced its first overhaul of the rules governing H.M.O.'s in more than two decades. Health maintenance organizations, which provide services in exchange for a fixed fee, are the fastest growing segment of the state's health care industry. Enrollment has increased from 100,000 in 1974, when the state first began regulating health maintenance organizations, to 1.4 million today. The state expects membership to exceed two million by the end of next year. 
 Some physicians and consumer groups have said disclosure is necessary so that patients know whether a doctor has any financial incentive to limit treatment or services and so that patients understand that some organizations pressure doctors. New York State, which has already revamped its regulations on H.M.O.'s, is also considering adopting a similar disclosure rule.
Under the proposed New Jersey rules, patients would be able to appeal to the state when they believe they have had services curtailed or denied, but the state's recommendation would be nonbinding. The health maintenance organizations would be required to file extensive reports with the state on services ranging from the number of children they immunize to the number of women receiving mammographies. In addition, the organizations would have to be recertified every three years. The state also plans to conduct membership surveys and publish a consumer guide to H.M.O.'s. "We have a package that I believe is the most progressive, consumer-oriented set of regulations ever proposed in this country," said State Health Commissioner Len Fishman. "We need to promote consumer protection and consumer confidence in H.M.O.'s."
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said the regulations were needed to assure fairness for patients while shielding New Jersey's 26 H.M.O.'s from undue state interference.
"What the commissioner is seeking to achieve with these regulations is a balance that will allow the citizens to feel comfortable that they are going to be well cared for within the H.M.O. structure, that they will have a voice," Governor Whitman said in a radio interview this afternoon.
At the same time, the Governor said, the regulations are intended to assure that H.M.O.'s retain "the flexibility to capture the kinds of savings that are unique to their organizations."
The financial disclosure segment of the regulations would require health maintenance organizations to provide details of their arrangements with doctors not only to the state but also in advertising and marketing materials to subscribers. Some health maintenance organizations now award bonuses to physicians who use less than the amount of funds allocated to cover payment for referrals to specialists and some services. State officials said this arrangement might influence physicians to refer fewer patients to specialists. Under the old fee-for-service system, doctors had virtually no reason not to refer patients to a specialist when they deemed it appropriate.
Neil Weisfeld, deputy executive director of the Medical Society of New Jersey, said the change is needed. "Physicians feel that they are under pressure," Mr. Weisfeld said, "and when they make a decision that is in the patient's interest but may not be in the H.M.O.'s interest, they are going to pay the price for that."
The new rules would prohibit H.M.O.'s from retaliating against doctors who side with the patient in a dispute over care. And the rules would require that only a state-licensed physician could deny or limit a request for a proposed course of medical service.
The Medical Society, which represents 9,500 doctors in the state, also welcomed the proposed changes.
"We are cautiously optimistic that the proposed regulations will require all H.M.O.'s operating in New Jersey to guarantee patients and providers various rights concerning their health care treatment and options," said Dr. Fred M. Palace, a past president of the society and a member of the Health Department's H.M.O. advisory committee.
But some health maintenance organizations complained that the proposed regulations tilted state policy in favor of the traditional fee-for-service doctors, who would be able to operate under a simpler regulatory burden.
"We're going to have, on one side, 'everything you ever wanted to know about H.M.O.'s but were afraid to ask,' but nothing about the fee-for-service practitioners," said George Strumpf, vice president of H.I.P. Health Plan, which operates large H.M.O.'s in New York and Florida, as well as in New Jersey.
Mr. Fishman said the extensive reporting requirements would produce a body of data that, for the first time, would give the state a clear picture of how health care is being delivered to a major segment of the population, and would also enable the state to monitor the evolving health care marketplace.
Dale Florio, spokesman for the New Jersey H.M.O. Association, said that the association was still reviewing the proposed regulations and would probably seek some changes. Mr. Florio's association is a member of a 32-member H.M.O. advisory committee made up of labor unions, physicians and other health industry officials that will offer recommendations for changes in the proposed rules by the end of December.
The rules will then be made available for public comment for 30 to 60 days, before becoming final next May.
Both Mr. Florio and Dr. Allan L. Hillman, director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, warned that imposing regulations on health maintenance organizations without regulating other forms of health care delivery would create inequities in the marketplace.
"Everyone should have the burden of regulations or we should stay out of it," Mr. Hillman said. "They are making it harder for H.M.O.'s to be a profitable and efficient business. It is the marketplace that is running health care now."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Pound Off Sharply vs. the Mark, Diverting Attention From Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday, as a sharp drop in the British pound against the German mark diverted currency traders' attention from the budget impasse in Washington.
The pound fell as low as 2.1680 marks -- below its previous low of 2.1755 marks, set in May -- on concerns that the budget being prepared for Britain would include tax cuts. There was further pressure on the pound from speculation that British interest rates would be moving downward. The pound, which had been falling in previous sessions, later recovered slightly. 
 "We've been close to the lows for the better part of the week," said David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics. "People were just looking for an opportunity to take them out. It doesn't come as much of a surprise."
 Dealers said the selling of the pound started after the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, spoke favorably about current policy on setting inflation targets. The markets interpreted the comments as a sign that British interest rates could fall early next year.
The dollar gained against the pound, which slipped to $1.5445 in New York, from $1.5557 on Thursday.
The dollar lost ground against the mark for most of the day, but regained strength after holding above the key level of 1.3975 marks, where huge orders to sell would have set in.
"Dollar/mark looked as if it was going to take a leap off the precipice but it pulled back," a dealer at a major investment bank said.
 In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.4060 marks, down from 1.4069 marks on Thursday. The dollar slipped to 102.05 Japanese yen from 102.09 yen. It also fell to 1.1387 Swiss francs from 1.1385.
While concerns over the budget impasse in Washington dragged the dollar down earlier in the week, some traders were heartened yesterday by what they saw as signs of movement by Republican Congressional leaders and the White House.
President Clinton sent his own stopgap legislation to Congress that would end the partial Government shutdown, while Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, said the Senate might soon vote on a piecemeal spending bill.
"Some of the news out of Washington was interpreted as fairly positive," said Lizbeth Goldberg, a dealer at Bayerrische Hypobank. "That's one reason why we traded up a little bit."

HEADLINE: Blue-Collar Bridgeport Loses Catalyzing Jobs

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Cases of juices and platters of pastries had barely been wheeled into the State Senate chamber this morning when Gov. John G. Rowland, in shirt sleeves, entered a caucus room to make his final argument for a casino in Bridgeport, the state's largest city.
"The issue today is jobs," Mr. Rowland said. And if Bridgeport did not get a casino, he did not know where else the city would find any. 
 "You've heard me say a thousand times where are the businesses that are moving into Bridgeport?" Mr. Rowland said. "If this goes down today I don't know what's next for Bridgeport."
Hours later the Senate rejected casino gambling in Connecticut outside of Indian reservations, killing an $875 million casino plan with 10,000 jobs proposed for Bridgeport. The manufacturing city has lost 70 percent of its factory jobs over the last 25 years.
To the casino's impassioned supporters, the rejection was a brutal slap at a blue-collar city that has never had the respect of its wealthy suburban neighbors in Fairfield County, much less of the state. While legislators approve tax breaks for the Swiss Bank to move to corporate Stamford and train subsidies for commuters to Manhattan, the casino advocates said, Bridgeport's hard-working residents, who want only to earn living wages in their own city, get nothing.
"Its residents are not thought of in the context of your neighbors," Senator Alvin W. Penn, Democrat of Bridgeport, said in a plea laced with bitterness and anger. "It's always negative. What do we have to do to be part of the State of Connecticut?"
But the 24-to-10 vote against a casino was not a vote against Bridgeport, people on both sides said, as much as a declaration that however badly the city needs an economic catalyst, a casino as proposed in this bill was not worth the perceived cost to the rest of the state.
Opposition from the parimutuel industry melded with concerns about the casino's possible effects on traffic, the wisdom of the state's relying on gambling revenue as casinos multiply, moral objections and doubts that a single casino could turn around Bridgeport, when 12 had not rebuilt much smaller Atlantic City.
"As long as this was cast as a vote about Bridgeport and about jobs, that was putting the bill in its most favorable light," said Senator George C. Jepsen, Democrat of Stamford, who voted no. "To state the obvious, although a casino may have been located in Bridgeport its impact would be much wider. The people who voted against it did so for a hundred reasons."
Mr. Jepsen said Mr. Rowland could have swung the vote the other way, had he done more to use his office's influence. As the day of the vote neared, Mr. Jepsen said, opponents had 19 votes in the Senate, 2 more than they needed to avoid a 17-17 tie that Lieut. Gov. M. Jodi Rell would have broken in favor of a casino.
Mr. Rowland agreed on the magnitude. "We were expecting either a 24-10 vote or a 17-17 vote," he said afterward, explaining that several senators had offered to be the 17th vote for a casino if the administration had 16, but had then switched to the winning side when it was clear the bill would fail.
Mr. Rowland, however, also insisted that he had not overstated the dire condition of Bridgeport and its lack of alternatives. But the Legislature is focusing on the need to find new industries for the city, he said, and his administration will propose concrete solutions in the next session.
Even as Bridgeport advocates like Senator Lee Scarpetti complained that suburban legislators were selfishly denying her city an opportunity to help itself, others noted that Bridgeport itself had been focused on a casino as its sole solution for years.
"One of the things that has held off development for years has been the question of whether a casino was going to come in," said Senator James T. Fleming, Republican, an opponent of casino gambling. "We now can get on with other forms of economic development."
Bridgeport has a long tradition of wishing for new businesses that run up against its gritty industrial image and its notoriety as Connecticut's murder capital in the early 1990's, when drug gangs took over the poorest neighborhoods.
Bridgeport has a detailed 10-year strategic plan for economic development, drawn up last year in a bid to win a Federal "economic empowerment" zone. But one goal, in a city that readily acknowledges that suburbanites fear it, is to establish a downtown theater district. Another goal is to attract telecommunications industries. A third objective calls for developing tourism.
In the casino vote, however, the city found again that the rest of the state did not share its faith in large visions. Although residents boast of living in the state's largest city -- a distinction gained because New Haven and Hartford have lost population faster -- even Mr. Rowland challenged senators to recall the last time that they had stopped in the city for dinner.
The distance from the centers of the state's life leaves many residents still unsure of the source of their calamity or whom to blame. "They're trying to isolate Bridgeport and kill it," said Fred Thibodeaux, one of 300 residents who traveled here today to rally in support of a casino. "For some reason or other, we are low on the food chain, very low on the food chain."

HEADLINE: Another Day Of Records For Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average flirted with the 5,000 level yesterday as the Standard & Poor's composite index reached its own milestone, surpassing 600 for the first time.
The Dow rose as high as 4,996.81 during the afternoon but finished at 4,989.95, up 20.59 points for the day. That close still set a new high for the 59th time in 1995, matching the record for new highs in one year -- set in 1925 and tied in 1964. But the champagne bought to celebrate 5,000 had to be kept on ice for at least one more weekend. 
 The S.& P. 500, an index followed more by money managers, rose 2.73 points, to 600.07. The milestone was the second for the index this year; the S.& P. first reached 500 less than eight months ago.
Both the Dow and the S.& P. are now up more than 30 percent in 1995. For much of the year, it was technology stocks -- particularly semiconductor issues -- that led the way. But the most recent advances have come despite softness in that sector. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index fell 2.13, to 229.19, and is now down 24 percent from the record set in September.
"The emotional moves are being felt with money coming out of high-tech areas, and moving into the oils," said David J. Olderman, the chairman of Carret & Company, an investment management firm in New York. "Financial stocks are holding their own and still going up."
Much of the strength in the Dow came from oil stocks. Texaco rose 1 1/8, to 71, while Exxon gained 1 1/2, to 79 3/8. Du Pont, the owner of Conoco, added 1 1/8, to 64 1/2. Oil prices have been strong in advance of a meeting next week of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
But I.B.M. was down 1/2, to 95 1/8, and Hewlett-Packard fell 4 3/4, to 88 1/2, after warning of a profit margin squeeze in personal computers.
The lag in technology stocks has also been seen in the indexes of smaller stocks. The Nasdaq composite climbed just 0.55 point yesterday, to 1,045.03, while the American Stock Exchange market value index added 2.50, to 531.96. The Russell 2,000 index of smaller companies climbed 1.04, to 303.84. All three indexes are well below peaks reached in mid-September.
Nonetheless, the attention was on the bigger stock indexes yesterday. The Dow put on a strong run that began shortly after 3:30 P.M., aided by buying related to expiration of stock index futures and options. The index rose to almost 4,997 a bit before 3:45, but it then fell back.
The bond market was quiet, with the price of the 30-year Treasury bond falling only slightly as the yield inched up to 6.23 percent, from 6.22 percent on Thursday, its lowest level since early 1994, just before the Federal Reserve began to tighten credit. Many market participants now believe that the Fed will resume easing credit as soon as the current budget battle in Washington is resolved. Despite much rhetoric, that fight has so far not alarmed investors.
Most of Wall Street remains firmly bullish on stocks, pointing both to the continued inflow of cash into mutual funds and to economic factors. "This economic cycle has a long way to go," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-head of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The economy is slow, but will accelerate. Profit growth will accelerate. Inflation is under very good control. Interest rates are benign from the standpoint of the equity markets."
The market for initial public offerings remained strong. Estee Lauder, the cosmetics company, sold shares at $26 but they never traded in the open market below 32 3/8 and closed at 34 1/2. Canadian National Railways, a Government privatization, was sold in an offering at 12, but ended the first day of trading at 15.
But the most amazing initial public offering was from Secure Computing, a company that provides products intended to protect computers from unauthorized users. It is viewed as a play on the Internet -- an area that has not gone soft among technology stocks. Last month, Secure said it would sell stock at $13 to $15 a share. It wound up going public at 16, and closed yesterday at 48 1/4, more than triple the offering price.
The new stock sales came at the end of the busiest week for initial public offerings in almost two years, as 21 companies sold shares to raise almost $3 billion.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel's September Vote Was 11-0 for Steady Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in holding an important short-term interest rate steady on Sept. 26, minutes of the meeting showed today.
The Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted 11 to 0 to leave the target for the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans at 5.75 percent. By changing the interest rates it controls, the Fed's actions translate into lower or higher borrowing costs on everything from home mortgages to industrial loans. 
 The committee meets eight times a year at intervals of five to eight weeks. While its meetings are closed, minutes are released several weeks later.
At the most recent meeting on Wednesday, committee members again decided to leave the target for the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans unchanged. The Federal Open Market Committee next meets Dec. 19.
Minutes from Sept. 26 showed the Fed officials decided to maintain a neutral policy stance, meaning they were neither inclined to raise nor lower interest rates.
But some panel members suggested that interest rates might have to be lowered eventually, "in light of the downside risks that they saw in the economy and a current policy stance that they viewed as slightly restrictive."
The Federal Open Market Committee last lowered rates at its July 6 session, the first reduction in three years. The quarter-point cut, to 5.75 percent from 6 percent, was intended to prevent the economy from falling into recession.
Throughout 1994 and early this year, the Fed increased rates a total of seven times in an effort to slow the economy's growth rate to a pace of about 2.5 percent a year, well below last year's 4.1 percent rate.
When Fed officials decide to lower the Federal funds target rate, they direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to buy Treasury bills, notes and bonds on the Fed's behalf in financial markets.
This action pumps money into the banking system, pushing rates lower and allowing commercial banks to charge each other a lower interest rate on overnight loans.

HEADLINE: A BID for Reform

 BODY:
Business Improvement Districts have been a godsend during a time of municipal austerity. There are 34 BID's in New York City. Commercial property owners pool their resources to hire extra street cleaners, security guards and graffiti removers. The BID's can take partial credit for some of the city's most conspicuous success stories, including Bryant Park, the revitalized Times Square and the upbeat look along 14th Street.
But a survey by the City Council Finance Committee has disclosed a troubling side to the BID phenomenon. A few BID's are in financial chaos. Others spend much of their income on overhead and little on actual services. One BID in Brooklyn employed sweepers who demanded extra money from store owners for cleaning sidewalks they had already been paid to sweep. Another in Queens was mired in conflicts of interest. 
 Many of the problems spotlighted in the Council report -- high directors' salaries, ineffective marketing programs -- are non-issues as long as the people paying for the BID are satisfied with the way it works. It seems clear that some of the smaller BID's exist mainly to decorate commercial areas for the holidays and organize parades, which is fine if those are the members' priorities. But the Council raises serious questions about whether property owners are always properly informed about what they are paying for.
The most important issue is governance. Boards of directors ought to be broadly representative of the communities they serve and must operate under procedures that are open and accountable. Their executive committees must meet frequently enough to exert meaningful influence.
The BID's themselves are attempting to establish criteria for proper management and open government. Such self-policing should be encouraged. But the city should hold BID's accountable for their performance and step in if they fall short. The city not only charters the BID's, it serves as their collection agency, sending property owners assessment bills and imposing fines for late payment. As long as the city plays that role, it has a responsibility to make sure the BID members are not suffering from taxation without representation.
Some of the report's proposals are too detailed for organizations that already struggle with more than their share of city paperwork. It would be wiser to give the new self-regulation a chance before adding too many more requirements. But others, like banning BID's from contracting out services outside their boundaries, should be adopted immediately. The districts are supposed to be economic development vehicles, not mini-municipalities unto themselves. On the whole, the Council report is a rare and welcome example of the over sight the city's legislature is supposed to exercise.

Loyalty Issue Crystallizes On Mattingly

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
WHEN Bob Watson, the Yankees' new general manager, says that he plans to take the team in a new, bold direction, I say "Amen."
Even if it means reassigning the congenial Gene Michael, even it means pushing the hard-working company man Buck Showalter to the desert. And yes, even if it means drastically reducing the role of Don Mattingly, the team's most consistent symbol of Yankee tradition. 
 Mattingly and the Yankees will eventually determine a course. The public posture is that the veteran first baseman will tell the Yankees whether he will return next season. The bottom line, however, is that the Yankees will tell Mattingly under what circumstances they will allow him to return.
Watson, a forthright, straight shooter as a player and as a successful general manager, has grand plans for the Yankees.
I like the Yankees' talk of New Directions.
When it was time to hire a new general manager, George Steinbrenner, to his credit, didn't dip into the old, old-boy network. He hired a successful new face, the best person for the job. A former Yankee.
Watson wants to acquire a second baseman, he wants to bolster his pitching staff, he wants to dramatically increase run production.
Russ Davis, the 26-year-old third baseman, must be in the lineup in the spring. Will Wade Boggs move to first? Will he remain at third? Will the Yankees sign a Fred McGriff-caliber first baseman?
Mattingly, the author of a brilliant 13-year career, must determine how, or if, he fits into the new scheme. Even if the Yankees decide to keep him, where will he play and how often?
More offense. A veteran coaching staff. The Yankees are almost where they need to be.
Showalter is where he needs to be, too: out of the major leagues for the next two seasons, preparing to take over an expansion team.
The Yankees, on the other hand, are close -- maybe a run producer away.
The issue before the Yankees is: What do they owe Mattingly? What do they owe the fans? This is not a matter of performance, but of loyalty.
"If he wants to come back," Watson said on Thursday, "he understands that the money can't be astronomical. He understands that it has to make some kind of economic sense and baseball sense."
For team owners, agents and athletes, balancing economic sense with sports sense and loyalty is the great challenge of the 90's. The mission has become a breathtaking, heartbreaking process of trial and error.
Everyone, including Mattingly, knows that he is not the great player he was. The issue before the Yankees, then, is not a performance issue, but a fundamental issue of loyalty. The question for the franchise is how important is loyalty when you're trying to win a pennant.
And for the so-called downtrodden, misused fans, the question is do you want relics or a championship? Fans will invariably choose winning.
Players were once prisoners of the owners. They fought and won free agency. Franchises were prisoners of the notion that movement was the exception, not the rule. They, too, have rebelled and have created a class of free-agent teams.
The last tinge of pain I felt in sports came when the Colts moved from Baltimore to Indianapolis. It occurred to me then that nothing was sacred. Baltimore is now getting the Browns from Cleveland, Nashville is getting the Oilers from Houston. (Won't somebody please take the Jets?)
"It makes you wonder what happened to loyalty," said Art Taylor, an associate director of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society. "What happens to the fans in those cities who totally identify with those teams?"
The fans will wait for another team or another Mattingly. Pro sports is simply strip mining. There are no rules, no regulations. Loyalty is not the central theme of this game, not for players, not for fans.
Perhaps part of the Yankees' new direction should be keeping Mattingly, for tradition's sake, getting out of him what they can get on the field and sending him into the bloodstream of the city. Tradition is important.
I never cried over sports heroes; the heroic act was always more appealing than the hero. Traditional values were also appealing: it's not whether you win or lose but how you play the game that counts. That sentiment must coexist with Al Davis's admonition to "Just win, baby."

Let's Get Sore!

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
It's time to give class warfare a chance. The Republicans had me muzzled a long time on this subject, but no more.
"Let the class warfare begin!" is my cry to all who are fed up with outrageously overpaid rock stars and industrial tycoons, with $12 million lunkheads in jockstraps and overgrown boy billionaire egomaniacs from Hollywood. 
 And let's not forget investment bankers and Wall Street lawyers drawing down zillions for merger-and-acquisition paperwork. It's time for class warfare on them all.
Let there be class warfare too on the gazillionaires for whom the abovementioned overpaid flunkeys toil so that great companies may be successfully merged, acquired and ruined and flattering newspaper articles composed to honor these masters of the superbuck way of life.
The Republicans say it is demagogic to complain about this disgusting redistribution of the country's wealth. A few years ago Republicans would have called such discussion "Communistic." A few years ago, however, is ancient history as Americans now measure time, and few can remember the shivers of terror that racked us when someone in that ancient past said "Communistic."
Instead, Republicans now talk of "class warfare." It invites "class warfare," they say, to mention the obvious about the economy; to wit, that while the rich are getting richer and the poor getting poorer, middle-class families now need two incomes just to stand still.
What finally emboldens me to cry out for class warfare is the news that the AT&T Corporation is going to dump 77,800 workers -- half its supervisory work force. For people like me, it is a murderous blow to our faith in American capitalism.
For people like me, faith in AT&T was once as unshakable as the faith of our fathers in ages past. Neighbors and relatives who had jobs with "the telephone company" were thought to be blessed. Even people who hated Wall Street owned a few shares of AT&T, if they could afford it.
It was the great corporation as the embodiment of security, dependability, loyalty and competence. It was capitalism as an ideal. It was big business as everyone's friend.
And now -- nearly 78,000 workers gone. And managerial workers too. All to be dumped on a labor market offering few hopes for the kind of people accustomed to thinking of life as a steadily upward progress.
It tempts me to shout, like some demented football coach, "Hey! What's happening to America when AT&T dumps on its own people?"
Well, the usual answer is: "Good things are happening to the country, coach. It's just people that bad things are happening to."
The misfortunes of people are what economists dismiss as "anecdotal evidence" about the state of the nation. It is statistics, not people with their irrelevant anecdotal problems, that tell the real story. Which goes like this:
The "downsizing" of the country's work force has been under way for several years, and for sound and excellent reasons. To compete in a world market, American industry must increase productivity, and firing people is one way of doing it. If the economic statistics are right -- and sometimes they are -- productivity has indeed risen in the United States since the "downsizing" began.
So runs the comfy tale of the statistics. If you are in the market for class warfare, there are other statistics that may sharpen your urge to set up the guillotine. For instance, though productivity has increased, wages have barely risen at all, except among top corporate executives who in some cases have treated themselves to startlingly big paydays, presumably to reward themselves for the agonizing toil of firing so many.
A rash of recent articles on the changing economy deals with the fact that there is a new overclass, of which the C.E.O.'s are only one element. What distinguishes this overclass is that it is raking down money at constantly increasing rates just when most Americans are struggling not to lose ground.
Is the guillotine the proper weapon for dealing with this new aristocracy? Or is it time for the ultimate weapon -- a new obscene-income tax?

HEADLINE: Admiral Has to Quit Over His Comments On Okinawa Rape

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The commander of United States forces in the Pacific was forced to step down today after he said the recent rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan girl could have been avoided if the American servicemen involved had simply paid for a prostitute.
The commander, Adm. Richard C. Macke, apologized after members of Congress and Japanese officials complained, but it was too late. 
 Admiral Macke, a 57-year-old Annapolis graduate and combat veteran of the war in Vietnam, announced late in the day that he had decided to take early retirement, and both White House and the Defense Department made clear that he had been forced to do so.
Admiral Macke declined to comment on the matter this evening.
A senior White House official said tonight that Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, had heard of Admiral Macke's remarks and told the Defense Department that the statements were "not acceptable."
The official added, "They didn't have to be coaxed," and Admiral Macke was forced to step down.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry said tonight that Admiral Macke had acknowledged that he had made a "serious mistake."
"This evening Admiral Macke and I discussed the comment and its impact on our valued relations with Japan and Okinawa," he said. "We decided that his lapse of judgment was so serious that he would be unable to perform effectively his duties as Commander in Chief of U.S. Forces in the Pacific. As a result, Admiral Macke offered to retire, and I accepted his early retirement."
Admiral Macke later issued a statement apologizing for his comment. "I made a serious mistake this morning," the statement said. "My recent comment was the result of my frustration over the stupidity of this heinous and incomprehensible crime against the young lady. I regret any misunderstanding my comment may have cause."
Admiral Macke also noted that he had repeatedly expressed sympathy for the girl.
The immediate reaction in Japan was subdued. Japanese television reported the admiral's resignation without mentioning his comments on the rape.
Still, a Foreign Ministry spokesman criticized the admiral's comments. "The remarks by Admiral Macke are most inappropriate in view of the terrible incident that took place in Okinawa," the spokesman, Takeshi Nakane, said.
The episode caused yet another strain in United States relations with Japan. First, there was the rape itself. On Nov. 7, the three American servicemen pleaded guilty to conspiring to kidnap and rape the girl.
Then on Wednesday, President Clinton canceled a planned trip to Japan for a Pacific Rim economic conference because of his long-running stalemate with the Republicans in Congress over the budget.
Then came the admiral's statement to reporters today. "I think that it was absolutely stupid, I've said several times," Admiral Macke said of the rape. "For the price they paid to rent the car they could have had a girl."
A Defense Department official said Admiral Macke had made his comment toward the end of a breakfast meeting with reporters this morning.
The official said that after Secretary Perry was told of it, he spoke by telephone with the United States Ambassador to Japan, Walter F. Mondale. Then Mr. Perry called Mr. Clinton and recommended that Admiral Macke be made to retire, and the President concurred, the official said.
Before the resignation was reported, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said she was stunned by the admiral's remarks condoning prostitution.
"I would say to Navy Secretary John Dalton, 'Your guys still don't get it,' " she said. "You better teach them, or else. Rape isn't about money and it isn't about sex. It's about power over women, and it's a very degrading, terrible, major felony."
Admiral Macke is the latest naval officer to become involved in a matter involving insensitivity toward women or outright assault.
The Navy was racked by the Tailhook scandal in 1991, when dozens of women were sexually assaulted by naval officers. Most recently, the Navy Secretary canceled the promotion of the officer in charge of equal opportunity, even after he was acquitted in a court martial on charges of sexually harassing a woman who worked for him.

HEADLINE: Bonanza: Panama Canal Zone Up for Sale

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
It is a colossal windfall that stirs old dreams of instant riches for this small country: 569 square miles of land abutting one of the world's most strategic waterways and more than 7,000 buildings, every last bit of which the United States must hand over to Panama by the end of 1999.
There are airports and harbors, hospitals and warehouses, shopping malls and hotels, apartments and schools, all originally built by American engineers and soldiers as part of what was once the Panama Canal Zone. 
 Now, as nearly a century of American domination draws to a close, the Panamanian Government is offering them for sale or lease to the highest bidder.
"We look upon this as the biggest real-estate operation of the century," said Maria Mercedes Morales de Morgan, promotion and marketing director for the Panamanian Government agency that is supervising the turnover.
But in a country with a long history of corruption and misrule since President Theodore Roosevelt maneuvered its creation in 1903, skeptical Panamanians also fear that the long-awaited bonanza will be mismanaged and end up benefiting only those in power.
"The shenanigans are already bubbling about," a diplomat here said. "There is that ethos here, and we keep hearing talk about payoffs and sweetheart deals and maneuvering and infighting to see who gets what."
Under the Panama Canal treaties of 1977, the United States must transfer control of the canal and all other American installations here to Panama no later than Dec. 31, 1999. That process was interrupted for nearly a decade by the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, but the pace has picked up in recent years, and in September the United States handed over two of its 10 military bases here.
With visions of untold wealth dancing in their heads, journalists, business leaders and politicians have suggested that the United States properties could be worth as much as $30 billion, more than four times the size of the Panamanian economy. In a fever that a Foreign Ministry official likens to the Oklahoma land rush, nearly every one of Panama's 2.5 million people, it seems, has hatched a scheme to capitalize on the return of what are known as the "reverted areas."
The Government, for instance, talks of creating a "City of Knowledge," an international center for research and scholarship, out of a motley collection of barracks.
Real-estate developers look at the pristine Pacific Ocean beachfront near Fort Amador and envision condominiums rising. Some populist politicians argue that the military housing being abandoned by the Americans should be raffled off to the poor.
There is even a plan to turn the former site of the School of the Americas, the alma mater of many Latin American officers including past military dictators, into a luxury hotel and ecotourism center. Some officials, though, are warning that the process is neither as simple nor as sure-fire as it looks.
"Ideally, we will have investors and businesses ready to move in the day after the Americans leave," said Nicolas Ardito Barletta, a former President of Panama who this spring was appointed director of the Inter- oceanic Regional Authority, the Government agency supervising the turnover. "But the reverted areas are only going to be worth what we make them produce."
Though legal procedures to dispose of the reverted areas are still incomplete, a handful of projects have already been approved or are up and running. A consortium led by an auto dealership has transformed a former submarine base across from Colon into a container port, one section of Fort Davis has been leased to Taiwan companies for use as an industrial park, and Swiss interests are negotiating to use part of Fort Gulick for a school to train hotel and tourism workers.
But many Panamanians scoff at the notion that the governing Revolutionary Democratic Party, or P.R.D., will oversee the transfer honestly and efficiently. Burdened by a long history of thievery and thuggery, especially when General Noriega was at its helm, the party was returned to power in the presidential election last year despite winning only a third of the vote.
"I just don't trust them to manage this for the benefit of the nation," said Juan de Dios Rivera, a parking-lot attendant in the capital. "This is a country where the house always takes its cut, and the P.R.D. is the worst of the lot, a nest of pirates. They've spent 23 years in power, and they're still permeated with a hunger for domination and wealth."
Panama's President, Ernesto Perez Balladares, maintains that "there is a lot of misunderstanding about our philosophy in the P.R.D.." He attributed much of his party's negative image to "the stupidities of Noriega and his regime," and predicted that both Panamanians and foreign investors would change their minds once "they start to see the end results."
"Yes, I understand that I have a lot of resistance, because people are used to dishonest governments and an easy-buck mindset," said Mr. Perez Balladares, 49, an economist and banker educated at the University of Notre Dame.
"That's their point of reference, and I can't erase it all in five years," he said. "But I can get a head start and convince them this is different."
Panamanians agree that finding productive uses for the area is essential to the country's prosperity. Some 8,000 American troops plus an even larger number of dependents are scheduled to leave by 1999, and Panama sorely needs a replacement for the more than $300 million that the American presence is estimated to pump into the economy each year.
Since the canal opened in 1914, American troops, numbering as many as 50,000 during World War II, have been responsible for its defense and security. After 1999, however, that responsibility will pass to Panama, which recently abolished its army, unless Mr. Perez Balladares and Washington agree to an extension of the American military presence here.
The troop and bases question, which Mr. Perez Balladares has said he is willing to discuss with Washington, is also important to international shipping companies, which in the last year sent 13,631 vessels through the canal.
They worry that when the Americans leave, no Panamanian Government after the year 2000 will be able to resist the temptation to dip into canal revenues, currently $463 million a year, to make up any shortfall.
Mr. Perez Balladares said such concerns are unfounded.
"We're not going to do that," he said. "We know what the market can bear, we know that we have agreements with the international community, we know that we have to have a Panama Canal that operates with sufficient revenue to make it efficient."
Panamanians now make up nearly 90 percent of the canal's 7,500 employees, and are eager to see the waterway remain outside politics when the Americans leave. If allowed to run the canal without political interference, they are likely to continue the current policy of investing the bulk of revenues in maintenance and modernization.
"They realize they could easily kill the goose that lays the golden egg if they are shortsighted in canal management after 1999," Joseph W. Cornelison, a Deputy Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission, the United States agency that operates the canal, said in an interview at the agency's headquarters.
But Mr. Perez Balladares' many critics have detected signs elsewhere of what they regard as the old business-as-usual approach. Earlier this year, the P.R.D.-dominated National Assembly revised the charter of the Interoceanic Regional Authority, removing some of the agency's independence and leaving it open to strict political control.
As for the areas surrounding the canal, the dangers of their mismanagement are on display across the isthmus at Fort Gulick. The first part of that base, renamed Fort Espinar, was returned to Panama in 1984, at the height of the Noriega era, and has lain abandoned for nearly a dozen years.
At building after building, including the former site of the School of the Americas, vandals have broken in and made off with all of the plumbing and electrical fixtures. Roofs have fallen, windows are broken, tiles have been smashed, garbage has piled up, and bird droppings foul the floors.
But Mr. Barletta, director of the Government agency supervising the turnover, said he was not alarmed.
"Just remember Singapore," he said. "The British walked out in 1963, but they knew in Singapore how to take advantage of their strategic location, and the rest is history. If we do this right, we too can be a developed nation."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVE G.O.P.'S 7-YEAR BUDGET PLAN; PRESIDENT PROMISES A VETO

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
As the first cracks developed in the deadlock between the White House and Congress that has caused a partial Government shutdown, Congress today approved mammoth Republican budget legislation to change the course of the American Government.
President Clinton said today that he would veto the legislation. "We should balance the budget in a way that reflects our values," he said in a statement. 
 But top White House officials spent the afternoon and evening in the Capitol working with Congressional leaders on a way to break the impasse that has kept the Government partially closed since Tuesday. An agreement seemed near between the President and his Republican antagonists to continue Government spending until sometime next month. But when the meetings broke up about 10 P.M., details still needed to be worked out.
"The bottom line is we're going to stand firm for a balanced budget over the next seven years," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader.
But the word at the White House was that it was the Republicans in the House, more zealous than those in the Senate, who were blocking a compromise. Negotiations are expected to continue on Saturday.
The House approved the seven-year budget bill, 237 to 189, essentially following party lines. The measure, the fulfillment of the Republicans' promise to shrink Government and alter its priorities, would eliminate the Federal deficit by 2002, cut taxes for many and sharply limit spending on social programs.
The Senate passed the legislation, 52 to 47. The vote was along party lines, except that Senator William S. Cohen, a Republican from Maine, voted against it.
The Senate made a technical change in the bill tonight. It will be returned to the House for a final vote on Saturday.
Since Republicans do not hold large enough majorities in Congress to override the veto, the bill will never become law. Still, it is one of the most important pieces of legislation in years. It lays down the basis for Republicans' negotiations with the White House, which are expected to begin after Thanksgiving.
"Today is as important a vote as any day since 1933," said Speaker Newt Gingrich. "I think this is an enormous accomplishment."
Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who heads the Budget Committee, wrapped up the debate in the House to a standing ovation from his side. "Balancing the budget and slowing the growth of Federal spending," he said, "is the key to making sure young people's future continues to look bright."
To some extent, the approval of this monumental legislation was overshadowed by the question of whether Congress and the President could arrange to get the Government back to work temporarily.
The issues are integrally entwined. If the President's veto of the big budget legislation is sustained, he will more or less have his way, and the Republicans will have little chance of overhauling Medicare and welfare, cutting a wide range of taxes and putting in place a seven-year plan to balance the budget.
With that in mind, Republicans have insisted on forcing the President's hand by attaching budget conditions to temporary spending legislation that must be enacted to give the Government's departments and agencies money to operate.
Congress has approved two temporary spending bills, called continuing resolutions, to put the Government back in business until next month. The President vetoed the first, leading to this week's partial Government shutdown, and has promised to veto the second.
Mr. Clinton refused to accept the condition Republicans attached to the legislation committing him to produce a seven-year balanced-budget plan using a conservative accounting method adopted by Congress.
Such a commitment, the President maintains, would force cuts the country cannot afford in Medicare and programs protecting the poor.
Two of the President's top assistants, Leon E. Panetta, his chief of staff, and George Stephanopoulos, his senior adviser, spent several hours in the Capitol this afternoon and evening working with lawmakers on a compromise.
"We believe we can find a way to break the impasse that's a win-win situation," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Senator John B. Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, said this evening that an agreement was near in which the President would agree to a balanced budget within seven years if "mutually agreeable economic assumptions" were used.
The Administration's economic forecasts, made by the Office of Management and Budget, are more optimistic and would thus allow more flexibility than those of the Congressional Budget Office, which Republican leaders have been insisting on using.
Republicans in the House were said to have balked at the Breaux prescription on the ground that it would give the President a way to back out of a pledge to put forward a balanced-budget plan.
With an agreement in the wind, the oratory on both sides was distinctly modulated today, compared with the shootout style of earlier in the week. Perhaps that was because the switchboards at the White House and Congress have been flooded with calls from people saying they are tired of the squabbling.
For the first time all week, Mr. Gingrich did not attack the President personally, and Mr. Clinton did not make a contentious statement.
"We are looking for ways," said Michael D. McCurry, the President's spokesman, speaking especially deliberately, "that we can work through this current crisis and come up with a continuing resolution acceptable to the Congress and acceptable to the President."
The seven-year budget legislation would sharply limit spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the Government's main health programs for the elderly and poor, respectively, and would turn many Federal social programs over to the states with restricted funds. Student loans, aid to farmers and environmental regulations would be changed.
Taxes would be cut by $245 billion over the seven-year period. Middle-income families with many children and wealthy investors would get most of the benefits. Most taxpayers, however, would get little if any benefit from the new tax breaks.
In the House debate, Republicans seemed determined to present themselves not as firebrands but as thoughtful legislators determined to protect the country's future.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader, said: "Nobody doubts for a moment that this is our best effort to do what we know is the right and necessary thing to do -- that we have been governed by our best motives, our hardest work, our best effort and frankly our most sincere prayers."
Mr. Kasich adopted a similar mien. "This is not business as usual," he said. "Both sides are fighting on deeply held principles. To the American people, this is what you sent us here to do, to stand up for our heart-felt beliefs."
Democrats took issue with the notion that by reversing direction, Republicans were improving the course of the country. But they also mainly criticized the legislation, not the motives of their opponents.
The main issue, said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, should not be how many years it would take to balance the budget but whether the priorities in the legislation were properly balanced.
"Do we take care of the disabled?" Mr. Gephardt asked. "Do we take care of the seniors? Do we take care of the children?"
The answer was "no," he said. "It asks too much of people in the middle class and people asking to get into the middle class and it does too much to give privileges and breaks to people who have done well."
In the Senate, Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, made a similar argument. "The Republican budget plan," he said, "is a program to sacrifice senior citizens, students, children and working families in order to pay for lavish tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals and corporations in America.
 
HIGHLIGHTS

HEADLINE: VOTE IN HARTFORD BY SENATE REJECTS BRIDGEPORT CASINO

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The Connecticut Senate today overwhelmingly rejected Gov. John G. Rowland's proposal for a casino in Bridgeport, ending more than four years of debate over whether to allow casinos in the state outside of Indian reservations.
The 24-to-10 vote crushed Bridgeport residents' hopes of seeing their ailing city, one hour from New York, become a gambling mecca. But for Atlantic City, it meant that a potential competitor, which experts said could have siphoned away as much as 30 percent of its business, had been stopped. 
 It was of particular interest in New York State, where debate over legalizing casinos in resort areas like the Catskills began earlier this year and where the Legislature must decide in 1997 whether to schedule a statewide referendum on the issue.
For New York, however, the meaning of today's action was by no means clear-cut. While the defeat of the Bridgeport proposal means less competition for potential casinos in New York, it also points out how difficult a fight casino supporters may face in Albany. The Bridgeport plan's strongest opposition came from the parimutuel industry in Connecticut -- two dog tracks, a jai alai fronton and two teletracks, where bettors watch live horse races on large television screens -- which feared that they could not compete against a casino. In New York, similar resistance has emerged from the powerful horse racing industry.
Today's vote was a major defeat for Mr. Rowland, who had worked furiously over the last three weeks to persuade senators that only a casino could provide the jobs needed to revive Bridgeport. He has said he will not consider any other casino proposals, adding today: "The proposal is dead. I am not going to put the State Senate through this again."
Carol Balboni, owner of Conte's Package Store on Madison Avenue, said: "I thought it would be different this time. I really believed the casino was going to be approved and we would finally get the chance to dig out from under our economic downfall. You might as well just build a wall around Bridgeport and shut down, now."
Although the $875 million casino would not have been on Indian land, the developer would have been the Mashantucket Pequot Indians, the owners of the immensely successful Foxwoods casino in eastern Connecticut. But even in defeat, the tribe was a winner. Without a casino in Bridgeport, the Pequots, along with another Connecticut tribe, the Mohegans, will retain a monopoly on casino gambling in the state.
The action in Connecticut was the latest in a series of defeats for the gaming industry nationally. In last week's elections, opponents of gambling won several referendums, stopping casino proposals in Springfield, Mass.; two counties in Indiana; Jefferson City, Mo., and in Washington State, where the proponents promised every resident $100 a year if the measure passed. Last year, Florida also voted down a pro-gaming referendum.
"It adds up to a pretty grim picture for casinos," Charles J. Anderer, editor of International Gaming and Wagering Business magazine, said today. "This will definitely contribute to the slowing of the growth of gaming."
The casino was opposed by a broad coalition from across the state. Some objected to expanding casino gaming, saying it would lead to an array of social ills, including increased crime and compulsive gambling. While Mr. Rowland argued that it would create 10,000 jobs, opponents said casino gambling took money from other businesses and would cost the state jobs.
Others opposed the measure because they were troubled about giving more power to the Pequots. And suburban Fairfield County lawmakers complained that the casino would worsen traffic and increase air pollution.
These issues overwhelmed Mr. Rowland's effort to cast the proposal as the last hope for Bridgeport.
"The focus has always been on one thing," Mr. Rowland said after the vote. "Jobs for Bridgeport."
The debate today was wrenching, cutting across party lines, pitting many of the state's most prominent Republicans against their Republican Governor and Bridgeport senators against their suburban neighbors.
Senator Judith G. Freedman, Republican of Westport, told the Senate, "I cannot support this, because it will hurt us more than it will help the city that we all have bleeding hearts for at this time." A few minutes later, Senator Alvin Penn, Democrat of Bridgeport, criticized her for caring more about traffic than jobs and said: "Folks can't drive their Bimmers. That's too bad."
Since it was first proposed in 1992, the casino issue has obsessed many in the legislature, resulting in dozens of hearings and more than $13 million in lobbying.
Mr. Rowland, bitterly disappointed, said the vote was an opportunity lost, costing the state billions of dollars. Asked if any place stood to gain from his defeat, he said: "Unfortunately, New York City is the big winner here. They may get the jobs, they may get the revenue. It could have gone to Bridgeport."
The Oneida Indians now operate a casino, as permitted by Federal law, on their reservation near Syracuse, and both they and the St. Regis Mohawk Indians have moved to open another in the Catskills. But Gov. George E. Pataki, whose approval would be required for such an expansion of Indian gaming, has said he would oppose the tribes' plans.
There is also a movement in the state to legalize non-Indian casino gaming. In June, the New York State Legislature took the first step, approving a constitutional amendment allowing casinos. The measure must also be approved by the next legislature to be elected, which comes into office in 1997, and then it would have to pass a statewide referendum.
The resolution designated Niagara Falls and the Catskills as potential sites, but did not include New York City. Mr. Pataki has said it should be amended to include the city, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has not taken any position on a New York City casino, though he has been exploring the idea of "casino cruises," during which betting would take place offshore.
But the Pequots' defeat may also suggest a larger trend that could help Atlantic City and undercut expanded gaming in New York: a growing backlash to casinos.
Over the last eight years, growth in the gaming industry has been remarkable. Iowa, Colorado, Mississippi, Louisiana and Illinois have approved non-Indian casinos, and at least 123 tribes have opened casinos in 24 states. But in response to the boom, a substantial anti-gaming movement has recently emerged.

HEADLINE: Union Members Express Dismay at Terms

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
As details of New York City's tentative new labor agreement with 17 of its unions began to filter down to the rank and file late yesterday, the immediate reaction of some workers was disbelief, followed by a simmering defiance that union leaders said could endanger ratification.
"There is no way I would vote for something like this," said Celeste James, an assistant in the City Clerk's Office in Brooklyn and a chairwoman of the executive board of Local 1549, which represents clerical workers. "To us, it's a slap in the face, totally." 
 Though the five-year agreement fell short of the major concessions on work rules and benefits that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had pledged, its offer of no raises for the first two years provoked dismay among many workers.
That initial dismay signaled a greater than usual uncertainty about the contract's chances of being ratified. And it virtually guaranteed that the leaders of the 17 unions, led by District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, would face a difficult sales campaign.
At the 11 P.M. press conference yesterday in which union leaders stood with the Mayor to announce the agreement, Stanley Hill, executive director of the district council, predicted that it would be accepted when the membership votes in the weeks ahead. "There's anger at first sight, but we're going to educate and communicate," he said. "Union members are angry, but union members are also realistic."
Yet some leaders of large locals in the council, including James Butler, president of Local 420 of the hospital workers' union, and Arthur Cheliotes, president of Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, voted against the deal and said that they would urge their members not to support the pact.
Mr. Cheliotes said that district council leaders would most likely try to convince workers to approve the agreement by telling them that it was the best that could be reached under the circumstances. "They're going to say: can anyone do any better?" he said. "And I think they don't think that anyone can. They can point to the teachers and to the state workers and to New Jersey."
But with the Mayor supporting raises for himself and other top officials at the same time that workers confront a seeming litany of higher living costs, such as the subway fare increase, some union leaders said it is a pitch that will fall on deaf ears.
While it is rare for the city's union members to reject contracts, said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity, if Mr. Butler of the hospital workers' union "really organizes against this, it's not going to be easy to pass."
Members of several locals represented by District Council 37 said that while they recognized the economic straits that bound the negotiations, they felt the union leadership had sold them out.
"I don't feel like they fought for us at all," said Mary Ann Barrucco, who works in the office of the City Register in Brooklyn. She echoed the sentiments of others who said they held a newfound distrust of the district council leadership.
Linda Dawkins, a clerical aide for the Department of Health, said she and her fellow employees had begun to feel as if City Hall and union leaders have become "just one big clique."
"It seems like they're trying to make each other look good, and we're losing out," she said.
Ms. Barrucco added that the work force in city offices had already been whittled significantly by attrition in recent years, and that workers are now "doing the job of three with no more money" in real terms than they had a decade ago.
Ms. James said she had received angry calls all morning from members who wanted to know when an agreement would come and what it would say.
But she had little to tell them, she said; unlike the practice in previous contract negotiations, her board had mostly been kept in the dark. "Today was the first I heard of all this," said Ms. James. "And I think that's because they knew there would be a lot of screaming."

Man Held in Parents' Deaths

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

DATELINE: WEST LONG BRANCH

 BODY:
A man fatally shot his elderly parents and a nurse Thursday afternoon, then shot and critically wounded himself, the authorities said yesterday. The man, Stephen Spranger, 54, was charged in the shooting deaths of his mother, Madeline, 89, his father, Harvey, 85, and Marcia Granucci, 45, who was employed to assist the couple. The suspect, who is unemployed and lived with his parents, was in critical condition yesterday with a bullet wound to the head. The authorities said they do not know the motive for the killings, The Associated Press reported. 
 The bodies were found in different rooms by officers who came to the Spranger home to inquire about Mrs. Granucci, whose husband had called the police to report that she had not returned to their Wall Township home after work.

HEADLINE: Budget Worries Leave Treasury Prices Flat

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday in a lackluster trading session as market participants awaited signs of progress on budget negotiations in Washington.
"I think most people came into the day expecting little and they got little," said Joshua Stiles, an economist with the consulting firm of IDEA Inc. "A lot of people would prefer to stay where they are until Monday," he said, because if a breakthrough on the budget occurred over the weekend, "it would trip people up." 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 1/32 , to 10823/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, edged up to 6.23 percent, from 6.22 percent on Thursday, but still near a two-year low.
Shorter-term maturities fared a little better yesterday. The price of the two-year note rose 1/32 , to 10011/32 , pushing down its yield to 5.43 percent from 5.45 percent. The price of the 10-year bond also edged up 1/32 , to 10413/32 , with its yield unchanged at 5.90 percent.
With so much uncertainty surrounding the Federal budget and the national debt limit, analysts said dealers who typically set up short positions ahead of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills were hesitant. In taking a short position, a dealer sells borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back at a lower price.
"I can name a handful of dealers who would have sold a couple hundred three-years today and bought them back again on Monday cheaper," Mr. Stiles of IDEA said. "But you don't want to get too aggressive shorting" if there is a chance of progress on the budget this weekend, he said.
The Treasury also plans to auction $18 billion of three-year notes on Monday and $13.5 billion of 10-year notes on Tuesday.
Still, the market took some encouragement from comments by the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who held out hope of a compromise with Republicans on a stopgap financing bill yesterday, saying President Clinton might be willing to back away from demands for a bill without any Republican conditions.
And Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said the Senate might vote today on a piecemeal spending bill to pay for agencies that process Social Security, veterans' benefits and Medicare claims.
The expiration of December Treasury bond futures options yesterday had little effect on the cash market, analysts said.
In the corporate bond market, prices were marginally weaker in light trading.
But Delta Air Lines was a big gainer, trading up to a 99.5 bid on its 12.5 percent notes on the news that Moody's Investors Service might upgrade the carrier's Ba1 senior unsecured debt, traders said.
New issues continued at a brisk pace yesterday.
ITT Destinations raised $1.75 billion in a four-part debt deal led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. ITT Destinations is one of three new companies being formed by the split-up of the ITT Corporation.
The debt issue was guaranteed by ITT, and was rated Baa1 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
The size of the offering was increased from $1.3 billion as a result of high interest from investors.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 25, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day last Saturday about trading in the credit markets the previous day omitted the name of a lead underwriter on a debt deal for ITT Destinations. It is Bear, Stearns & Company, which is managing the deal along with Goldman, Sachs & Company.

HEADLINE: Mumford and the Master

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger; Paul Goldberger is the chief cultural correspondent of The New York Times.

 BODY:

LEWIS MUMFORD AND PATRICK GEDDES
The Correspondence.
Edited by Frank G. Novak Jr.
Illustrated. 383 pp. New York:
Routledge.
$45. 
 THERE are epistolary novels and there are books in which the correspondence of great figures is reverently assembled, and one rarely has much to do with the other. The letters that make up an epistolary novel are expected to deal in the routine, even trite, minutiae of daily life but together tell a larger story. Collections of the correspondence between celebrated people are often the opposite: we assume that each and every letter will stand as a work on its own, demonstrating in capsule form why its writer deserves our attention.
One of the most pleasing things about "Lewis Mumford and Patrick Geddes: The Correspondence" is the way in which it fails to meet this standard, and provides only sporadic glimpses of its writers' greatness. This book contains neither Mumford's best prose nor Geddes's most lucid presentation of his ideas. Yet it manages, slowly and firmly, if not always clearly, to record a remarkable relationship in American intellectual history. It is a story, in spite of itself.
And the story is a universal one: a mating dance, full of joy and sadness, progressing over the course of 17 years from infatuation to connection to disillusionment. That the romance was an intellectual one, driven not by eros but by the desire for mental stimulus and career advancement, matters not at all. These were two heterosexual men who wanted as much out of each other as lovers do, and in some ways forged a bond every bit as tight. The connection between Geddes, teacher, and Mumford, acolyte, is one of the great master-protege relationships in modern cultural history, ranking with that of Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright; its long evolution sheds light on every anguished exchange between a pupil who has worshiped his teacher and then been disappointed by him.
Mumford, who died at 95 in 1990 -- he would have been 100 a month ago today -- was perhaps the strongest and most powerful general humanist of the 20th century. Best known as an architecture critic and urban historian, he was also a social commentator, literary critic, philosopher and poet, a student of technology and an unstinting moral voice. His refusal to be constrained by narrow definitions of subject and his determination to use scholarship as the springboard for an active civic life came in large part from Geddes, 41 years his senior, a biologist, urban planner, sociologist and determined outsider to the academy, who argued passionately that all subjects were intertwined and spent much of his life trying to formulate a rational system for the synthesis of knowledge and human experience.
Mumford first encountered Geddes's work in 1914, when he was a student at City College in New York. Geddes managed to rouse "something in my soul that no one else had yet touched," Mumford wrote later. "What Geddes's voice did was to lead me away from the well-paved avenue to professional success: his was the Song of the Open Road. . . . Geddes believed that abstract thinking must be enriched by wider experience, clarified by reflective criticism, and completed by communal action."
Mumford wrote to Geddes's secretary in 1915 for an explanation of how a student might arrange to study with him. But not until 1917 did Mumford write directly to the man he was later to address as Master, and that first letter was marked by a striking combination of obsequiousness and eagerness. Significantly, Mumford introduced in this very first letter a subject that was to continue as a leitmotif throughout the years of their relationship: the belief, shared by both men, that great cities are entities unto themselves, with an economic, social and cultural power that transcends the nations of which they are, technically, a part, and that the regions that naturally surround cities can be more appropriate political units than the artificial boundaries of nations and states. Geddes responded with some brevity to Mumford's riff on his theories, but with cautious encouragement -- enough, in fact, to unleash a torrent of further words from Mumford.
And soon they were off to the races. Thousands of words poured back and forth, revealing in both men a constant hunger for ideas and an almost desperate desire to exchange information. Not the least intriguing aspect of this entire correspondence is the extent to which it reveals the scarcity of scholarly information in the early decades of this century and the slowness with which theories were propagated. No doubt the fact that Geddes spent many of those years in Bombay, planning cities in India, contributed to his eagerness to turn Mumford into a pipeline for information about colleagues, news of new books and their reviews and gossip. But obtaining information is really a kind of theme throughout the letters of both men; in this age of information overload they stand as a reminder of how recently the challenge was not to sift through too much information but to get enough of it in the first place.
It is almost too obvious to say that Mumford, who never knew his father, found in Geddes a surrogate parent, and that Geddes saw in Mumford a replacement for his elder son, who had been killed in World War I, before the correspondence began. In this sense their contact seems almost fated. Yet both men seem to have viewed this aspect of their relationship with some discomfort if not, at times, denial. Each struggled to be free of the other even as he clung to his identity as master or student. In 1921 Mumford would ask Geddes to "forgive the brusqueness of a young man who intellectually speaking is scarcely fit to wash out a beaker in your laboratory," laying before Geddes all his problems, personal and financial as well as intellectual. Yet he would feel free to offer up his own ideas, and while they were presented with an obvious eye toward the older man's approval, he made no effort to tailor them to fit Geddes's own theories.
 THE two did not actually meet until Geddes came to New York in 1923, to lecture at the New School on a trip Mumford had helped to arrange. Geddes had repeatedly invited Mumford to join him in Bombay as well as in Palestine, where he was helping to plan what became the Hebrew University, but for various reasons, mainly connected to the uncertainty of both Mumford's health and his finances, none of the trips came off. By the time they actually laid eyes on each other, they had spent six years concocting various plans for collaboration, for the editing of Geddes's voluminous papers and for the creation of a book that would pull together all of his diverse ideas -- during which time neither man had ever even heard the other's voice.
Their first face-to-face encounter was a moment of high drama that marked, in a way, the beginning of Mumford's disillusionment: he found Geddes vain, self-centered, rigid and disorganized. Mumford was at that point approaching 30, and increasingly committing himself to a life centered on writing; he was less interested in serving as Geddes's acolyte than in being perceived as his intellectual heir. Geddes could never quite comprehend Mumford's increasing independence, and while he referred to him as a collaborator, as the years went on his notion of the joint work they would undertake seemed more and more to be focused on Geddes's alone. Once Geddes cruelly, if unintentionally, slighted Mumford when he forgot to appear at Mumford's apartment in Brooklyn Heights for a planned Sunday afternoon visit, not even telephoning his regrets. Yet Mumford never seemed quite able to acknowledge directly to Geddes the scope of his intellectual debt, which might have mellowed the older man's outlook. Mumford's letters are filled with florid praise (for a while he closed them with the phrase, "Yours in discipleship") but there is always a formal tone, and hence an odd distance.
 THE letters are, alas, rather unrevealing about this difficult visit; we know more of this interlude from Mumford's other writings, and from the excellent and wide-ranging introductory essay by Frank G. Novak Jr., a professor of English at George Pepperdine University, who edited this volume. While Geddes was in New York Mumford wrote him only once. But this letter is among the best in the book, for Mumford here did not hesitate to say what was on his mind. On July 6, after Geddes had been in New York for two months, Mumford wrote, "In one sense, I have the feeling that we have yet to meet. . . . My respect for you is so great that it reduces my mental reactions in your presence to those I used to feel in the presence of my teacher when I was 12 years old -- that is, complete paralysis!" Later in the letter comes one of the rare moments when Mumford takes Geddes on: "If instead of thinking of me as a quack journalist you'd conceive of me rather as a young scholar who publishes his notes and lectures instead of speaking to a class; and if you'd see that I have chosen to get a living in this manner because it is for me the one means by which I can work at my own pace and keep at least a third of my time free for thinking and studying of a different sort, there might still be a little exaggeration in the picture, but it would be an exaggeration towards the truth."
Geddes answered with praise, and the statement that "I don't want mere secretaryship . . . but your maturer development above all," but that was enough to hold things together only for a while, for Mumford knew better than to take Geddes at his word. Yet the relationship continued, and in its odd way flourished; after the New York visit, Geddes finally began to address Mumford as "Lewis," and Mumford, who had a lifelong tendency toward stuffiness, assumed a tone that was at least a little bit less stuffy. When Mumford's son was born in 1925, he named him Geddes, and Geddes's acknowledgment of this fact in his letters, if terse, seems to reflect genuine pleasure.
The correspondence continued until Geddes's death at the age of 77 in 1932, the year he received a knighthood, one of the few public acknowledgments of his stature. By then the disappointment both men felt for their failure to produce creative work together was an established fact, but so was the affection and admiration they continued to hold for each other. The tone was relaxed and almost mellow toward the end; since Geddes's death was sudden, there were no farewells, no cathartic moments in print. In the end, for all their struggles with each other, it really was the exchange of ideas that motivated both Geddes and Mumford. They whined and complained and talked endlessly of logistical complications, but in the best letters in this volume ideas break through, and you can clearly sense the thrill.

HEADLINE: THE RICH;
How Their Kids Are Just Like Them

BYLINE: By ROBERT SULLIVAN; Robert Sullivan's last piece for the Magazine was about television writers. He lives in Portland, Ore.

 BODY:
With its red-brick New England-style buildings and its leafy campus setting, the Lakeside School, a private institution for grades 5 through 12 in north Seattle, looks like the quintessential East Coast prep school -- an Ivy League steppingstone from the other side of the continent. But the similarities end at the tall white doors of the main building, called Bliss Hall. On the East Coast, an expensive private-school education is considered a rung on the ladder to upper-crust America, and in the halls of such places the quiet codes of high-society conduct are imparted along with lessons in trigonometry and French. At Lakeside, the tone is distinctly . . . well, there isn't tone. There are faded T-shirts and lots of neo-grunge flannel and every make of athletic shoe imaginable -- and not a blue blazer in sight. There is no one, in fact, who is dressed or talking as rich kids do, or are thought to. There are garden burgers being prepared in the cafeteria and scores of computers booting up and, on the stage in the community meeting room this particular morning in September, a girl named Katie Coxon. She is describing for about 200 middle-schoolers a brainstorming session at which she and other eighth graders worked up a list of adjectives with which they hoped to describe their lives come the year 2005: relaxed, bold, talented, friendly, productive.
Lakeside is expensive (about $12,000 a year). And Lakeside is proud of its alumni, who include Bill Gates, his founding partner at Microsoft, Paul Allen, and Craig McCaw, the founder of McCaw Cellular Communications, bought last year by AT&T for $12.6 billion. 
 But Lakeside is not Groton or Spence. It doesn't have the subtle Anglophile trappings -- the ones the East Coast prep schools make a point of not pointing to too expressively. It doesn't feel exclusive, just as a Microsoft millionaire can convey that sense -- with his jeans and knowledge of takeout food -- of not seeming rich.
Robin Ballard, a Lakeside ninth grader, was perhaps alluding to this more casual style of American affluence as it is manifesting itself in the Pacific Northwest when she said, "My dad works at Microsoft, and it looks like a lot of fun."
Keith Grinstein, a 1978 Lakeside graduate who is now president of the aviation communications division of AT&T wireless services as well as a member of Lakeside's development committee, observes: "When I got to Yale, I had no idea what the Fence Club was. I didn't know what secret societies were. Lakeside didn't prepare me for eating lunch at the Yale or the Harvard Club in New York City. The school is not designed to train legions of cultural or economic elite."
Like the space needle, Lakeside is singular in Seattle, for private school is not a tradition among the city's upper-income families. In the East, public schools were mostly built after private ones. In the Northwest, the educational system is a remnant of the original layout of the territory: each settlement included a plot of land set aside for the benefit of public education. The educational past here is markedly egalitarian. Lumber barons and banking magnates sometimes sent their children east for prep-school educations, but more often than not they sent them to a public school close to home. As a result, Seattle has only a few private schools like Lakeside, whereas Eastern cities of similar size and wealth are apt to have at least a dozen.
The Lakeside School was begun in 1919 as the Moran-Lakeside School; it was for boys only and set on the shore of Lake Washington in the old-money neighborhood of Denny Blaine. (The school moved to its present site in 1930 and went co-ed in 1971.) Today the enrollment is 693, with 160 faculty and staff members, a 33,500-volume library and some 200 computers (although most of the computers at Gates's alma mater are not on the cutting edge but on the edge of obsolescence). The list of courses is liberal-arts-meets-continuing-multicultural education. In the middle school, at 10 A.M., a sixth-grade class studies the budgets of foreign countries on the World Wide Web.
If the prep-school culture of Boston mirrors the culture of its firms and corporations, so the culture at Lakeside mirrors that of business in the Northwest. In Seattle and Portland, professionals attend creative seminars and go on kayaking retreats; at Lakeside, students are sent into the forests of Washington State to commune with nature and one another, and in-school work teams and frequent sessions of "free writing" emphasize creativity and intellectual nimbleness.
"I think we do a pretty good job of encouraging kids who like to play with ideas," Fred Wright, the math teacher who taught Gates in the 70's, says.
Peter Hodges is the director of curriculum for Lakeside's lower school. He walks the halls waving and chatting with students who call him by his first name and comment on his neckties -- today, a relic from a 1968 Janis Joplin Winterland concert.
"We're trying to tell them that it's really O.K. to be curious," Hodges says. "Most kids at this time are showing their separation and disdain for the adult world. But our kids are engaged."
BETWEEN 8 AND 8:15 A.M., WHEN THE upperschool kids pull off the highway after their trips from the big homes in Broadmoor, Denny Blaine and Washington Park and from suburbs like Bellevue, the intersection of Northeast 130th Street and First Avenue, just down the street from the school, is jammed with shining four-wheel-drive vehicles of every kind. Ford Explorers, Isuzu Troopers -- it's as if the school were reachable only by dirt road. Eventually those cars jam the parking lot, behind the Refectory, which is the cafeteria -- and which by lunch time is filled with 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th graders who are similar in their scrubbed unkemptness.
The kids are smart and relaxed about that.
"You're not, like, labeled as a dork if you want to learn stuff," Hannah Elmer says.
The science class is as likely to entail pondering mayfly larvae at a nearby creek as hitting the books.
"I only have two academic courses today, math and philosophy," Amity Burr says, relishing the freedom of her new management-style schedule. "My dad hates my schedule, but I actually learn a lot."
When the subjects of family income and tuition are raised, Bunnie Curtis, poised and soft-spoken, points out that 17 percent of the students, herself included, are on financial aid. She recalls that the students at her previous school, a public one, told her not to apply: "They said: 'Oh, it's a bunch of rich kids. You won't like it.' And a lot of them didn't try to apply. But it's not like that."
Income was something of a sore point at the school just then, after a small controversy over a "kickoff" dinner for the parents of seniors held in the Highlands, Seattle's gated and most exclusive neighborhood. There was an admission charge of $40 per couple, not to mention valet parking. According to the student paper, The Tatler, the cost kept some parents away, and the reporting of this led to soul-searching all around. The student government was reported to be in the process of drafting a letter to the organizers asking them to consider "the feelings of the entire community."
At day's end at Lakeside, there is noise on the soccer field and the sound of sports-utility vehicles being started and driven away. To the lake or the hills for a mountain-bike ride -- but first a stop at the local Starbucks for a little something to go.

HEADLINE: THE BIG CITY;
Number Theory

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
YOUNG investment bankers don't like to mention the Number in polite society. They know how appalling their calculations sound. But in private, after a few drinks, they will ask one another: How much money do you need to leave your job? What sum will make you a permanent member of New York's leisure class? What is . . . the Number?
The Number is often used interchangeably with another term, an unprintable one that describes the sum you need to be able to tell your boss you've had enough. Its family-newspaper approximation would be Forget You Money. But linguistic purists on Wall Street insist there's a difference between the two concepts. "It doesn't take much money to tell your boss to get lost," one money manager explains. "With a million in the bank you can afford to look for another job. But if you want to live the rest of your life without worrying about money, you need the Number." 
 You can think of the Number as the inverse of the poverty line: the subsistence-wealth line. Subsistence, of course, is a highly relative concept in New York. In the novel he's now writing, Tom Wolfe has a character struggling for upper-middle-class status on $225,000 a year. "He's not a socialite," Wolfe says. "He has not all that grand a co-op apartment. He's just someone who wants to send his two kids to private school and have an apartment in which each child has a bedroom. He'd like to have a car and to take a vacation every now and then. He explains to himself why a civilized life in New York is impossible on $225,000 year, and I think it's quite reasonable." In "Bonfire of the Vanities," Sherman McCoy was barely surviving in the 1980's on $980,000 a year -- the co-op loan payments were crushing him -- and Wolfe believes today's socialite would need more money still: "I said Sherman's two-story apartment at Park Avenue and 75th Street cost $2.6 million, but that was already too low by the time the book came out. It might be $3.5 million now."
The Masters of the Universe I consulted agree that Sherman would be in trouble today. A million a year starts to look like chump change once you deduct the taxes and the loan payments on a couple of homes. When calculating the Number, they talk in after-tax dollars and assume that the co-op and the country house are already paid off.
"If there's no mortgage, you can figure your normal monthly expenses at $8,000," an investment banker explained over his third beer at the Royalton Hotel bar. "That covers the nanny and food and leaves plenty of room for $300 dinners at Bouley. Figure $50,000 to $100,000 a year on major expenses like furniture and cars. Give yourself 50 days of vacation at $1,200 a day -- that's another $60,000. Add it up and you see you can live quite comfortably on $250,000."
"But that's not even subsistence level," a colleague at the bar protested. "What about the $30,000 for school tuition? What about the $25,000 a stud like you has to spend on the country club? That brings it up to $300,000 minimum. And if you get a jet ----."
"No jet. The jet will kill you. Then your wife wants a $2,000 gown for every charity event and a $25,000 donation to put your name on the program. You start buying art -- there's no limit once you get the jet. I'm talking about a very basic kind of guy here."
They finally agreed that this basic guy could survive on $400,000 a year. To generate this income, assuming a 4 percent after-tax return on short-term Treasury bills, you would need $10 million. This was the same Number I heard from some other Wall Streeters too. In fact, it's roughly equivalent to the pre-inflation Numbers used last century by two rich New Yorkers.
"I have had no real gratification or enjoyment," William Henry Vanderbilt said in the 1880's, "more than my neighbor on the next block who is worth only half a million." Earlier in the century John Jacob Astor declared that "a man who has a million dollars is as well off as if he were rich." In today's dollars their estimates would translate, respectively, into $8 million and $14 million.
So is $10 million the Number? Maybe for this year. But what about future inflation? "You really need $25 million," a banker told me. "That gives you a million in after-tax income this year -- $400,000 to spend, $600,000 to reinvest so you compensate for inflation. And if you want to be really safe, you should be prepared to lose half your money in a divorce. That means you have to start out with $50 million."
Fifty million seems an incontrovertibly comfortable figure for the subsistence-wealth line. It looks very much like the Number. But what happens to those who reach it? A few do leave Wall Street to tend a vineyard or run a country inn, but not many stay away for long. They develop new urges. They start thinking about reaching $100 million (a sum known as a Hunge) or a billion (a Bill). They speak of becoming a Player in games in which the Number is merely the ante. They begin to understand the practical reasons for having that jet. "If you're someone who can make the Number," says John Spooner, a senior vice president at Smith Barney, "you're probably someone who can't stop there." You're like the client of Spooner who tried retiring and soon called to say he was depressed: "I've made my Number, but no one returns my phone calls."
In the spring I was at a dinner party with an investment banker in his mid-40's who had just quit with his Number safely in the bank. "I worked so hard that the last 25 years are a blur," he told the impoverished journalists at the table. "I shouldn't look so much older than you guys. I've got to slow down." His wife smiled as he talked about their plans to travel. He was going to read, relax with his kids, maybe start a leisurely second career in education. "I'm going to take my time and figure out what I really want to do with my life."
Two months later I saw his name in the paper. He had taken a high-pressure job overhauling one of the giant new global conglomerates. I don't know if he has figured out his life yet -- his assistant said he didn't have time to return my phone call -- but I suspect that his hiatus enabled him to glimpse the true mathematical equation: The Number = A Little More.

HEADLINE: On Language;
Spookspeak in Deutchland

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
NEITHER THE NIO for warning nor any of the SIBlings knew that this article was being prepared for publication. Transmitted outside the WASHFAX, it has not appeared in the latest SNIE and was done with no knowledge in Deutchland.
"Deutchland" is what the surly set at the Central Intelligence Agency calls the mole-shocked agency in its post-Ames era. John Deutch, the new D.C.I. (Director of Central Intelligence), is a hearty fellow from M.I.T. and the Pentagon, given to hugging and back-rubbing insecure case officers, who suspiciously refer to such physical reassurance as "the hug of death." 
As the agency staggers from being penetrated by the K.G.B. to being rigorously examined by CODELS (Congressional Delegations), one element of its culture remains sacrosanct: spookspeak. In the land of acronyms, we now have FUSS (Fleet Undersea Surveillance System) and FORMICA (not the counter-top material, but Foreign Military Intelligence Collection Activity). But initialese -- without the creative acronymic word-formation -- is rampant.
Take it from the top: within the NIC, or National Intelligence Council, there are NIO's, or National Intelligence Officers: the guy who tries to keep the Government from any blind-siding by the competition or the media is the NIO for warning. He is in close touch with members of the Strategic Intelligence Board, or SIB, whose brothers under the skin are SIBlings, and they all share SNIE's -- Special National Intelligence Estimates.
A WASHFAX is a secure, encrypted telephone fax line that nobody in the intelligence community trusts. If the communication was until recently labeled WNINTEL/ ORCON/PROPIN, the spooks felt better hand-carrying it over. WNINTEL meant that remote sensing technology -- like a long-distance bug -- was used to gather the information. ORCON meant "originator controlled," with the writer to be consulted about future clearances. PROPIN meant "contains proprietary information," like the formula for Coca-Cola syrup or the sketches for a French designer's collection.
The INT, for "intelligence," is a standard acronym-former: HUMINT is "human intelligence," SIGINT "signal intelligence," which includes "KEYHOLE," the code word for data derived from an imagery satellite, and MASINT, "measurement and signature intelligence," the telltale clues to identity picked up by acoustic, nuclear and seismic sensors, hand-carried over (not the WASHFAX, stupid) to the A.S.D. (C3I) who is Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, who was hugged by Deutch and survived. An unofficial usage is RUMINT -- for "rumor intelligence," the gossip and scuttlebutt that often proved more reliable than the HUMINT sent in by one of the K.G.B. or Stasi double agents who the D.D.O. (Deputy Director for Operations) thought was working for us. (A House Intelligence staff member has pledged to review the C.I.A. "INT by INT.")
The word from DODIPP (the Department of Defense Intelligence Production Program) is that PROPIN is no longer used. The intelligence community's sort-of-secret budget ($28 billion and change) will depend on how well it does on the economic stuff; because its plan is to set up more "front" companies to run agents abroad, future phony corporate entities like the Deutchland Seismic Sensor and Escort Service will be sourced in agency documents with a word that does not indicate anything to do with "proprietary." I do not include the new code word here because I am not eager to help French counterintelligence.
The key element in many intel estimates is probability. Within the community, the word used for the lowest probability is conceivably. A less-than-50 percent chance draws a possibly, and just over 50 percent a probably. In the 60 to 70 percent range, spooks use likely, and in the 80's it gets to almost certainly. An estimated sure thing is no doubt, a rarity.
One member of the community, not in the Defense Intelligence Agency, defines conceivably this way: "Nobody but D.I.A. believes this, but if we didn't put it in, they wouldn't coordinate, and we figured it wasn't worth the fight because no sane reader would take it seriously."
 
Early Rap Artist
 Hold on to your cigar -- we may have discovered an unexpectedly early rap artist.
This is the sort of find that sends a frisson of delight through the entire Phrasedick Brigade and causes lexicographers the world over to rejigger their computer files.
It concerns the slang verb to rap, which has led to rap session and rap artist. Though the noun rap dates back to Middle English, with meanings ranging from "a sharp blow" to "a rebuke" to the undeserved reputation of "a bum rap," a criminal charge that is sometimes beaten, the slang or colloquial verb is a product of recent black English, especially in the music world. In the Oxford English Dictionary Supplement, the modern noun rap is defined as "a special style of verbal display, repartee. . . . More generally, impromptu dialogue, talk or discussion." The earliest citation in this sense of shooting pyrotechnic breeze is in a 1967 article in the magazine Trans Action.
This sense is rooted, I think, in a more general usage of rap, to mean "to talk freely and frankly." To back up this definition from Merriam-Webster's 10th Collegiate, here is a 1929 citation from Damon Runyon: "I wish Moosh a hello, and he never raps to me but only bows, and takes my hat."
Alistair Cooke, an active member of OLBOM -- On Language's Board of Octogenarian Mentors -- was reading "one of my bed books," presumably one he keeps handy for reading in bed. It was "Churchill at Large," a collection of essays, newspaper articles and other writings by Winston Churchill.
In a piece dated Aug. 5, 1933, Churchill wrote about a Washington dinner party in 1931, at which "after the dinner was over, the whole company formed a half-circle round me . . . and for two hours we wrestled strenuously, unsparingly, but in the best of tempers with each other." In that admixture of controversy and camaraderie, he concluded, "The priceless gift of a common language, and the pervading atmosphere of good sense and fellow [sic] feeling enabled us to rap all the most delicate topics without the slightest offense given or received."
That's it: rap meaning "discuss" in the writing of a master of English letters. "Astonishing in Churchill," notes Cooke. "I never heard it used at all until about 15 years ago, and then from a jazz drummer."
Ah, those elegant Washington dinner parties, where the latest slang was tossed about in the rapt half-circles around an articulate source. Those days went out with Joe Alsop.

HEADLINE: THE RICH: How They're Different;
How They're Different . . . Than They Used to Be

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS; Michael Lewis, who writes The Capitalist column for the Magazine, is working on a book about George Soros.

 BODY:
I've been loitering in the vicinity of rich people for nearly 15 years now, and in that time I have seen and heard a lot of strange things, but nothing as strange as what was related to me during a single brief encounter with the species in the summer of 1982. It was during a picnic in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. I was minding my own business, more or less, when a middle-aged woman appeared and introduced herself as a close relation of Pierre du Pont 5th, with whom I had just graduated from Princeton University. After she asked what I intended to do with my life, and I replied that I had no idea, she explained to me how much more difficult things were for young Pierre. In a surprisingly aggressive tone she ticked off his many achievements: Pierre had graduated with honors, she said; Pierre had "23 job offers"; Pierre was already putting in 14-hour days at some computer company; the company was paying Pierre nearly $30,000 a year. The list was long but somehow failed to include the fact most central to Pierre's existence: the du Pont family fortune recently estimated by Forbes to be at least $10 billion, a large chunk of which he stands to inherit. Clearly, something was amiss. I had no trust fund (or job) and yet there I was having a picnic. Young Pierre was well on his way to inheriting millions, and yet there he was, a veritable human workhorse, enslaved to some dreary corporation for a pittance. The contrast was a clear confirmation of my own lassitude -- but also, I think, a small sign of the shift taking place in the imaginations of the rich: just as new money once sought to obscure itself with the trappings of ancienne noblesse, old money was now shifting its focus to achievement. The antimarket snobbery, the pursuit of useless hobbies, the preference for filigreed personalities over human ramrods, the taste for understatement -- all those qualities that had distinguished du Ponts for more than a century apparently had vanished. Old money was being buffeted not merely economically but culturally. It was uncomfortable in its own skin.
In his marvelous 1988 memoir, "Old Money," Nelson Aldrich revealed, among other things, the then-recent creation of a support group for troubled heirs. The Dough Nuts, as they dubbed themselves, felt ill at ease in the modern world. You could sympathize -- after you heard the gruesome tales about the rich kids who failed to overcome their trust funds. One evening in 1989 a young Mellon found the decal on the back window of his BMW defaced. On top of "The Wharton School" someone had scrawled "Night School" in thick black letters. The villains, as it turned out, were a couple of full-time Wharton students. The worst part was that it was true. A Mellon was attending night school. Life was that harsh.
 MAKING MONEY, ONCE REGARDED AS THE FIRST IN A SERIES of steppingstones to the top of society, now was the only step that really mattered. Even as young Mellon wiped his sticker clean, the new ground rule -- that you had to earn your way to the top of society -- was being reinforced by several related trends:
 * Money is being made faster than ever before. In 1987 Warren Buffett was worth $2.1 billion and Bill Gates $1.25 billion; in eight years Buffett's wealth has more than quintupled to $12 billion and Gates is now worth $15 billion. One year Michael Eisner is an upper-middle-class American; the next he has exercised his Disney stock options and has $200 million in the bank, thus launching him onto the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans. The speed with which wealth is now amassed gives it a magical, rabbit-from-the-hat quality. The rich man has performed a wonderful trick. We applaud him so loudly he wants to do it again.
 * The ultra-rich are growing richer faster than the very rich and the very rich are becoming richer faster than the merely rich. Between 1977 and 1989, the average income of the top 1 percent of American families rose from $323,942 to $576,553 -- even as the incomes of average families remained essentially flat. And the gains among the richest Americans have been even greater. In 1987 a net worth of $225 million landed you on the Forbes list; this year it took $340 million. The yawning and ever-changing gaps enhance the tendency of rich people to compare themselves mostly with other rich people. If the sale of CNN to Time Warner goes through, Ted Turner can gloat that he has gone from being a billion or so dollars behind to being a billion or so dollars ahead of Rupert Murdoch. (It's worth noting that Malcolm Forbes the elder poached the idea for his list, first published in 1982, from Mrs. Astor, of New York and Newport, who judged people by more than their money, and whose social adviser decreed that only 400 could fit into her ballroom comfortably. Fittingly the Forbes list has reduced the complex blue-blood social formula of the Astor 400 to simple, coldblooded accounting.)
 * Partly because of the trend in the raw numbers, there has been an odd shift in the rich man's view of his social role. The source of all fortunes is, of course, profits. Rich men have always romanticized these. The robber barons -- and indeed all American businessmen until about 15 years ago -- arrogated to themselves the prestige of military leaders. Hence the phrase "captain of industry." Beginning in the 80's, however, the controlling metaphor of wealth accumulation changed. The modern rich man -- and those who make huge sums still are, as a rule, men -- is much less likely to imagine himself a military leader, or even a great sports hero. Such images are too sweaty and concrete for a group of people who, less and less, make things and, more and more, earn their money in such intangibles, or barely tangibles, as media, entertainment, investment, finance and computer software.
To the timeless and thorny question, "Daddy, how come you make a billion dollars?" the answer is no longer, "I am an iron-willed leader of men." The answer is, "I am an artist." All the prestige we accord the artist in his quest for originality and authenticity we now grant the businessman in his quest for profits. Saying Warren Buffett is limited because all he can think to do with his $12 billion is to turn it into $20 billion is like saying Picasso is limited because he couldn't think of anything else to do but paint. The rich man's "duty," such as it is, is not to society but to his art, and his art is making money.
 "MUCH OF OLD MONEY'S ESTHETIC," NELSON ALDRICH OBSERVED, "depends on the belief that membership in the class is a gift beyond achievement." But in a society less inclined than ever to credit any gift beyond achievement, the old-money esthetic appears increasingly ridiculous. Sensing this, rich people have been fashioning themselves a new esthetic -- call it the esthetic of windfall gains. Herewith, its salient features:
 INCONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION: The flushing of fortunes down gilded toilets is a lost art. The rich will never entirely escape their acquisitions, of course. But there is nothing in the 1990's, for example, to compare with the consumption of the 1890's, when rich men habitually raised ballroomed palaces of Numidian marble and filled them with dozens of servants and hundreds of oil paintings and thousands of trinkets that made life bearable for the European aristocracy (plus a few luxuries never thought of in Europe, like linen beds for the horses). William K. Vanderbilt, a fairly typical Gilded Age specimen, spent the equivalent today of $365 million to build his Newport "summer cottage," Marble House. Even Andrew Carnegie, who wrote that "the duty of the man of Wealth is first to set an example of modest, unostentatious living, shunning display and extravagance," owned 32,000 acres and a castle in Scotland, and a palace on Fifth Avenue.
The waste value of these homes was further enhanced by their intense discomfort. Next to their cavernous ballrooms, their dark gothic chambers, the chilly dripping of their ormolu-accented fountains, the Metropolitan Museum feels like a cozy place to curl up with a cup of tea. There were reasons the great Newport mansions were closed for nine months of the year and slept in only on weekends by the men who paid for them; the effective cost of sleeping in Marble House came to about $1 million a night, in current dollars. By comparison the $30 million and counting that Bill Gates is dropping on a suburban Seattle residence in which he intends actually to live, and which is often cited as proof of the wild-eyed extravagance of rich people, is a disgrace to the tradition. Gates's stock in Microsoft has been appreciating on average at a rate of $450 million a month. He could build himself a proper home. Why doesn't he?
The answer begins with the collapse in the appeal of European aristocracy. One important purpose of the Newport mansions was to create the illusion of dynasty, and thus to curry favor with old money in general and European old money in particular. As sugar cubes to attract the blue bloods, these places worked wonders. For example, in 1895, according to "To Marry an English Lord," a 1989 book on Anglomania, nine American girls from Newport society married peers of the British realm, most of whom the girls had first met at Newport summer parties. Try to imagine Ted Turner writing a check so that a daughter might marry an English Lord. It's far easier imagining an English Lord writing a fan letter to Ted Turner. Indeed, in the past 20 years one of the surest ways for an Englishman to become a Lord was to mimic this sort of quintessential American tycoon, and more or less buy the title. (Lord Hanson of Hanson Trust, Lord Weinstock of Britain's General Electric Company, Sir James Goldsmith, et al.)
But there is another reason still for the decline in conspicuous waste: anybody can do it! In 1895 big-ticket shopping was a competitive sport, like tennis, open to the few. In 1995, any of the more than 65,000 American families that declare an annual income of $1 million can play. A few years ago, American Express nicely illustrated the nature of this very modern problem. Its first charge card issued in 1958 -- the green card -- was quickly taken up by the rich. It genuinely was exclusive, for a brief moment. Over time, however, the rich were joined by the not-so-rich, and then by the frankly middle class. The company responded by creating the gold card, but this, too, soon was lost to the chest-hair-and-gold-chain crowd. Gold segued into platinum and platinum into the mysterious black card until finally the American Express Company, perhaps sensing its own absurdity, threw in the towel, issued a down-market credit card, Optima, and toned down its noise about prestige.
What was true about a little plastic card is nearly as true even of expensive homes: too many people can afford them. As soon as some bauble acquires sufficient appeal it attracts so many buyers that it loses its cachet and becomes faintly risible. The end result is that the home with all its chattels has lost its grip on the social imagination of the very rich. The only people who behave consistently the way the middle class expect the rich to behave are the middle class. The Old World belief in magnificenza -- in the hoary tradition of spending well that has shaped the landscape of Europe for 600 years -- echoes clearly only in the Visa statements of the Jersey suburbs.
Rich people still afflicted by consumption neuroses are now more likely to obsess about what they do not buy: Warren Buffett, who is worth $12 billion, still lives with great self-consciousness in a house that cost $31,500 in 1958. Back when he was a multibillionaire, Michael Milken never bought anything for himself but more junk bonds. Bill Gates once explained that it did not matter to him if the stock price of Microsoft collapsed, because "I would still eat the same hamburgers." We should be thankful that he eats at all. The wealthier moguls in Hollywood have taken to lunching without food -- just a plate of undressed arugula and a glass of Evian.
 CONSPICUOUS PRODUCTION: When a man becomes rich the best way for him to boost his status is not to give alms to the poor or to acquire a wall full of Roman sarcophagi but to become even richer. Like shopping, leisure has ceded its bragging rights to the middle class. This year's Forbes 400 list confirms that many very rich people also want to be seen to be doing nothing other than making even more money: "No hobbies. 'I work too hard.' " (Steven Anthony Ballmer. Software. $2.9 billion.) " 'I don't do anything but work. I used to play golf. I made a hole in one once, so I quit.' " (Alpheus Lee Ellis. Banking. $490 million.) " 'If you slow down, you really doom yourself.' " (Gordon Earle Moore. Computer chips. $2.8 billion.) Summing it all up: " 'I love America. We've got the only system that works. It keeps everyone hustling.' " (John Richard Simplot. French fries. $2.2 billion.) In this crowd the legendary hours of Bill Gates (72 hours a week) and Michael Milken (at his Drexel desk by 3 A.M.) are unexceptional.
Here is where the American rich have turned for psychic income: production has replaced consumption at the core of the rich man's identity. Production, not consumption, is also the source of a rich man's publicity. Just as crowds once gathered in the streets to witness the unveiling of a new mansion, now the public, in search of revelation, pores over the details of the latest giant deal cobbled together by moneycrats over a pitcher of ice water. The degradation of large corporations through highly publicized mergers or buyouts has replaced the degradation of the Rhode Island coastline through highly publicized construction. As a result, the modern tycoon can focus on what genuinely interests him without having to learn which fork to use, or how to spell Houdon.
But there is a trade-off. The rich man's identity is less diversified than ever before: he is distinguished only by his commercial acumen as measured by his net worth. It is no coincidence that the one hobby many rich people allow themselves -- owning a professional sports franchise -- is dressed up as a successful business.
The need for constant financial success, actual or perceived, has spawned a new form of madness -- the tycoon who is obsessed with his financial image. Warren Buffett, who one would think would have better things to do with his time, sees red when accused in print of underperforming the market averages. (I found out the hard way, by making the embarrassing mistake.) At least a few of the more extravagant corporate buyouts and takeovers of the past decade -- RJR Nabisco, to name one -- gathered steam for no better reason than that a rich man -- Henry Kravis, in this case -- wanted to call attention to his capacity to get richer.
The old-money concern with social reputation has been transformed into a new-money concern for commercial reputation. This extends far beyond the desire for more spending power. Buffett, for instance, probably wouldn't care very much if he lost half his pile in a market crash, as long as everyone else lost more than he did. But if he lagged the market for, say, five years running, even if his pile kept growing, he would suffer an identity crisis. The crowds would cease to turn up at his annual meetings, his old annual reports would go out of print, his hagiographers would turn sour and he'd lose his ability to merge giant corporations on his lunch breaks.
In the rich man's image-grooming the unrich play the role of willing accomplices. Up to the point of bankruptcy or incarceration we regard the rich man and his work as complex beyond our understanding. Beyond understanding, it is also beyond criticism. All highly public business decisions made by rich men are, at the time of the decision, not evaluated on their own terms but widely applauded as strokes of genius. The major business magazines exist in part to whip up this applause (while occasionally stomping on smaller fry to maintain journalistic credibility). When Warren Buffett buys into US Air or Salomon Brothers it's a sign that the firm is undervalued. When the Walt Disney Company agrees to buy Capital Cities/ABC, it is both bold and ingenious because the deal was dreamed up by Michael Eisner and Warren Buffett. This deal met with near-unanimous approval, though the only reason ever given for it was that last refuge of crackpots, "synergy." What this means, in fact, is that ABC, which already was able to buy as much from Disney as it wanted, will now be coerced into taking things it doesn't want. Already everyone has forgotten the disasters that befell Sony and Matsushita when, governed by the same logic, they bought Columbia and MCA.
 HE ILLUSION OF INDEPENDENCE: The rich man is ever less entwined in the society that has made him wealthy. Unlike the captain of industry, the modern artist is a loner. His prestige does not depend much on giving away money (the ungiving Buffett is maybe the country's most-highly-thought-of rich man), or on marrying his daughter off well, or in draping his wife in furs and jewels. He derives status from his marriage only insofar as he monopolizes the childbearing years of a series of women much younger than himself. A timely divorce, for example, may actually raise his status in the eyes of his adoring public: his creative juices are flowing again! Thus the price for women's liberation was paid in part by the women at the top of society, who, with a couple of notable exceptions, now enjoy less control than ever over the lives of their husbands. The Gilded Age party in which the men were required to make fools of themselves for the amusement of the women -- dining on horseback, dressing up as Roman orators -- is a thing of the past. So, increasingly, is the giant trust fund. The rich man's conviction that achievement is all often outweighs his desire to see his children spend his money. On the rare occasions when Warren Buffett was willing to lend his kids money, he required them to sign loan agreements. The centi-millionaire Ronnie Chan has been quoted in Forbes saying, "I told my kids early on: you're not going to get a dime."This echoes sentiments heartfelt by many rich men today.
Not surprisingly, then, the rich man's empathy for the unrich has diminished. Or, since it was never very great, perhaps it is more true to say that the pretense of compassion for life's losers is no longer as fashionable as it once was. What we have lost in civility we have gained in honesty. Rich people used to shield themselves from the pleas of the unrich with social-class pretensions. Their chief defense these days is their keen sense of personal accomplishment. From this follows their righteous indignation toward the claims of the unrich: you can't give money to anyone you don't respect, and you can't respect anyone who doesn't make money.
The conundrum has led to an odd development: alms for the rich. When David Geffen buys and temporarily buries his friend Calvin Klein's junk bonds, or Ted Turner earmarks a $50 million tip for his friend Michael Milken as a way of thanking him for his role in Time Warner's planned purchase of Turner Broadcasting, we are witnessing a strange permutation of noblesse oblige. Rich men have always loved to impress other rich men, but these gestures seem fueled by something deeper than the desire to impress. They are a form of atonement. We have arrived at a point where the rich man disposes of his social responsibility by giving $50 million of other people's money to another rich man who has fallen on hard times. (According to Forbes, Milken is worth only about $500 million today, down from about $2 billion a few years ago.)
Cut loose from society the rich man can play his chosen role free of guilt and responsibility. He becomes that great figure of American mythology -- the roaming frontiersman. These days the man who has made a fortune is likely to spend more on his means of transportation than on his home: the private jet is the possession that most distinguishes him from the rest of us. The jet facilitates his favorite male ritual -- gathering in out-of-the-way places with other rich men. With his jet, he can go anywhere he wants when he wants and, more important, leave.
The old aristocratic conceit of place has given way to a glorious placelessness. There was a time when the next step for the man who made his fortune mining gold in Colorado was to build a house on Fifth Avenue and pretend he had always lived in it. The East offered the rich man his places -- in Newport and Charleston and New York. Now he goes West, to the last nonplaces in America. He builds a ranch in the remote Wyoming desert or the Montana grasslands or the Colorado steppes -- someplace far away from the society he has mastered. On his ranch he experiences Shane-like surges of rugged individualism -- but without actually being alone. For other rich men have come before him, and other rich men are there to keep score of what he has made, and still other rich men are sure to follow -- to reassure one another that they are, in fact, different.

GRAPHIC: Photos: TWENTY-FOUR HOURS INTHE LIFE OF THE NEW RICH MAN -- At 8:30 A.M. on a recent Monday, Mahboud Zebetian, 29, had breakfast with Polo, his Russian wolfhound. (He's between girlfriends just now.) By 9:30 , he was in the office of AG Group, the software company in Walnut Creek, Calif., he co-founded in 1990. Eleven o'clock found Zabetian, as it often does, on nearby Mount Diablo, doing some laptop programming while waiting for the wind to pick up so he could paraglide. At 1:30, Zabetian showed AG's newest product, Net Meter, to the editors of Mac User magazine. (pgs. 66 & 67); At 5:45, Zabetian was looking for a seat at Bill Bradley speech in San Francisco. By 8:45, he was finishing dinner at Mel's Diner before getting back to the office by 9:30, staying until 2 A.M. In the early days of AG, it wasn't unusual for Zabetian and his partner to work around the clock. It paid off: Ether Peek, their network management program, put AG on the map, and the company is now worth about $10 million. And Zabetian, an Iranian expatriate, now has a little more time on his hands. By 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, he was finishing off his hourlong bike workout, ready for another day.

HEADLINE: THE RICH;
Why Their World Might Crumble

BYLINE: By LESTER THUROW; Lester Thurow is a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

 BODY:
The year 1968 was among the worst years this century for the United States -- assassinations, riots, campus uprisings and the infamous Democratic National Convention in Chicago. But an event that attracted little or no attention at the time may ultimately prove to have the most lasting and destabilizing effects of all. Suddenly that year, like a surge in a long immobile glacier, economic inequality started to rise.
Among men working full time -- the group most sharply affected -- inequalities in earnings between the top 20 percent of wage earners and the bottom 20 percent doubled in the next two and a half decades. By 1973, the median wage for all men working full time began to fall. 
 Over the next 20 years, men's earnings fell 11 percent, from $34,048 to $30,407, even though the earnings of the top 20 percent grew steadily and the real, per-capita gross domestic product (G.D.P.) rose 29 percent.
Within the family, American women came to the rescue of American men. Mostly by working many more hours per year, women kept median household incomes slowly rising until 1989. In 1989, however, median real wages for women working full time year-round also began to fall. Preliminary data for 1994 and early 1995 indicate that these wage declines are accelerating. As a result, since 1989 median household incomes have fallen more than 7 percent after correcting for inflation and family size, to $31,241 in 1993, from $33,585. Already working full time, women had no more extra hours of work effort to contribute to the family's income.
The same sharp rise in inequality has occurred in the distribution of wealth. The share of total net worth of the top one-half of 1 percent of the population rose from 26 to 31 percent in just six years, between 1983 and 1989. By the early 1990's the share of wealth (more than 40 percent) held by the top 1 percent of the population was essentially double what it had been in the mid-1970's and back to where it was in the late 1920's, before the introduction of progressive taxation.
These are uncharted waters for American democracy. Since accurate data have been kept, beginning in 1929, America has never experienced falling real wages for a majority of its work force while its per-capita G.D.P. was rising. In effect, we are conducting an enormous social and political experiment -- something like putting a pressure cooker on the stove over a full flame and waiting to see how long it takes to explode.
 BEHIND THESE CHANGES LIE TECHNOLOGIcal shifts that demand a more skilled work force, competition from lower-paid but well-educated workers in the rest of the world and two decades of Federal Reserve Board policies of creating unemployment to fight inflation. There also has been a big shift in the implicit contract between owners and workers.
After World War II, white-collar workers and managers came to expect lifetime employment with rising wages, assuming their firms remained profitable. Blue-collar workers, who also expected and received real annual-wage increases, did face the prospect of occasional layoffs. But these were restricted mostly to younger workers, who could expect to be recalled in the next boom. This implicit contract has been smashed by companies with high and rising profits that are nevertheless reducing wages, eliminating fringe benefits and permanently laying off hundreds of thousands of workers from what had been society's best jobs.
The middle class is scared, and it should be. The supports for its economic security are being kicked out from under it. The remedy must include a huge program of re-educating and retraining the bottom 60 percent of the work force, investments in research and high-tech infrastructure and a willingness to run the economy with tight labor markets so that labor shortages push wages upward. But it takes organization to do that, and it's not clear that America has the will to get organized to solve its problems.
Historically, some very successful societies have existed for millennia with enormous inequalities of wealth and income -- ancient Egypt, imperial Rome, classical China, the Incas, the Aztecs. But all these societies had political and social ideologies that fit this economic reality. None believed in equality in any sense -- not theoretically, not politically, not socially, not economically. Democracies have a problem with rising economic inequality precisely because they believe in political equality -- "one person, one vote."
One solution to this divergent distribution of power is to drive out the economically weak. A 19th-century economist, Herbert Spencer, introduced the idea of "survival of the fittest" capitalism, a phrase that Charles Darwin appropriated to explain evolution. Spencer believed that it was the duty of the economically strong to drive the economically weak into extinction; that drive was in fact the secret of capitalism's strength.
Until recently, Spencer's suggested solution was roundly rejected, and democratic governments systematically worked to reduce earnings and wealth inequalities. A state-financed safety net protected the weak (the old, the sick, the unemployed, the poor) from economic extinction. Social investments in education, infrastructure and research and development helped raise the earning power of the middle class. The capitalist's power to exploit his work force was legally limited, and a combination of social and legal pressures insured that rising output was shared with the work force.
The Republicans' balanced-budget plan essentially offers a return to Spencer's survival-of-the-fittest capitalism. It raises taxes on working Americans and lowers them for the wealthy. It shreds the safety net, apparently on the theory that individuals facing starvation will knuckle down and work. Fear will make them hold on so tightly to the economic trapeze that they won't fall off.
No one has ever tried survival-of-the-fittest capitalism for any extended period in a modern democracy, so we don't know how far rising inequality and falling real wages can go before something snaps. Social systems can certainly snap; the recent implosion of the Soviet Union is a good example. But to snap, there must be some alternative banner under which the population can quickly regroup. In the case of Communism, that alternative banner was capitalism. But if capitalism does not produce acceptable results, there simply isn't any alternative system under which the people can quickly regroup. As a result, a sudden social collapse is highly unlikely.
What is more likely is a vicious cycle of individual disaffection, social disorganization, falling incomes and a slow downward spiral, something like the long slide from the peak of the Roman Empire to the bottom of the Middle Ages. There were those in the Middle Ages, for example, who knew everything the Romans knew about fertilizing crops. What later Europeans lost was the ability to get organized to fertilize. Without fertilization, crop yields fell so far that the best land yielded only three pieces of grain for each one that was planted. Put aside one seed to plant next year, subtract seeds eaten or spoiled by vermin and there is very little left to sustain life through the winter. There simply were not enough calories available to sustain vigorous activity, and the quality of life inevitably declined.
Today we are refusing to make the investments in the modern equivalents of fertilization -- education, infrastructure, research and development. Public spending on infrastructure, as a percentage of G.D.P., has been cut in half in the last two decades and is scheduled to be reduced even further by Washington's budget cutters.
Rome's downward spiral did not begin with an external defeat. It began with a period of uncertainty and disorientation. Further military expansion no longer made sense, since Rome was at its natural geographic limits and facing empty deserts, steppes and forests. Our equivalent is the disorientation that came at the end of the cold war. The enemy was gone, yet defense budgets had to be maintained.
Rome was faced with huge numbers of immigrants who wanted to attain the higher standard of living they saw before them. But Rome had lost the ability to make them into Romans. Perhaps Proposition 187 in California means that America has also lost that ability.
Literacy, widespread in the Roman Empire, was restricted to a few cloistered monks in the depths of the Middle Ages. Today functional illiteracy is on the rise even amid a sharp escalation in the educational requirements for productive workers.
During the medieval era, banditry became widespread and was widely accepted (remember Robin Hood) as a populist revenge upon the defenders of the political and social order. Unwalled cities and free citizens were replaced by walled manor houses and serfs. Walled and gated communities are once again on the rise. Twenty-eight million Americans live in such communities, if one counts privately guarded apartment houses, and the number is expected to double in the next decade.
No one can know what will happen if inequality continues to rise and a large majority of our families experience falling real incomes. But if capitalism does not deliver rising real wages in a period when the total economic pie is expanding, its hold on the political allegiance of the population will be threatened. Similarly, if the democratic political process cannot reverse the trend to inequality, democracy will eventually be discredited. What we do know is that a large group of hostile voters who draw no benefits from the economic system and don't think the government cares is not a particularly promising recipe for economic or political success.

Arena Rock Loses One Voice and Gains Another

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
THE VOICE IS BIG AND GUTSY, with strength behind its rasp. It aches and it exults; it pleads, and it accuses. Behind it, the band sounds muscular and polished, with power chords chiming atop a big unswerving beat, propulsive but unhurried. Within the new songs are traces of old ones, half-remembered hits from the days of Phil Spector and Roy Orbison and the early British Invasion, evoking an unbroken rock heritage.
A decade ago, that could have described the music of Bruce Springsteen. But Springsteen has pulled back from his old, heroic sound; his new album, "The Ghost of Tom Joad" (Columbia), broods quietly over unemployment, frustration and short, wasted lives. In some ways, it's like a hi-fi, West Coast sequel to "Nebraska," the homemade album he released in 1982 between the grander statements of "The River" and "Born in the U.S.A." It's also where his award-winning, AIDS-haunted "Streets of Philadelphia" has led, to a territory of sober rumination and chronic bummers. 
 Yet many listeners rely on music to stoke a sense of hope, and the sound Springsteen and others honed was too uplifting to discard. The triumphal tone of Springsteen's old songs has been taken up by younger performers like Counting Crows, Hootie and the Blowfish and, most dramatically, Melissa Etheridge, whose new album, "Your Little Secret" (Island), follows her five-million-selling "Yes I Am" with more of the confident blare of mid-1980's rock.
It's not a revival but a continuation of the arena-filling sound of the era, which backs up unironic earnestness with ringing major chords and proclaims it in singing that grows more vehement with every verse. In the 1980's, songwriters often tied their fervor to causes or characters, like the troubled narrators in Springsteen's "Hungry Heart" or "Born in the U.S.A." In the 1990's, however, people belt for their own romance, and the search for love becomes an all-consuming quest. "I want to lose all your demons and go," Etheridge sings. "I want to tear off your chains 'cause I know."
Etheridge has entered a zone of rock that was briefly neglected, that of the arena anthem. While early-1990's rock bands turned to the self-lacerating introspection of grunge or the self-mocking frenzy of punk, Etheridge sang for people whose main anxiety came from unrequited love.
Grunge and punk reveal a crisis of masculinity for intelligent rockers, who can no longer take for granted the sense of dominance that used to come with maleness and a loud guitar. (The raw misogyny of so much hip-hop faces male insecurity with an exaggerated reaction in the opposite direction.) But the old rock swagger was up for grabs by a woman, and Etheridge grabbed it. Tina Turner and Joan Jett may be among her models, but so are male rockers: Springsteen, Rod Stewart, Bob Seger, Bryan Adams and, on the new album, U2.
Etheridge and her co-producer, Hugh Padgham, have outdone their previous collaboration on "Yes I Am." Etheridge's newer songs are more spacious and more memorable, with arrangements that hold her voice in reserve and then let her break through with redoubled urgency. And she homes in on the topic that makes her fans shout along: the way passion conquers reason. "To hell with the consequence," she insists in "I Want to Come Over," "You told me you love me."
"Yes I Am" was tied to Etheridge's strummed acoustic guitar, keeping her close to the Midwestern rock of John Mellencamp. "Your Little Secret" features Mellencamp's brilliant drummer, Kenny Aronoff, and the album's first single, the title song, picks up Mellencamp's Rolling-Stones-in-Indiana guitar crunch. But the album continually looks over its shoulder at Springsteen -- not his storytelling, but his music.
Etheridge and Padgham have studied the way Springsteen and his producer, Chuck Plotkin, use sustained keyboard chords as unobtrusive cushions. Songs take up Springsteen's marching tempos: the Phil Spector beat in "I Want to Come Over," the expansive acoustic-guitar march in "All the Way to Heaven" and the thoughtful keyboard march in "Nowhere to Go," which also borrows guitar from U2's "With or Without You." U2's resolute pace and resonant guitars reappear in "This War Is Over," as Etheridge sings, "Melt all the chains in my soul."
After "Yes I Am" was released, Etheridge acknowledged that she is a lesbian, but in her songs the object of desire remains "you," with no description to restrict anybody's fantasy. She does sometimes drop a geographical detail, like "the muddy waters of the mighty Mo" (presumably the Missouri River) in "Nowhere to Go."
But Etheridge labors to stay generic, setting herself up as a middle-American Everygal, with details out of Gap ads. "Just my jeans and my T-shirt and my blue Chevrolet," she sings in "Nowhere to Go." Staying up-to-date, two songs bring up tattoos.
Etheridge also refers indirectly to her new status as rock's most popular acknowledged lesbian. Under its cliches and its melodramatic buildup, "I Could Have Been You" replies to those who condemn homosexuals for choosing an immoral orientation: "A path I didn't choose," Etheridge insists, adding, "With hate you justify your crime/ A crime compassion can erase." And in "Shriner's Park," another slow-building march, the inevitable pronoun is "you," but the scenario could easily be the story of teen-age lesbian trysts with a girlfriend who decided to stay straight.
Most of "Your Little Secret" sticks with common situations -- temptation and seduction, cheating and losing -- and Etheridge hurls herself into them, capturing obsession and infatuation in songs like "An Unusual Kiss" and "I Want to Come Over." Her songs don't withdraw into desire; they make desire fill the whole world.
But only in pop songs can people live exclusively for passion. Even when he was helping invent the arena anthem, Springsteen rarely devoted the style to simple love songs. He saw not just potential lovers but friendships, jobs, families. As he matured, he lost adolescent visions of heroic romance and started to consider how adults make it through everyday life.
ON "The Ghost of Tom Joad," he never raises his voice; he sings as if he's humbled by what he knows. He gently picks his acoustic guitar; keyboards and whispering drums waft in behind him, as the tunes rise a few notes, then fall to earth.
It's Springsteen in Woody Guthrie mode, setting stories from newspaper articles and thinking about justice for the downtrodden. The title song, named after a character in John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath," vows that Tom Joad's ghost will appear "wherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand/ Or a decent job or a helpin' hand." A few other songs also point fingers: "Sir you tell me the world's changed," a furnace worker sings in "Youngstown." "Once I made you rich enough/ Rich enough to forget my name." But only a few songs are heavy-handed. In most of them, Springsteen doesn't find lessons as Guthrie would; he just tells another tale of someone up against the insurmountable.
The songs are about hobos, ex-convicts and small-town bank robbers, as well as people new to Springsteen songs: immigrants from Mexico and Vietnam, contracting AIDS as hustlers or watching their shrimp boats burn. After a night with the woman he loves, a man in "Dry Lightning" is told, "Ain't nobody can give nobody what they really need anyway."
There's not much hope, but Springsteen sees the glimmer that makes people keep trying. Amid the dead-end stories, there's an anthem tucked on to the album: "Across the Border" is the prayer and vow of a man planning to migrate with his lover: "I know love and fortune will be mine." Like the singer, we know they'll have to worry about more than the next night's rendezvous; along with the music, we're pulling for them anyway.

An Art Tour Comes Home, Its Fortune Made

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE Hausder Kunst had ever stayed open all night. Then again, it was also the first time a museum show in Munich had drawn more than 400,000 people. The exhibition, "From Cezanne to Matisse: Great French Paintings From the Barnes Foundation," was on the last day of its last stop on a two-and-a-half-year international tour. Christoph Vitali, director of the Haus der Kunst, had decided that keeping the museum open for 24 hours would let art lovers make one final "meditative visit" to see the famous Cezannes and Matisses, Renoirs and Manets without the crowds that had swarmed around the museum's galleries since the show opened on June 23.
But in the early morning hours of this "long night of art," on Oct. 22, the museum was packed. Couples in black tie, straight from the opera, bumped into red-haired punkers. Guards had trouble keeping visitors from getting too close to the paintings. 
 The response in Munich was hardly atypical. Everywhere the Barnes collection traveled -- not only Munich but Washington, Paris, Tokyo, Fort Worth, Toronto and Philadelphia -- it set records of one sort or another and got mostly favorable reviews. About five million visitors saw the show, and many bought Barnes memorabilia in the form of posters, postcards, catalogues, tote bags, scarfs, CD-ROM's and key chains with images of the paintings, filling the coffers of each institution. The show also brought in more than $17 million in rental fees for the Barnes Foundation.
As traveling shows go, the Barnes exhibition was one of the most successful in museum history, ranking just behind "The Treasures of Tutankhamen," a seven-city United States tour that drew more than eight million people between November 1976 and September 1979. Why did the Barnes work so well? "Besides the large number of exceptional paintings by popular artists, the number of paintings -- 80 -- was just right," said Glenn D. Lowry, who was director of the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto at the time of the show. "Not too many to overwhelm visitors, not too few."
The show also had a built-in curiosity factor. "It got the reputation for being the girl you can't have," said J. Carter Brown, director emeritus of the National Gallery in Washington. "The mystery of seeing these hidden treasures, major masterpieces by major artists that would never been shown outside Pennsylvania again, gave it serious news value." In addition, people were curious to see what this little-known millionaire collector had chosen to buy.
For all of its success, it was a show that almost didn't happen, because of the eccentric nature of the Barnes Foundation itself. The foundation was established in 1922 by Albert C. Barnes, a trained physician and manufacturer of patent medicines, to house and manage his exceptional art collection.
Dr. Barnes had amassed about 800 paintings and 200 sculptures, including some 170 Renoirs, 55 Cezannes and 20 Picassos, which he liked to display in crowded, quirky arrangements that included Gothic hardware, African sculpture, furniture and porcelains. His stated mission was to educate students in the art of viewing art. The collection was open by appointment only. Only in 1961, a decade after Dr. Barnes died and after the foundation's tax-exempt status had been challenged in court, were its galleries opened to the public on a limited basis.
TO GET THE SHOW ON THE road, Richard H. Glanton, the director of the foundation, spent months in court to break the foundation's charter, which stipulated that no picture could ever be lent, sold or otherwise disposed of. So strict were the mandates that color photographs of the collection were never distributed outside the foundation. The international tour, along with its lavish 318-page color catalogue, was a big step forward.
Barnes loyalists argued that taking a portion of the collection on tour would destroy the intentionally reclusive nature of the institution. But the board of directors needed money to keep the Barnes afloat and save its decaying building in Merion, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb. "We had a situation that was so bad that if we didn't raise money touring the art, we would have had to pursue alternatives like deaccessioning some of the collection," Mr. Glanton said.
The tour changed all that. It allowed the foundation to give the 1925 building a $12 million face lift overseen by Robert Venturi, the Philadelphia architect whose acclaimed museum projects include the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London. The rest of the money, Mr. Glanton said, will go into the foundation's endowment and operating costs. (The building reopened to the public on Thursday.)
The decision to offer an international exhibition was a fairly benign solution compared with Mr. Glanton's first scheme. In 1991, he announced that the foundation was asking the court's permission to sell at least 15 paintings from the collection. The proposal caused an uproar in the art community, and the foundation backed down.
Walter H. Annenberg, the billionaire collector and then a member of the foundation's advisory committee, came up with the idea of a tour. Francoise Cachin, who was then the director of the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, said she had had the same thought. "When we heard about the idea of selling part of the collection, we were shocked," she said. "A tour was a better and rather obvious way of raising money. "
When the National Gallery in Washington heard the idea, it got into the act, too, saying it wanted the show first. And so the National Gallery and the Musee d'Orsay agreed to work together. The National Gallery was the only museum to get the show at no cost; other museums were charged from $750,000 to $4.5 million -- because it acted as a consultant to the foundation on restoration, shipping and other important details. And it charged no entrance fee. The show opened with fanfare in Washington on May 2, 1993, and ranked among the top 10 shows for attendance in the gallery's history, attracting 521,000 visitors during its 106-day run.
The Royal Academy of Art in London and the Palazzo Grassi in Venice clamored to get the show. But it had limited time to travel, and not every museum could raise the necessary fee. The only institution that turned down the show was the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Barnes wanted $2 million to take it there.
"Turning it down was an easy decision to make," said Philippe de Montebello, the Metropolitan's director. "It didn't seem worth it when Philadelphia is only one hour away." But a bigger reason, Mr. de Montebello said, was that the Metropolitan no longer charges separate entrance fees for special exhibitions and had no hope of recovering its expenses. "Most museums made money from the gate," he said. "But we have no gate."
For many of the smaller institutions, however, like the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the show was a great prize. Additional visitors yielded new museum memberships, and marketing studies released after the exhibition had closed showed that it had also boosted regional economies with revenues from hotels, restaurants and entertainment.
REPEAT BUSINESS WAS reported everywhere. In Philadelphia, even though the Barnes Foundation is just 15 minutes away, the show broke all attendance records. "To some degree we were preaching to the converted," said Anne d'Harnoncourt, director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. "Many of the visitors who kept coming back were from the greater Philadelphia area. They knew about the Barnes but had never been there."
At the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo, visitors waited two to three hours to see the show. "The Japanese people love Impressionist art, and they knew about the great success of this show in Washington and Paris," said Ichiro Suyama, who is in charge of cultural affairs for Yomiuri Shimbun, the Japanese newspaper that sponsored the show there. "We advertised it heavily, so the public was well aware that this was the only chance they would ever have to see these paintings in Japan."
Public fascination with Barnes as a personality also helped. "It was that highly potent mix of an eccentric man and his art that captured the public's imagination," said Mr. Lowry, who is now director of the Museum of Modern Art. Wherever it went, the show became a kind of international public relations campaign for the foundation. "The name Dr. Barnes was not exactly a household word," said Edmund P. Pillsbury, director of the Kimbell. "But now he's known worldwide. And now Philadelphia has an international landmark."

 CORRECTION:
 An article on Dec. 14 about a judge's decision to let the, Barnes, Foundation move its art holdings from Merion, Pa., to Philadelphia misstated the number of works by Renoir, Cezanne and ,Picasso, in the collection. (Several articles since 1991 have also variously misstated those figures as ,well as the number of works by Matisse.) There are 181 Renoirs, not ,170;, 69 ,Cezannes, not ,55;, and 46 ,Picassos,, not ,20., There are 59 Matisses, not 60. An e-mail message from a reader last week pointed out the errors.

HEADLINE: CHOICE TABLES;
Chefs Who Dare To Be British

BYLINE: By CATHARINE REYNOLDS; CATHARINE REYNOLDS lives in London.

 BODY:
FOR many Americans the very term "British food" conjures visions of groaning boards laden with roast beef, vegetables steamed to a pulp, and cholesterol-freighted Yorkshire pudding. Visitors to today's London need no longer be sentenced to such Dickensian fare. Like Londoners, they can explore what for lack of a better term is called modern British cookery.
The term is literally a portmanteau phrase, having arrived in the baggage of Odyssean British chefs eager to ally their traditional larder with the sharp, fresh seasonings and exotic (and quicker) cooking methods they encountered abroad. This new crop now runs a variety of restaurants where the atmospheres differ dramatically but the food, however eclectic in its inspiration, is distinctly British.
 
The Square 
 Tall, dark-haired Philip Howard, one of modern British cookery's leading practitioners, holds sway here. Mr. Howard, who abandoned microbiology to work under the Roux brothers as well as homegrown talents such as Simon Hopkinson and Marco Pierre White, has been packing the vellum-colored room off fashionable St. James's Square twice daily since 1991. Heavy hitters from corporations with headquarters nearby together with art people from Christie's and Spink's across the street call well in advance to book the 65 magenta and midnight-blue chairs at the discreetly spaced tables. The dining room is screened from the street by variegated ivy topiary and dangling metal spirals charitably described as gypsy earrings gone wrong -- perhaps the only overstated feature of the minimalist decor.
The royal-blue menu, changed monthly, explains the attractions: from among the eight first courses, we selected the seared tuna with a tartare of vegetables and soy-wilted greens and a warm salad of game and chestnuts. The first highlighted Mr. Howard's penchant for sweet-and-sour pairings, whereas the second, with its accompaniment of crisp-fried vegetables, showcased his grasp of textural counterpoint. Both were sensational.
At the Square, garnishes are not an aside. Rich and rare main-course venison came with significant (and wonderful) mashed potatoes and caramelized onions. Firm-fleshed roasted sea bass kept company with an unctuous sweet-onion risotto and wild mushrooms. Each element was exemplary, but the sum of the parts provided ample evidence for the Michelin star the restaurant received in 1994.
Most of the Square's desserts are fruit-based. My sublime Pithiviers' tender pastry layers enclosed prune puree knowingly dosed with Armagnac. Even the simplest sable of raspberries boasts pluperfect short pastry.
The cellar is in every way worthy of the kitchen. Diners benefit from the palate of the principal owner, Nigel Platts-Martin, which is so discerning that wine critics such as Hugh Johnson and Serena Sutcliffe are regularly seen there. They may opt to trawl the 19-page wine list for Raveneau's Chablis Premier Cru Butteaux '92 ($76 a bottle; prices at $1.65 to the pound) or Alain Brumont's Madiran Cuvee Prestige '89, a red from southwest France ($64), under the guidance of Emmanuel Hardoniere, one of London's most charming sommeliers, or choose from the Square's dozen selected French wines (some available by the glass at $4.80 to $8).
 
The Canteen
This restaurant delivers mod British food in quite a different atmosphere. If its Hollywood-on-Thames glamour stems largely from the presence of Michael Caine, a part owner, and his actor friends, the good food originated under the guidance of the bad boy of English cooking, Marco Pierre White. Since garnering three Michelin stars for his new restaurant in the Hyde Park Hotel, Mr. White has relinquished control at the Canteen to Tim Powell and his team. Apprenticed in France and the United States as well as in Britain, Mr. Powell smilingly allows that he is "married to the place."
Dark velvet curtains and a witty playing-card theme set against the backdrop of a marina on the Thames trumps the soullessness of the restaurant's location in a residential-retail development in the farther reaches of Fulham. At lunch, daylight floods the conservatory windows even on winter's dimmest days, though perhaps only half the 140 places are filled because of the restaurant's less than central location. By nightfall reservations are at a premium, stretching the reservation manager's diplomacy to its limits.
As its name suggests, the Canteen is dedicated to keeping good food within the reach of most pockets. All 12 first courses are priced at just over $11. Their inspirations girdle the globe. If the risotto I had recently was less al dente than I would have expected in Italy, its flavor did not disappoint, a felicitous medley of sea scallops with diced tomato, sweet red peppers and chives. A crisp spring roll enclosed succulent Dorset crab, made sprightly with ginger and scallion.
Tim Powell is gradually adding his signature dishes to the house favorites. His autumnal pappardelle with earthy field mushrooms and fragrant truffle oil is at once a credit to its Italian antecedents and its creator's Bedfordshire roots.
All but one of the dozen main courses cost just over $19, whether diners choose the roasted rabbit with grain mustard sauce, garnished with garlic and young leeks; roasted chicken with celery heart, or the pink saddle of lamb with garlic confit. I found the fennel and watercress salad and warm aioli dressing accompanying my halibut a subtle triumph, the peppery cress enriching the fish without overwhelming the fennel. My dinner partner's grilled tuna on a croustade of piperade topped with balsamic-dressed curly endive was as delectable as it was stunning. The wine list stands at a hundred entries; we were more than happy with a half bottle of St.-Veran, a light white Burgundy ($19.20).
The deep, sharp lemon tart of Alain Ronez, the patissier, and his pear Tatin (upside-down pear tart) have become much-imitated but rarely equaled London classics -- still another reason why people hang out at the Canteen.
 
The Brackenbury
One of the most engaging exponents of modern British cookery, Adam Robinson, set out in mid-recession to run a neighborhood wine bar with his wife, Katie. They chose an unglitzy West London neighborhood, and soon eaters in the know were beating a track down the Goldhawk Road to the Brackenbury's door.
They do not come for the comforts. Narrow, thinly padded pews pass for banquettes, tables are snugly juxtaposed and noise levels can be high. Good-natured service, general conviviality and gentle prices entice, but it is the food that keeps people clamoring for the 55 seats in the Brackenbury's two terra-cotta-painted dining rooms.
Adam Robinson, a dropout philosophy student, began his catering career waiting on tables in a Soho restaurant. He persuaded the chef, Alastair Little, to let him help out in the kitchen, and was captivated.
Today his considered creations captivate guests. The lunch and dinner menus change daily. Several weeks ago we began Sunday lunch with a warm salad of snappy leeks and artichokes combined with Serrano ham and boiled baby potatoes; a deep-flavored seafood soup with piquant rouille, and a terrine of chicken layered with bacon, accentuated by house-made chutney.
We went on to tagliatelle rich with a hare sauce that surpassed any I've ever tasted in Tuscany. The cepe tart was a credit to "the mushroom lady" who supplies the restaurant direct, and the classic roasted saddle of lamb with mint and firm-roasted vegetables rehabilitate the classic English Sunday lunch.
Out of curiosity, I ordered lemon verbena jelly with clotted cream ice cream and madeleines, and stumbled on a made-in-heaven alliance of textures and tastes. Jo Corrigan, the pastry chef, topped the chocolate ice cream with witty twists of long langues de chat cookies. Even the abstainer among us plumped for zesty lemon and mint granita spiked with a sparkling cava from Catalonia.
Like all chefs in this league, Mr. Robinson takes pains with his produce: lamb, rabbit and pigeon from Wales, gray mullet, sea bass and Dover sole from the coast at Maldon, and tomatoes and herbs from Kent. The menu states that the Brackenbury eschews French produce when possible in a gesture against the Chirac Government's nuclear tests.
Katie Robinson's stepfather was chairman of one of Britain's leading wine merchants, and her list of 25-plus good-value vintages available by the glass currently includes fine Casal di Serra Verdicchio Classico from Umani Ronchi '94 ($4.15 a glass) and a well-made red Gisborne Merlot '94 from New Zealand ($5.45).
 
Museum Street Cafe
Modern British cuisine is a broad church, welcoming talent and influences from everywhere. At the Museum Street Cafe, Mark Nathan, a Londoner, teamed up six years ago with Gail Koerber, a Bostonian who moved to London after training in Providence, R.I.
Slipping in the door of the 18th-century town house only a block from the British Museum, diners are struck by the Spartan white simplicity and narrow scale. The focus is on the shiny stainless-steel kitchen, which runs most of the length of one wall, leaving room for just 33 seats, most with a ringside view from which to watch nimble Mr. Nathan at his grill and Ms. Koerber coolly whipping wonders from her oven. The occasional presence of Frank, Ms. Koerber's Dandie Dinmont terrier, tethered outside the kitchen, emphasizes the congeniality of the place.
The Cafe's brief, changing menus run to two starters and five main courses at lunch and three of each course at dinner. But then caramelized onion soup with Stilton is so comforting, so perfectly in sync on a damp, gray day, warm goat cheese salad with roasted beets and yellow tomatoes so cheering, who needs more choice?
Recent offerings, generally timed to the nanosecond, have included red snapper dressed with top-quality olive oil, corn-fed chicken with tomato relish, and leg of lamb with rosemary-infused oil. Dishes are not restricted to the grill, witness a gently sauteed duck breast with a mellow port sauce studded with green peppercorns. Crisp yet tender-hearted smoked haddock fish cakes are a near-fixture on the lunch menu. The daily vegetarian alternative bears consideration, especially if it includes Ms. Koerber's ethereal pastry. About a month ago, I devoured the mushroom and dill tartlet, pursuing each flake across the plate as I sipped the excellent Australian Ryecroft Flametrees Chardonnay '93 ($4.65 a glass).
This is no place to resist dessert -- Valhrona chocolate cake, typically English apple and blackberry crisp or whatever else Ms. Koerber has dreamed up that day. And in a city where cheese is increasingly neglected, the Museum Street Cafe features excellent specimens from Neal's Yard Dairy. Like the owners and their obliging staff, the wine list, with its 21 entries, is a happy blend of new and old worlds. The top price is $44.80. Those bent on grander vintages can bring their own, paying only $6.40 corkage.
 
Andrew Edmunds
English understatement delights us all, but what about a restaurant with no sign of a name on its facade? Welcome to Andrew Edmunds, at 46 Lexington Street, and don't look for your lunch at the print shop of the same name next door. Both are owned by the eponymous Mr. Edmunds. The prints came first, which is not to suggest that good wine and food are any less dear to this shy, gentle man. When the managers of the wine bar in the neighboring shop were unable to keep their accounts straight, Mr. Edmunds intervened.
Ten years later, hearty amateurism remains the hallmark and fascination of the restaurant. The chef, Paul Croal, is Irish, but he understands the articulated, strong flavors favored by Mr. Edmunds and the literati who make this place their headquarters. The ground-floor and basement dining rooms are oatmeal (upstairs) and dark green (downstairs) and shabby chic, hung with the odd 18th-century political caricature.
Not too long ago I settled down at a flower-decked table to red pepper and tomato soup as a warmup for a lamb tagine with couscous sparked with prunes that proved outstanding. A large glass of Ochoa '92 ($6.15), a dry Spanish red, stood up to the bold spicing. My companion rapidly reduced his red mullet with white beans and tomato salsa to bones, leaving me with morsels. He was only marginally more generous with his rich chocolate mousse cake and made serious inroads into my luscious pear crumble.
Both of us will hasten back this winter to savor game, or the duck confit and cassoulet for which the house is known, perhaps splurging on a bottle of Antinori's sumptuous red Sassicaia '85 -- great value at $104. The low markup on wines makes Andrew Edmunds a good place to drink above yourself.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Recalls the Century of Steam

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE; LINDA GREENHOUSE covers the Supreme Court for The New York Times.

 BODY:
I RECOGNIZED the sound of the train whistle, of course, but what was that smell? It was rich, slightly sweet, quite pleasant and completely unfamiliar. Then I saw the thick gray smoke billowing from the far side of the parking lot, where Engine 3254 of the Canadian National Railway was moving slowly down the track, and I realized that for the first time in my life, I was smelling the steam of a working steam engine.
 We were in Scranton, Pa., at the Steamtown National Historic Site, the country's newest national park (just four months old), a long-debated and much-maligned urban development project designed to shore up the struggling downtown of this old coal and railroad center as well as to recall the century, roughly from 1850 to 1950, when steam locomotives dominated the landscape and captured the imagination. 
 Foisted on a decidedly unenthusiastic National Park Service in 1986 by Congress -- or, more specifically, by a powerful local booster, Representative Joseph M. McDade of Scranton, long the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee -- Steamtown was denounced in many quarters, including the editorial columns of this newspaper, as a second-rate collection of trains on a third-rate site. The 52-acre park finally opened in July after a Federal expenditure of more than $70 million, and a late-summer family drive through the Poconos and the nearby Delaware Water Gap gave us a chance to detour through Scranton and see what all the fuss had been about.
 While I leave it to others to carry on the debate over budget priorities, I can report that we came away informed, entertained, and with a new appreciation for a vanished era in the country's history. Not only did we get to see, hear, and smell the trains, but we also got to ride one, to learn a considerable amount about how they worked and -- among the most enjoyable aspects of our visit -- to talk to people who had actually worked on the old steam trains and had signed on as seasonal Park Service rangers to answer visitors' questions.
 Not suprisingly, Steamtown is crawling with train buffs -- the rangers and college students who applied to work there, as well as railroad men on pilgrimages with their families. One fellow visitor, a burly former Chicago & Northwestern engineer who now works for Union Pacific, seemed to take it as a personal mission to test, and if possible to top, the knowledge of the younger rangers, who played his game with good humor. "I don't care if it's a boondoggle. Anything that restores these trains is O.K. with me," he said as he snapped his son's picture in the engineer's seat of one of the park's 29 locomotives. There are nearly 100 other railroad cars in the collection as well.
 Admittedly, our own credentials were thin. My husband, Gene Fidell, is a New Yorker who grew up riding the GG train from Queens. But Hannah, our 10-year-old daughter, has traveled on Amtrak since infancy, and I've actually spent a few nights in sleeper-car bunks. My only railroad adventure consisted of once spending a day and night on a passenger train stranded on a siding at Pumpville, Tex. (population 6), because the main line was blocked by a derailment.
 But we needed no particular expertise to enjoy ourselves as Leo McLane, a seasonal ranger who spent 35 years as a switchman on the old Delaware, Lackawanna & Hudson Railroad, explained the equipment and shared some memories with anyone who wandered by a display of old signal lights. "My wife says to me, 'You're 76 years old and you're still playing with your damn choo-choos,' " Mr. McLane said with a chuckle.
 There is a kind of oral history going on here that, while it obviously won't last forever, the park's museum has captured to some extent on film. One display explains the work of the fireman, among whose jobs was to shovel some two tons of coal an hour from the tender to the engine. Each locomotive had its own personality, a retired fireman explains in the film that accompanies the exhibit. Engine No. 1053, for example, didn't like to run at 40 miles an hour, but did much better at 35 or 45.
 There is also a collection of newsreel excerpts showing various railroad disasters in such chilling detail as to make anyone think twice before ever boarding a train again. Perhaps as an antidote, the orientation film in the visitor center is the cheerful story of a young boy who dreams of trains and grows up to join the railroad.
 Steamtown is situated on the old Lackawanna yards, and it celebrates that railroad, famous in its day as the Route of the Phoebe Snow, the "maiden all in white," an advertising symbol created to display the virtues of the hard and clean-burning anthracite coal the railroad ran on. There was never any soot on Phoebe Snow's white dress as the Lackawanna traveled its route from Hoboken, N.J., to Buffalo.
 The Lackawanna, which later merged with its archrival, the Erie Railroad, in a fruitless effort to stave off extinction, kept the Phoebe Snow name alive even after it converted to diesel locomotives in the 1950's. The display cases showing Phoebe Snow's various incarnations, as well as the orientation film that features the Phoebe Snow image, are reminders that passenger train travel once meant excitement and even glamour. It all seemed long ago and far away, as I could tell from Hannah's skeptical response to my announcement that I had actually ridden the Phoebe Snow as a child on family trips to upstate New York.
 Clearly, a downtown industrial site -- especially one that is connected through a pedestrian walkway to an indoor shopping mall and food court -- is not everyone's idea of a national park. Later in our trip, we asked a ranger in the Delaware Water Gap what she thought of Steamtown. She wrinkled her nose. "I would never want to work there," she said. "No trees."
 BUT does it have trains! The pride of Steamtown's collection is one of the biggest steam locomotives ever built, a 4-8-8-4 Union Pacific Big Boy (the numbers refer to the way the wheels are arranged). Nearly 133 feet long, it carried 28 tons of coal and could run at more than 80 miles an hour.
 The pleasure of the park is to see trains not only as one might see them in a museum but to see them in motion. Steamtown is a dynamic museum, with locomotives moving regularly from the yard into the park's architectural centerpiece, the roundhouse. The building, with its 46 stalls where locomotives could be cleaned and serviced, was in complete disrepair when the City of Scranton bought it along with the rest of the abandoned yard in 1983 to house the train collection of Steamtown U.S.A., a struggling private museum in Bellows Falls, Vt. The Park Service rebuilt and reconfigured the roundhouse to give it 13 working stalls, converting the rest into museum space.
 Rangers take visitors on tours of the roundhouse, where locomotives are being restored. In the center of the complex is the turntable, a bigger-than-life lazy susan that works just as it does in any set of toy trains to aim a locomotive in the direction of its assigned stall. It was in frequent use and was such an arresting sight that it always caused a stir. While it once took 10 men to turn the mechanism, the turntable now works electrically with a 5-horsepower engine on each side.
 Admission to the museum, $6 for adults and $2 for children, includes a brief excursion on a 70-year-old steam train to the nearby Scranton Iron Furnaces, a relic of Scranton's industrial glory. With local anthracite coal as the fuel, these four massive furnaces produced most of the iron rails used by American railroads in the late 1800's. The furnaces, several stories high, stand in a park as part of an outdoor museum run by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.
 A longer excursion, a scenic two-hour round trip to Moscow, Pa., was available during summer and early fall weekends and will resume in the spring. Even longer trips, such as a sold-out weekend excursion to Syracuse with an overnight hotel stay that was preparing to depart when we visited the park, are sponsored by private organizations that maintain several of the locomotives housed at Steamtown.
 Scranton was once served by five railroads, an almost unthinkable luxury for a city of just over 80,000 people. The passenger trains stopped decades ago, but one memory remains: the Lackawanna's elegant station, just up the street from Steamtown, completed in 1908 and converted into a hotel through a public-private partnership in 1983. Now run by the Radisson chain as the Lackawanna Station Hotel, it has a grand and evocative two-story lobby, complete with a vaulted leaded-glass ceiling and 36 faience panels showing scenes along the Lackawanna's route. The guest rooms, comfortable if fairly standard, take up the upper floors that were once the railroad's administrative offices. Our stay there added a note of completion to our visit.

HEADLINE: THE GOOD RAT

 BODY:
Michael Lewis's "The Good Rat" (The Capitalist, Oct. 29) will further discourage potential whistle blowers. Lewis expressed no praise for John Swanson and Mark Whitacre. Instead, he emphasized that their disclosures terminated their careers and rendered them virtually unemployable. Dow Corning and Archer-Daniels-Midland could post Lewis's article on their corporate bulletin boards as a warning to other employees who might consider telling the truth. 
 At a dinner party recently, I characterized Whitacre as a true American hero. My assessment was criticized by one guest as "stupid, naive and idiotic." Curiously, my critic was a person who blames all of America's problems on the deterioration of family values. Apparently, corporate loyalty in the face of corporate criminality is a family value and personal integrity is not.

HEADLINE: THE RICH: How They Spend It;
A-Z: What a Lot of Money Can Buy

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL; Peter Passell writes about economics and other topics for The Times.

 BODY:

ACCESS
 A cellular phone is fine as long as you're within a few miles of a transmitter. But the truly rich don't need to be shackled to civilation. Comsat's 25-pound, briefcase-size Mobile Link provides a connection to anywhere in the wrold through Inmarsat's system of high-earth-orbit satellites. Cost, with 1,000 minutes of air time: $13,850.
 
BOY TOY
 The wealthy have long lusted to own sports teams, and for a while Madonna was rumored to be interested in buying an N.B.A. franchise. But it has since become clear that she was less interested in teamwork than in individual performances, especially by the likes of the irrepressible Dennis Rodman (then with the San Antonio Spurs). "She had ways of making you feel like you're King Tut," Rodman once told an interviewer, "but she also wanted to cuddle and be held."
 

COHIBA
 When Cuba's leisure class left for Miami, it was widely assumed that all the great cigar makers went too. Not so. The worl's most coveted cigars - and the most expensive - are Cohibas, originally produced exclusively for Fidel Castro. They've been commercially available since the early 1980's, selling for about $25 to $30 apiece insmoke shops abroad; they regularly find their way back to the United States in the luggage of discerning travelers.
 
DEMOCRACY
 For the man who has everything, like the billionaire currency speculator George Soros, there's only one logical way to spend your money: is the world. Soros spends some $300 million a year - more than the Ford Foundation - on his own private foreign policy. Having already promoted democracy in Eastern Europe for several years, he is quietly becoming a major player in South Africa, pledging up to $50 million in mortgage insurance guarantees to help replace tin shacks with more substantial housing.
 
EAVESDROPPING
 You never know what's in that van parked on you block. With just $200,000, a good underground electronics expert can be hired - not through the Yellow Pages, mind you - to put together a surveillance vehicle that enables the jealous, the suspicious or the paranoidj to monitor their enemy's activities. Options include a movement - sensitive pinhole camera and a scanner that intercepts phone numbers and digital mesages; there's also $15,000 night-vision goggles and an $18,000 car-tracking satellite system. For what it's worth: most of these items are now or soon will be illegal.
 
FEMALE ROLE MODELS
 Bill Koch, a Kansas-bred businessman and self-described rebel, wanted to drum up interest in yacht racing while breaking down th esport's good-old-boy image. So he spent $5 million-plus to assemble an all-female crew for his 1995 America team, which had won the previous Americas Cup, in 1992. Mighty Mary, the team's lead boat this year, didn't fare well - even after a new tactician, a man, was installed at the 11th hour. Still, all was not lost: after the races, team members toured the country, running leadership - training classes for high-school girls.
 
GLORY
 In 1983, in a well-publicized act of wish fulfillment, Gilbert Kaplan, the founder of Institutional Investor magazine, took some music lessons and spent $125,000 to conduct Gustav Mahler's intricate Symphony No. 2 in C Orchestra. But don't call him a dilettante: Kaplan has since conducted the symphony with 26 orchestras, at their invitation, and next year will conduct the opening concert of the 1996 Salzburg Festival. His critically praised recording with the London Symphony Orchestra, has sold 140,000 copies.
 
HONEYMOON
 Why wed at some boring old watering hole like the Plaze? No reason, if you can afford to hire Bill Fischer to plan the event. New York's travel agent to the stars recently arranged a movable feast for a client, his bride-to-be and 38 of their closest friends. The group first flew to Rome to pick up a 450-foot yacht for a cruise to Antibes, where the couple were married at the Hotel du Cap. Fischer had persuaded the management to surrender several previously booked rooms (the Cannes Film Festival was under way) and shut down the dining room for the wedding reception. The newlyweds spent the next three and a half months touring Europe, Africa, the Greek and Turkish isles, Bali, Singapore and the Great Barrier Reef, traveling by private jet, boat, helicopter andhot-air balloon. Desiring some comfort on their arduous journey, they had asked Fischer to hire a butler for them just like the one at the Lanesborough Hotel in London. What they got was that very butler, who quit his job to join the couple full time. Total cost: $3.5 million, including commissions.
 
IMMORTALITY
 Monuments crumble, but nature is forever. The Nature Conservancy, a Virginia-based environmental group, is willing to accommodate those who appreciate this distinction. It recently accepted a gift of 512 pristine acres on Martha's Vineyard form Bob N. Woods, a Califronia rancher andvintner. The land, worth about $18 million if developed, is dedicated to the memory of Wood's mother.
 
JUNK
 Mitchell Woflson Jr., whose family made millions through an entertainment jconglomerate, has spent nearly his entire life accumulating some 70,000. . . well, objets. What to do now? Charge admission. The $10-million-plus Wolfsonian museum, which opened last weekend in Miami Beach, will show including the first Scotch tape dispenser, a Braille version of "Mein Kampf" and King Farouk's matchbook collection.
 
KICK
 When the consumption starts getting too conspicuous, it's always safe to retreat to the quiet luxury practiced by the English lord, strolling the estate on a crisp morning with his hunting dogs at his side. And clutching, of course, a $45,500 custom-fitted shotgun from James Purdey and Sons of London, replete with a hand-carved stock of walnut from the Dordogne region of France.
 
LOOPHOLE
 Anyone with a few hundred thousand to spend on lobbying has a shot at creating his own private tax loophole. It takes real insider status to hang on to a tax break that has been closed to everyone else. Rupert Murdoch and Quincy Jones were the lucky recipients of just such a break this year when Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois jconvinced Congress to permit one last tax-exempt sale of television licenses to a minority-owned business. The deal hasn't gone through yet, but it appears very likely; Murdoch, the seller, would reap $30 million in tax savings while Jones and his partner would have $12 million knocked off the price tag.
 
MMMM
 Forward-looking enophiles are discovering the exotic sweet whites of Alsace made from overripe grapes, at about $180 a half bottle. But most wine drinkers with money to spare still go for that icon of Burgundy, Romanee-Conti from the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. At Restaurant Daniel in New York, a bottle from 1929 will set you back $3,500; a case of the 1985 vintage recently sold at auction for $18,000.
 
THE NEW WIFE
 Maybe it all started with Hillary, but the days of the old-fashioned trophy wife - long on glamour, short on resume - are on the wane. Betsy McCaughey, New York's Lieutenant Governor, remains the state's No. 1 bachelorette after breaking off her engagement this summer. Then there's Marie-Josee Drouin (left) - an economist, newspaper columnist, member of the board of Ford Motor Company and, as of last year, Mrs. Henry Kravis.
 
ORDERING OFF THE MENU
 Being rich means never having to settle for the catch of the day. One prominent New YOrk widow has long exercised this privilege. Every Wedenday night, she arrives by Mercedes limousine at the Rainbow Room and proceeds to roder dishes that are listed nowhere on the menu. She might begin with sauteed quail eggs and beluga caviar, at $160, and move on to risotto toppedj with shredded white truffles, for $100. Then the widow and her escort - she hires a different dance instructor each week - walz and tango the night away, invariably repairing next door to Rainbow and Stars for one last bottle of 1982 Krug Brut Champagne. ($190).
 
PEARLS
 A girl's newest best friend is a strand of the lustrous, almost-iridescent colored pearls from the South Pacific. AT Tiffany & Company, $365,000 buys a particulary chic necklace of large Black South Sea pearls, even offering a concession to traditional tastes: the clasp is hidden in a platinum ball studded with 40 diamonds.
 
RISK REDUCTION
 Shrewd casino gamblers play only baccarat or blackjack, where the house advantage is razor thin. But a truly high roller can improve even those odds, buying the privilege to play fewer hands at higher stakes than the house limit. A Japanese gambler named Akio Kashiwagi used to play baccarat at Trump Plaza for $200,000 a hand. (In 1992, Kashiwagi was stabbed to death in Japan, owing some $9 million to American casinos.)
 
SAFETY
 It's no longer a luxury to own the gadget that turns on the yard lights when a raccoon wanders by. Visions Innovative Electronic Environments, in North Palm Beach, Fla, wraps an entire house in industrial-strength electronics. When the house is empty, the system switches to guard mode, faking the lighting and television-use patterns of the occupants. And video cameras, linked to special computers, allow owners to view their possessions in real time from anywhere in the world.
 
TIME
 This most precious commodity, of course, is irreplaceable. So how best to take advantage of It? The Agusta A109C is the ultimate timesaver, a $2.7 million Italian-built helicopter with twin engines, airplanelike streamlining and a top speed of 175 m.p.h. There's plenty of room on board to do business, and no ugly delays at the airport. For longer hops, the $25-million-plus Gulfstream IV-SP jet, with shower and bedroom (or a dozen seats), can fly nonstop from Chicago to Paris at 80 percent of the speed of sound. Next year, owners of the IV-SP can trade up to the even roomeier Gulfstream V, the first personal jet able to fly nonstop form New York to Tokyo. The price tag: about $30 million, plus decorating.
 
UNCTION
 When life is on the line, it's far from clear that the rich have an edge over the well-insured middle class. Doctors willing to be at beck and call for a price are rarely the most skilled. And while donating a bundle to a hospital does insure V.I.P. treatment, it might also lead to treatment-by-committee - which is often dangerously conservative. What money can buy is Claridge's-like lodgings and service insituations in which other patients must settle for Motel 6. At Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center's McKeen Pavilion, whose long-term patients include Sunny von Bulow, there is even a pianist to tinkle away the cocktail-hour gloom.
 
VROOM
 In the 1980's, Ferraris were better status symbols than cars. The seats were uncomfortable, shifting gears required muscular forearms and when driven by amateurs the cars had an unfortunate propensity to spin out of control. But now the rich want their status symbols to be practical as well, and Ferrari has responded with the very drivable 456 GT, a plush, power-everything four-seater with the acceleration of a Porsche and the road manners of a Lexus. And all for just $207,000 (plus $3,400 air freight for those who can't bear to delay gratification).
 
WORLD ON A WRIST
 A $20 Casio keeps better time than the best mechanical watches, so why would anyone pay 10,000 times as much? For some, it's a celebration of the marvels of Victorian technology: a watch's value is largely determined by how many functions - what the Swiss Call complications - can fit inside the most elegant case. Date, moon phase, dual time zones and multiple stopwatches are child's play; "les grandes complications" include a perpetual calendar, a "tourbilon" mechanism, which compensates for the differing impact of gravity when the watch is held in various positions, and a "repeater" mechanism that chimes the hour and minutes with the push of a button. I.W.C.'s Grande Complication platinum watch, whose features include a repeater and perpetual calendar, goes for about $195,000 at Tourneau (or $275,000 with hand-finished platinum bracet).
 
XANADU
 Well-heeled jbody worshippers from either coast gravitate to Canyon Ranch in Tucson, Aris. Southern California's matrons flock to the Golden Door in Escondido, while their counterparts in Texas go to the Greenhouse inDallas. But the spa of the moment is clearly Cal-a-Vie, a "Provencal" village set among 150 landscaped acres north of San Diego. What does $3,950 a week buy? All the usual spa treats, to be sure, plus some unusual pampering. The individual jcottages are decorated in French country; the cuisine is built around fruits and vegetables from the spa's garden. And there are no fewer than four staff members to every client. Barbra Streisand slept here. So did Donna Karan, Nan Kempner, Angelica Houston, Michelle Pfeiffer, Julia Roberts and Oprah Winfrey.
 
YES MEN
 Like most movie stars, Eddie Murphy spends freely on the usual trappings of wealth. He also employs a cre of famously devout "personal assistants" who are always eager to second their boss's opinion, from where he should eat to what movie he should make. This may help explain the string of bombs he has starred in lately. As one review of his recent "Vampire in Brooklyn" put it, "Next time, maybe Murphy's entourage will include better scriptwriters and fewer personal assistants."
 
ZEBRAS, ETC.
 Michael Steinhardt, the recently retired hedge-fund operator, maintains a wildlife preserve on half of his 50-plus-acre estate in Bedford, N.Y. Four acres are devoted to birds (including African cranes and a cereopsis goose), mammals (wallabies, kangaroos, alpacas, antelopes, zebras and camels) roam the rest. And it's not just his own animals that he supports: last year he bought two islands in the Falklands as a refuge for penguins, seals and the black-browed albatross.

HEADLINE: In Co-ops, Renting Is a Growing Concern

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
LORETTA KRIARIS thought she was doing her fellow co-op owners a favor two years ago by capping -- at eight -- the number of apartments that could be rented at any given time in her 115-unit building in the Briarwood section of Queens.
After all, a high percentage of rentals had made it difficult for her co-op to refinance its mortgage, for apartment owners to sell their units and for prospective buyers to get loans. 
 "It was highly restrictive," said Ms. Kriaris, who was board president at the time. "But it was in the context of seeking refinancing. It was a last-ditch effort to stave off default and get rid of an exorbitant rate of interest that the co-op was paying on the underlying mortgage."
There was also, Ms. Kriaris said, the matter of the building's ambiance with many of the apartments occupied by renters. "They have a different feeling and attitude toward the building than the owner-occupants do," she said.
Surprisingly, perhaps, the eight-unit cap was not appreciated by the majority of shareholders in the building, which is at 143-50 Hoover Avenue. About 57 percent of the apartments are rented out. And three months ago, a new board was elected that eliminated the cap.
"It is troubling," Ms. Kriaris said. "If there is no scrutiny and no control, ultimately this will have a deleterious effect on the building, and the number of rentals will escalate."
The conflict inside co-ops between unit owners who rent out their apartments and those who live in them is one of the most vexing issues in the co-op world today. Many boards in recent years have loosened sublease policies to extend relief to apartment owners facing financial hardship. At the same time, though, some boards have tightened the rules for a variety of financial and lifestyle reasons.
"I consider this to be the next big emerging co-op problem," said Marc J. Luxemburg, president of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
He estimated that from 1,000 to 2,000 buildings have some sort of serious conflict between renters and owners. There are 8,080 co-op buildings in the city, half of them in Manhattan, containing about 416,000 apartments. About 15 percent of the city lives in co-op units -- but almost half of them are renters.
There are also 1,040 condominium complexes, which sometimes have similar conflicts between renters and owners. Such conflicts arise less frequently in condominiums, however, because buyers often opt for condos because of the freedom to rent the units out with few restrictions.
Still, resident owners of condos can get just as annoyed as co-op owners if renters dominate a building, as is the case at Park Avenue Court, a 223-unit condominium in the old Gimbels store at 120 East 87th Street on the East Side of Manhattan. There a consortium of Hong Kong investors bought 118 units and is renting them out; the developer had filed for bankruptcy.
"The building is not being maintained to the standard that it would if it were owner-occupied," said Joanna Townshend-Boegner, an apartment owner.
Such problems are much more prevalent and contentious at co-ops, however. And the problems are not limited to New York City. Many co-ops exist in the New Jersey suburbs and in Westchester County.
"The subletting issue is indeed one of the most difficult that co-op boards now face," said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
Subleasing -- the technical term for renting a co-op unit, because the owners are the actual tenants -- isn't always a panacea for apartment owners who can't sell their units and must move or sell. Some co-op boards have refused to allow sublets. Others have tacked on fees. And even with the strong rental market, sometimes the rent doesn't cover the apartment owner's combined maintenance and share loan payment. Moreover, many co-op and condo owners are unaccustomed to acting as landlord, especially when it comes to dealing with tenants.
Subletting, however, can be even more of a headache for the co-op.
First, banks generally do not make "share" or "end" loans for individual units -- the equivalent of the mortgages used by owners to buy private houses -- if a building has more than 50 or 60 percent of its units occupied by subtenants. In a market where buyers are still often hard to come by, that can be a deal-killer for tenants who are trying to sell their apartments.
Second, a high percentage of subtenants may also endanger a co-op's ability to refinance its underlying mortgage -- the loan taken out by the co-op corporation to buy the building from the sponsor or the converter.
Third, renters, generally, have a reputation, perhaps ill-deserved, for lacking as much pride or concern for a building's appearance and operation as owners do. Worldwide Plaza, a condominium at 350 West 50th Street in Manhattan, last year tightened up its screening of rental tenants and its house rules after some tenants were spotted roller-blading in the hallways.
Fourth, in buildings where the sponsor has defaulted and subtenants still live in unsold units, such apartments revert back to the co-op. This, however, frequently creates a financial crunch because the board usually collects rents on these apartments that do not match what shareholders pay in maintenance; this is because the subtenants are generally living in rent-stabilized units that rent for significantly less than they would bring on the open market.
IF such apartments are vacated and the co-op corporation decides not to sell them, market-rate rents can be charged, as is the case with investor-owned units, and such rents can be equal to or even more than the maintenance that would be charged if the unit were a co-op.
But the far more common situation, according to Ms. Rothman and others familiar with co-op issues, is for rentals to fall short of expenses. This shortfall in revenue from subtenants, Ms. Rothman says, often causes the co-op board to raise the maintenance on all owners of apartments in the building.
"You have the shareholders subsidizing the renters," said Stuart Saft, a lawyer who serves as chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
He added that co-op boards cannot even cut services because of the discrepancy between the amount of revenue collected from renters and the monthly maintenance paid by shareholders.
"If they do, the renters can then seek rent reductions," he said.
The wave of sponsor co-op defaults in the early 90's exacerbated this problem, as unsold units were often sold to investors who, rather than sell them, continued to rent them because of the strong market for rentals and the soft, albeit improving, market for co-ops.
Mr. Saft noted that the owners of co-op units, because of an exemption in the state's rent-regulation laws, can collect market rents for those apartments once the original rent-stabilized tenants vacate.
This exemption, he said, has created a disincentive for the owners to sell their units.
"During the downturn the last few years, no one was pressuring anyone to sell," he said. "But now the market has gotten better and the wave of sponsor defaults are mostly past. And still some owners aren't selling their units because of the rents they can get."
Mr. Luxemburg questioned whether the intent of the framers of the rent-regulation laws had been to allow an exemption from controls after an apartment is vacated in order to allow an investor or a sponsor to utilize co-ops as a permanent source of market-rent income.
He also said that continuing to rent these units rather than making a good-faith effort to sell them was inconsistent with the sponsor's obligation to the co-op and existing tenant-shareholders, even though sponsors are usually obligated to sell only a minimum of 15 percent of their units to make the co-op conversion legal.
"The sponsor put out an offering plan to convert the building to co-op status, but did that mean 100 percent co-op status or something less?" Mr. Luxemburg asked. "I would think an ordinary person reading an offering plan would think that the entire building would be converted.
"I find it surprising that the offering plans or regulations don't say that in so many words," Mr. Luxemburg said. "The problem is that it should be explicit but it is not."
Mr. Saft added that the growing role of co-op boards and unit owners as reluctant landlords could make them lobby for changes in the state's rent-regulation laws, which come up for renewal in the spring of 1997.
"Co-ops have never been involved in this issue before," he said. "It was always landlord-tenant groups going at it.
"But now there are a half-million co-op and condo owners who have an interest in seeing the regulations eliminated or curtailed," he said. "I think you will have an incredible fight in a year and a half, and I think you will see a fundamental change in rent control laws because of this."
MR. SAFT speculated that vacancy decontrol might be expanded beyond the current exemption. (Gov. George E. Pataki's Transition Committee on Housing and Community Development last year recommended phasing out rent regulations completely through vacancy decontrol -- the lifting of controls on all apartments as they become vacant. Currently apartments renting for more than $2,000 a month are, under the 1993 law, decontrolled when they become vacant.)
This may not have a direct impact on co-ops since they are already decontrolled upon vacancy, but it may remove an incentive some sponsors have for turning rental buildings into co-ops. "One of the reasons some sponsors converted to co-ops was to get vacancy decontrol," said Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in real estate issues. "If vacancy decontrol applies to all rental apartments, then there is no reason to convert, if vacancy decontrol was the major reason they were doing it."
Mr. Saft also urged that the the threshold on household income for rent-controlled and rent-stabilized units be lowered "to more like $75,000." (Rent controls for apartments renting for $2,000 or more a month that are occupied by tenants whose household income was more than $250,000 for two years running were effectively lifted in 1993.)
He said that if changes were made in rent-regulation that allowed co-op boards to charge higher rents to tenants now covered by rent regulation, then occupants of those rental units would either be spurred to buy their apartments, or they would pay the higher unregulated rents, which would go into the co-op's coffers.
"Either way, co-ops get bailed out," he said.

Do Walls Keep Out Crime, or Just Neighbors?

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
The place where Hoboken wants to build a wall is sort of in the middle of nowhere, which is both the point and the problem.
It is near railroad tracks that lie at the base of a cliff at the back of town, several hundred feet west of the city's cluster of public housing projects. At the top of the cliff is a Jersey City neighborhood called the Heights, and since the dawn of local history, residents of the two communities have climbed up and down the cliff on a system of improvised staircases and paths. Some of the travelers, residents and officials say, are drug dealers or customers looking for a low-profile route. 
 Recently, there has been more serious trouble. The Hoboken wall was proposed in August after three young visitors from the Heights argued with some Hoboken youths, then went up the hill, got their guns, walked back down the cliff, and shot and wounded three people before fleeing. The incident rocked a neighborhood that has been largely free of the gunplay that often plagues public housing in bigger cities.
The wall envisioned by the city -- no construction specifics have been mentioned yet -- would run for four blocks, from one end of the housing project to the other. It wouldn't keep people out altogether -- the difficult-to-patrol cliff runs the whole length of Hoboken's mile-and-a-half border -- but it would make it harder for pedestrians to get into and out of heart of the housing project and easier for police to pursue criminals.
"Drug dealers are using that back way as an easy egress route," Mayor Anthony Russo said. "Building the wall would make it a little more difficult for that to continue."
The wall will not be built for a while, if at all. Mayor Russo, who estimated the cost at $300,000 to $500,000, has asked New Jersey Transit, which is in the process of buying the freight tracks from Conrail, if it would be interested in paying for part of the construction. (The wall is also being touted as a deterrent to the gangs who loot the Conrail freight trains). The state Department of Transportation, which oversees the transit agency, is considering its options.
Many residents of the projects welcome the wall proposal.
"A lot of people come down off the tracks to either buy or sell their drugs, and it's infested down here in the community already," said Cindy Willis, vice president of United Sisters, a group based in the projects that works to keep young people out of trouble. "We don't need any out-of-towners to make the problem any worse than it already is, and if that wall keeps a little of the activity out, I'm all for it."
Walled cities, of course, are nearly as old as civilization itself. But more and more communities in the state seem to be turning to fortification to address their social ills.
In Monmouth County, Neptune Township and the religious shore community of Ocean Grove, which is part of the township, are considering a proposal to erect gates on the footbridges that connect Ocean Grove to Asbury Park, and lock them from midnight to 5 A.M. Officials in mostly black Asbury Park have criticized the concept as racist.
Last year, Pennsauken, a suburb of crime-plagued Camden, toyed with the idea of walling itself off but abandoned it after a wave of bad publicity. And in 1993, Maplewood approved the installation of traffic barriers that were intended to keep drivers from using a once-placid neighborhood as a thoroughfare, but also happened to close off part of the border with Newark, ruffling feathers there.
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, says wall-building is a suburban response to crime and trespassing.
"If you live in a high-rise apartment in Manhattan, essentially you're walled off from the street," he said. "When you're in lower-density environments, if people want a similar feeling of security, they feel that all they can do is a put up a wall. The difference is that one comes off very distasteful and the other comes off as business as usual."
In Hoboken, it is not a question ofkeeping out the underclass. The economically and culturally diverse Heights, in fact, is considerably more gentrified than the housing project. Rather, residents are simply trying to find a way to control crime.
A similar project has been tried in New Brunswick. Last year, the New Brunswick Housing Authority, at the request of residents, put a high wrought-iron fence around two garden apartment complexes to keep drug dealers and buyers from the adjoining neighborhood out.
It didn't work.
"People just took saws and cut right through it," said Shirley Cargile, the manager of the two complexes. "We keep repairing it, though, because if they have to go all the way around, the cops could catch them a lot easier."
A Hoboken police officer who spoke on the condition that his name not be used said he doubted that a wall would do any good.
"It's just a big waste of money, because if you give people any kind of time, they can get through any material in a manner of minutes -- cinder blocks, concrete, whatever," he said. "Where there's a will, there's a way."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Patience? This Man Practically Invented It

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
THE blue eyes sparkle, the chuckles begin somewhere deep inside his throat, then churn through his body like waves of delight. He sits in front of a slab of rare roast beef and a mountain range of mashed potatoes. The bearish fellow -- indisputably seasoned enough to ignore broccoli sprigs and anything else he chooses -- is having lunch in the Marco Polo Club, started by his friend Lowell Thomas, the explorer.
On Nov. 28, Philip L. Carret will celebrate his 99th birthday -- though, for the eighth time now, he is calling it his 100th. Worried that he would miss the big party, he had his first centennial bash when he was 92, and now he feels ahead of the game. "Phil Carret Turns 100 -- Again!" read the headline of a fake newspaper last year. 
 This is a life so full that friends in his industry joke that when Mr. Carret (rhymes with beret) reaches 100, he'll split the stock. This is a man whose grandfather was born in the 18th century, who flew a Sopwith Camel in World War I, met President Coolidge ("Any President who takes afternoon naps can't be all bad"), helped give birth to the mutual fund industry by founding the awesomely successful Pioneer Fund back when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 197, works more than 40 hours a week and cooks most of his own meals.
And it is a life that is still in flux. He is writing his fourth book, "The Patient Investor," by hand on yellow legal pads. Two weeks ago, he returned from Borneo, where he viewed his 19th total eclipse of the sun, his passion since 1925. His career is hardly over: each week, he heads a meeting of investment advisers, often picking apart theories and demanding more information.
It seems like yesterday, but it was a half century ago that Mr. Carret stopped in Omaha to meet Howard Buffett, a broker who recommended a few stocks.
Mr. Carret stayed in touch with the Buffett family, thank you very much. Berkshire Hathaway, managed by Mr. Buffett's son Warren -- a teen-ager when Mr. Carret met him -- is perhaps Mr. Carret's most successful investment, soaring from $2,000 a share less than a decade ago to more than $30,000 now.
Warren Buffett's famous philosophy of buying rock-solid stocks and sitting on them echoes Mr. Carret's strategy, described in his first book, "The Art of Investing," in 1930.
Luck matters, but luck alone cannot explain Mr. Carret's success: he operates under strict self-imposed standards. "Phil has the best long-term investment record of anyone in America," Mr. Buffett said in 1991.
Two years later, in a note to Mr. Carret, he said, "You are the Lou Gehrig of investing."
Here, for the record, are Mr. Carret's views on the current market: "In the short term, it's in a very delicate position. In recent weeks, we've had a flood of hundreds of millions of dollars of new offerings. This glut pushes down prices in the short run. Also, the market is very high in historical valuations. But in the longer run, I'm bullish. America has about 100 good years left."
It is always the long view that matters. "Trading in and out of the market is the pinnacle of stupidity," he scoffed. This old man buys enduring companies, not faceless stocks. He has seen it all and then some: his professional life has spanned 31 bull markets, 30 bear markets, 20 recessions and the Depression. He remembers when bicycles had one speed, T-shirts carried no messages, and electric lights, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve did not exist. Options, financial derivatives and the like baffle the daylights out of him.
"My grandfather does not understand why anyone thinks they need a cellular phone," said his 42-year-old granddaughter, Renee Carret, a portfolio manager in the family firm.
For a man who is one of the legendary stock pickers, his secret is not elusive. Quality, conservatively defined, is Mr. Carret's prey: strong balance sheets, steady earnings, clever market strategies and committed managers with hefty investments in their own companies, at least a year's salary, by Mr. Carret's standards. Their own money, too. No stock options or other corporate handouts.
Mr. Carret's success combines intense work -- only recently did he stop commuting six days a week from Scarsdale in Westchester County -- and a capriciousness of spirit. A few years ago, he noticed lots of North American Van Lines trucks on the highway, researched the company and bought some of its shares -- just before Pepsico noticed the same thing and acquired the company at a premium. He made a nice profit on Neutrogena, later bought by Johnson & Johnson; he liked the soap in a hotel room. Another time, he noticed the bottle on top of the water cooler in his office: he bought the stock of its manufacturer, Liqui-Box, for $10.50 and sold it for $120.
Not to say there have been no disasters. More than 60 years ago, Mr. Carret acted on a tip from his bookkeeper and bought an oil stock -- he does not remember which one -- for $20. He does remember exactly what he sold it for: 12 1/2 cents. He ended up firing the bookkeeper, but not for the bum tip; he was caught embezzling.
More recently, Mr. Carret hit on the notion that the Bank of New England could not make all bad loans -- a wildly wrong guess. The bank failed in 1991.
Today, though he has given up all administrative responsibility at Carret & Company, which handles investment portfolios of at least $500,000, he is still at his small, cluttered desk every Monday through Friday promptly at 9, picking stocks.
He has no interest in a stock unless he thinks it will at least double, but he is willing to wait for that. He looks on in disapproval and no small measure of befuddlement at the whiz kids managing funds worth hundreds of millions who dart in and out of a market that, in their short careers, has only gone up. "They buy at 10:15 A.M. and sell at 3:45 P.M.," he said, shaking his huge head. "Crazy."
One of Mr. Carret's few recreational activities has been mountain climbing -- "but only the kind where you put one foot in front of the other and walk; I have never hung off the edge of cliffs." He neither smokes nor drinks, and buys no tobacco or alcohol stocks.
He takes only vitamins, but could not help noticing his peers were a strong market for drugs. So about a year ago, he bought stock in Merck, which had been depressed by concerns over managed-health care. The stock met his financial yardsticks and its management impressed him when he paid a visit. Since the purchase, the shares have risen 70 percent. "Most people my age are practically drowning in drugs," he said.
Mr. Carret has no answer to why he has outlived almost everyone, including several doctors. A year and a half ago, he said, he received a mysterious message in his brain, that he would die on April 15. He woke up on tax-deadline day and noticed he was still alive, then spent the day at home, keeping an eye on himself.
"It was a false alarm," Mr. Carret said. "Maybe next year."
The long view is in his genes: virtually all his direct ancestors have lived into their 80's. His father, a lawyer, was 22 when Lincoln gave his Gettysburg Address, and his grandfather, the son of Napoleon's paymaster general, was born in 1797. His mother, a social worker who became one of the nation's first probation officers, was 39 when she gave birth to him, her only child.
"I was brought up by old people, my grandmother, old-maid aunts, you name it," he said.
Mr. Carret, born in Lynn, Mass., embodies long New England traditions, becoming a Congregationalist after growing up in the more-liberal Unitarian faith and, like others in his well-off family, attending Harvard. The family's earliest Harvard man, he said, was the Rev. Daniel Gookin, class of 1669. As a freshman in 1914, he was at the new Yale Bowl for its first contest, Harvard-Yale.
In four years, he finished his undergraduate degree and a year at the brand-new business school -- enough, by his reckoning. Chemistry, his first choice, struck him as hopelessly declasse after he visited a grimy gas company laboratory and noticed his tour guide wore a celluloid collar, that era's equivalent of the clip-on tie. "The absolute nadir of sartorial elegance," Mr. Carret said, wincing.
In 1917, he entered the Army Signal Corps, a predecessor to the Air Force. He learned to shoot a machine gun while piloting a Sopwith Camel and was sent to France, but the war ended before he saw combat.
After discharge, he went to work for a small securities firm in Boston, starting at $15 a week. After five months, he got a raise to $20. "I was insulted," at the paltry amount, he said, and took off to roam America, working in mining camps and the like, eventually landing a job selling bonds in Seattle.
It was there, in 1920, that he met Florence Elisabeth Osgood, the granddaughter of a Civil War general and Vermont governor and a 1918 graduate of Wellesley College. They were married in 1922, and had 63 years together before she died in 1986.
They had two sons, a daughter, 12 grandchildren and, as of now, 12 great grandchildren.
Mr. Carret likes to say that Betty, as he called her, was 99.99 percent perfect because only God is 100 percent. "In truth, I never detected a flaw that could represent a 0.01 percent shortfall," he quickly added.
After his marriage, he returned to Boston to the firm he had left, this time in sales. He quit in four months, and went to work at Barron's, the new financial weekly owned by Clarence W. Barron. Mr. Carret, who wrote feature articles, loves to tell stories about his flamboyant boss, who weighed well in excess of 300 pounds and had a flowing white beard.
On one train ride to New York, he recalled, Mr. Barron ensconced himself in his compartment and played bridge most of the trip. But at dinner time, he emerged and walked briskly to the dining car with two colleagues and a secretary, proceeding to dictate letters and issue rapid-fire orders between hurried bites.
"What a workaholic!" people would marvel. "What a phony," Mr. Carret says now.
The most valuable lesson from Mr. Carret's journalistic career came the day Sherman Adams, no relation to Eisenhower's chief of staff, visited the newsroom. Mr. Carret could not help overhearing Mr. Adams describing his idea for a new financial company, which became Massachusetts Investors Trust, one of the first mutual funds.
In 1928, Mr. Carret scraped together $25,000 from family and friends and started his own fund. It was first called Fidelity Investment Trust (no relation to today's Fidelity), and was later renamed Pioneer Fund. It started strongly with blue chips like Maytag preferred and Firestone Tire and Rubber, and its value moved briskly upward. Even after the 1929 crash, it was still ahead by 11 percent, but by the beginning of 1932 an original investment of $1,000 on Jan. 1, 1929, would have fallen to $470.
But after the market hit bottom that year, the fund bounced back 37 percent. Today, that original $1,000 would be worth more than $2 million, making Pioneer by far the most profitable of the old-timer funds, according to Mutual Funds Magazine.
Mr. Carret never looked back. He picked stocks for himself, for Pioneer and later for Carret & Company, which he began in 1963, the year he sold control of Pioneer's management company. In 1983, he stepped down as chairman of Pioneer, though he still attends monthly board meetings.
His nuts-and-bolts message came to be called value investing, and he wanted to make sure it would continue for his well-heeled clients.

manages $600 million, up from $180 million a decade ago, with a large part of the asset growth presumably coming from stock-market gains.
"We're performance-driven, not transaction-driven," said Frank H. Betz, the managing director, who added that Carret was a company "where gray hair is valued." The average age of the nine principals is the mid-60's, not counting Mr. Carret.
Mr. Carret spent two years searching for a successor to buy the firm, of which he owned half. Neither his son Gerard, who died of cancer in 1991 at 70, nor his other son, Donald, now 66 -- both of whom owned a quarter of the firm -- wanted the helm. The elder Mr. Carret was most curious about the religious and moral convictions of possible buyers. Price was never the principal object, because he gives away everything he makes to Harvard, Wellesley and charities. But he wanted someone true to value investing.
He found David J. Olderman, now 58, who had been vice chairman of Stone & Webster Inc., then retired to Florida. The first thing Mr. Olderman did on retirement was earn a master's degree in moral theology.
Mr. Olderman found the chance to carry on the Carret name and mission irresistible, and bought the firm. Mr. Carret draws no salary, but all the others do, including Donald and Renee Carret.
Mr. Olderman became president and chief executive in 1988 and chairman in 1993. "Things don't change," he said said. "Good people make good companies. Great people make great companies."
Lunch with Mr. Carret and a few colleagues is a soothing blend of memory, insight and plain delight. F.D.R., he says, was wrong: "There was plenty to fear. Everyone was just scared out of their wits."
He regards government as a barely necessary evil, calling himself an anarchist. But he does not entirely resent S.E.C. disclosure rules, which prevent investors with more access to detailed data from profiting at the expense of the less informed by discovering hidden assets.
When asked about government securities, he reverts to his curmudgeon mode. "I don't like to invest in the operations of insolvent organizations," he snorted.
President Clinton? Mr. Carret remembers being charmed sitting next to the candidate at dinner a few years ago and writing a check for $1,000. "Never again," he said of the man he calls a disaster because of his weak economic policies.
Though he abhors war, he thinks it only sensible to profit from them. In 1939, for instance, he found a Cuban sugar company whose stock was available at $1.75. He bought some, then a lot more at $7 to $8. He sold most for $60, and the last little bit for $200. "One thing that goes up in a war is sugar," he said, "because it's a very concentrated form of energy and everybody likes the stuff."
He tells of one stock Howard Buffett recommended: Greif Brothers. He bought it almost 50 years ago, following his usual guidelines and knowing there would always be demand for their main product, barrels, and has been buying it ever since. It has not exactly worked as planned, but Greif has switched successfully into fiberboard drums and containers. Although Mr. Betz said it had been an "absolute dog for the last five years," it is the classic Carret stock: a steady grower with steady management bought at a reasonable price. Each share Mr. Carret bought at around 68 cents is now worth $25.625.
Arrogance is what most alienates Mr. Carret from a stock. He remembers reading I.B.M.'s 1991 letter to shareholders, in which John Akers, then the chairman, promised no dividend cut. Within two years, Big Blue had lost money and slashed the payout. By contrast, the next chief, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., in a speech to investment advisers, said only, "I think we can do it." Mr. Carret had already bought some I.B.M. stock simply because it was so cheap, but that speech was his signal to buy more.
Mr. Carret lives alone in his Scarsdale apartment. Each week "a gal" stops in to help clean. A driver takes him to work and back. Each of his six rooms is covered top to bottom with books. The one he is reading now is "God: A Biography," by Jack Miles. He also has old copies of Value Line Investment Survey evaluations, office castoffs, strewn about, and trade publications like Oil and Gas Journal.
He delights in reading annual reports of odd investments, and spent years pondering the annual report of Howe Caverns, which operates a cave in upstate New York. That report routinely included revenues from pay toilets, and Mr. Carret, for reasons he will not describe, tried mightily to find a link between this statistic and overall admissions. "The correlation was practically zero," he said.
His social life is sometimes not so tame as he would like. "I get invited out occasionally, mostly by widows," he said. "Only one of them really made a pass at me. She scared the hell out of me."
And there are those eclipses. Mr. Carret and his wife saw their first one in Westerly, R.I., in 1925. He has now seen them in every corner of the world, from the Amazon to Antarctica to Siberia and, most recently, in Borneo. He happily concedes that they are all pretty much the same but insists no sight compares with the inexorable march of the moon across the sun. Then comes what eclipse buffs call "totality," four minutes or so of night in the middle of day. A diamond ring effect is created by the groove between two lunar mountains.
But eclipses remain forever mysterious. "You see shadow bands on the surface of the earth, which I don't understand," Mr. Carret said, Pushing aside his uneaten roast beef, Mr. Carret headed back to his desk to study annual reports, a patient investor on the prowl.
"I haven't done anything brilliant lately," the almost 99-year-old man said with a wink.

HEADLINE: Washington, Watch What You Wish For

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
"BEWARE, lest stern heaven hate you enough to hear your prayers!" Anatole France said it 114 years ago, but the warning still resonates in the current battle over the Federal budget.
For more than a decade, mainstream economists have been begging, pleading, demanding that the chronic deficit opened in the Reagan years be closed. "Cutting the deficit will boost growth and help restore confidence that our elected representatives know how to run the store," explains Henry Aaron, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
 But now that the Republican-controlled Congress has formally resolved to balance the budget by the year 2002 -- a stand that
has led to the current impasse with the White House over the shape, the size and the pace of spending cuts -- many of those same economists are having second thoughts.
In part, they are reacting to the proposed means rather than to the end: the Republican budget, which is intended to shrink the Federal Government and give more authority to the states, would cut deeply into traditional programs supplementing the incomes of the poor, even as it reduced taxes on capital gains and for middle-income families. The White House wants a different mix and a smaller amount of savings spread out over a longer period and a much more modest tax cut. The gulf remains so wide that the fundamental issue may ultimately not be resolved until the voters choose sides in November 1996.
In part, the economists fear that fixing a path to a balanced budget would inhibit Government efforts to cushion the economy and protect the losers if there is a downturn in the next few years. "A recession would be no time to cut the deficit," frets Robert Solow, the Nobel Prize-winning economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But in large measure, the shift reflects skepticism over the capacity of Republicans -- or Democrats -- to shrink the Government in rational ways.
What the economists who helped lay the intellectual foundation for the current drive to balance the budget wanted was to inhibit Uncle Sam's inclination to support high living today at the expense of future generations. What they fear they are getting is a smaller Government that cuts tangible and intangible investment -- everything from advanced technology to adequate medical care for pregnant women -- far more than private consumption, which it helps subsidize through Social Security and other ballooning entitlement programs for the middle class. That approach, they say, will undermine rather than enhance the capacity of the economy to grow.
"The task of public policy should not be a balanced budget come hell or high water," warns William Nordhaus, a Yale economist. The challenge, he argues, "is to weed out low-yield public investments and to reduce inefficient public subsidies" -- a challenge yet to be embraced by the current budget-balancers on either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
The modern debate over budget deficits was born in the early 1980's, with the big Reagan tax cut. The initial worry was that the resulting Government borrowing to bridge the gap between tax revenues and Government outlays, which rose from $38 billion in 1979 to $212 billion in 1985, would "crowd out" productivity-enhancing private investment.
In fact, foreigners came to the rescue. America's "current account" on international financial transactions was roughly in balance in 1979. Six years later, foreigners invested $122 billion more in America than Americans invested abroad, as everyone from Argentine cattle barons to Japanese bankers bought large amounts of Government and private American securities.
That shifted the debate to the question of sustainability. Stephen Marris, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, predicted a "hard landing" in which foreign cash would dry up and interest rates would soar, triggering severe recession. "We came close in 1987," he recalls, "but I underestimated the creditworthiness of the Government."
The bang no longer seems realistic, even with talk these days, courtesy of the budget impasse, of a Government default on Treasury obligations. But most economists still worry a lot about a demographic whimper later on.
INDEED, the current indictment of budget deficits -- one more or less accepted by most economists -- is based on the calculation that Americans are not saving enough to meet their own expectations for the future. They are counting on Social Security and Medicare to sustain their living standard a quarter-century down the road, when the number of workers supporting each retiree will be nearly halved and the taxes needed to cover pay-as-you-go financing of promised benefits would make a Swedish socialist blush.
Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat, estimates that in the year 2012, entitlement programs (mostly Social Security and Medicare) plus interest payments on the debt would exceed 100 percent of projected tax revenues, leaving not a penny for the traditional activities of government. That would be the case under either the Republicans' 7-year plan to end the deficit or the 10-year alternative favored by the White House, since spending cuts under both plans, deep as they are, go only so far, allowing the deficit to flare again, and hugely so, almost as soon as it goes away.
"We will have a fiscal nightmare on our hands," says Lawrence Kotlikoff, a Boston University economist.
The only plausible solution from this perspective is to use long-term fiscal policy to offset private profligacy, reducing private consumption and raising growth-enhancing investment, both private and public. Delay, the deficit hawks argue, will only compound the political problem by forcing greater levels of sacrifice.
"Anyone who says there's no hurry to do something about the deficit is, in effect, conceding the Government isn't going to pay its obligations," concludes Paul Krugman, an economist at Stanford University.
Indeed, that is exactly the argument made by the Republicans at the forefront of the drive to bring the budget into balance by 2002. "The biggest risk our nation faces is that we not balance our budget and that we continue to spend our children's and our grandchildren's money to pay for programs we cannot afford," said Senator Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
But the closer one looks at the mechanics of doing the right thing by future generations, the more problematic it appears.
A straightforward objection comes from those who fear that deficit reduction would aggravate the business cycle. Economists have mostly given up the Keynesian idea of using discretionary fiscal policy -- temporary reductions in tax rates or increases in Government spending -- to smooth the economy. Dozens of Federal programs, however, quickly and automatically adjust spending to buffer changes in private spending. And once Washington is locked politically on a path toward zero deficit, some of this buffer is likely to be stripped away.
Brad DeLong, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, estimates that 25 to 30 percent of personal income lost in recessions is offset by the lower tax bite on those reduced earnings, while roughly 7 percent is made up in Government transfers. And "that 7 percent, mostly unemployment insurance and food stamps, goes to people who really need it," he argues.
Still others are dismayed with the way the new Republican majority in Congress has built an antideficit coalition at the expense of the lower third of the income distribution. Businesses with close ties to the Republicans -- from sugar beet growers to distillers of ethanol for motor fuel -- will retain their perquisites. Investors will be tossed a long-awaited bone in the form of a cut in the capital gains tax. And even families with six-figure incomes will get tax credits for children.
To pay for this lagniappe, welfare, college grants for the poor and Medicaid will take heavy hits. And low-wage workers will lose part of what was once seen as the conservatives' answer to dependence on Washington, the earned income tax credit.
Those sympathetic with the Republican approach defend the need to get Uncle Sam off the backs of both the middle class and the rich. "In my view, the tax cuts don't go far enough to encourage work and investment," said Dean Stansel, a fiscal policy analyst at the libertarian CATO Institute in Washington.
But the distributional impact has many veterans from the deficit wars shaking their heads.
"The family tax cut is wasted money," argues Dale Jorgensen, a Harvard economist. "It uses a lot of revenue with no payoff in economic growth."
Paul Tsongas, the former Democratic Senator from Massachusetts who now leads a bipartisan lobbying group for deficit reduction, adds that the tax cuts "have undermined the sense of shared sacrifice."
Probably the most damning attack on deficit reduction, though, comes from economists who fear Washington has been miscast as a wastrel -- and that budget cuts are likely to lead to lower, not higher, national savings.
To clarify the point, look at the (often abused) analogy between the Government's budget and that of a family. If a family earns $50,000, spends $60,000 and has nothing to show for it at year-end except more credit card debt, it has "dissaved" $10,000. Suppose, though, the family earns $50,000, spends $40,000 and uses the rest for a down payment on a $100,000 house.
The family is out-of-pocket $140,000, but no one would say it has negative savings of $90,000 -- the difference between income and outlays. Its assets have grown by $100,000, while its debts have risen just $90,000, implying that the family is $10,000 richer. By contrast, the Federal budget makes no distinction between consumption and savings and investment. Hence a change in the deficit may reflect a change in consumption (pension checks) or a change in public wealth (buildings).
Robert Eisner, a former president of the American Economic Association, has argued that government gets a bum rap largely because its investments exceed the depreciation of government-generated assets.
He notes that spending at all levels of government exceeded revenues by $193 billion in 1991. He estimates, however, that governments invested $530 billion in everything from B-2's to teachers' salaries while existing government assets depreciated by a lesser amount -- $361 billion. Figured the way a family (or corporation) would calculate its budget, the true deficit is $193 billion less the increase in government wealth ($530 billion minus $361 billion). And this comes to just $24 billion.
THESE calculations are necessarily crude. There is no generally accepted method for writing off nuclear missiles. Nor is there an obvious way of deciding what portion of Medicaid represents compassion, and what portion is an investment in future productivity.
But Mr. Nordhaus of Yale offers a way of finessing such details. He notes that anxiety with budget deficits derives from concern that the national savings rate, both public and private, is too low. And if that is the case, he suggests, the degree of anxiety ought to be linked to the trend in savings rather than the absolute level.
Conventional estimates of gross savings show the rate has indeed fallen from 17.3 percent of national income in 1955 to a measly 12.5 percent in 1993. Mr. Nordhaus, however, believes that the estimates, which dismiss investments in education, the military and health as consumption, distort the trend. Adding back in these intangible contributions to future welfare, Mr. Nordhaus concludes that "the genuine savings rate is essentially constant."
Deficit hawks like Mr. Kotlikoff of Boston University are not impressed. The bottom line, they stress, is not the trend in the savings rate, but whether savings are adequate to keep the economy growing fast enough to pay for the retirement of the baby boomers. Mr. Eisner concedes the point, but argues that the path of least political resistance to deficit reduction is as likely to reduce the rate of growth as it is to raise it. And here, he has quiet allies in President Clinton's economists.
According to the Council of Economic Advisers, by the time the Republicans balanced the budget, Federal investments on research and development would be down by a third. And the politics of the process make it likely that the programs that remain are the least productive -- like NASA's space station. By the same token, Republican cuts in grants for education would hit a productive form of investment.
A different approach -- one that raised taxes on private consumption and curtailed Government transfer payments (in particular, Social Security) -- would hurt Federal investments less and thus might increase the economy's capacity to grow.
But while the Administration is more sensitive to the pitfalls of cutting Government investment, Democrats, too, are under pressure to keep Social Security cuts and tax increases off the table. That largely explains why Mr. Solow is prepared to pull his punches on deficit reduction. "If Americans won't pay for education with taxes," he explains, "I'd pay for it by borrowing."
All this may leave politically aware Americans uneasy. Deficit reduction has become the mantra of responsible government. But the real goal, generating enough savings to prepare America to meet its looming economic obligations, is several steps removed from the process. And the politics of getting from here to there are tortuous.
THE consequences of failing to prepare for tomorrow's problems cannot be entirely lost on either President Clinton or the Republican leadership. Even accounting for the Republicans' proposed whack at Medicare, a long-term solution to the deficit is not at hand.
"Every year of delay shifts another percentage point of the budget from discretionary spending to entitlements that largely benefit the middle class," reminds Senator Kerrey. Hence many analysts remain hopeful that after this budget impasse is broken, deficit reduction will focus on curtailing consumption by Americans who can afford it.
"This is just the appetizer to the main course ahead," suggests Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "Success now would help to make the meal digestible."
 
A Sea of Red Ink, or Just a Puddle?
 The combined 1991 state and Federal budget deficits were just over $193 billion, according to Government figures. But if Washington accounted for public finances the way most businesses do, the gap would narrow sharply, according to a study by Robert Eisner of Northwestern Universtiy. Instead of treating long-term investments like education, research and infrastructure as expenses that get charged to the books immediately, the Governemtn could capitalize those items. They then would be charged over time, or depreciated, as the benefits of the investments are enjoyed.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Remember The 50's? Stocks Sure Do

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Prices went up and up. And never was seen a discouraging trend.
So it is for the stock market in 1995. Last week, with the Washington politicians squabbling worse than ever, with talk of a possible default on Treasury securities, interest rates fell and the Dow neared 5,000. 
 In fact, few investors take the current budget battle seriously. There is great confidence that something will be worked out, bringing down the deficit and averting default. So while prices rise, Wall Street tells jokes. Did you hear about the new types of Treasury bonds to be issued to avoid default? The Gingrich bonds have no maturity, the Dole bonds bear no interest, and the Clinton bonds have no principle.
To those brought up on traditional theories of value, reading the stock tables can seem like a joke as well. The Internet stocks -- a category no one ever heard of before this year -- show amazing levitation. Uunet, an Internet-access company, went public in May with insiders selling shares at $14. What fools these insiders be. The shares traded over $95 on Friday. The company has yet to earn an operating profit. Spyglass, a competitor, is making money. Its insiders sold at $17 in May, but the stock hit $102 Friday. That's 204 times profits.
But the most amazing part of the 1995 stock market has been the relentless way it rises. So far this year, the largest drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 -- the worst you could have done in those stocks with abysmal market timing -- has been a dip of 2.4 percent. There has never been a year without a bigger fall than that. The old record is 3.6 percent, set in 1964.
To be sure, prices do fall some days. The S.& P. 500 has shown drops in 38 percent of the trading days so far this year. But that too is close to a record. Only in four years -- 1945 and three times in the placid 1950's -- has the market managed such consistent rises that the proportion of down days was below 40 percent. In three of the four following years -- all but 1946 -- share prices rose.
Added to this is the fact that the stock market has had an unprecedented run of never embarrassing a bull, even briefly. Barring a sharp plunge in the remaining six weeks, this will be the fifth consecutive year that the S.& P. 500 has not had a 10 percent drop. Never before had there been even three consecutive years that were so mild.
This is occurring because of the massive commitment of individual investors to the stock market, largely through mutual funds. It is a trend brought on by baby boomers worryied about retirement and convinced that stocks are the only long-term answer. And it is a reminder to market seers that stocks go up because there are buyers willing to pay more, a fact that may or may not be related to such things as profits and dividends.
On Wall Street, there is starting to be talk about budget cuts bringing on a recession, if not in 1996 then in 1997. Recessions, market historians know, end bull markets. But this one conceivably could spur stock purchases, simply by making the baby boomers worry even more about retirement.
All elderly people depend on Medicare for health care, and many who were forced into nursing homes have turned to Medicaid to pay those huge bills. Now, as the decisions are left to the states, that nursing home protection may vanish. In any case, Medicare seems certain to cost more.
This is the most phenomenal bull market ever, and the Internet stocks show there are some real excesses. But maybe the fearful boomers will keep it going for a long time.

HEADLINE: Harlem on Her Mind

BYLINE: By LISA ANDERSON 

 BODY:
THE ride from the airport was almost over. We were near home -- at least the place that would be my home for the next year. My new landlady, a friend of my aunt, had picked me up at La Guardia and was giving me a brief tour of the neighborhood.
 "This is Striver's Row," she said, as we passed Volvos and other imports dotting a street that appeared more arboreous than its neighbors. 
 "And there is Eddie," she added, as we rounded the corner onto a street that was noticeably less tranquil. "I'm sure you'll meet him soon." I followed her gaze to a shabby, bespectacled man pushing an oversize shopping cart filled with a broom, garbage bags and odds and ends. "Yeah, right," I thought. "I'm going to bond with the street man!"
I didn't know what I was getting into on Aug. 23, 1994, when I moved to New York City to go to graduate school at Columbia and rented a room in a brownstone on 140th Street between Frederick Douglass Boulevard and Edgecombe Avenue. The only New York I knew, from family and college trips and a razzle-dazzle scholarship tour, was the one of Broadway theaters, the Pierre Hotel, Macy's and Windows on the World.
I was 22 years old, the child of well-traveled, hard-working West Indian professionals, the product of secure Houston suburbs, private schools and four years at Princeton. In my world were the black folk who were the nurses and the scientists, the teachers and the engineers, the lawyers and the corporate vice presidents. In my world, professionals didn't live around the corner from the underclass. The only ghetto my sister or I ever saw as children was the gritty Fifth Ward in Houston; my father wanted to encourage us to keep working rigorously. These worn houses, he said, were where bad grades could send us.
To put it simply, when it came to Harlem, I was clueless.
I had never seen used condoms or crack vials on the ground on a simple walk to the mailbox. I had never been in a place where people had to grab their home-delivered newspapers before thieves took them to sell. I had never thought I would fear clusters of black men at my subway exit. I had never before come head to head with a world so unlike my own. And it repulsed me.
My reflection in that world was disquieting. It bounced back as limited, elitist. If I were white, it wouldn't have surprised anyone that I didn't bond with the locals. If I had lived on Striver's Row, the "street-comfy" people would have kept some distance. But I wasn't white, and I wasn't on Striver's Row.
Sifting through my year in Harlem made me aware of my unspoken assumptions and beliefs about who I was, as an educated woman, as a black woman. I lost the comfortable illusion that we were all one big, classless society, and that made me realize how much easier it is to talk about race than class, how much you have to reveal about yourself to talk about class.
I look back on that year with some regret about my aloofness. But even now, I don't think I could have been any other way.
Two days after I moved in, I met Eddie. He was the Harlem professional's dream: a self-appointed protector and handyman, ears to the ground, eyes-on-your-front-porch neighborhood gem. He was a kind of buffer who was "down" with those on the street, but knew and respected the concerns of better-off, homeowning families.
It took me months to figure out that this man, who pushed an oversize shopping cart, had a sick mother in Westchester and a home to go to at night.
The people I stayed with let him use their phone in emergencies, and, when he asked for money, hired him to do odd jobs.
They were sophisticated Midwesterners, people who sent their daughter to prep school at Exeter, then to Brown University. They were kind and admirable. How many people with the means to live elsewhere would choose to live in Harlem, to support a struggling neighborhood that was not even a place of their youth? They patronized the local barber, baker and dry cleaner. They accepted with grace inconveniences that irritated me: A guy at Domino's told me he wouldn't deliver to my address; I had to walk several blocks to find an ATM; there were diners but no bookish cafes.
They wrestled with unenthusiastic bankers to get the money to renovate their house, a historic three-story brick home with a basement apartment. They made a point of using local plumbers, electricians and other service people. They kept track of developments in the area, like the distinctively new, orangish low-rises that they explained were low-to-moderate-income housing units.
But they didn't pretend the area was problem-free. They took their son to the Harlem School of the Arts to dance, but not to public school. The only street-comfy people I saw them chat with were Eddie and a woman who came by to ask for money.
Eddie was their ears and eyes. Eddie knew everything. And, in a sense, he measured the distance between their beautifully stained front door and the boarded-up building at the end of the block.
I was getting a snack in the kitchen at 3:15 A.M. one day in those first months, and heard clanging. I peeked out to see Eddie hauling trash. It was just one of the jobs he did as he roamed the surrounding blocks night and day -- washing cars, sweeping sidewalks, fixing what was broken and on a few occasions opening the taxi door when I came home after dark.
This was Eddie's domain. And he knew that there were people in his domain who would hassle me and that there would be times when I was afraid.
Like the dusky evening in early September, just a few weeks after my arrival. "This place might not be so bad," I thought, strolling past neat, prim brownstones to the subway. Suddenly, a voice crept out of the walls like God out of nowhere: "I saw you pass this way earlier. I'm watching you."
I panicked. I had no idea who or where he was. There was no one on the steps. No one behind me. No one in front. The only place left to look was a cornerful of shadows by a basement apartment. And I wasn't about to look there. I walked, fast, out. So I wasn't sneering at any offers of protection. "Just tell them that Eddie said to leave you alone," he'd say, and I would nod politely.
It didn't take me long to realize that Eddie was an interesting character. He said he had lived in the area as a youth and graduated from a local high school.
But I never found out why he spent his time patrolling the streets. The truth was that I didn't really want to know about Eddie's life, at least not badly enough to befriend him. I was studying journalism, and the newshound in me was ashamed, for not pursuing a source that would clearly bring me stories far more real than the ones I tapped out at school. The Christian in me was guilty, for not having the guts to be kind to someone who was difficult to be kind to.
Eddie probed to find out where I had been and where I was going. He stood and watched and gave patronizing advice as I fumbled with my keys to get into the house. He told me to "stop walking so fast," because my midtown pace was out of place among the languorous gaits around me. He was a constant reminder of the fear I had of my foreign surroundings.
One day he said that "his men" had told him I came in past midnight from a night on the town. I freaked.
Eddie reminded me too much of the stereotypical black street culture. I looked at him and his cart, his crooked teeth and worn clothes, and I saw the people who hung out on their stoops instead of working 9 to 9, and the teen-age girls pushing their baby carriages in the subway. The only way anyone would confuse me with any of that is: I'm black.
If I couldn't deal with Eddie like I dealt with other people in my world -- with a basic level of respect -- then it was pointless to deal with him at all. If I didn't make some kind of natural space for Eddie in my world, then I would have to acknowledge a very strong class distinction. And I didn't want to deal with that.
I blew up at him and told him to leave me alone. And then I just didn't deal with Eddie.
 
DIFFERENT DREAMS
 Harlem means a lot more to a lot of people than its buildings and environs. It's almost a black archetype. But not to me. I was born in the West Indies. I don't know what family stories the people born here are told, but my stories were of Jamaica.
We moved to the United States in '79 -- and not to New York. We moved to a conservative, almost all-white Houston suburb. I could count the other black students in my private high school on one hand. My best friends included a Hispanic girl and a girl from Laos. One year, there was a girl from Thailand, but she hated America. When she left, it significantly reduced the school's minority population.
There were points when other black people made me feel that I wasn't black enough, like the athlete who said that I was the studious type "they" liked. The one time I ran into lots of black people was at track meets. My need to focus before a race would be interpreted as standoffishness. They would hear me talk, and I didn't sound like them. They saw me hanging out with my white teammates. I felt bad vibes from them, and that was annoying. I didn't have to prove that I was black. In my mind, and in my parents minds', I was doing what every child, black or white, should do. I was part of a culture of people who worked hard, studied, accomplished things. Conforming to other people's ideas of blackness wasn't going to make me any more black.
At Princeton, there was a black lunch table, but I ate with friends from my dorm -- a blond Californian, a black woman from Trenton, a clean-cut girl from Pennsylvania, an Italian from New York, a Pakistani Bostonian. I felt like I was getting looks from the black table. I wanted to be friends with some of the people there, but I wanted to get to know them in a more natural way -- from classes or parties or non-race-related interests. I wasn't going to go sit at the black table.
In my college years, I started reading more about race. I reveled in classes on black literature and developed a penchant for books by contemporary black authors. I read a lot of Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, Stephen Carter, Arthur Ashe, Ellis Cose, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and a lot of academic stuff. Many books referred to Harlem in the 20's. It took on an almost mythological aura of greatness, with great clubs and famous people. I got a sense of economic and social stability. But I never felt driven to get a clear picture of what it was all about. I knew, and respected, that many people dreamed of recreating the Harlem Renaissance. But they weren't my dreams. And if my aunt's friends hadn't paved my road into Harlem, I would never have come.
 
ON THE STREET
 After I got there, I was mystified when one new neighbor said he had moved to Harlem because of its sense of community. When people called it a good place to live, I thought, "What? Are you kidding?" It was one thing to shop on 125th Street and visit the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Riverside Church and the Studio Museum in Harlem. It was another altogether to walk home at night and hear a young braggart assuring his female companion that the alias he had concocted would help him avoid the police.
My insides convulsed with disgust when I walked to the mailbox on the next block. Children played tag on mangled sidewalks -- the concrete shattered, as though something below were sucking it under. There were some renovated apartment houses, but the unrenovated ones were more striking. They exuded a stench of mustiness, urine, something aged and something unknown. I could not believe people actually lived in them until I saw heads poking out of windows and heard voices calling to neighbors.
On the street, men called to me. It was more than the catcalls you could expect anywhere. There's nothing like being a black woman in an all-black part of town. The men seemed to expect interaction, because I was a "sistah." When I did not respond, some men helpfully repeated their comments in Spanish.
For refusing to answer, I won insults about my uppityness and conjectures about my affinity for people of my own race.
One day, I ignored persistent crescendos of "Hey Half Pint!" When the yeller finally had to admit that audibility was not the problem, he changed his cry to: "She thinks she is all that! So it's like that, huh? You ain't all that beautiful! You're nothing!"
A passerby joined in. "Now, if he hadn't called you Half Pint, you probably would have responded, now, wouldn't you?" I shrugged; he didn't give up. "How should we brothers address you? Tell us so that we know what we are supposed say. How about, 'Good afternoon, my beautiful sister'?"
I gave up and said hello. But I was thinking: "He doesn't get it. I don't want to be called anything on these streets. Period."
The rare times I did interact, I felt safer talking to women. Even so, I was still suspicious of the woman who called to me from a parked car on St. Nicholas Avenue. I was sure she was in cahoots with someone lurking in her back seat. I stood in my skates, a respectable distance from her window, teetering backwards dangerously close to traffic and skeptically asked her what she wanted. My overreaction was clear. She only wanted to know what kind of skates I had bought and how much a pair would cost her.
 
AT THE EDGE
 I told myself that I could do anything for one year, but I almost gave up on Harlem early last winter when two local crimes prompted me, sobbing and shaken with fear, to call my parents at 2 A.M.
In January the body of a 16-year-old girl was found in St. Nicholas Park just two blocks west of where I lived. My usual jog was on a path near that park. One month later, a woman riding the downtown C train was stabbed to death as it entered the 135th Street station at 6:16 in the evening. She was stabbed in the third car -- the one that stopped just a few feet away from the lone downtown bench, a bench I would have been occupying at 6:15 that night -- but my professor had canceled class.
Three days later, a check arrived from my grandmother: taxi money. I began to rethink my policy of subway before 11 P.M., taxi after. Each night before I made the decision, I asked myself, "Do I want to be leaving a Harlem subway at this time tonight?" And I debated which train to take. Sometimes the wait for a local to 135th, where I usually felt safer, seemed endless. The five blocks from the express stop at 145th had its own set of obstacles.
At night, the scene there was usually the same. On one side of the walk a long line of hungry patrons followed the whiff of fried fish to a basement stand. On the other side a group of leering men leaned on cars and hurled innuendoes. They could see I despised them, and that made it worse.
I knew there were things to be edgy about, but sometimes I wished I could deal with it better. But I had a moment of reprieve one day, when I saw a woman suddenly startled by a thunderous pop as we left the 135th Street station. She looked hesitantly around, and we began chatting. She was a real Harlem resident, and she was scared, too.
 
PRIDE, OR REGRET
 I didn't pack up in the middle of the semester. The people I lived with were an absolute joy. Nowhere else would I have gotten so much in return for giving so little.
Friends said they admired me for "sticking it out" -- but I wasn't proud of how I'd handled it.
Then there were the words of my college roommate, who listened sympathetically during our incessant phone calls, but chided me gently: "There but for the grace of God." She didn't have to say any more.
In August, two weeks before my father arrived in a U-Haul to help me move out, I was enjoying a sunny Sunday afternoon, walking home after church. As I rounded the corner, I saw two cops chasing a man in bright yellow pants. He clambered up the fence, but the two managed to bring him down. I ran inside, and when I looked out the window, two cops had turned into eight, all with batons. All for the arrest of this lone black man. A mix of suspicions and relief overwhelmed me. I was always glad to see the cops sitting at the top of the hill at 140th Street. Many mornings I had walked out the front door and breathed, "I'm glad you guys are on that hill today." But three squad cars and eight cops? For one graying, middle-aged man? I couldn't help but wonder.
I left Harlem in August -- unharmed, relieved and regretful. My fears had driven me to ignore, despise and imagine the worst about all the people I saw. I didn't make any attempt to differentiate between the truly malicious and those who would have done me no harm. I ignored, along with the whistles, the good mornings and the good afternoons and most decisively, the humanity of the people I passed.
Eddie was still there, and I still didn't deal with Eddie. I wished I could cut him some slack, but by then, it would have been too much work. I would have had to at least explain why, after months of avoidance, I would even give him the time of day. It was the same with the rest of the street-comfy people. As far as I was concerned, we were from different worlds and had nothing in common other than darkened pigment. There were clear boundaries and I didn't want them breached.
But I couldn't escape my own nagging thoughts: it wouldn't have killed me to see the faces; it wouldn't have killed me to get to know some of the people who were locked into a world I feared, but could leave whenever I chose. It wouldn't have killed me to have befriended someone like Eddie.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
A Tale of Two Christopher Streets

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
IT'S lunchtime at Smil'in Jacks, a cafe at Christopher and Washington Streets, but George Tassone, the owner, is wearing an unmistakable frown. "Where is everybody?" he asks as he surveys empty tables at the restaurant he christened this month. "If I had known it was going to be this bad, I wouldn't have opened."
Most of Mr. Tassone's neighbors are also having a hard time making ends meet, and vacant storefronts litter this western spur of Christopher Street like broken teeth in an otherwise healthy mouth. But a few blocks east, on the other side of Hudson Street, things at the Espresso Bar couldn't be better. "Business is great," says the owner, Hugo Cory, as a dozen customers wait in a line. "We're busy morning, noon and night." 
 These days Christopher Street, the traditional heart of gay New York and one of Greenwich Village's main shopping thoroughfares, is a tale of two streets. East of Hudson Street, it is the best of times: crowds are thick and vacancies are rare. But to the west, from Hudson Street to the Hudson River, foot traffic slows to a trickle and nearly a quarter of the two dozen or so storefronts along the five forlorn blocks are begging for tenants.
"The two sides are like two different worlds," Mr. Cory said. "We're glad to be on this side." A 500-square-foot store that fetches $4,000 a month on Christopher's eastern end typically rents for $2,500 to the west, says Chuck Stephan, a broker with Montante, a real estate firm.
But even up and down Christopher Street's western stretch are signs that the worst of times may be coming to an end. Besides the newly arrived Smil'in Jacks, a dry cleaner and a coffee shop, Station Cafe, plan to open next month. And another newcomer to the street's western half, Dolly Rokkas, who opened Sweet Life Cafe nine months ago, is far more upbeat than Mr. Tassone. "In the beginning, we thought there would be problems," she said, "but business has been better than we expected."
Joel Laiter, who owns half the block between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, sees the area as poised for a resurgence. "For Rent" signs have come down from two of the three empty storefronts on the block. One will be occupied by the Station Cafe; the other by a restaurant. "This block could be awesome, like a bit of Paris," Mr. Laiter said. "It's the last frontier in the Village and it's ready to boom."
Christopher Street's troubles began in the early 1980's, when a police crackdown in Times Square drove petty thieves and drug dealers to the western corner of the Village, long considered a place where anything goes. "Every lowlife flocked here, and our crime went up 110 percent," said Dave Poster, who founded the volunteer Christopher Street Patrol in 1990 to combat a rash of muggings and robberies. The patrol and an increased police presence have helped reduce crime significantly in the last five years, said Officer Mike Singer, community affairs officer at the Sixth Precinct.
But crime is just one element of Christopher Street's problems, which are also rooted in the AIDS epidemic and racial and class prejudice. AIDS has devastated a generation of gay men who once made Christopher Street on both sides of Hudson Street a chic shopping destination. And cheaper rents in Chelsea are drawing the younger generation of gay residents and merchants.
At the westernmost end of Christopher stands a sobering reminder of the epidemic -- Bailey House, a residence for homeless people with AIDS in what was once the River Hotel and its Grand Corniche restaurant, two glitzy ventures that went under in the early 1980's. "What was once a giddy walk to the piers now symbolically and literally ends with AIDS," said William K. Dobbs, a gay rights advocate. "Doesn't that say everything about Christopher Street?"
But many people say racism has played an even larger role in western Christopher Street's economic downturn. Over the last decade, the street has become a haven for gay black and Hispanic youths who flock to what is a corridor of tolerance. Local merchants complain that boisterous teen-agers who congregate on stoops and street corners scare away potential shoppers. The Neutral Zone, a storefront drop-in center for gay teen-agers at 162 Christopher Street, opened three years ago. But some merchants and residents say it has failed to solve the loitering problem and are pressing the center to leave the street.
Newly enacted zoning regulations that restrict adult businesses citywide would sweep away the half-dozen sex-related stores that now line the street, something that pleases many -- but not all -- merchants. Bob Kohler, who has owned the Loft, a Christopher Street clothing store, for 17 years, believes that sex-oriented businesses are part of the street's lifeblood. "These places help Christopher Street keep its gay identity and actually draw people with money to the neighborhood," he said. "Most of them blend right in."
The Archive, a luxury rental apartment building that takes up the block bounded by Greenwich, Washington, Christopher and Barrow Streets, was once heralded as an elixir to the street's problems. As it was developed in the early 80's, there was talk of large retailers like Bloomingdale's moving to the hulking, red-brick structure. But while all its 479 apartments were rented, most of its 40,000 square feet of commercial space remained dark until two years ago. Today, a gym, a theater and several businesses tied to the photography trade occupy its storefronts. "There just isn't enough life down here to support retail," said Patricia Dunphy, leasing director for Rockrose Development Corporation, which owns the Archive. Across the street at Smil'in Jacks, the manager, Eric Shaw, hopes to survive until warmer weather brings waterfront-bound crowds to the street. Food sales, at $200 a day, are less than a quarter of what was projected. "This is rough," he said. "If we could only get people to cross Hudson Street, we'd be in heaven."

HEADLINE: Deficits Have Kept Us Out of a Depression

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Deficit-Cutting's International" (Week in Review, Nov. 12) outlines how European countries are reducing deficit spending. You restate the common economic belief that deficits "bring high interest rates and divert investment from its most productive uses." 
 You acknowledge that budget cuts are "clouding the prospects for economic growth and reducing high unemployment rates." If the cuts produce such dire consequences and social unrest as well, are not the deficits more desirable?
You add that Italy's national debt, 122 precent of annual output, and Belgium's, 138 percent of output, would cause banks to laugh at individuals with such credit records. Maybe not. It is normal for individuals to take out home mortgages that are 300 percent of their incomes. The United States debt, 63 percent of output, is relatively trivial.
American budget-balancing and debt reduction in the 1920's was followed by the Great Depression of the 30's, a pattern common to all six major depressions in this country's history.
The virtually unbroken deficits since the 1930's may have enabled us to avoid another crash, the longest depression-free period in history.

HEADLINE: Mission Impassable;
After a Budget Side Show, This Way to the Egress

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FINALLY, the main event. Congress's votes to send President Clinton the Republicans' budget reconciliation bill, with its seven-year balanced budget, tax cut and sharp curbs of Medicare and Medicaid spending, will take a very serious fight beyond side issues.
The national debt and partial closing of the Government are hardly trivial, but as political problems they do not approach the one posed by the budget -- just how big a role the Federal Government should have in American life. 
 That is the issue, obscured by childish squabbles over tee times and face time, that must now be solved. For the choice, as Speaker Newt Gingrich contends, may be "the largest domestic decision since 1933," determining whether the central government remains the guarantor of basic standards in areas like health, welfare and the environment, or whether states and individuals can do it better.
Both sides underestimated their opposition's determination and climbed out on limbs. Each side's preferred solution, of course, is to push the other off the limb. But, as William Kristol, the conservative strategist, said last week, "I'm not sure either side has that much leverage."
That does not stop both sides from predicting victory. "I think the President will come our way," said Tony Blankley, Mr. Gingrich's press secretary. Democrats sound confident that Medicare is so important to voters that sooner or later Republicans will give up their plans to tamper with the program's future.
If neither side gives up -- and now that Mr. Clinton is swearing that he will veto the budget, some of the Congressmen who feared his inconstancy are getting weak in the knees -- there will be an impasse that makes this month's fights over debt and spending seem like no more than a morning traffic tie-up.
The problem is less the policy chasm between the two sides than the uncompromising political personalities of the 73 House Republican freshmen, and a leadership who that sometimes seem to lead by following them. Except for that signal characteristic of the 104th Congress, which reflects an almost Biblical sense of destiny after 40 years in the political wilderness, there would be ways to bridge the chasm.
In another political era, perhaps just last year, it would have been no trick at all to compromise the basic budget disputes between President Clinton and Congress.
The Republicans have voted to balance the budget in seven years, with $245 billion in tax cuts. That goal requires taking $270 billion from the growth of Medicare, and biting deeply into Medicaid, education and programs meant to protect the environment. Democrats say those cuts are too deep. But Democrats are increasingly eager to say they want a balanced budget, too.
So, what kind of a deal would you make?
Thomas S. Foley, whose career as Speaker was ended by the Republican revolution last election day, offered a simple prescription: "Think about the possibility of an eight-year period, without the tax cut." With this approach, each side could claim to have put the good of the country ahead of diehard stubbornness. Each side would have some political cover when spending reductions begin to pinch.
But Mr. Foley confesses that he does not know if such an approach is possible with the House's Republican freshman contingent, elected as sworn enemies of the compromise as evil business as usual.
Another Washington veteran, former Senator and Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat, says compromise cannot be achieved now: "First they have to find that they are not going to have their way on everything. It just doesn't work that way."
Things might also be fixed easily with some revisions in the economic assumptions provided by the Congressional Budget Office. Republicans have insisted on using its economic estimates, more conservative than most others, including the Administration's. Because they project less tax revenue, they require deeper spending cuts. A very light finger on the scales, if it put the C.B.O. at the middle of current economic forecasts instead of the bottom, would free up hundreds of billions of estimated dollars. But the C.B.O. has never played that way.
One recourse that requires neither compromise nor surrender -- just patience -- was offered from St. Louis by former Senator John C. Danforth. He argued that his fellow Republicans cannot compromise or give up their cause of cutting spending to balance the budget. But he said that if the President remains firm and his vetoes are sustained, they may have to wait until the Presidential election next year to finish that fight.
"We could take the high ground," Mr. Danforth said, "and say we are not going to allow the country to be hurt" by Government shutdowns and high-wire management of the national debt. Republicans could then go along with spending and debt measures that will last through the election, and allow the American people to show, he said, "whether they really mean it when they say they want to balance the budget, or to keep on spending."
President Clinton seems to like the idea of making the election a referendum.
In an interview last week with CBS News, Mr. Clinton said of the budget dispute, "If we take it right into the next election, let the American people decide." If the people want the Republican budget, he said, "they're entitled to another President, and that's the only way they are going to get it."
The idea has some appeal to conservatives outside Congress, like Mr. Kristol or Mickey Edwards, the former Republican Congressman from Oklahoma who now teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Mr. Edwards thinks the idea might sell, but only if President Clinton understands that Republicans have to have some immediate victory, like Representative Ernest Istook's amendment prohibiting political activity by recipients of Federal grants (a proposal whose foes say is so unconstitutional that it would immediately be enjoined anyway).
The Republican leaders "have to be able to show their freshmen members that 'we didn't win it all in one fell swoop, but we're on our way,' " Mr. Edwards said. "Outside of that, I don't think Newt has any flexibility."
 
Dole's Quiet Time
 The player with the least flexibility of all may be Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader and the most experienced deal-maker involved. Mr. Dole's hopes for the Presidency require him to court the absolutists in his party. Even so, his once-sharp tongue has been muted, at least by comparison to Mr. Gingrich's.
Another essential to agreement -- even if it is only agreeing to disagree -- is a greater level of civility.
On Friday night, House members got into a shoving match.
Yesterday, the House erupted into partisan shouting after Representative John L. Mica said of Mr. Clinton and his shifting views on budget balancing, "We're here to nail the little bugger down." He was ruled out of order, but the No. 3 Republican leader, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, pushed through a motion to let him resume speaking.
Any sort of agreement will not come easy, though. If both sides agree on a way to commit themselves to balancing the budget, and they may, the arguments over how to balance it will finally begin. And then, if nothing is settled by Christmas, the national debt and the threat of default will take center stage again.
No wonder Congress is keeping most of its staff on the payroll as essential.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Little Hope Pumps Up An Attitude

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
FIDEL CASTRO seems to have a new spring in his step since returning from his recent visit to New York and the United Nations, and his brightened outlook has quickly percolated through a state and party apparatus that has always taken its cues from him. After enduring his six worst years since his revolution swept him to power nearly 37 years ago, Mr. Castro and his Government once again seem to be directing, rather than reacting to, events.
They also seem to have drawn a singular lesson from their recent successes: Perhaps there is no further need for their regime to loosen up, either toward political freedom, or toward more open markets. 
 Whether dealing with the Clinton Administration, Cuban exiles, the 11 million people on this island or the growing number of foreign businesses seeking a foothold here, "the Cuban Government is once again acting in a triumphalist manner," one foreign diplomat said. Last year's crisis of people fleeing the island on rafts is gradually fading in memory, as Mr. Castro, invigorated and even cocky, has begun reaping the benefits of the efforts he launched then to improve his position at home and abroad.
 
A Very Good Year
 His five-day foray in New York capped what has been an unusually active year for him on the international diplomatic stage, and the result has been a strengthening of Cuba's ties with the rest of the world, including some of America's closest allies. Since August alone, he has attended regional conferences of heads of state in Trinidad, Colombia and Argentina, and Cuba now has full diplomatic relations with almost every country in the hemisphere. Just last week, a European Union delegation arrived here to begin discussions on an economic cooperation agreement.
That can only whet the appetite of American business executives, who showed during his trip that they are eager for a loosening of the longstanding embargo on trade with and travel to Cuba -- a principal goal of Mr. Castro's Government. Indeed, with the United Nations having condemned the embargo again -- by a 117-3 vote this year -- Mr. Castro has taken to suggesting that the Clinton Administration, by discouraging private investment, has impeded Cuba's transformation from a doggedly Stalinist command economy to a Chinese-style "socialist market" economy.
At home, Mr. Castro has been bolstered by the recent performance of Cuba's economy, which had been in a virtual free fall since the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1989, contracting by more than one-third. Cuban officials now forecast 2.5 percent growth for 1995.
But the turnaround of the Cuban economy has been due principally to the impact of reforms about which Mr. Castro still harbors deep reservations, such as the 212 joint-venture and other investment agreements his Government has signed with foreign companies, and the opening of farmers' markets. For that reason, the spurt of growth appears to have slowed, not encouraged, the Government's willingness to undertake further economic reforms. Measures to broaden the right of self employment and slim the size of the Government work force, which six months ago were said to be close to ratification, are now on hold, for example.
"They seem to be drawing the wrong lessons from what has happened," said one frustrated Latin American diplomat here. "Instead of looking on the promising results they have obtained thus far as a signal to press on and open further, they appear to be telling themselves that they have now done all they need to get by."
 
A Very Bare Minimum
 On the human rights front too, Mr. Castro appears still inclined to cede no more than the absolute minimum, and that only under pressure. In a report last month, Human Rights Watch/Americas noted that in order to "facilitate its full integration into the world community -- and thus the world economy -- the Cuban Government is trying to improve its human rights image." The report identified some "positive developments" but pointed out that "the country's repressive legal structure remains unchanged" and suggested that "in the absence of real reform, this year's positive developments may be fleeting."
Recent efforts to set up independent press outlets have been stymied, for instance, and Mr. Castro remains adamant about keeping "dissidents or opposition" off the state controlled media. "I will be frank with you," Mr. Castro said in an interview with Telemundo, a Spanish-language TV network in the United States. "They have no access, and they will have none, because we are not going to give any opportunities to those who want to destroy the revolution."
Taken together, Mr. Castro's improved prospects at home and abroad, and the renewed self-confidence they have engendered, suggest it is going to be more difficult than ever to cajole him down the path of true change. If neither the carrot nor the stick seems to work, that means the rest of the world is going to have to take him -- or leave him -- as he is.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
How Sanctions Bit -- Serbia's Neighbors

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: SKOPJE, Macedonia

 BODY:
GRANTED, three years of international trade sanctions may have helped to nudge Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian strongman, to peace talks in Dayton, Ohio. But at whose expense?
Ordinary Serbs were inconvenienced by shortages and higher prices, but there were no images of dying Serb children to truly undermine the Serbian President's hold on power. Nor did sanctions appreciably slow the Serb war machine (though the forces of Croatia and NATO did) because Serb forces never lacked for imported fuel and other supplies from the outside world. 
 Rather, the most lasting and overlooked damage of sanctions may have been the corruption they encouraged in surrounding countries like Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Hungary and Romania. These countries -- all formerly Communist lands professing to be fledgling democracies, and all major trading partners of Serbia -- were ill-equipped to enforce sanctions from the outset and, in the end, fell victim to the irresistible temptation to evade them.
Should Mr. Milosevic sign a peace deal in Dayton and thereby win an end to the West's embargo, the economic consequences to Serbia's neighbors might well, in time, be overcome. But the criminality and criminal ethos that sanctions have fostered will be much harder to dispel.
During one recent week, according to a report of the European Union's sanctions-monitoring office in Brussels, 782 trucks moved from Macedonia into Serbia, laden with computers, food and chemicals, and 466 came out of Serbia into Macedonia, hauling everything from copper tubing to frozen raspberries. Commerce on such a scale could not take place without the complicity of Macedonian officials high and low. "Look at almost any company that has violated sanctions and you will find a member of Parliament is the head of it," said a Western diplomat here.
In Romania, international sanctions monitors discovered a creative Serbian fuel-smuggling scheme. Yugoslav Airlines passenger flights were flying daily -- with no passengers -- from Belgrade to the Romanian city of Timisoara. The route was lucrative nonetheless, for the planes returned to Belgrade with tanks brimming, up to 5,000 gallons of fuel on each flight. Romanian officials told Western officials there was nothing they could do about it because a senior Government minister was involved in the business.
In Albania, oil trade with Serbia is by far the country's largest enterprise. In impoverished northern Albania, which has more sheep than cars, there are 39 gas stations in less than 20 miles along a narrow road almost devoid of cars. The fuel is pumped into containers, taken to the river and then sent to Serbia. Diplomats and sanctions monitors in Tirana say that senior Albanian officials have their hands in the trade and that it is controlled by organized crime elements, which are more powerful than the fledgling state's police.
The formerly Communist states don't shoulder all the blame. Oil companies in Greece and Italy have supplied the oil going to Serbia through Albania. In August, Greek companies shipped more than 9,000 tons of oil to Albania, most of which was then smuggled to Serbia, European sanctions monitors say.
Greek officials have heatedly denied complicity in the illegal trade. Italian companies are the culprits, they say (which they were, until the Greek oil traders overtook them, according to European Union reports). Besides, the Greeks say, there is nothing illegal about trading with Albania. True enough, but, Western officials counter, if the oil were going from Albania to a Greek enemy -- say, Turkish Cyprus -- Greece would find a way to stop it.
International monitoring teams, including United States customs agents, have been stationed in each of the front-line countries but have been hampered by a limited mandate: They can't arrest anyone. Reports of violations go to the United Nations and Western governments, which for the most part make sure that no violating country is publicly embarrassed. The European head of one such team described his mission as: "To see and to know, but not to do anything."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Shortfall In the Grain Fields

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
THANKS largely to rapidly increasing export demand, stores of American corn, wheat and soybeans are lower than they have been for two decades. The harvest farmers are just finishing would have been a record-setting bin-buster just 20 years ago, but it is a shortfall today, with roughly 1.5 billion more mouths to feed on the planet and a growing industrial market for vegetable oil and grain products. Grain reserves worldwide amount to a 48-day supply, the lowest level since measurements began in 1963, according to the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based environmental group. 
 What does it all mean? Not much, said Dennis Avery, head of the Center for Global Food Issues at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis. "The world has more food security than at any time in history," he said, citing improvements in agricultural tools and techniques and the trend toward freer trade in agriculture.
 
The Sky Is Falling. Really!
 Nothing could be further from the truth, said Lester R. Brown, president of Worldwatch. "The politics of scarcity is already beginning to manifest itself," he said, referring to Vietnam's brief embargo on rice exports early this year and to reports that some inland Chinese provinces limited grain shipments to populous coastal provinces. "We are moving into a period so different from the last half century that we can't even imagine how different it will be."
Mr. Avery and Mr. Brown represent two extremes in a long-running battle that tangles the boundaries of science, politics and philosophy. Optimists like Mr. Avery believe the track record of the 20th century proves that the world can innovate and grow its way out of food shortages despite rising populations, especially if governments interfere less in agricultural markets. Mr. Brown and other disciples of Thomas Malthus, the 18th century philosopher who warned about the dangers of runaway population increases, see such arguments as a complacent prelude to war, massive famines and epidemic diseases.
One thing is clear: after a long run of successes that had kept prices low and encouraged politicians and many economists to ignore and even ridicule the Malthusians, a bad spring could sow second thoughts. Experts in agribusiness agree that the current, unusually high prices for grain could skyrocket. Add a troubled harvest in Brazil and other breadbaskets in South America -- or poor conditions in the winter wheat crop here next June -- and the price of food could become an election-year issue in the United States.
Sharply higher grain prices next spring might not immediately affect consumers. Grain is a very small part of the checkout counter cost of bread and breakfast cereal. Companies like Kellogg and the Interstate Bakeries, the maker of Wonder bread, might also shield shoppers from the impact by living with lower profits or even losses until their competitors seem ready to raise prices. At the same time, meat prices could fall as livestock and poultry producers dump animals into the market rather than feed them high-priced grain. The upward pressure on food prices for Americans might be delayed for months.
Big grain importers, however, like Indonesia, Russia and China would feel the consequences of higher prices almost immediately. Hard pressed to compete with wealthier countries for grain, these developing countries might respond by expanding their own planting, with little attention to the environmental costs. Satellite photos already suggest a sharp increase this year in fires to clear more farmland in Brazil's rain forests, a direct reaction to the rising price of grain.
To relieve some of the pressure, Washington has already set aside restrictions on how much land farmers can plant next year without losing their eligibility for subsidies, a move that will bring millions of acres back into production.
 
Listening to Malthus
 A shortfall next spring would make it harder than ever for environmental groups to defend rules that limit planting on wetlands. It could also undermine the already embattled Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to idle 32 million acres of environmentally sensitive land. Much of this land, Mr. Avery and others say, could be farmed with little damage using current techniques. They argue that expanding American exports will protect rain forests and other environmentally vital areas.
Soaring prices might also make political life rough for defenders of a number of policies that have supported farmers by boosting demand in difficult times, from export subsidies to tax breaks for ethanol. Prominent members of that group are talking tough for now: Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told the National Association of Farm Broadcasters convention in Kansas City this month, "I'm not in the mood to cut the legs from under all those people who have waited all these years for higher grain prices."
But farm groups fear that a tough spring in the fields would reconfigure political reality. Their biggest nightmare: an export embargo on grain supplies large enough to protect Americans from big price increases. Previous embargoes severely damaged the nation's reputation as a reliable supplier, allowing Europe and Brazil to capture a big chunk of the market.
"You can't just jump in and out of export markets," said John Keeling, director for agricultural policy at the National Corn Growers Association. "It would be very awkward for us politically, but we'd be arguing for higher food prices for Americans."
The chances of such actions seem remote for now, even if prices soar. But the stresses could easily rise to the level where the Malthusians once again get a more respectful hearing.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/Capital Gangs;
They Started It. No, They Did. The Budget Debate Continues.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BUDGET negotiations between the Democratic White House and the Republican Congress had broken down and Federal buildings around the country were locked.
But the White House and the Capitol stayed open. Inside, by early Tuesday afternoon, politicians were pointing fingers. 
 Both sides were steeped in opinion polls, which show that the public favors a balanced budget by a large margin -- but is not willing to touch Medicare to reach the goal.
And so, just hours after Federal workers went home, President Clinton vetoed a new bill to keep the Government running, since it also raised Medicare premiums for the elderly. Then, in a 900-word statement, he said 16 different times that he favored a balanced budget.
The Republicans immediately struck back. And so on. What follows is a sampler of one afternoon's sloganeering. DAVID E. ROSENBAUM
Mr. Clinton took the lead in his statement:
Let me be clear: We must balance the budget. I proposed to Congress a balanced budget, but Congress refused to enact it. Congress has even refused to give me the line-item veto to help me achieve further deficit reduction. But we must balance this budget without unwise cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, in education and the environment. . . .
We can balance the budget without doing what they seek to do. We can balance the budget without the deep cuts in education, without the deep cuts in the environment, without letting Medicare wither on the vine, without imposing tax increases on the hardest-pressed working families in America. I am fighting for a balanced budget that is good for America and consistent with our values.
The line about letting Medicare wither on the vine was a slap at Speaker Newt Gingrich. It is what Mr. Gingrich seemed to say, in a speech last month, that he wanted to see happen, although he denies that is what he meant. As soon as the President finished his statement, Mr. Gingrich returned fire:
Because he can't win the argument between spending more and spending a whole lot more, he has to try to create a phony argument about fantasy cuts that do not exist in order to frighten people about problems that aren't real.
He talked about letting Medicare wither on the vine. The fact is that there is a 45 percent increase in general Medicare spending that is twice the inflation rate over the next seven years. Now, how anybody who has looked at the budget numbers could have this kind of gross misrepresentation is sobering.
The Republican plans would indeed permit a 45 percent increase in Medicare spending over seven years. But that is $270 billion, or 14 percent, less than what would be needed merely to keep pace with expected increases in medical costs and in the number of people eligible for the program.
As Mr. Gingrich spoke, Michael D. McCurry, the President's press secretary, had his daily briefing for reporters at the White House. He ducked a question as to whether Mr. Clinton: "would accept any increase in the Medicare premium at all."
No, no, there's, well -- how much, how technically and deeply do you want the answer to that question? I mean, it goes to the issue of current law. Current law, as you know, has got, in essence, a drop that is scheduled for Jan. 1. There was some discussion over the last 48 hours of freeze. That's off the table now because the President has vetoed the increase that was included by the Republican majority and the continuing resolution that they passed.
Here's what Mr. McCurry was talking about. The monthly Medicare premium withheld from retirees' Social Security checks is now $46.10. Unless the law is changed, it will drop to $42.50 on Jan. 1. Republicans want to raise it to $53.50. They want to do it on Jan. 1. And to do that, the increase must be enacted right away to give the Social Security Administration time to reprogram the computers.
If the premium does go up on Jan. 1, retirees might not notice it, since their Social Security checks would increase anyway. But if the premium drops on Jan. 1 and then is raised $11 later in the year, many retired people would see their Social Security checks shrink. Mr. Clinton could capitalize on that in the election year.
Some Republicans talked of freezing the premium at $46.10, but squelched the idea upon realizing they would still have the problem of smaller checks later in the year.
Meanwhile, in the Hart Office Building,the first and last meeting of the House-Senate conference committee on the big budget bill was taking place. Democrats complained that they had not the foggiest idea what was in the legislation they were being asked to vote on. That led to this exchange between Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, and Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, the top Democrat on Ways and Means:
Mr. Domenici: Last time you all did a budget reconciliation bill, we were not participants and were not invited.
Mr. Gibbons: Two wrongs don't make a right.
On the floor of the House, Representative William M. Thomas, Republican of California, accused Mr. Clinton of "political game playing" on Medicare. He continued:
They will tell you it is for good and worthy purposes. It is for down-in-the-dirt gutter politics, and you people are going to pay.
Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, asked that Mr. Thomas's last words be struck from the official record on the ground that they violated the House rule against ad hominem attacks. The parliamentarian ruled that Mr. Thomas's remarks did not amount to a violation. This exchange (somewhat abridged here) followed:
Mr. Obey: I do want to observe that when the gentleman says that something was done for reasons of down-and-dirty gutter politics and then he points his finger over here and says, "You will pay," there is no doubt in my mind who he is talking about. He told me privately that he was not talking about us. He was talking about the President of the United States.
Mr. Thomas: I appreciate his at least being honest, indicating that I told you privately, and this gentleman certainly appreciates the way in which you honor private conversations, and it will be remembered.
Mr. Obey: I did not consider that to be a private conversation. I considered it to be a conversation made on the floor of the people's House.
Mr. Thomas: Why did you characterize it as that?
Mr. Obey: Get your own time.
Mr. Thomas: Why did you characterize it as that?
Mr. Obey: Get your own time. Once today you ought to follow the rules.
And so it went. As Walter Cronkite used to say on "You Are There," it was "a day like all days, filled with the events that alter and illuminate our time."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
For the U.S., Uncertainty May Cost a Certain Price

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR decades Wall Street and Washington have been on the lookout for the world's deadbeats, tinderboxes and questionable bets: They rescued Latin America from its debt crisis in the 80's, worked to stabilize Russia's economy in the 90's, and even now are pressing India to insure that American companies investing in power projects are not left with giant cement holes in the ground.
But risk is in the eye of the beholder, and now the telescope has suddenly swung in the other direction. Countries that America once worried about are beginning to worry about America. 
 No one is questioning Washington's ability to pay its debts. Instead, the worry focuses on whether the ideological hardening in Washington could make the United States an unpredictable debtor -- especially if the tactic of holding the country's repayments hostage to a budget deal becomes a habit.
So in a week dominated by images of guards shuttering the Smithsonian, everyone but the grizzly bears abandoning Yellowstone and Newt Gingrich complaining that he was relegated to the rear exit on Air Force One, the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, said he thought the most striking development lay buried in a trickle of dry announcements from the world's credit-rating agencies.
For the first time, they put the United States on different varieties of "credit watch," warning that unless feuding politicians learn to get along, the country's good-as-gold rating would be in jeopardy. That, of course, is the nuclear threat of a financial age: A lower credit rating would almost certainly translate into higher interest rates when the Government borrows to finance its $4.9 trillion debt. And almost every vital statistic in the American economy is linked to those rates: variable rate mortgages, college and car loans, and, of course, the national economic growth rate.
 
Faith No More
 "Over the past 200 years, through wars, through the Depression, no one ever questioned the full faith and credit of the United States," Mr. Rubin said, justifying his decision to "disinvest" $63 billion from Federal retirement trust funds to enable the United States to pay off investors without violating the ceiling on the nation's borrowing limit. "It would be tragic if the lasting legacy of this fight over the budget is that we pay the price for years and years to come."
To many Republicans in Congress and some investors on Wall Street, Mr. Rubin is a scare-monger trying to terrify Mr. Gingrich's legions into backing down. "He's privately telling the President not to worry," the Speaker said of the former investment banker, after trooping out Wall Street experts of his own who proclaimed that the markets would shrug off default and were concerned only about balancing the budget.
Certainly there was plenty of politics at work in Mr. Rubin's maneuverings last week, and he can probably keep his accounting shell game going for months. Still, his critics had a hard time answering Standard & Poor's, known for keen assessments of the "political risk" of doing business around the world. It warned that "the global capital market's unquestioned faith in the United States Government's willingness to honor its financial obligations" has been tarnished for a while. Europe's largest rating concern was even harsher.
Some worried that even if all the talk about default was just talk, it could prove infectious. "Think of all the pressure on the Mexicans to walk away from their debts to ease their economic problems," said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs & Co., Mr. Rubin's old firm. "Congress has now made it legitimate to think the unthinkable."
Americans can take heart: They are hardly the only invincible, triple-A-rated nation looking a bit vincible these days. Japan's biggest banks now pay a premium -- about a half a percentage point -- to attract investors, the result of Tokyo's unwillingness to level with investors about the depth of the banking industry's problems. "In our case and in Japan's, the details are different but the result is the same," a senior Administration official said. "You can be the biggest economy in the world, or the second biggest, but if you create uncertainty about the future, you pay a price."
Half a point may not sound like much, but with a debt as large as Washington's, it would amount to another $25 billion in interest payments every year. That's almost exactly the entire Federal budget for food stamps this year, and more than is spent on veterans or Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
All this is a reminder that markets are unforgiving of anything that smacks of uncertainty: Just ask Italy. While economically formidable, it is prone to revolving-door governments, which contribute to the lowest credit rating among the Group of Seven industrial nations and the highest borrowing costs. Markets are also uninterested in whether Medicare lives, Americorps dies or the Pentagon gets new fighters. The finance ministers, bankers and investors who hold American Treasury bonds care chiefly about getting paid on time, and perhaps in whether the budget gets balanced, because its sheer size affects interest rates and markets around the world.
 
Fragile Assumptions
 So far, the markets seem convinced of two things: that the Treasury Secretary will find a way to pay, no matter how long Congress and the President bicker over the debt limit, and that deep budget-cutting is on the way. But those are fragile assumptions. Any sign that either calculation could be wrong, many Wall Street analysts say, could trigger a broad market selloff, which would vastly change the politics of Washington gridlock.
If Mr. Rubin seems fanatical about avoiding any chance of default, perhaps it is because in his spare time he has been reading about the first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton, whose visage stares down on his desk every day from a giant portrait over the mantelpiece in the Treasury building.
It was Hamilton who insisted in the early 1790's -- over considerable objections -- that the Federal Government assume the debts of the Continental Congress, including I.O.U.'s. that had been issued by a broke George Washington to his troops. The troops, more confident in Washington's battlefield skills than his financial acumen, sold off most of those notes to speculators at a fraction of their face value, figuring a little hard cash was better than the full faith and credit of a country that did not yet exist. Ultimately, many of those notes ended up in the hands of foreign bankers -- sound familiar? -- who had been assured by Thomas Jefferson that the new nation's bonds were as good as its word.
The argument over whether Congress should pay off that debt -- and the debts of individual states that spent like drunken Colonials -- ripped apart the first sessions of Congress. Massachusetts and South Carolina threatened to secede. The whole thing was resolved only when Jefferson worked a compromise that called, among other things, for the creation of a capital along the Potomac, so that history would have a swampy place to repeat itself.
"It was Hamilton who first understood that it was crucial to the United States to establish its creditworthiness in world financial markets," Mr. Rubin said the other day, fresh from another seemingly endless negotiating session with Republican leaders. "That's why the finance minister of every emerging country will do whatever he can to avoid default. And it's why we have to take this issue off the table."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
CONGRESS CANCELS PLAN TO TAKE OFF FOR THE WEEKEND

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Despite signs on Friday that Congress and President Clinton were making progress on reopening Government offices, neither side reported getting any closer to agreement today and lawmakers were forced to put off plans to go home for the weekend.
In the early evening, Republicans sent the White House a new proposal. But when Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, was asked whether he thought the President would accept it, he said, "I doubt it." 
 In the House, where members had been promised that they could leave by 2 P.M., solid Democratic opposition to adjournment embarrassed Republicans into staying. The final vote was 361 to 32. The Senate was in recess for much of the afternoon, waiting for Senator Dole to return from a brief Presidential campaign appearance in Florida.
After the House vote, Republicans did not resume business but called an indefinite recess; later, they said it would last until Monday. Democrats stayed, shouting, "Work, work, work," then held a two-hour rally, although Republicans turned the television cameras off and ordered the House restaurant to close.
Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas said: "There are countries in this world where the mikes are turned off and where the plugs are pulled on television. But have you ever known something like that to happen on the floor of the House of Representatives?"
Negotiations between the Administration and Republican leaders broke down on Friday night. President Clinton said in his radio address today that "it looks like this chance to reopen the Government may be slipping away."
Both sides said they still wanted to talk, but neither would give any ground publicly on the terms of an agreement to balance the budget.
Speaker Newt Gingrich, at a Capitol Hill news conference this morning, insisted that "there is no compromise on seven years and on having an honest number, scored an honest way." He complained that the Administration was hedging its commitment to a timetable and economic analysis.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff who had negotiated on Friday night with Republican leaders, said this afternoon: "The President urges the Congress, and will request the Congress, to stay in session in order to get this work done. This is not a time to leave on recess. This is not a time to cut out of this town while we are trying to resolve a very real crisis in this country."
While last week Mr. Clinton canceled a state visit to Japan because of the impasse, Senator Dole and other Republican Presidential hopefuls managed quick trips to Orlando, Fla., for a campaign straw poll.
The centerpiece of Republican plans -- the bill that would balance the budget in seven years, cut taxes and curb spending on Medicare and Medicaid -- did not win final passage because of a dispute that erupted when Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, used a disparaging term in referring to the President. A final vote is now planned for Monday.
Before the adjournment motion was defeated, the House voted for a limited spending bill that would reopen for the entire fiscal year offices that deal with Medicare, Social Security and veterans claims. The vote was 416 to 0. A senior White House aide said that was already being done administratively, so Mr. Clinton would probably sign that bill.
In an interview with NBC News, President Clinton said he was trying to find "a legal way" to send Federal employees back to work on Monday. He attributed the stalemate to "the most intransigent members of the House" and said that Senate Republicans would "resolve this on honorable terms if they were free to do it."
The rump caucus meeting Democrats staged on the House floor was one of their most united, fiery sessions of the year. Speaking only to each other and a few reporters in the gallery, they assailed the Republicans for two hours.
Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida said the Republican message was that "the wealthy need more help." Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts said, "I have never seen democracy more grievously abused."
Representative John Lewis of Georgia said, "I stood up to Bull Connor in Birmingham. I stood up to Sheriff Clark in Selma. I stood up to George Wallace in Alabama. And I'm not about to run from Newt Gingrich."
When a technician turned on a microphone momentarily, Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, cried, "He's out of a job." But when Representative Harold E. Ford, a Tennessee Democrat, went up to the gallery and threw the switches, the microphones stayed on.
Twenty-eight Democrats hammered the Republicans for leaving instead of working to reopen Government offices. Mr. Gingrich dismissed their protests, saying, "They aren't helping anything; they aren't helping balance the budget. If they want to stay on the floor and make noise, then that's fine. At least it keeps them out of trouble."
Before the bedlam in the House, Mr. Clinton and the Republican leaders sought to convince the public that their dispute was serious, not petty.
Mr. Clinton said, "I know that for many people across our country, all this conflict and drama looks just like people in Washington are playing politics again. What every American has to realize is that this is way beyond politics. There are very profound fundamental issues involved. What's at stake is nothing less than two different visions of our country, and two different futures for our people."
Then he assailed the Republican budget plan because it "cuts funding for disabled children and school lunches, for Head Start for your youngest children, for college scholarships and loans, that doubles Medicare premiums and undermines the entire Medicaid program that provides for nursing home care and home health care for the elderly, the disabled and health care for poor children."
For those reasons, he said, the bill will be "dead on arrival" at the White House.
Mr. Gingrich described the importance of the debate in even grander terms. "This is the largest domestic decision since 1933," referring to the first year of the New Deal. "I think for two generations we have borrowed our children's money. We've built up a five-trillion-dollar debt, and we are now faced with a great choice of whether we begin to move power back out of Washington, back to state and local government, back to citizens, whether we begin to move to replace the welfare state and have a work requirement, whether we in fact balance the budget, stop using our children's money and get lower interest rates through a balanced budget bonus that is very real."
Mr. Dole said: "This is a fundamental change in the direction of government, and it seems to me we are going in the right direction. You talk about welfare reform, you talk about tax cuts for families with children, saving and preserving Medicare. The big item is balancing that budget in seven years. It's a challenge and an opportunity and a responsibility we have as the majority party."
The proposal that the Republicans submitted today, to get a stopgap spending bill approved and reopen Federal offices, would require Mr. Clinton to commit himself to a seven-year balanced-budget plan, to be judged by the Congressional Budget Office.
The Administration had proposed making both the plan and the issue of how compliance would be assessed subject to "mutual agreement." The Congressional Republicans gave a little ground, saying the Congressional Budget Office should consult with the White House budget office and other Government and private experts before announcing its findings.
Democratic Congressional aides agreed with Mr. Dole's assessment that the Administration would not accept the plan when Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, met with Republicans at the Capitol on Sunday afternoon. The Senate planned a rare Sunday afternoon schedule so it could act if there was any agreement to act upon.
Mr. Dole said, "There is ample room for compromise."
Asked about the $245 billion tax cut in the Republican plan, Mr. Gingrich said that everything would be on the table, "but I also think they have to recognize that we did sign a contract that did get us elected, and we are going to keep our word."

HEADLINE: Crime Continues to Decline, but Experts Warn of Coming 'Storm' of Juvenile Violence

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
The nation's overall crime rate dropped 2 percent in 1994, the third consecutive year it has fallen, with a 4 percent decrease in the rate of violent crimes, according to an annual report to be released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation today.
The rate of violent crimes, which include murder, robbery, rape and assault, actually fell to its lowest level since 1989, the F.B.I. reported, and the murder rate itself continued its recent decline, similarly sinking to its lowest level since 1989, 9 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. 
 The F.B.I. data, part of the bureau's annual "Uniform Crime Report," are the latest indication that crime rates are receding after surging in the mid-1980's and early 1990's with the epidemic of crack cocaine and the increasing use of guns by young people.
Law-enforcement officials and criminologists agreed that the F.B.I. data showed that innovative police strategies generally known as community policing were beginning to produce results across the country. But the experts disagreed on whether a long-term improvement in crime rates had begun or whether they were simply seeing a normal statistical reaction after years of sharp increases.
"What is interesting about the data is that the numbers are definitely going down and there is every reason to believe the data are accurate," said John J. DiIulio Jr., professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University. Professor DiIulio gave major credit to police leaders who had taken a more aggressive approach to their work, especially the New York City Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton.
But Professor DiIulio cautioned, "This is also the lull before the crime storm."
The professor said the reason for his concern was "40 million kids 10 years old and under" who are about to become teen-agers, the biggest group of adolescents in a generation, and many of them "fatherless, godless and jobless."
While it is true that the overall national number of violent crimes has been going down, Professor DiIulio said, the decline masks a more important underlying trend.
The decrease has been largely accounted for by a steady decline during the last 15 years in violent crimes by adults 24 years of age or older. But at the same time the number of violent crimes, especially those committed with guns, has been increasing among younger adolescents, and the number of teen-agers is about to climb rapidly.
The director of the F.B.I., Louis J. Freeh, also sounded a note of caution in remarks prepared to accompany the release of the report.
"The modest decreases in crime are, in large part, a tribute to the men and women in law enforcement who daily risk their lives for the public's safety," Mr. Freeh said, though He added that "the ominous increase in juvenile crime, coupled with population trends, portend future crime and violence at nearly unprecedented levels."
In a White House statement, President Clinton sought to give some of the credit for the reduced crime rates to his Administration. He cited the Crime Act, which is intended to put 100,000 more police officers on the street, as well as his efforts to ban the sale of assault weapons and insure passage of the Brady Bill, which requires a waiting period for handgun purchases.
But President Clinton also acknowledged that "all Americans must double their efforts to eliminate the scourge of juvenile violence."
According to the F.B.I. report, there were 14 million crimes in 1994, or a rate of 5,374 offenses for every 100,000 Americans, a decline of 2 percent compared with 1993.
Violent crime rates fell especially sharply in the nine cities with populations of more than one million people, declining 8 percent. But the overall crime rate was up 1 percent in the suburbs and 2 percent in rural counties, the F.B.I. said.
Geographically, the crime rate was highest in the West, with 6,152 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, while it was lowest in the Northeast, with a rate of 4,344 per 100,000, the report said. The South had the highest murder rate, accounting for 42 percent of the nation's murders.
According to the report, the number of forcible rapes reported to law-enforcement authorities was 102,096, the lowest since 1989. Property crimes also fell in 1994, dropping to their lowest mark since 1984, the F.B.I. said.
Among serious crimes, the police reported the highest clearance rate for murder, 64 percent, and the lowest rate, 13 percent, for burglary. Clearance rate generally means a case is resolved, or closed, usually by an arrest.
During 1994, law-enforcement agencies made 14.6 million arrests, not including traffic violations, an increase of 6 percent over 1993. Of all people arrested during the year, 80 percent were male and 67 percent were white, the F.B.I. reported.
But for murder, the F.B.I said, 51 percent of the victims and 56 percent of the suspects arrested were black.
Professor DiIulio said these figures were especially alarming because they suggested that violent crime was becoming more concentrated in a few areas in the inner cities that already had many other signs of social distress, like poverty, unemployment and high rates of drug abuse.
"This makes it harder and harder to go after crime, because the criminals and their victims have even more chronic levels of illiteracy, joblessness and drug dependency," Professor DiIulio said.
But Joe Brann, the director of the Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services in the Justice Department, was more optimistic, noting that the biggest drops in crime had come in cities using the new strategies of community policing. "I am always cautious when I see these short-term crime figures," Mr. Brann said. "But I believe that with all the changes being made in law enforcement we are on the threshold of seeing even more significant reductions in crime and violence."
For example, Mr. Brann said that in Santa Ana, Calif., which pioneered the concept of community policing in the 1970's and where he served as an officer for many years, the city reduced the crime rate by 42 percent in 1994 compared with 1974.

HEADLINE: Real Targets For Giuliani

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
By agreeing to unusually long union contracts this month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did more than simply secure labor peace until the next century. Having come to power vowing to transform the structure of government, he has now emphatically revealed where that transformation will take place, and where it will not.
The most intensive efforts at reducing and restructuring government will focus on those programs used mostly by the city's poorest residents: health care, social services and, to a lesser degree, education. The unionized employees, who deliver services related to so-called quality-of-life issues, will make only small sacrifices, and have agreed to step out of the way as Mr. Giuliani sells off public hospitals and puts welfare recipients to work. 
 For many, that statement of priorities is disappointing, and for varying reasons. Business leaders said they feared the Mayor was too generous with the unions and would eventually pay a financial price, while those who serve the poor said their clients were being asked to bear too heavy a portion of the budget-cutting pain.
"The Mayor is clearly willing to take big risks and break new ground when it comes to things like privatizing the hospitals," said Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker and former chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. "But when it comes to labor, it seems like very much of a holding operation, with no really new initiatives or changes from past practices."
The Rev. Kevin Sullivan, chief operating officer of Catholic Charities for the Archdiocese of New York, said that given the severe economic afflictions of those at the bottom of the ladder, he had expected the unions to give more.
"I was expecting that everyone was going to have to tighten their belts," Father Sullivan said, "so I was a little surprised that that was the situation. Our concern is always that we realize in hard times people have to make sacrifices, so you just have to be real careful that the major sacrifices aren't made by the most vulnerable among us."
Cementing a pattern that was glimpsed earlier in the year, the Mayor has agreed in two five-year contracts not to lay off, reduce the salary or cut the benefits of any teacher or unionized worker, with the notable exception of workers in the public hospitals.
Some employees will have to give up their premiums for working on Lincoln's Birthday in exchange for a day off later, and many union members are grumbling about having to wait two years before their 11.3 percent raises begin. But in general, the web of work rules and job protections Mr. Giuliani railed against as a candidate remains intact.
Having purchased labor peace, the Mayor is now free to pursue the items at the top of his agenda: eliminating the Board of Education and shrinking its budget, removing tens of thousands from the welfare rolls and putting the rest to work cleaning the city, cutting the city's Medicaid spending and selling the public hospitals to the private sector.
The Mayor and his aides argue that they have achieved a radical and historic turnaround in the city's relationship with labor. Randy L. Levine, the departing Labor Commissioner, said the city had cut spending for overtime, pensions and health benefits, all with the union's blessing. Most important, he said, the city has slashed its payroll costs, because far fewer people are working for the city.
Early in his term, Mr. Giuliani used money from the Municipal Assistance Corporation to pay about 17,000 workers to leave the city payroll. The new contract continues that pattern without the severance payments, assuming that 2,000 workers a year will leave of their own volition. That attrition will pay for $509 million of the contract's $830 million wage increase, said Marc V. Shaw, the city's Budget Director, with the rest coming from earlier health and pension agreements.
Peter J. Powers, the First Deputy Mayor, says the reduction constitutes a huge increase in worker productivity, because the remaining employees have to work harder to maintain the same level of services. Critics who want the city to be tough on the unions fail to credit the Mayor with achieving the same result through peaceful means, he said.
"Look at the end game here," Mr. Powers said. "We've got better services, with fewer employees, and a reduced budget."
Mr. Giuliani made the same point yesterday in a brief interview, saying the city saves only when there are fewer employees.
"If a smaller work force does the same job as a work force that was bloated by 8,000," he said, "then they are more productive. That's what productivity is."
But relying on severance payments and attrition is not the traditional definition of a productivity increase, because determining whether services have stayed even or declined is subjective. The Mayor said yesterday that there had been no reduction in services as the work force had shrunk, but a recent New York Times examination indicated otherwise.
"If they're counting attrition as productivity, well, it's hard to know what to make of that," said Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership, an alliance of corporate executives, and former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "That's the kind of thing the Dinkins administration used to do, and it doesn't have any real value without real changes in work rules or working conditions."
A more standard productivity change would have been getting the unions to agree to work longer days, or give up a holiday or a sick day. Though there are some modifications to overtime and holiday rules in the contract reached Friday night with the civilian workers, they do not produce a major savings.
Of course, the Republican Mayor gains a political premium through labor cooperation, particularly if the unions do not support a Democratic challenger in the next election. But beyond the ballot box, Mr. Giuliani's decision not to harm any existing worker has implications for the initiatives he holds most dear.
The civilian unions, for example, have now agreed not to object as the city puts welfare recipients to work cleaning up, sometimes in jobs once occupied by union members. The teachers' union has agreed with the Mayor that the governing structure of the school system must be overhauled, although it is still uncertain whether they will see eye-to-eye on a final proposal.
Most remarkably, the umbrella group known as the Bargaining Council of Municipal Labor Unions agreed in essence to abandon a major member, the hospital workers' union, which was left out of the no-layoff pledge contained in Friday's contract so that the city could sell its hospitals. Stanley Hill, chairman of the coalition, said the unions would work to find jobs for any displaced hospital employees, but the action made it clear that labor will not stand in the Mayor's way.
It is these areas -- health care, welfare and education -- that will be under the most pressure as Federal and state budget cuts make their way toward New York City in the months to come. And having agreed not to lay off most workers for three years or change any major work rules, the Mayor may find himself with no choice but to return to these areas again and again for cuts.
"The budget cuts coming from Washington seem to me inevitably to put the city under very, very significant pressure," Mr. Rohatyn said. "I would question whether the Mayor is actually able to keep the commitments being made here in these contracts without unleashing some other problems by skewing the sacrifices to programs under great pressure already, including those involving welfare recipients."

HEADLINE: Foster Care System Wary of Welfare Cuts

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Waiting for the school bus in a frosty dawn, 12-year-old Andy Munoz explained the secret of making a pair of shoes last when there is no money to buy new ones. "Try not to run in them," he said, shrinking into the hood of last year's winter jacket. "Try not to bend."
Andy has learned the lessons of poverty in a childhood shaped by slim paychecks that stop without warning and slimmer welfare checks that often come late. With his father gone, his mother, Olga L. Munoz, somehow manages between short-lived jobs, even when fuel bills eat up the grocery budget and rent money redeems the Christmas lay-away. 
 But five years ago, mistakenly caught in the machinery of a malfunctioning child protection system, Andy spent three weeks in a children's foster care shelter while his mother begged for his return. His greatest fear these days is that he will end up back in foster care, because without a welfare check to count on, how can his mother keep him?
"Welfare, I think it was made up so they can help people, and now they want to take it away," he said. "People can't pay their bills, and they'll lose everything."
Andy is not alone in being worried. The fear that refugees from the restructuring of welfare will flood an already overburdened foster care system is haunting state, county and municipal officials who preside over the nation's patchwork of child protection. By default, they say, they will be left holding the safety net for 9 million children who are losing their entitlement to welfare.
The Republican-led Congress has voted to end welfare as an entitlement with unlimited Federal funds, opting instead for limited cash payments to the states known as block grants. But at the same time, Congress would preserve unlimited Federal support for children who have been removed from their homes to shelters, foster homes or institutions.
With the changes, advocates and foster care officials say, fewer people would receive welfare, and more children would end up in foster care.
Thomas Brophy, former director of Milwaukee County Human Services, said bluntly that under that kind of strain "the foster care system that is now in a state of crisis would totally collapse." The county has seen its foster care caseload increase fivefold since 1986, as its child poverty rate soared to almost 28 percent.
The Republican architects of the welfare overhaul acknowledge that child protection systems will serve as the ultimate safety net, but they say that replacing welfare with work will lead to lower rates of the child neglect and abuse that lead to foster care. They say that the experiments already under way in many states ultimately will help families trapped in dependency work their way out of poverty and stop them from having children they cannot support.
But judges and child protection workers say that without any family right to aid, the blurry line between destitution and neglect will disappear altogether. Child protection statutes typically rule out parental poverty as a legal reason to take a child into government custody, but these laws are based on the assumption of an entitlement to public assistance that is being abolished.
"If we're going to take away income from a parent who refuses to cooperate, and I see three small kids in that home and no money coming in, I'm going to have to take them into custody," said Michael Malmstadt, chief judge of Milwaukee County's Children's Court, where a new state law has barred judges from appointing lawyers for poor parents at public expense.
 
Seeing More Problems For a System in Trouble
 These children will be moving into a foster care system that by all accounts is already deeply troubled. Between 1985 and 1992, the foster care population grew by 60 percent, to nearly 450,000 -- twice the growth rate of the welfare rolls. A child in foster care now costs the Federal Government 11 times more than a child on Aid to Families With Dependent Children, or A.F.D.C., the main cash assistance program. Federal spending on foster care ballooned to $2.55 billion in 1993 from $309 million in 1981 -- an eightfold increase.
"There's hardly an adequately functioning child welfare system in this country now," said Marcia Lowry, a lawyer who has pressed class action lawsuits against foster care systems in many states, and is director of Children's Rights Inc., a national nonprofit advocacy organization. "What is going to happen to these systems next year with the influx of children and with the elimination of other funding is unimaginable. It's not just that children are going to get dumped into this system and stay there, but that children in genuinely dangerous situations are not going to be taken in."
Milwaukee County is one of many jurisdictions in at least 22 states where lawsuits have caused officials to acknowledge that their overburdened child protection systems damage many of the children they are supposed to protect. But nowhere is the collision course between the foster care system and the campaign to end welfare more sharply etched than in Wisconsin, where Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, has ridden his welfare agenda into national prominence, and county officials say the foster care system is in danger of collapsing under its unintended consequences.
"If foster care is intended to be the life raft for children who can no longer remain safely at home, then the boat is being swamped," said Mark Courtney, a University of Wisconsin professor who recently analyzed the relationship between national poverty policy and foster care for the Journal of the American Public Welfare Association.
There are no reliable national figures for the total cost of foster care, but according to the best estimates, the Federal share represents about 40 percent and goes to the care of children already eligible for A.F.D.C. -- about half the children in foster care.
"In essence, A.F.D.C. foster care is a program whereby the government takes over primary child-rearing responsibilities from low-income parents, based on the assumption that it can and must do better," Professor Courtney wrote. Even in the absence of welfare overhaul, he said, the Federal Government will soon be spending about one-fourth as much trying to raise the children of low-income families as it spends to keep them at home on A.F.D.C.
The kind of group home care Andy Munoz experienced when he was 7 costs between $2,000 and $6,000 a month, and he would still be entitled to it under the Republican bill. The median monthly A.F.D.C. payment is $212 for one child -- about $100 per month less than the median foster care rate.
 
An Array of Programs, Under Reconstruction
 Welfare as Andy knows it is more than Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Food stamps paid for the pancakes Mrs. Munoz made for his breakfast with the help of his 11-year-old sister Geneva, who has mild disabilities from a premature birth and receives Social Security. A Federally-subsidized lunch awaits the children at school. A $396 check from A.F.D.C. mainly allows the family to pay the rent on their bungalow, which faces a highway and the remains of an industrial skyline in a city where 53 percent of all children are dependent on A.F.D.C.
Now all this is being disassembled, shrunk or replaced. Governor Thompson has been ahead of the curve. He cut and froze A.F.D.C. benefits to political acclaim as Wisconsin's economy rebounded from the devastating recession of the early 1980's. He lobbied for block grants. Leading the way for governors in 34 other states, he obtained a fistful of Federal waivers from both the Bush and Clinton administrations to launch get-tough pilot projects with names like Learnfare and Work not Welfare. Voters loved them, though researchers have found the results equivocal at best.
Meanwhile, Clifford O'Connor, who recently succeeded Mr. Brophy as head of Milwaukee County Human Services, saw the foster care caseload in his county surge from about 1,200 in 1986 to nearly 6,000 last year, as the foster care costs paid for by property taxes increased tenfold, to $30 million from $3 million. County officials contend that they never saw new Federal foster care money because the state just used it to replace its own expenditures.
Now Wisconsin is on the verge of replacing Aid to Families With Dependent Children entirely with a jobs-only program called W-2, which eliminates A.F.D.C. entitlements to 76,000 families, including 72,000 children in Milwaukee County. Under the plan, which is expected to be approved by the legislature early next year, families will be eligible for some child care and health insurance subsidies, but these would not be entitlements, and could be cut if competing costs -- like the foster care budget -- grew too large. Mr. O'Connor estimates that an additional 10,800 children will flood his county's child protection system even if only 15 percent of A.F.D.C. households, or 5,400 adults, are judged "uncooperative" under the plan; that was the percentage of general assistance recipients who failed the mandatory work program the county ran until last month, when Wisconsin ended all cash relief to childless adults.
"We're very nervous," Mr. O'Connor said. "We can't handle the 6,000 we have now, let alone any more. The whole welfare reform thrust is based on changing adult behavior. It's a hard road to go down. If the parent doesn't cooperate, or they use up their time-limited benefits, or their family is too large to support on the minimum wage, or they're mentally ill and can't work, what are we going to do with the children? I only need a small number of people failing with welfare reform to get a large number of kids."
Milwaukee County social workers today have caseloads of 100 children, five times the national average, and have to abandon them all to the oblivion of an unstaffed "vacant zone" if they leave the agency. One 10-year-old plaintiff in an American Civil Liberties lawsuit against the system spent 11 months in a temporary shelter without hearing from the caseworker who was supposed to find him a foster family -- his fifth placement in five years. An aunt who could not care for the abused boy herself grew so desperate that she ran her own campaign to find him a foster home, distributing fliers in her neighborhood that read: "I'm a little boy. I like soccer. What I really need is a mom and dad."
 
'Positive Aspects' Seen From Tougher Programs
 Mr. Brophy, who is about to retire from decades of county service, talks like a man who sees two trains speeding, oblivious, toward an intersection.
"The welfare reform debate and its implementation is on one track, the child welfare reform and debate is on another. And what child welfare advocates in Wisconsin are saying is we must stop and look at the potential impact on the child welfare system of families who fail to make it in the reformed welfare system. We must at least begin to ask the questions."
State officials, who are defendants in the three-year-old suit by the civil liberties union, plan to take over the county's foster care system and privatize it. But they will not discuss the possibility that W-2 could swell the system's ranks. On the contrary, they assert that child neglect and abuse probably will decrease as parents on A.F.D.C. go to work under W-2, which expects to place 85 percent of participants in subsidized jobs paying between $2.98 and $3.19 per hour. Mothers will be required to go to work when their children are 12 weeks old.
"So many positive aspects come from feeling good about yourself and those feelings come from employment," argues Jean Rogers, Governor Thompson's appointee as the state's director of public assistance, which is soon to be folded into a new superagency, the Division of Labor and Job Development. "People when they feel better about themselves are much more likely to behave positively to the people around them. We're saying that on balance there will not be a negative impact."
The same pattern is repeated around the country. As Republican governors compete to design the toughest welfare system, their human services administrators say little about possible child protection consequences. But county officials are waking up in alarm to the unanticipated costs.
'All the talk of historic welfare reform is just about shifting the liability and risk to the local communities," said Rick Phelps, the president of National Association of Elected County Executives. "If a mom is forced to go to work and does not have adequate child care, the county will seize the child. Not only is that a human tragedy, but the county will pay the bill. And the state and Federal Government will be completely protected, because they have capped all of their risk."

HEADLINE: Haitian Leader's Angry Words Unnerve Elite and Worry Allies

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 18

 BODY:
With an emotional outburst at the funeral of a slain relative a week ago, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide set off an outbreak of street violence, provoked panic among Haiti's elite and undermined his relations with the United States and other members of the international coalition that restored him to power a year ago.
At least seven people have been killed and more than a score wounded in the unrest that erupted after Mr. Aristide urged his followers a week ago today to "go to the neighborhoods where there are big houses and heavy weapons" to help the police disarm "the big men with heavy weapons" and other suspected wrongdoers. 
 "Do not sit idly by, do not wait," he demanded in an impassioned eulogy for Jean-Hubert Feuille, a cousin and close political associate.
Since then, dozens of homes of suspected Aristide opponents have been burned or looted, a radio station critical of the President has been attacked and vigilante squads have erected roadblocks and stopped and searched vehicles. In the coastal town of Gonaives earlier this week, Nepalese soldiers who are part of the United Nations peacekeeping force clashed with a pro-Aristide mob, firing shots into the air to disperse them, while in the northern town of Limbe, 21 foreign relief workers, 16 of them Americans, took refuge in a hospital after a band of Aristide supporters became unruly.
Mr. Aristide's tirade also included sharp criticism of what he described as the failure of the United Nations mission here to disarm Tontons Macoutes and other members of hostile paramilitary groups. Foreign officials who have been working closely with the Aristide Government in efforts to build democracy here after nearly three decades of dictatorship described themselves as shocked and even betrayed by the President's unexpected behavior.
"He wanted to flex some muscle and take aim at an issue important to all Haitians, but he went way too far, and has brought the process of national reconciliation almost to a halt," one diplomat said. Another said: "He played with fire a little bit, and I'm sure he did it on purpose. He was sending everyone a message."
But a close aide to Mr. Aristide said he had not intended to encourage violence in the streets, only to get the attention of the international community before the scheduled departure of the United Nations troops at the end of February.
"Some slogans against the United Nations mission have been appearing, and he was telling them they must do more disarmament so that the people will kiss them and dance with them again," the aide said.
After meeting with Mr. Aristide on Monday, Lakhdar Brahimi, who heads the United Nations mission here, scoffed at the idea of a widening rift between Haiti's Government and the United Nations.
"We have no problems or difficulties," Mr. Brahimi said. Disarmament efforts will continue, he said, adding, "One cannot find things which are only said to be here or there." But he also urged Haitians not to respond to Mr. Aristide's call for vigilantism.
"The Constitution and the law say that it is the police who are responsible for keeping order, and not self-declared volunteers who say they are," he said.
With Haitians scheduled to go to the polls Dec. 17 to choose a successor to Mr. Aristide, "the latest violence has thrown a shadow over the presidential campaign," the Port-au-Prince newspaper Le Nouvelliste declared this week.
The incidents of violence by vigilantes and intimidation against perceived opponents of Mr. Aristide coincided with the registration period for presidential candidates, and dropped off as it came to an end on Wednesday. Many of Mr. Aristide's most fervent supporters have called for the vote to be canceled altogether so he would remain in office. Under Haiti's Constitution, the President cannot serve two consecutive terms.
The crisis began on Nov. 7, when Mr. Feuille, a newly seated member of Parliament, was shot and killed by unknown assailants as he arrived at the home of another lawmaker. The two men had earlier that day attended the swearing-in ceremony of Haiti's new Prime Minister, Claudette Werleigh, and stopped at a bank, where they withdrew several thousand dollars. That money disappeared in the shooting, but the Haitian Government has said it regarded Mr. Feuille's death as an assassination. Within hours, the police began searching for suspected arms caches among supporters of the former military rulers.
One of those whose arrest was sought was Gen. Prosper Avril, a former military dictator. But since taking refuge in the Colombian Embassy on the day of the killing, General Avril has been granted asylum and negotiations are under way to gain his safe passage out of the country.
Last Saturday's outburst was uncharacteristic for Mr. Aristide, who since returning from three years in exile on Oct. 15, 1994, has steadfastly preached reconciliation, peace and patience.
"It is the first time that I have spoken like this since my return to Haiti," he acknowledged toward the end of the eulogy, delivered from a church pulpit as Haitians cheered wildly and the diplomatic corps sat by silently and grimly.
For the political and economic elite that has always distrusted Mr. Aristide, his remarks stirred memories of the incendiary oratory he employed shortly before being overthrown by the military in September 1991. Fearing the worst, some prominent political and business figures have quietly left the country, while others have approached friends at foreign embassies, seeking guarantees of protection.
"The private sector has a great deal of fear," said a businessman who has generally supported Mr. Aristide. "Things are very tense."
Mr. Aristide's aides and supporters maintain that his outburst, and the violence it provoked, were spontaneous responses to a deeply felt personal tragedy.
"It was an emotional reaction," said Jean-Robert Sabalat, who was briefly Mr. Aristide's Foreign Minister in 1991 and is now a member of the Senate. "Now everything is calm and back to normal."
But Mr. Aristide's opponents argue that his real motives are otherwise. "There is a political strategy behind this campaign," intended to make the presidential election meaningless, said Evans Paul, a former ally and Mayor of Port-au-Prince who broke with the President after this summer's parliamentary elections.
On Wednesday, Mr. Aristide's Lavalas movement chose Rene Preval, a former Prime Minister who heads a foundation that finances small development projects, as its candidate, and he is expected to win handily. Most major opposition parties are boycotting the election, and the field of 14 includes candidates from such obscure entities as the Virgin Mary Party and Haitian Party of God as well as three senators running as independents.
Relations between Mr. Aristide's Government and the United Nations coalition that brought him back to power have been fraying since Prime Minister Smarck Michel stepped down last month. Mr. Michel resigned and was replaced by Mrs. Werleigh after failing to persuade Mr. Aristide to carry out an agreement signed with Haiti's creditors to privatize nine state companies.
As a result of the Government's failure to move ahead with that program, the United States is withholding $4.6 million in aid, some $100 million in other foreign assistance is also in jeopardy, and the value of the gourde has dropped by 20 percent. That has not only frustrated the Government, which sent Finance Jean-Marie Cherestal off to Taiwan in an unsuccessful quest for money, but also appears to have reduced the leverage of the United States and its allies over Mr. Aristide.
Mr. Aristide's funeral eulogy, which was broadcast repeatedly on television and radio for several days afterward, included what many interpreted as a jab at the United States Ambassador here, William L. Swing, and Mr. Brahimi, the chief of the United Nations mission, who were seated together at the funeral.
"I am reminding you that until further notice there are not two or three heads of state, but just one," Mr. Aristide said.
In addition, he suggested that a second term for the Clinton Administration is linked to his success or failure here.
"The month of November 1995 must be a month of peace, a month of success, so the month of November 1996 can be a success also in the United States," he said.
Mr. Aristide also pointedly reminded American and United Nations officials of the profound emotional hold and bond he has with the Haitian people. "Dear friends of the international community, I know you need me just as I need you," he said.
To many diplomats here, that is perhaps the chief lesson of the week's unrest.
"It doesn't matter whether Aristide is sitting in the presidential palace, or retires to his home in Tabarre" after his scheduled departure from office on Feb. 7, one diplomat said. "He will still be the one who has the power in this country."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE CLOSURES;
Canyon Becomes Peaceful, Pleasing Nobody

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz., Nov. 18

 BODY:
Nature's silence was profound, ethereal and serene, and frankly a bit eerie.
Such quietude is hardly typical of the Grand Canyon this time of year. Normally, about 8,000 people a day visit this national treasure, and there is hardly an inch not flanked by a crush of gawking visitors. Hotels are usually booked weeks ahead, and trails are crawling with hikers. Few come here anymore seeking solitude since they hardly see the canyon through the jumbo tour buses and encircling motels and fast-food restaurants. 
 That was until the park, a major source of tourism income in Arizona, was shut on Thursday because of the Federal budget impasse.
Indeed, for the first time in the country's history, all 369 national parks, monuments and recreation areas have been shut down. Although several parks have been closed temporarily because of fire, earthquakes or other natural catastrophes, never have they been closed at the same time in the 79-year history of the National Park Service.
Although it is impossible to say how many visitors ventured to the Grand Canyon today -- and some determined souls were hoping to force themselves into the park -- by any accounting, this was virtually a ghost town.
Except for some tour planes and helicopters, the quiet of the ages once found at the Grand Canyon's vast amphitheaters had abruptly returned, thanks to the budget brawl in Washington.
"It stinks," said Harry Miller, manager of the Eagle Canyon airlines office here. He said on a good day, the five carriers that work the area bring in several thousand people; today, only 37 passengers had arrived by midday.
"With them closing the park, it's put 3,800 people out of work," Mr. Miller said.
Not far away, Pat Noon, a manager for a helicopter service in the park and a 16-year resident of the area, said the budget impasse "is hurting a lot of innocent people."
"And the worst thing about it is that the politicians don't care," Mr. Noon said, "they're in this for their own political gain."
Sheila Taylor and her fiance, James Atwater, had been planning a tour of the south rim for months. Not only had the closing altered their plans, but it also had a decededly negative effect on their mood. "We've been bickering for the last two days about whether to stick around, hoping this thing will end and the park will open, or drive back to Los Angeles," Ms. Taylor said. "I want to go, but Jim doesn't. I guess it'll work itself out eventually. But frankly, I'm depressed."
On Friday, Interior Department officials rebuffed an effort by Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona to use National Guard troops and state employees to reopen the park, citing safety issues, financial problems and possible legal tangles.
The department's rejection came in a letter from John D. Leshy, the solicitor of the Interior Department to the Governor, a Republican, who arrived at the park's gates along with 50 or so National Guard troops he had ordered to the spectacular chasm.
The arrival of the guard troops in Humvee all-terrain vehicles, ambulances and personnel trucks seemed to suggest the possibility of a state takeover. But state officials said the troops were part of a transportation unit summoned to help workers return in the event the park was reopened.
A spokesman for the department said later that agency officials were willing to discuss an arrangement in which parts of the park could be reopened if the state paid the full operational and insurance costs.
In any event, the park will remain closed at least until Monday, Governor Symington told reporters at a news conference at Grand Cayon Airport on Friday, adding, "I think it's all a political game."
Amy Rezzonico, a spokeswoman for Governor Symington, told the Mesa Tribune that the closing of the Grand Canyon National Park meant the park and surrounding areas are losing between $950,000 and $1.25 million a day in tourism revenue.
At the park itself, the mood among the thousands who normally run the attractions was as gloomy as the day was bright.
"We have no guests in any of our 900 rooms," said Jane Gillespie, sales director for Grand Canyon National Park Lodges. "With weather like today, we normally have high occupancy. And Thanksgiving is usually sold out."
And after Thanksgiving, park attendance usually rises to 15,000 to 20,000 visitors a day.
"People are upset," she said. "They've prepaid for their rooms. A lot of people come here to get their winter fix."

HEADLINE: Bosnia Asks U.S. Arms Aid as Part of Any Peace Accord

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The Muslim-led Bosnian Government has formally asked the United States to provide "on an urgent basis, significant materiel, training and logistic support" to insure a balance of forces with the Serbs as part of any peace agreement.
The demand, made in a draft memorandum of understanding given to American officials, calls on the Clinton Administration to "move at once" to obtain a lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina and then "take immediate steps to facilitate the urgent delivery of defense articles and services." 
 Although Washington is ready to push for a lifting of the arms embargo in the event of a peace accord and work to achieve a balance of power in the Balkans, the Bosnian draft memorandum is unacceptable in its demand for American arms and training, senior officials said.
The issue is "a potential deal breaker," a Bosnian official said. It is one of several thorny questions, including the division of territory, that remain unresolved as an 18-day-old peace conference here moves toward a conclusion that is expected on Sunday or Monday, whether a settlement is reached or not.
"There are significant gaps among the parties, significant disagreements, and a substantial amount of work to do," said Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman. He was speaking after a meeting today between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's President.
But a senior European diplomat said that the talks were moving forward despite the difficulties and that there was still hope of an agreement by Sunday night and the initialing of it by the parties on Monday.
A member of the American delegation to the talks said, "The psychodrama in here is really quite amazing." As the hour of decisions approaches, the Bosnian Government, which has known nothing but war, appears particularly torn over what course to take.
The tension building at the conference was evident early today in the abrupt resignation of Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's Foreign Minister. He announced his departure over a beer in the discotheque at a Holiday Inn near Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where the talks are being held. It is not clear when the resignation will take effect.
Mr. Sacirbey said his decision stemmed from the need to install a Croat in a top government position in order to bolster the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia.
"The country has to have a Croatian in one of its top three posts," he said. "The President isn't going and the Prime Minister doesn't want to go so I decided I would go."
But officials at the talks said the relationship between Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, and Mr. Sacirbey had been under acute strain during the 18 days of negotiations.
"Mr. Sacirbey had effectively been sidelined," said a person at the talks.
American officials have been focusing their diplomatic efforts on Mr. Silajdzic, whom they see as the key to persuading the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, that his country's future is best secured through peace rather than a continuation of 42 months of war. It appeared that this approach had not pleased the American-educated Mr. Sacirbey, 39, who 3 has proved extremely adroit at putting across the Bosnian point of view in countless television interviews.
Bosnian officials said the issue of American military support for the Bosnian Army after any peace deal had become critical. It was raised on Friday with Defense Secretary William J. Perry, and the day before with Anthony Lake, the national security adviser.
The draft memorandum makes clear the Bosnian demands by saying that "it is understood" that Bosnian forces are "particularly deficient with respect to armor, artillery, air mobility, communications, logistics and air defense."
The Clinton Administration at first said it was ready to provide military support for the Muslim-Croat federation after a peace deal. But several factors have since led it to an apparent modification of its position.
Among these factors are strong objections from Western European allies and the difficulty of combining participation in a neutral NATO force to enforce peace with active military support for one side in the conflict.
Moreover, in Congress, even among supporters of American participation in the NATO force and an immediate lifting of the embargo, there are serious misgivings about an active American role in arming and training the federation, senior officials said. The view of many on Capitol Hill is that peace enforcement and the training of one side are irreconcilable.
"Our position has evolved," said a senior Administration official. "Clearly, it would be a deal breaker if we were not prepared to do anything for the Bosnians. But how and when and who does it are critical factors. We are hoping that it will be enough for them to have the certainty that we will help them."
It thus appeared unlikely that any commitment in writing to provide arms and training, as requested in the memorandum, would be forthcoming from the Administration at this stage.
Mr. Burns, the State Department spokesman, said the Administration's preference was now to "build down" toward a rough military balance -- that is, presumably, to relieve the Bosnian Serbs of some of their considerable superiority in tanks and artillery.
The issue has been complicated by the fact that the Croatian Army has been present in large numbers in Bosnia for several months and has insured that, in fact, a rough military balance exists at this moment.
Unless a lasting military balance is contrived, it would be very difficult for NATO forces, including American troops, that would go in to police a peace to leave after one year, as they now hope to do.
In the event of an agreement, the United States and its allies are preparing to suspend trade sanctions on Serbia. Diplomats said a draft resolution had been prepared at the Security Council that would suspend all trade sanctions as soon as an accord is initialed. The sanctions have been in effect for more than three years and have inflicted considerable economic misery on Serbia.
The diplomats said the resolution would not affect financial sanctions on Serbia -- like its ineligibility for international loans. Those sanctions would remain in place until any accord has been fully carried out. Moreover, the suspension would be for a limited period and trade sanctions would be immediately reimposed if Mr. Milosevic did not sign the final peace agreement.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE BUDGET;
Once Ignored, a Middle-Ground Budget Advances

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Even as President Clinton prepares to veto a huge budget-balancing bill, Administration officials are completing their own proposals to achieve a similar fiscal goal while protecting programs for poor people and the elderly.
The President has yet to give in to the Republican demand that a balanced budget be achieved in seven years, but his aides are crafting just such a proposal that would, among other things, dramatically reduce the size of Republican tax cuts. 
 In preparation for negotiations with Congress after the veto, White House officials say Mr. Clinton is being forced to set his priorities more firmly than ever before, deciding, for example, which programs he really wants to protect, which Republican proposals he can tolerate and which are unacceptable.
"If you get to a negotiation, you want to have your homework done," said the deputy assistant to the President for economic policy, Gene B. Sperling. "If you have a negotiation, you want to know what proposals of theirs could be acceptable if they made the right concessions and which ones are absolutely unacceptable."
And in figuring out a new budget, the White House has been inspired by a largely unnoticed alternative budget offered in October by moderate and conservative Democrats in the House. In the middle of the current turmoil, the proposal looks more and more like a promising middle ground between the White House and Congressional Republicans. It would eliminate the Federal budget deficit in seven years, as the Republicans want, while requiring less drastic cuts in social programs because it is without tax cuts. By contrast, both houses of Congress have voted to cut taxes by $245 billion over seven years, and Mr. Clinton wants to cut taxes by $105 billion.
While this will not be the last word on the budget, Republicans and Democrats admit this is the direction where a compromise is heading.
Representative Tim Roemer, Democrat of Indiana, described the basic logic of the alternative budget: "If you delay tax cuts till after the budget is balanced, then you don't have to devastate Medicare, student loans and farm programs."
Many Democrats say that even Mr. Clinton's tax proposal is too expensive. "Every Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee opposes the President's tax proposal," said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, a member of the committee. Aides to Alice M. Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said she tended to agree with these Democrats. For every dollar given away in tax cuts, they said, another dollar must be cut from Medicare, education, farm programs or some other Government activity.
The alternative budget was developed by a group of conservative Democrats known as the Coalition. It won surprising support from Democratic liberals when offered as an alternative to the Republican budget on the House floor on Oct. 26. Then 68 Democrats voted for the measure including more liberal lawmakers like Mr. Cardin, John D. Dingell of Michigan, Vic Fazio of California, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee.
Only four Republicans voted for the Coalition budget, but many praised its authors.
Its supporters in the Senate include Paul Simon of Illinois, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Kent Conrad of North Dakota. Mr. Cardin claims that cuts in the Republican budget were so deep they could not be sustained over the seven-year life of the budget plan. "Bureaucrats will find a way to get their money back," he said in an interview. "I don't want to go through all the pain and suffering of budget cuts and still have large deficits in the future."
Likewise, Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which has supplied liberal Democrats with some of their most powerful arguments against the Republicans' social welfare policies, said the Coalition budget "sets the right priorities on a lot of issues."
"It doesn't savage means-tested entitlement programs" like food stamps, welfare and Medicaid, Mr. Greenstein said.
The Republicans would control the cost of welfare and Medicaid by giving each state a fixed amount of Federal money, known as a block grant, to run its own programs with a minimum of Federal supervision, and they would allow states to replace the food stamp program with similar grants. People now receiving assistance would not necessarily be entitled to benefits in the future.
The alternative Coalition budget would preserve such entitlements, but restrain the cost. One of the Coalition's most significant proposals would slow the growth of Social Security benefits paid to 43 million people. The Coalition would base the annual cost-of-living adjustment on the change in the Consumer Price Index minus one-half of one percentage point in each of the next three years. Currently the annual cost-of-living adjustment for several entitlement programs is based on the Consumer Price Index, which many economists say overstates inflation.
Representative Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas and a strong supporter of the Coalition budget, made the principal argument in the budget's favor saying it offered Mr. Clinton "a middle ground that protects some of his priorities and principles" while satisfying the Republican demand for a balanced budget in seven years.
The Federal budget deficit has declined in each of the last three years. The Republican budget package would balance the budget in 2002 but estimates by the Congressional Budget Office show that the Republican plan would actually increase the deficit in 1996 and 1997, partly because of the tax cuts.
The budget bill approved this week in both houses of Congress would cut projected spending on Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, by $270 billion over seven years. The Coalition would cut $168 billion, and Mr. Clinton would cut $124 billion.
Republicans in Congress would cut projected spending on Medicaid, the program for the poor, by $163 billion over seven years. By contrast, the Coalition would cut $85 billion, and Mr. Clinton would cut $54 billion.
Republicans would cut $32 billion from the earned-income tax credit, a valuable form of assistance for low-income workers. The Coalition would cut $2 billion, and Mr. Clinton would cut $3 billion.
In his budget request in February, just three months after a Republican landslide, Mr. Clinton evidently misjudged the mood of Congress and proposed spending and tax policies that would generate deficits of at least $190 billion a year through 2005.
In mid-June, Mr. Clinton suddenly shifted course and proposed to balance the budget in 10 years, but offered a sketchy outline of how to do it. In late July, he said he could achieve a balanced budget in nine years because the economy was performing better than expected, and the Government was spending less than expected for benefit programs and debt service.
On Medicaid, it is relatively easy to see room for compromise between Congress and the President. Republicans want to limit the growth of the program overall. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, would limit the growth in the average Federal payment for each Medicaid recipient, and the Coalition also favors a "per capita cap." A limit on per capita spending would help control costs, but would still allow Medicaid to expand automatically if the need increased because of a recession or an epidemic.
Administration officials have several proposals to control Medicaid costs, including a reduction in special Medicaid payments to hospitals that serve large numbers of indigent patients.
The Administration might curb Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies that care for elderly people but with far smaller reductions than those planned by the Republicans.
Mr. Clinton and the Coalition recommend a small raise in the basic premium for Medicare beneficiaries, less than what the Republicans want. Like the Republicans, the Coalition, would establish higher Medicare premiums for people with higher incomes, a step not recommended by Mr. Clinton.
Finally, under the budget bill just passed by Congress, discretionary spending would decline to $515 billion in 2002, from $546 billion in the fiscal year 1995, which ended on Sept. 30. This spending is some one-third of the budget and covers activities like education, law enforcement, environmental protection, scientific research and national defense. To keep up with inflation, the Congressional Budget Office says, such spending would have to rise to $631 billion in 2002.
Martha H. Phillips, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan organization that lobbies for a balanced budget, said it was unrealistic to think that discretionary spending would decline for seven years, given pressures from Federal agencies and citizens who benefit from such spending.
"One wonders how Congress could possibly stay on that course for more than a few years," Mrs. Phillips said. "It's a starvation diet, like skipping two meals a day for the next seven years."

HEADLINE: Town Built on Steel Industry Resigns Itself to End of an Era

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa., Nov. 18

 BODY:
There is not much fire-and-tongs fight left in Local 2599 anymore. Old steelmen like Rebel, Chico and the union boss Danny Mills know they have lost their battle to preserve a livelihood, and with it a way of life.
"There was a time when we were unbeatable," said Mr. Mills, pointing to framed black-and-white photos of steelworkers toppling police cars and hurling bricks during their first walkout, in 1941. 
 "Those men didn't fight for something like this to happen," Mr. Mills said, his voice echoing in the dim corridor of the quiet United Steelworkers union hall.
Early today, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation shut down the last blast furnace at its flagship plant here, sending home 1,800 workers and ending an operation that had been pouring steel since before the Civil War.
Chances are that almost any major bridge or skyscraper in America contains some Bethlehem steel. Metal forged here went into landmarks like the Golden Gate and George Washington Bridges, into missile silos and more than 1,000 naval and merchant ships in World War II.
Having bailed out the company with economic concessions in the 1980's, Bethlehem workers feel betrayed by the closing.
The hot-metal workers and the big-beam shapers were the latest to fall to the cutbacks that have shrunk the Bethlehem plant in northeastern Pennsylvania from 31,000 workers at its postwar heyday in the 1960's to the 1,200 workers who were left after today's shutdown. The skeleton crew will continue nonsteelmaking operations, like running a coke furnace and a combine mill that rolls unfinished steel.
Bethlehem was once America's No. 2 steelmaker, during a time when 85 percent of all goods manufactured in the United States contained steel and 40 percent of the nation's work force owed its wages, directly or indirectly, to steel.
But in the past 30 years, American giants like Bethlehem and United States Steel have been caught in what an industry expert, Paul Tiffany, called "the twin pincers of foreign steel and the mini-mills." Making iron and steel, he said, "is the most labor-intensive part of the industry, and Bethlehem was far out of the running."
America has now largely ceded heavy steelmaking to the Japanese. Some steelmakers in the United States have formed joint ventures with foreign competitors.
Bethlehem's chief executive, Curtis H. Barnette, acknowledged that "the unions did their part when we asked them" to make concessions. But rather than try to modernize the antiquated Bethlehem plant, Mr. Barnette decided to build a mini-mill in Steelton, Pa., and refurbish the steel plant in Burns Harbor, Ind., which is near the major auto manufacturers.
Bethlehem's restructuring has enabled the company to rebound somewhat. For the first nine months of 1995, the corporation posted profits of $147 million.
But for the newly laid-off workers it's a different story. More than half have opted for early retirement, figuring that their specialized training made them unemployable in the Bethlehem area.
"I don't know what will happen to these men with kids in school, mortgages to pay," said a 48-year-old furnace operator, Larry Brandon. "We've got guys here with little ones, and that little nickel job they're going to find won't go too far."
The lucky ones will find jobs through the company's four-year-old retraining and placement program. But Mr. Brandon believes many will simply leave Bethlehem, a city of about 70,000 people.
"There's nothing here for them anymore," he said. "Just a town looking over a graveyard."

Horror Cabbies Add to Burdens Of Honest Ones

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
NEW YORK'S taxi drivers have been taking it on the collective chin.
First, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission reported last week that 5 percent of cabbies in the yellow fleets lack valid driver's licenses. Then it issued a list of 10 drivers who are the top code violators, quickly dubbed "cabbies from hell." 
 Tahir Sohail, cruising mid-Manhattan in his yellow cab, applauded the agency for going after the bad guys. (Thankfully, he applauded at a red light, keeping hands on the wheel while driving.) "It's good they do this," he said. "It's good for the nice people who want to drive well."
But before cabby-hating goes too far, Mr. Sohail points out that driving 12 hours a day for a living is no simple task. It was easier back in Lahore, Pakistan, which he left seven years ago for this city where the streets, once thought by immigrants to be paved with gold, are sometimes barely paved at all.
"It was better in Lahore," he said. "There is no double-parking there. And the police treat you nicer."
With the taxi commission debating whether to raise fares as much as 27 percent, attention has turned once again to the caliber of the 40,000 drivers -- overwhelmingly foreign born, with 40 percent having come from the Indian subcontinent alone.
SOME newspaper and magazine writers delving into the industry's complicated economics have concluded that the fare, which has gone up only twice since 1980, should stay put. Any increase, they say, would go to the owners of the 11,787 taxi medallions, those coveted licenses to accept street hails. Each is now worth as much as $220,000 because the number of medallions has been unchanged since 1937, thanks to political faintheartedness before a powerful taxi-owner lobby.
It just so happens that many of those opposed to a fare increase are guys in suits who take cabs a lot. The suits didn't ask Embadul Shahan what he thought.
Mr. Shahan, who came eight years ago from Bangladesh, also worries that a good part of any raise will go to the man who leases him his yellow cab. But at least he will get some extra money, and he can use every penny.
For him, the economics lesson starts with the $450 leasing fee each week. He also pays about $20 a day for gas, and is sometimes hit by the cab owner with extra charges like "a deposit" for using the meter. It means that he must pick up at least $100 a day in fares and tips just to climb back to zero.
His situation is typical, as are his earnings of $75 to $90 for a 12-hour shift. "If I work six days, maybe I can make $500," he said as he ended a break at an Indian restaurant on Lexington Avenue.
A sympathetic Christopher R. Lynn, chairman of the taxi commission, says that if the city wants better cabs and more qualified drivers, it must have a fare structure that gives cabbies more than their present average of $6.25 an hour.
Ah, but what about all those fringe benefits that Mr. Shahan receives? Like abuse from veteran New Yorkers because his English, which is perfectly fine, does not meet loftier standards. Being told by some New Yawkers that you don't speak well is bit like being called ugly by a frog. But that does not stop the diatribes, often wildly exaggerated, about the quality of English behind the wheel.
"THE most liberal people in the world can be the most nativist when it comes to taxi drivers," said Anne Morris of the Center for Logistics and Transportation at the City University's graduate school.
No one denies that some yellow cab drivers indeed speak poorly. Some are abusive. Some are fare-gougers. Some confuse Manhattan's avenues for the Indy 500. Many have no idea how to get to Carnegie Hall, except maybe practice. Many will not go to Brooklyn.
But Manhattan cabbies never liked going to Brooklyn, including the cigar-chomping fellow of misguided nostalgia. A recent survey by the taxi commission shows that most riders are amply satisfied with the service. Besides, if some cabbies do not know their way around, don't city monitors share the blame for having tolerated it for so long?
Standards are now being tightened, Mr. Lynn pledges. But that is not so easy in a city that habitually thumbs its nose at traffic laws. By police estimate, 15 percent of all New York drivers do not have valid licenses.
At only 5 percent, the cabbies suddenly look pretty good.

Mr. Speaker, May I?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It is Nov. 19, 1996. The Federal Government has been shut down for a year. The landscape is bleak, the city a trash heap. Rats chew on rep ties and sensible pumps. The rubble of old health care plans and $600 toilet seats are strewn across Pennsylvania Avenue. The neo-classical buildings are shells. Wild bands of unemployed bureaucrats roam the streets, forcing innocent passers-by to fill out huge volumes of paperwork. A gang war has broken out between the G-6's and the G-7's. Besides bonfires, the only pools of light are in the Capitol and the White House, where the two sides in the budget standoff are hunkered down. How did a once-great nation sink into this dystopia? Follow me back, as I explain:
Nov. 15, 1995: Newt Gingrich admits that pique over how he was treated by the President on the trip to Israel provoked him into writing a tougher spending bill -- which Mr. Clinton vetoed, causing parts of the Government to close. The Speaker, aggrieved that he had to disembark by the back ramp, wails: "Where is their sense of manners? Where is their sense of courtesy?" 
 Nov. 23, 1995: The President tries to make peace by inviting the Speaker to the White House for Thanksgiving. All goes well until Mr. Gingrich spies a demitasse spoon above his plate. Jumping up and throwing down his linen napkin, he cries: "Don't you know that a teaspoon has no place at a formal table? What kind of a rube do you take me for?"
Dec. 20, 1995: Under pressure to end the impasse by Christmas, Mr. Gingrich invites the Clintons to a holiday cocktail party at the Capitol. The merriment ends abruptly when the Speaker confronts the President at the hors d'oeuvre table. "You pathetic vulgarian! Asparagus may be taken in the fingers, but you never take a long drooping stalk, hold it up in the air and catch the end of it in your mouth like a fish. Marianne, get our guests their coats."

HEADLINE: How to Soften a Harsh Budget

 BODY:
The Republicans have fulfilled their campaign promise by giving initial approval to a "reconciliation" bill that eliminates the deficit in seven years without gimmicks. The bill, which changes entitlement programs and taxes, is not devoid of merit. For example, it targets two programs popular among Republicans, Medicare and farm subsidies. But the bill is also needlessly harsh and horribly unfair. President Clinton's veto pen is the final defense.
Mr. Clinton has moved toward much of the G.O.P.'s plan -- its seven-year horizon, huge tax cuts, large Medicare cuts and the end of federally guaranteed cash aid to the poor. But the bill goes far beyond anything he has endorsed. It pummels poverty programs and shovels tax cuts to the rich. The President has to draw lines where the G.O.P. has gone too far. Here are five such areas. 
 The Safety Net. Under the bill, Washington would turn over a fixed block of money to states for welfare but no longer pump more money into states experiencing soaring welfare rolls during recession. Sadly, Mr. Clinton will go along. But he must then insist that Congress preserve other parts of the safety net, such as food stamps and Medicaid, for every poor family. Congress could put a cap on, for example, Medicaid spending per recipient. That way, Congress limits its outlays but provides added help to states with rising poverty.
Means-Tested Spending. The G.O.P. would cut spending on food stamps, school lunches, Medicaid, foster care and other programs for the needy by about 25 percent. Yet these programs represent only 13 percent of the Federal budget. Slamming the poor twice as hard as everyone else is unconscionable.
Legal Immigrants. The Republicans would deny legal immigrants Medicaid, food stamps, cash aid and other services for at least five years. Mr. Clinton should insist that sponsors of legal immigrants assume financial responsibility for keeping them off poverty rolls. But if sponsors go bankrupt or die, immigrants should qualify for at least food stamps and Medicaid.
Medicare. The bill invites retirees to leave traditional Medicare to set up -- with Government money -- medical savings accounts, which combine catastrophic coverage with tax-free deposits from which to pay ordinary medical expenses. The bill also loosens the antitrust laws governing voluntary associations of doctors. The combination of these two provisions would be deadly. Doctors would flee traditional Medicare and serve only healthy and wealthy retirees, at inflated prices no one else could afford.
Capital-Gains Taxes. The G.O.P. wants to immunize investors from the impact of inflation, a protection it would not extend to bondholders or anyone else. The bill would also needlessly cut taxes on the sale of old investments. The first provision would wreck the tax code. The second would provide a multibillion-dollar giveaway to wealthy investors. Both warrant a veto.
The Republicans themselves could meet these tests by massively scaling back their tax cut and defense plans. Even if they agreed, however, their budget plan would still be unsatisfactory. It would spend too little on public investments in infrastructure, worker training and research and too much on subsidies to corporations, dairy farmers and other special interests.
But at least with these modifications the bill would be less cruel.

HEADLINE: Governor Pataki's Mystery Donors

 BODY:
Politicians can deal with ethics laws in one of two ways. They can use them as guideposts, charting the road to open government. Or they can view them as roadblocks to be skirted with the aid of every possible legal loophole.
Gov. George Pataki is a member of the loophole-loving camp. Mr. Pataki's latest blow to the spirit of New York's campaign finance law involves his glitzy inauguration ceremonies last January in Albany. An extravaganza by the capital's dowdy standards, the event included a laser light show, a black-tie gala, a "people's reception" that fed and entertained thousands and a swearing-in before 13,000 supporters in a sports arena. But now it appears that the state's voters will never get a full accounting of who paid the bills. 
 Mr. Pataki's aides created a private corporation to raise the money. It was headed by Charles Gargano, the campaign finance chairman who is now Commissioner of Economic Development. As an extra-governmental organization, N.Y. Inaugural '95 was not legally obliged to disclose the names of contributors or abide by campaign finance limits of $5,000 per donor. But the Governor's aides vowed that the inaugural committee would do both.
It did neither. An investigation by The Times's James Dao revealed that Mr. Gargano's committee raised about $500,000, with donations as high as $25,000. Most of them came from people who need something from state government -- firms with large state contracts, corporations under heavy state regulation. Their names have never been made public. Late last month, the Governor's representatives dissolved the corporation, just weeks before they would have had to file a report giving information about its operations.
None of the administration's explanations seem plausible. The Governor's spokeswoman claimed the contributors' names were being kept confidential for "ethical reasons," so that state workers would not be tempted to show favoritism toward the donors. But some of the names were listed right on the inaugural program. The inaugural committee had always intended to accept up to $25,000 per corporation, she said. The only mistake occurred when the Governor's staff misunderstood and promised to stick to the limits required under state election laws.
For the voters, the real sadness here arises from the missed opportunity. This Governor came to Albany with a new broom, and he could have chosen to sweep it clean. Instead, Mr. Pataki has endorsed this inaugural dodge, and he continues to condone Mr. Gargano's seedy fund-raising procedures. Mr. Pataki's commissioners are permitted to raise donations, as long as they do not solicit them from businesses that deal directly with their agencies. Of course, the possibilities for ultrafine distinctions and contributor tradeoffs are endless.
With his alarming affinity for business-worse-than-usual, Mr. Pataki is missing a chance to make the Republicans into a party of reform in Albany.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Chinese Schizophrenia

BYLINE: By PHILIP TAUBMAN 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
Ding Fa Zhang, the editor of The Xinmen Evening News, a lively Shanghai tabloid that eschews political coverage, says business is so brisk he hardly knows how to spend the profits. With the paper's ad space booked three months in advance, Mr. Ding has become a construction tycoon, plowing the paper's surplus income into new office buildings.
Leo Yang, a Dale Carnegie instructor and general manager of a Shanghai dairy products company, is developing new ice cream treats for next summer that he hopes can match the popularity of the Crunch Bar, a mixture of ice cream and crushed Oreo cookies that was this year's surprise seller. His manufacturing plant is located in Pudong, a sprawling East Shanghai corporate and industrial zone that just a few years ago was undeveloped farmland. 
 Liu Bo, the executive vice president of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, recently returned from a visit to New York, where he consulted with Wall Street executives on how to increase the trading volume in Shanghai and develop a market for mutual funds. The Shanghai exchange is still recovering from a disastrous collapse in the bond futures market earlier this year.
Shanghai shows all the signs of China's breakneck economic expansion, one of the many boom-or-bust cities driven by Beijing's turn toward market economics. But just under the bustle there is an unsettling reality. Many of the basic building blocks of a modern market economy are still missing. The currency is not yet convertible. The banking system is antiquated and unsound. Financial regulation is largely absent, commercial law is arbitrarily enforced and corruption is rampant.
Most important, China's economic center of gravity is not the stock market or the banks or the hundreds of new companies. It is the Communist Government in Beijing, which is still churning out laborious five-year plans and subsidizing a huge network of unprofitable state enterprises. The system essentially is a command market economy, a schizophrenic formula designed to fuse Communism and capitalism.
The Government's role remains ubiquitous, as Beijing meddles in every area of economic activity. Before Motorola could open a plant to make cellular phones and beepers in Tianjin, the American company needed approval of Government officials in Beijing. If municipal officials in Shanghai want to revise the tax incentives that have attracted business development in Pudong, they need a policy change in Beijing. Even Mr. Ding of The Evening News said he would not ask reporters to investigate police corruption in Shanghai because that would violate journalism standards set in Beijing.
While still heavy, the hand of Government is not always steady. Beijing recently canceled $6 billion in tax rebates promised to export businesses under a value-added tax imposed in 1994. Many companies had counted on the payments to turn a profit this year. The Government has slowed economic reform by abruptly demanding a greater share of provincial tax revenues and more control over the establishment of joint ventures.
China's novel modernization formula has worked so far, producing explosive expansion over the last 15 years. In cities where sleek new buildings crowd the skyline and the ping of beepers and cell phones competes with conversation in elegant restaurants and hotel lobbies, it is easy to forget that China remains a Communist state. But during a visit to Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, I could not help wondering whether the advanced case of political sclerosis in China would eventually undermine the country's economic vitality, particularly if an improved standard of living leads to renewed agitation for more freedom and democracy.
The Chinese leadership, for all its economic innovation, remains a fervent keeper of the Communist political faith. Li Zhaoxing, a Vice Foreign Minister, captured the unyielding spirit of several meetings with senior Chinese officials when he explained that China's Constitution protects freedom of speech but not the rights of dissidents. "A citizen is a citizen, a criminal is a criminal," he said with a cold smile. PHILIP TAUBMAN

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
Holding That Line, Wailing That Sax

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Nov. 18

 BODY:
With both teams relying on the run, it had been a bruising first half, particularly for the linemen, in Friday night's championship game between Wilton and Brien McMahon of Norwalk.
As the gun sounded to end the half before a crowd of about 7,000 at Boyle Stadium at Stamford High School, players from both teams headed for the locker rooms. All, that is, except for Peter Yarusavage, a 250-pound lineman who had played the entire half, which ended with Wilton leading the defending state-championship McMahon team, 7-6. 
 Instead, the 17-year-old Yarusavage ran to his team's bench and deposited his helmet and shoulder pads. Then he ran to the north end zone, where his father, George, met him with a bear hug, and his mother, Colleen, began what has become young Peter's halftime ritual -- a quick change into his band uniform, which includes a jacket, cape, plumed hat, gloves and his sax, but not the striped pants or shoes; his football pants and cleats stay on. Then, Yarusavage hustled over to hook up with the 111-member McMahon marching band for its halftime show.
In an era of the one-way football player, meet a three-way player, Peter Yarusavage, who stars at offensive right guard, defensive left tackle and on the baritone saxophone in the outstanding Brien McMahon High School band. Yarusavage is also a star in the classroom, where, while tackling such subjects as physics, economics, calculus, Spanish and English, he currently has a 3.56 grade-point average.
Playing with the McMahon band at halftime is hardly a respite from playing every down during a football game and, indeed, even playing on every special team, except McMahon kickoffs. And with a team that went 12-0 last year and may qualify for the state tournament again if it beats its intracity rival Norwalk High on Thanksgiving Day, the Senators (the team is named for a late United States Senator, Brien McMahon of Norwalk) do not kick off that often. On Friday night, for example, the band played a spirited eight-minute jazz medley, starting with "Don't Get Around Much Anymore."
When the band's performance ended, the 6-foot Yarusavage again hurried to his mother's side, handed her his sax, doffed his band garb and ran on the field to join his teammates, who were already loosening up for the second half. Neither the lack of rest nor Coach Rob Trifone's halftime talk seemed to have any bearing on Yarusavage, who made a number of tackles in the second half and helped open big holes in the line as McMahon (8-2) came back to win, 19-7, handing Wilton its first loss in 10 games this season.
"I ask the other offensive guard, Sean McGrath, what the coaches said at halftime, so I know what we're supposed to do," said Yarusavage, one of McMahon's four captains. "Is it tiring? I don't think so. It's worked out fine."
Trifone is quite happy to share Yarusavage with the band's director, Tom Miner. They worked out the arrangement along with Yarusavage and his mother.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Yarusavage, after two and a half hours of football practice, hurries to the band room at Brien McMahon, where his mother is waiting with dinner at 5 P.M. After eating, he hustles to the parking lot to practice with the band.
On Saturdays, the routine is even more rigorous, particularly when the Senators are playing on the road. Then, Yarusavage practices with the band from 9 to 11:30 A.M. and drives to the game site with his father, since the band does not go on trips, except for special games, such as the Fairfield County championship, which McMahon has won two years in a row.
"And on several Saturdays last year and this year," Miner said, "Peter has driven back to Norwalk from a road game to meet our bus in the parking lot and go off to a competition with us on Saturday nights."
That routine, he said, earned Yarusavage the band's ABCD Award, which stands for Above and Beyond the Call of Duty.
How and why does he do it? "Because I love to play the saxophone, and I love football," he said. "But I guess I have more friends in the band, since I played in the band with a lot of them in middle school, but hadn't played organized football."
How good is Yarusavage?
"Peter is my best lineman, both on offense and defense," Trifone said. "I told him at the beginning that this routine was going to be very trying and that there would be a lot of constraints. But he's very committed and he's handled it very well."

HEADLINE: When Patients Try to Protect Medical Records

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Nov. 15 front-page article on the medical records confidentiality bill reports that some consumer advocates have been advising patients to avoid filing insurance claims even though the services they used were fully covered by their policies. This strategy, the advocates say, will protect sensitive personal information about the patient's health, keeping it out of insurer databases and reducing the risk of its disclosure. 
 Although this advice is well intentioned, it is misguided. I call this strategy the "don't claim-don't tell" strategy. It hurts only the patient; it helps only the insurer. Here's why.
First, by refraining from making a legitimate claim, the patient alone bears the cost of the medical service, instead of the insurer. Although some patients may be able to afford initial treatments for some illnesses or injuries, the need for future treatment and the costs may not be predictable. At some time in the future, these patients may need to rely on their insurance, and all the alleged benefits of concealment will be lost.
More important, the "don't claim-don't tell" strategy is unlikely to protect patient confidentiality. Any secrecy will be short-lived. Even if a claim is not filed, the medical information still exists in the health practitioner's records.
Sooner or later it may be shared with another practitioner, particularly if the trends toward computerization of medical records and integrated health delivery continue.
Most Americans change jobs several times during their work careers -- another trend that is likely to continue in our changing economy. As long as the United States persists in building its health care "system" on private, employer-subsidized insurance, cost-conscious employers will increasingly demand access to employee medical histories.
The information revolution enables employers to gather ever more data on all of us from health care providers and from medical information services to manage the costs of paying for employees' illnesses and those of their families.
When applying for a new job, with a detailed personal health questionnaire to complete, the patient who once engaged in "don't claim-don't tell" faces a painful dilemma.
Should the patient pretend that the illness never existed? Should the patient expect the treating physician to join in this deception? Should the patient simply hope that the prospective employer does not have access to some database, somewhere, that contains this information?
The "don't claim-don't tell" strategy must inevitably backfire sooner or later. And it is the patient (and anyone else on that policy) who suffers when the insurance coverage is refused or sharply limited when any perjury is discovered.
"Don't claim-don't tell" is a desperate, doomed strategy that papers over the underlying problems with our health care "system." What we need is a system in which being ill is a misfortune rather than a dangerous, shameful fact we must conceal lest we lose not only our health but also our benefits and even livelihoods.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Madison From 50th to 57th Street;
From Hodgepodge to Shopping Corridor

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
TRY this geographic free-association test on New York shoppers: Say Madison Avenue above 57th Street. Then Madison south of 50th Street. Now Madison between 50th and 57th Streets.
The first will probably pull some reference to high-fashion women's clothes selling for astronomical prices. The second usually conjures up visions of well-cut men's suits. And the third phrase generally brings to mind . . . nothing in particular. 
 For some time now, Madison Avenue in the 50's has been a characterless hodgepodge of unrelated stores, filler linking the Rodeo Drive cousin to the north and the Bond Street cousin to the south. The Gap and Gap Kids have been on the stretch for a few years, but unlike in other parts of town -- Third Avenue north of Bloomingdale's being the most notable recent example -- few national chains have rushed to follow.
Talbot's, the New England women's apparel chain, has its flagship New York City store near 54th Street, and Tourneau has had a watch store on 52d Street for decades, but both are upscale anomalies in a patternless area that national retailers have, for the most part, ignored.
Now that is starting to change. Within the last few years, Bostonian Shoes opened on 53d Street, a Coach leather store opened on 57th Street, and The Limited opened an Express store on 51st Street. It was that Express, selling high-fashion to young shoppers in a spot where a variety store stood for years, "that signaled to other retailers that this stretch was now O.K. for fashion uses," said Faith H. Consolo, a senior managing director at the Garrick-Aug brokerage.
New retailers are pouring in. The Nine West Group opened an Enzo Angiolini, its upscale shoe chain, on 55th Street in September, and will open an Easy Spirit -- the shoe-store chain that it recently acquired from U.S. Shoe -- a few doors north next month. Folli Follie, an international jewelry chain, is to open near 56th Street around Thanksgiving. Brokers say that The Limited wants to open other stores on the strip, and that Borders Books is scouring the area.
"The area is turning into a great middle-class, middle-of-the-road retail place, an almost classic Main Street," said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director at the Edward S. Gordon Company brokerage.
Retailers see it that way, too. "Madison has always had high-quality retailing, but the area is becoming positively gentrified," said Robin Bartosh, chief executive of Cosmetics Plus, which has had a store near 53d Street for 15 years.
RENTS are soaring. Spaces that a few years ago went for annual rents of $110 a square foot now command $175 and more (although, as always, solid-credit chains in large spaces pay less). Nor has the steep rise dampened ardor for the area.
"I'm getting a lot of clamor from delis and other food stores who really believe that there is not enough food available to service the waves of traffic that go through here now," said Rob Nager, director of retail leasing at Colliers ABR.
A lot of unrelated reasons are converging to revitalize Madison Avenue's midtown stretch. First, there's the law of supply and demand. Spaces on upper Madison are both expensive and scarce, and rarely large enough to accommodate typical mall retailers. By contrast, bank and airline defections and a few store closings have opened a lot of good, big space below 57th Street.
Dime Savings Bank wants to sublet 5,500 square feet on 54th Street. Sterling National Bank is ready to vacate its branch on 55th Street, if it finds a tenant for the 6,000 square feet of street level space and 8,000 square feet of basement space it occupies. There are about 6,000 square feet of street-level space, and 4,000 square feet of mezzanine space sitting empty on 53d Street, where a furniture store once operated.
Smaller stores, too, are getting easier to find. There are about 1,100 square feet available right next to Tourneau, although several brokers say the watch store may expand into the space. Timothy's New World Coffee, put off by the many coffee bars on surrounding streets, changed its mind about opening a coffee bar in 1,350 square feet it recently leased near 51st Street, and is looking for a subtenant. There is a 350- square-foot slot available near 53d Street.
The big spaces are particularly tempting to national chains, many of which are publicly traded and feel a need to show constant expansion to shareholders. Most of them have already saturated the available shopping malls that have been their metier, and have been forced to turn to urban locations. In New York, there are fewer and fewer of those locations around.
"Retail space is getting tight all over the city, so of course tenants go where stores are available," said Edward A. Friedman, president of Newmark Retail Services.
And the pedestrian traffic on the avenue keeps increasing. The area's office buildings, many of which had huge vacancy rates during the last recession, are filling up again, spewing forth more lunchtime and after-work shoppers. And the recent vibrancy in the hotel business has caused the area to fill up on weekends and evenings, too.
The pricey Four Seasons hotel, which opened on 57th Street in 1993, and the revved up Palace Hotel, the 50th Street hotel that the Sultan of Brunei bought from the Helmsley family that same year, have brought many international tourists and business people to the area. The Omni Berkshire hotel at 52d Street, which reopened a few months ago after a one-year overhaul, and the soon-to-be-renovated Roosevelt Hotel at 45th Street, promise to bring even more.
"Our weekend sales have been flat since the Omni closed, but we really expect its reopening to give us back our Saturday and Sunday tourist business," said Mr. Bartosh of Cosmetics Plus.
The area's retail newcomers come with simiarly high expectations. "Maybe three years ago this wouldn't have been the perfect location for us, but today it sure is," said Myrvet Ben-Abdallah, chief financial officer of Madison Jewels, Folli Follie's American distributor. "Now we can capitalize on the brand recognition we have with the Europeans and the Japanese."
New Yorkers, too, have more reason to visit the stretch on weekends. There is Sony Plaza, the glitzy group of shops and attractions in the street-level part of the Sony building at 55th Street, which Sony is in the process of fine-tuning. And next year the Freedom Forum's Center for Media Studies will be opening a museum of news, as well as holding numerous meetings and seminars, in the retail space in the I.B.M. building a block north of Sony.
The activity has caused several retailers to move Madison Avenue higher on their priority lists. "The changes we've been seeing made us move here quicker than we might have," said Brenda Wurtz, 9 West's senior vice president of real estate and store planning. "We always go after spaces where we see potential, and we see a lot happening on Madison both now and in the future."
IN a sense, Madison Avenue retailing is finally turning into what developers had originally envisioned it to be. Back in the 80's, when the Sony building (then the AT&T building), the I.B.M. building, and several other nearby Madison Avenue towers first went up, many of the building owners were hyping their locations as the new alternative to Fifth Avenue, and asking for annual rents of well over $200 a square foot.
"They kept telling investors and brokers that their spaces were perfect for chic, upscale stores because they were but a block away from Fifth," recalled Michael N. Hirschfeld, who heads his own brokerage company. "No one realized that, in retailing, a block away can be Death Valley."
The realization quickly hit home. Mr. Hirschfeld remembers numerous stores, including a French sportswear store and a Korean handbag shop, that came in, paying annual rents of as much as $275 a square foot. They quickly closed, unable to survive at those rents. Slowly at first -- then precipitately when the recession hit in the late '80s -- the rents came down, and food shops, card stores, drugstores and others aimed at servicing the local office workers moved in.
There are still plenty of stationery stores, eyeglass stores and the like dotting the area and catering almost entirely to the office crowd. But, brokers and retailers say, the "feel" of the area is changing rapidly.
"It used to just feel like a place with a mix of stores," Ms. Consolo said. "Now it's getting the feel of a real shopping corridor."
 The article should have verified the account with New World, or attributed the information to the brokers who provided it. A lawyer for New World says that the company had terminated the lease and was not seeking subtenants, and that concern about competition was not a factor. The matter is now in litigation.

 CORRECTION:
The Commercial Property column in the Real Estate Section on Nov. 19 discussed changes in retailing on Madison Avenue. It included a brief reference to space that had been leased for a coffee bar on 51st Street. The article misidentified the concern that had leased the space. It was New World Coffee, not Timothy's New World Coffee. The article said that New World had decided against opening at the 51st Street location and was seeking subtenants for the space because of the number of other coffee bars nearby.

HEADLINE: State Invites Public's Ideas on I-287 Bottleneck

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
LIKE the irate tempers of commuters, the rhetoric is heating up over proposals to ease traffic congestion along Interstate 287. Increasingly, as a public hearing on the matter nears, the battle lines are being drawn between environmental groups opposing further expansion of the busy east-west corridor and the business community, which wants better ways to bring more workers, travelers and shoppers to White Plains and its environs.
The Cross Westchester Expressway, as I-287 is also known, cuts a broad swath through the county just north of White Plains, forming one of the most heavily traveled corridors in southern New York State. 
 Built more than 30 years ago, shortly after completion of the Tappan Zee Bridge, the six-lane highway connects the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway (Interstate 87) with the New England Thruway (Interstate 95) -- and carries 100,000 vehicles a day. With the recent completion of I-287 in northern New Jersey, the road has picked up additional truck traffic and become part of a major suburban beltway.
As the populations of nearby Dutchess, Putnam, Rockland and Orange Counties have grown and more major businesses have located along the expressway, the problems have increased. On better days during rush hour, vehicles inch along at 30 miles an hour. Often, they are at a standstill. Also, the accident rate has steadily risen and now exceeds statewide averages for similar roads.
At the Dec. 6 hearing, the State Department of Transportation will officially unveil plans to the public to spend up to $365 million to improve conditions on 14 miles of the interstate from Route 303 west of the Tappan Zee Bridge to I-95. Although transportation officials support plans for a high-occupancy-vehicle lane to move traffic more quickly, they say they are eager to please and remain open to suggestions.
"There's nothing Machiavellian about our motives," said Richard A. Peters, regional planning and program manager for the Department of Transportation. "We could take the do-nothing approach, rehabilitate the six lanes that are there, add another lane each way or add a reversible H.O.V. lane. Our goal is to provide safe, economical and efficient transportation for the people of New York. We're all heading for the same place. We're just disagreeing sometimes on how to get there."
As for the environmentalists, they favor the do-nothing approach, asserting that bigger roads bring more traffic, generate more air pollution and invade what little open space is left. They support increased reliance on mass-transit alternatives.
"If you build, people and businesses will come, and that's how we got to this gridlock situation to begin with," said Maureen M. Morgan, president of Federated Conservationists of Westchester, a 30-year-old network of 70 environmental organizations.
Meanwhile, those representing business interests said they would like to expand the road. They see an office-vacancy rate as high as 30 percent in downtown White Plains and in industrial parks along the interstate.
"It's absurd to say you want to fill up that office space and at the same time limit road development," said Frank Ronnenberg, executive director of the Westchester Transportation Management Organization, a state and county partnership formed three years ago to study transportation issues.
Those opposing expansion of the road, like James T. B. Tripp, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, a national advocacy group, say that additional capacity will not solve congestion problems or benefit business.
"Typically, what happens is that billions are spent to expand a highway, only to induce businesses and people to develop along it," Mr. Tripp said. "Some see road development as a way to promote economic revitalization, but it also may have the opposite effect in the long run, because it can encourage sprawl. It can enable businesses to move farther away."
The environmentalists, like Mr. Tripp and Ms. Morgan, support the development of more mass transit in Westchester and Rockland Counties and the use of discounts for travelers who cross the Tappan Zee Bridge at off-peak hours, a policy known as congestion pricing.
The high-occupancy lanes are not practical, Ms. Morgan recently said, claiming that few people would chose to car pool to work.
"There are too many disadvantages," she said. "People talk too much, or they talk too little, or they rattle their newspapers. For most commuters, a car pool is too much of a close situation.
"The ads say, 'I spend half of my life in the car.' But, my God, who in their right mind would want to? What we need is more and better mass transit."
Mr. Ronnenberg, representing business interests, agreed that mass transit could prove to be the best alternative for many commuters. His organization, which is financed in part by the Federal Highway Administration, has encouraged more bus service on the county-operated Bee-Line System's routes. It has also supported three shuttles that pick up train travelers in White Plains and transport them to office parks on Route 287.
In compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act, the organization has completed transportation surveys with employees at 315 work sites in the county and conducts workshops to inform commuters of mass transit options.
Although the Westchester Transportation Management Organization is opposed to high-occupancy lanes -- "They serve too small a group for too short a distance," Mr. Ronnenberg said -- the group backs expansion of I-287 to eight lanes.
"There is the reality of lots of empty office space along the corridor, and so we need to look at the situation from all points of view," he said.
The American Automobile Association will also be represented at the hearing, and it is also supporting expansion of the expressway.
"Retaining only six lanes will basically suffocate Westchester over time," said Mark Kulewicz, a traffic engineer for the motorists' advocacy organization.
Also, he said that Westchester's severe ozone problem, determined by Federal air-quality standards, was being exacerbated by stop-and-start traffic on I-287.
The automobile association also opposes congestion pricing on the Tappan Zee Bridge. Mr. Kulewicz said such a policy had met strong opposition from commuters using the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in California. "Quite simply," he said, "the public did not want to be charged more to get to work."
He added: "Let's face it. The automobile is the most convenient way to travel. And if you make it too difficult for people to go to one place, they will go to another that is more convenient. White Plains and Harrison will lose out."
But Paul J. Feiner, Town Supervisor of Greenburgh, said he didn't buy Mr. Kulewicz's arguments.
"I-287 doesn't do a thing for Westchester," said the Supervisor, who argued that truck drivers and travelers rarely stop on their way to other destinations. "The state should be fixing problems on the road, not causing more problems."
Mayor Sy J. Schulman of White Plains, however, said he favored widening the road and even including a high-occupancy lane in the plans to benefit business development. "We don't want to choke off the future," he said.
The State Department of Transportation is projecting that the number of vehicles will continue to increase along I-287 -- from 100,000 now to 170,000 a day by the year 2021. According to projections, if no roadway improvements are made, in 30 years, traffic will practically be brought to a halt for three hours or more during peak periods.
Under the department's "no-build alternative," the state would make only spot improvements to correct structural deficiencies in the road and overpasses but would not address congestion and safety.
Under another proposal to be aired at the hearing, the state would correct safety and operational problems. A concrete median barrier would be placed in the center of the expressway, and several acceleration and deceleration lanes would be lengthened. Also, most of the bridges would be rehabilitated or replaced.
The eight-lane plan calls for four 12-foot-wide lanes in each direction.
The purpose of the high-occupancy-vehicle plan, the state said, is to encourage more use of car pools, buses and vans and "move more people in fewer vehicles."
The Dec. 6 public hearing will begin at 4:30 P.M. at the County Center in White Plains.

HEADLINE: Giving Small Businesses Keys to Success

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
THERE are those who work from 9 to 5 and there are those who work from 5 to 9 and the difference between them, Lloyd Shefsky said, is that those in the 5 to 9 category are working for themselves.
"Only they get to decide if 5 to 9 means 4 hours of work or 16 or anything in between," Mr. Shefsky said. "I know entrepreneurs who have succeeded by working four hours a day and made a fortune. But when they worked, they were so passionate about what they were doing that no matter what it took them to do, they'd do it." 
 Mr. Shefsky heads a Chicago law firm that specializes in advising entrepreneurs. He also is the author of the book "Entrepreneurs Are Made Not Born" (McGraw Hill). He appeared here recently as one of the speakers at an entrepreneur conference and workshop co-sponsored by the Entrepreneurial Center in Purchase, Citibank and the Westchester/Fairfield County Business Journal, which was held in Reid Castle at Manhattanville College.
As for the other conference speakers, Tim and Nina Zagat, publishers of the Zagat Surveys, Ruth Henderson, owner of the Silo, a cooking school in New Milford, and Spencer Putnam, chief operating officer of the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, they all agreed that one trait successful entrepreneurs have in common is passion for their venture.
"Passion is absolutely essential, it is important to choose something you love to do," Mr. Zagat said. "If you don't, you won't do all the extra things people do to make their dreams work and chances are the venture won't succeed."
The 147 conference participants who paid $149 to attend were mainly those who had already started businesses, said Marge Lovero, president of the Entrepreneurial Center.
"This was our ninth entrepreneurial conference, and I was struck with the way things have changed over the years," she said. "People came from New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania to the conference and we had fewer start-ups. The participants were older and more men than women were in attendance. Many of them were former executives embarked on second or third careers. Others were established small-business owners who were looking for ways to grow their businesses."
The first conferences were held at Manhattanville College, Ms. Lovero said, when Manhattanville was an all-women school and the conference participants were all women.
"That was the time when opportunities for corporate careers were unlimited," she said. "It was not the era of the entrepreneur and information on entrepreneurship was scarce. We were one of the first to recognize that people who wanted to know how to become entrepreneurs needed a place to learn how to take the initial step."
In 1992, the entrepreneurial center expanded so well that it left the college to set up as a nonprofit organization with headquarters at 100 Manhattanville Road in Purchase, the former Nestle Building.
"We took our own advice and grew our business so successfully that we now have 50 teachers who give on-site training in entrepreneurship to employees of Fortune 500 companies," Ms. Lovero said. "We teach employees of large corporations how to take ownership responsibility. When they do that they change their mindset and become more effective employees." The fear of failure, Ms. Lovero pointed out, is the No. 1 barrier stopping would-be entrepreneurs in their tracks.
"That was true nine years ago at our first conference, and it is true today," she said. "So when Spencer Putnam told the participants at the conference how they turn their failures into a learning experience, the audience really took heart."
The focus of the most recent conference was on marketing. Participants have the chance to attend various workshops dealing with subjects like targeting your market, financing your marketing efforts and the legal aspects of marketing.
Small businesses, Ms. Lovero said, are called the engines of the economy because today about 20 million of them are in existence.
"Entrepreneurs create opportunities for others," said John Geils, who, with his son William, owns Wina Products in Fairfield, manufacturers of products for the pet market. The Geilses were at the conference, said John Geils, in order to seek ways to make their year-old business grow.
"We know we have unique products, one we call Dander-Seal controls pet allergies and seals and controls pet dander," William Geils said. "And it's nontoxic and keeps the house allergy free . But we need advice in marketing, and we are getting it here."
Debra C. Weissman, another conference participant, said this is the best time to be an entrepreneur. "Especially in the health-care field, which is changing as we speak," said Ms. Weissman, who was on her way to a workshop on breakthrough marketing strategies. "I have a medical and dental practice management-consulting business in White Plains, and I started in business by showing doctors and dentists how to run their practices on a business-like basis," she said. "I used to work at a very good job at a major hospital in Manhattan, but I realized that there was a job ceiling that I kept bumping into. As an entrepreneur, I feel the sky's the limit."
Barbara F. Hibbert is a former corporate executive who spent 23 years training employees at I.B.M. Ms. Hibbert is now using the skills she honed at International Business Machines to build her own company. As an entrepreneur, she is not only training employees for clients, but has become a meeting planner as well. "I work hard, I travel a lot and do you know what?" she said, "I love being my own boss."
Cynthia Ehrenkrantz is no novice business owner. She has run her fine-food and confectionary brokerage in White Plains for 11 years. But Ms. Ehrenkrantz said she came to the conference "because I am looking for advice on how to take my business to the next level." "I know I am ready to expand," she continued, "and the workshops that deal with marketing, especially financing marketing efforts and marketing with a competitive edge I think will be extremely useful to me."
Marilyn R. Zuckerman, the manager of A.T.&T. corporate quality office, presided over a workshop called "Marketing Quality or Else." She was there, Ms. Zuckerman explained, because big business also needs expertise in developing entrepreneurship.
"The same things that drive entrepreneurs are necessary in big business today," she said. "That is the willingness to put in long hours, the ability to listen to customers and supply them with what they want. These are essential today if companies are going to thrive. Look at start-up companies, that's where the cutting-edge ideas come from."
As for Mr. Shefsky's definition of an entrepreneur -- "someone who enters a business before the nerve system or core is established and who conceives an idea and gathers the sources to create and develop it into a successful venture" -- the conference attendees agreed it was apt.
