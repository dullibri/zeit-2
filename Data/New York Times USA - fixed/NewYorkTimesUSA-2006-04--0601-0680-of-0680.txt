HEADLINE: Where Wall Street Meets to Eat, the Last Lunch

BYLINE: By PETER EDMONSTON; Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
What was once the site of Wall Street's quintessential power lunch is preparing its last meal.
 The Stock Exchange Luncheon Club, a wood-paneled dining room that has served members of the New York Stock Exchange and other Wall Street power brokers since 1898, is closing at the end of business today.
The members-owned club, on the seventh floor of the New York Stock Exchange, was where market titans and traders toasted their investing successes and lamented their losses. Andrew Carnegie supped on oysters there, and Richard A. Grasso held court. 
 ''It was the grandest of places for people in business,'' recalled Peter Dully, 64, a retired managing director at Bear Stearns and a member of the luncheon club for 42 years. Mr. Dully said he went to the club for years every morning for breakfast and hung his coat there and returned at the end of the trading day to talk shop and trade stories over a single-malt whiskey or a cold beer.
 But after surviving market crashes, world wars and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the club decided it could no longer go on. 
 In a letter to its members, the luncheon club said it had lost both members and money since the exchange put enhanced security measures in place after Sept. 11, making the club's facilities less accessible. The club also pointed to the general disappearance of New York's luncheon clubs, which were once plentiful in the Wall Street area.
 More broadly, the club's demise parallels the changes that have swept through Wall Street.
 Financial services firms, while booming, have been more mindful of reining in expense accounts since the stock bubble burst in 2000. The New York Stock Exchange itself has become less of a club, converting from a member-owned institution to a publicly traded, for-profit company after a merger with Archipelago. And the rise of electronic trading has kept traders and other market participants glued to their workstations.
 The club's marbled and chandelier-filled rooms also became a bit emptier after Mr. Grasso, one of its most dedicated patrons, was ousted as chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange in 2003. Mr. Grasso often used the club to celebrate initial public offerings, and the club closed its main dining room temporarily after his departure.
 The club's decision to close will leave 55 employees without a job, according to a spokesman for a union representing some of the workers. The spokesman, John Turchiano, said the club failed to give the workers adequate notice that it would shut down, as their contract requires.
 Kevin McGrath, a lawyer for the club, said the organization was ''very sensitive'' to its employees and had notified them as soon as it knew it would close on Tuesday. ''We intend to honor every benefit that accrued to them as a result of their contract,'' he said.
 It is not clear how many members will find time to visit the club for what will be its final round of hamburgers today.
 Those that do can take one last look at the heads of moose and elk mounted in the lobby and the leather chairs in the lounge, all of which will be sold to pay the club's employees and vendors, Mr. McGrath said.
 A spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, which leases its space to the luncheon club, said the decision to close was ''unfortunate yet understandable.''
 ''The club's board, members and staff, with the support of exchange management, have done their utmost in recent years to maintain viability of the Luncheon Club, which has been a prominent fixture at the exchange for more than 100 years,'' said the spokesman, Richard Adamonis. ''It will be missed.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. SENATORS HURRY TO QUELL FUROR OVER GAS

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Matthew L. Wald and Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans tried on Thursday to get the upper hand in the escalating political battle over high gasoline prices by proposing a $100 rebate for taxpayers and by suggesting that they might increase taxes on oil-industry profits.
 The Republican proposal also called for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production, a provision sure to draw opposition from many Democrats and even some Republicans.
 ''The American consumer is the one that needs the break today, and we need to be taking steps to make sure that they aren't emptying their wallet every time they fill their tank,'' said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, as the leadership unveiled its legislative response to an issue quickly taking over the Congressional agenda. 
 The Republican plan includes a provision that could levy a significant tax on oil company profits, a provision that President Bush promised to veto when a version appeared in a Senate bill last year. The proposal came on a day when Exxon Mobil reported a 7 percent gain in its first-quarter earnings. [Page C3.] 
 Greeting surprised customers at a BP service station in Biloxi, Miss., on Thursday, Mr. Bush compared rising gasoline prices to a new tax. In brief remarks there, confronting an issue that is adding to his political woes, he endorsed one aspect of the Senate proposal by encouraging Congress to give him the same authority to set standards for gasoline mileage of cars as he has over light trucks, sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans.
 The president also promised to curb price gouging, increase refinery capacity and support alternative fuels. 
 ''One of the things we've got to do is make these trucks run on ethanol and batteries that won't require gasoline,'' he said. ''That's what the future is going to be.''
 Democrats quickly dismissed the new Republican approach as a backdoor effort to overcome deep-seated opposition to drilling in the Arctic refuge.
 ''Americans are struggling to pay the rising cost of gas,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, ''and they are not interested in handouts to help oil companies make more money by letting them drill in wildlife refuges.'' 
 Democrats pressed their own ideas, including a proposal by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, for a 60-day suspension on the 18.4-cent-per-gallon federal tax on gasoline and 24-cent diesel tax. 
 ''It is direct relief at the pump,'' Mr. Menendez said. 
 Some Republicans, including Mr. Thune, have also endorsed a suspension of those taxes.
 Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, tied up the Senate for almost five hours on Thursday in an effort to force a vote on his proposal to prohibit oil companies from escaping federal royalties for drilling on public lands when oil prices exceeded $55 per barrel. (Prices recently rose above $75 a barrel.) But Republicans blocked that effort.
 ''You cannot get a vote up or down in the United States Senate on a rip-off of taxpayer money,'' Mr. Wyden said.
 The exchanges in the Senate and elsewhere on Capitol Hill illustrated both the political dangers and potential opportunities presented by the rise in gasoline prices and the accompanying consumer discomfort.
 ''This gas price issue is huge,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.
 Democrats say they believe that the public unhappiness will play into their efforts to regain control of the House and Senate this fall as they try to convince voters of the close ties between Republicans and oil companies and remind voters of industry-friendly legislation advocated by Republicans.
 ''High gas prices are going to be the final nail in the G.O.P.'s coffin this election year,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
 But Republicans say they believe that their new proposal, which is promoted as an eight-point plan and which was announced at a news conference attended by several senators facing re-election this year, could strike a public chord, particularly with its promise of a $100 check to millions of taxpayers.
 It is unclear when the Senate might move forward on the issue or how the Bush administration and the House, where Republicans and Democrats have their own ideas circulating, will respond.
 But a chief aide to Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said the midterm elections would be a catalyst for Congressional action.
 ''The political will is there,'' said Eric Ueland, chief of staff to Mr. Frist. ''The need is very real. And the urge to help constituents directly and quickly is omnipresent.''
 The price tag for the Republican package had not been calculated, but aides said it would cost less than $20 billion. The proposed rebate was patterned after a refund sent to taxpayers early in Mr. Bush's first term as a down payment on an initial set of tax cuts.
 The $100 payment would not be tied to gasoline consumption but would be sent to taxpayers at the end of the summer, going to single-filing taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes below $145,950, and to couples earning less than $218,950. The Finance Committee estimated that at least 100 million taxpayers would qualify.
 Republican authors of the plan said opening the Arctic refuge to drilling was essential because it could provide federal revenue to pay for the initiative as well as increase domestic oil production. 
 "We need to open up the reserve of oil and gas that we have in this country,'' said Senator Jim Talent of Missouri, one of the Republicans up for re-election. "With all due respect, I cannot understand what coherent political philosophy cuts its own country off from oil.''
 The Republican package would also ease environmental regulations and provide other incentives to add to oil refinery capacity, outlaw unjustifiable price increases and increase tax breaks for owners of hybrid vehicles.
 In a proposal expected to draw significant opposition from the oil industry and perhaps the business community at large, the Republican plan would repeal a method of accounting for inventories, known as last in first out, or LIFO. The method, which is used in many industries, gives oil companies a chance to avoid some large capital gains taxes through its accounting of sales from inventory.
 The Senate had previously considered a similar provision that would have prohibited major oil companies from using the LIFO method for one year. It was expected to raise about $5 billion, but it generated a storm of opposition from oil companies and Mr. Bush threatened to veto the bill unless lawmakers rejected it.
 The new proposal would prevent all companies from using the LIFO method, not just oil companies, and the prohibition would be permanent, instead of limited to one year.
 On the fuel-economy issue, federal transportation officials say they need new authority to set higher standards for cars. as they did for trucks last month. The Senate bill would give them that ability. 
 But any change in federal standards for mileage would be a long-term fix since automakers are required to have 18 months' notice of any change and creating the new rule would involve a process that would take months in itself.
 At the White House, a spokeswoman said the administration would consider the Congressional proposals but would make no commitments. 
 "We are taking all options into account that seek to relieve what is certainly the burden of high gasoline prices on American consumers,'' said the spokeswoman, Dana Perino.
 Ms. Perino said the president remained focusedon solving the fundamental problem of supply and demand "so that we can end a vicious cycle.''
 Lawmakers were grappling for other ways to contend immediately with gasoline prices and oil industry profits. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee quickly passed legislation that would make it a violation of antitrust laws to manipulate oil supplies to drive up prices.
 In the House, Republicans, voting largely along party lines, rejected a symbolic effort by Democrats to urge House tax negotiators to support the Senate on rolling back tax breaks for oil companies.

HEADLINE: Pander at the Pump

 BODY:
The battle to see which political party can out-pander the other on the subject of gasoline prices is embarrassing. If American consumers are having sticker shock at the pumps, it's because of a series of policy failures that stretch back decades. The last thing the country needs now is another irresponsible quick fix.
 Senate Republicans have proposed to assuage the pain of high gas prices by sending many taxpayers $100 apiece -- enough for about two tanks of gas. Meanwhile, a cadre of Senate Democrats is carrying on about a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, the same level it was in 1993. At best, the suspension would temporarily reduce prices a fraction, causing car owners to drive a little more. That rise in demand would send prices back up again. 
 Lawmakers from both houses and parties are calling for investigations into any price gouging or other rip-offs by oil companies and filling stations. It's perfectly all right to look into these things, but no one imagines that the result will be much more than a series of photo-ops.
 Suspending environmental safeguards -- as President Bush proposed in his energy speech earlier this week -- might send prices down a bit, at the price of dirtier air. It's appalling that a generation after the first oil shock, in 1973, politicians are still reacting with such hysteria.
 The main problem is not environmental regulations or even rapacious oil companies. It certainly isn't the fact that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been kept off limits for drilling. Americans' outsized demand for oil and gasoline pushes up prices, and now that the economies of huge countries like China and India have taken off, there will continue to be more competition for the world's available oil. There are policy solutions for the problem of excess demand, chief among them higher fuel economy standards. But more than five years into the Bush administration, there has been only a minuscule increase in mileage standards for S.U.V.'s and no increase for cars. 
 The oil companies' mind-boggling profits have produced calls for a windfall profits tax. It would not be too difficult to set up a system that would capture a percentage of the companies' extraordinary profits, and the money could be used for long-term solutions, like research into alternate fuels and mass transit. That would be fair. Oil companies are indeed profiting from events that have little to do with their efforts. If some of those profits were taxed and flowed into the public treasury, the money could go toward public purposes. 
 But critics who say such a tax discourages investment in exploration and drilling have a point. Though they invariably overstate their case, their opposition would make a windfall tax a heavy lift politically, thereby draining effort from other, more direct, solutions, like better mileage standards and ultimately -- the hardest sell of all -- a bolstered federal gas tax to encourage conservation. 
 It's important during this debate not to discount the genuine pain being felt by the poor and middle-class families who must drive long distances just to get to work and school. But their problem is more than gasoline prices. It's their vulnerability to the price increases, which results from stagnating wages and a lack of savings. If the Bush administration had devoted as much political capital in the past five years to wage and job growth initiatives as it has to cutting taxes for the wealthy, these struggling families would be better able to weather higher prices at the pump. 
 Congress's frantic gestures this week are, at bottom, an attempt to divert attention from its past failures to act, and its resulting inability to shield Americans from the burden of high prices at the pump. But the pain of high gas prices will only get worse unless Congress changes its priorities, now.

HEADLINE: Iran Vows to Defy U.N. on Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD and ELAINE SCIOLINO; William J. Broad reported from New York for this article, and Elaine Sciolino from Vienna. Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Sofia, Bulgaria.

 BODY:
Iran vowed yesterday to defy any United Nations Security Council resolution on its nuclear activities on the eve of a major report by atomic inspectors on the status of its nuclear program.
 Javad Zarif, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters in New York that Iran would consider illegitimate any Council resolution calling on Iran to stop uranium enrichment that invoked the so-called Chapter 7 clause, which could open the door to penalties and possibly to military action.
The United States has been pressing for such a resolution. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said yesterday that the Security Council had no choice but to rebuke Iran and that negotiations had apparently broken down between International Atomic Energy Agency monitors and Iranian envoys. 
 Today, the agency will deliver to the Security Council a report expected to be highly critical of Iran's compliance with demands that it stop enriching uranium. 
 The Council is expected to meet, probably next week, to debate what, if any, punitive action to take against Iran. 
 ''If the Security Council decides to take decisions that are not within its competence, Iran is not obliged to obey them,'' Mr. Zarif said, speaking to reporters at the residence of the Iranian Mission to the United Nations in Manhattan.
 He said the matter should properly be handled by the atomic energy agency, not the United Nations. 
 He also sought to portray Iran's defiant stance as nothing more than a logical response to American threats against Iran.
 ''We're not upping the ante,'' he said. ''We're simply responding to others upping the ante.''
 Ms. Rice, speaking in Bulgaria at a conference of envoys from NATO and the European Union, said, ''What is clear is that it is highly unlikely that Iran is going to accede to the demands of the international community.''
 She added, ''In order to be credible, the Security Council of course has to act.''
 Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter deals with ''threats to the peace, breaches of peace, and acts of aggression,'' and its application in this case would make Iranian compliance binding under international law.
 As a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran has the right to enrich uranium, but the United States and its European allies have argued that Iran's concealment of nuclear activities in the past means it has forfeited that right. 
 In January, Iran restarted its effort to make atomic fuel after negotiations with Britain, France and Germany over the fate of its atomic program broke down, and a month ago the Council voted unanimously to give Iran 30 days to show it had stopped enriching uranium.
 Yesterday in Vienna, Iranian officials delivered a confidential letter to the agency that emphasized its determination to press on with its nuclear program, defying calls from other nations to freeze its activities, according to a European official who had seen the document. 
 The letter was a response to the agency's demand for more cooperation from Iran to investigate suspicions that Iran has been researching ways to produce warheads or delivery systems for weapons. Iran has denied such activities. The letter reflected a hardening of Iran's position and asked other nations to make concessions to Iran, the official said. 
 A senior Iranian official confirmed the delivery of the letter, which he said would probably be made public today. 
 Although the United States is pushing for tough measures, it is far from clear whether Russia would drop its opposition to a Chapter 7 resolution at the Security Council.
 Past opposition by Russia, China and others has forced the United States to back down from its demand for such a resolution, but now American and European diplomats hope that a new critical finding by the International Atomic Energy Agency will increase support for the action it wants.
 Iran insists that its activities are for peaceful purposes only, and its leaders have kept up a barrage of criticism of the United States, Europe and others who suspect it of concealing a nuclear weapons program. In the past several days, Iranian officials have threatened to strike at American military targets if the United States attacks Iran. The officials have also offered to share nuclear technology with other nations, including Sudan. 
 Last week, Iran informed the monitoring agency that it would provide only the minimal level of cooperation legally required under its safeguards agreement with the agency as a signatory to the nonproliferation treaty. 
 That decision made it much harder for the agency's nuclear inspectors to visit sites in Iran and led Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the agency's director general, to cancel a trip to Iran by his senior inspectors. 
 Meanwhile, European diplomats said Iran was expanding its efforts to enrich uranium on an industrial scale with centrifuges -- tall, thin machines whose rotors spin extraordinarily fast to concentrate uranium's rare form, uranium 235, which can fuel nuclear reactors or atom bombs.
 Diplomats familiar with what Iran has told atomic inspectors in recent days said the country had started work on second and third ''cascades'' of 164 centrifuges, preparing to match the first already in operation at its enrichment facility in Natanz.
 David Albright, an expert on the Iranian centrifuge program and president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private research group in Washington, said the Iranian expansion made technical sense but did not necessarily bespeak a major advance.
 ''I don't think the first cascade is running all that well,'' he said. ''So that's an incentive to build more to learn how to get them working more efficiently. They might need to do many experiments.''

HEADLINE: Playing It by Ear

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, indicated on Thursday that the central bank was ready for a cautious experiment.
 Despite unexpectedly strong economic growth in recent months, and some evidence of a risk of higher inflation, Mr. Bernanke told Congress that the Fed's policy-making committee might pause temporarily in its two-year campaign to raise interest rates.
''At some point in the future, the committee may decide to take no action at one or more meetings in the interest of allowing more time to receive information relevant to the outlook,'' Mr. Bernanke told members of the Joint Economic Committee. 
 ''Of course,'' he added, ''a decision to take no action at a particular meeting does not preclude actions at subsequent meetings.''
 Mr. Bernanke's comment, which he repeated in the same hearing, signaled that the Federal Reserve might stop its rate increases after one more adjustment at its meeting on May 10. 
 But it also raised the possibility of a ''stop and go'' approach that would differ significantly from the Fed's typical pattern over the last two decades. Mr. Bernanke suggested that the Fed's actions from now on would be governed by the signals it receives from economic data.
 Investors quickly reduced their bets that the central bank might raise interest rates at its late June meeting. Based on prices of federal funds futures, investors reduced the odds of a second rate increase in June by about half, to 30 percent.
 At its policy meetings, which are usually held approximately every six weeks, the Federal Reserve has raised the overnight federal funds rate 15 consecutive times in the last two years, to 4.75 percent from 1 percent, and it is all but certain to raise it to 5 percent at its May meeting. 
 Fed officials made it clear earlier this month that they were near the end of their march toward higher rates. But a pause would let policy makers see if their efforts are having the impact they expected.
 ''It is quite sensible for them to sit back and see where they are,'' said Paul Ashworth, senior international economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm in London. 
 ''The rule of thumb is that effects of rate increases take about 12 to 18 months to come through in the pipeline,'' Mr. Ashworth said. ''One of the things the Fed wants to do is make sure the cumulative impact of past tightening has had the effect it was supposed to have.''
 The uncertainty is whether moves so far by the Fed will cool the economy enough to keep inflation under control. With unemployment in March at 4.7 percent, the nation is still adding about 200,000 jobs a month -- a fairly robust pace.
 Mr. Bernanke's game plan assumes that growth will slow from about 5 percent in the quarter that just ended to an annual rate of about 3 percent in the months ahead, which would be enough to keep unemployment low while easing inflation fears.
 On Thursday, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that the economy might have expanded at an unexpectedly rapid pace of nearly 5 percent in the first three months. 
 But, he added, ''it seems reasonable to expect that economic growth will moderate to a more sustainable pace as the year progresses.''
 Despite an increase in home sales last month, Mr. Bernanke said the housing market and housing prices would ''most likely experience a gradual cooling'' that would slow the rise in household wealth and consumer spending.
 Mr. Bernanke predicted that high energy prices would slow the economy slightly as well, though he expressed more concern that those energy costs would lead to higher prices for other goods and services. 
 Laurence H. Meyer, senior forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers, said Mr. Bernanke's comments on Thursday ''helped clarify'' the Fed's plans and predicted that it would pause after raising rates to 5 percent next month.
 By many measures, the federal funds rate is in line with what economists say they believe is a neutral rate that neither provokes inflation nor slows the economy. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, excluding prices of food and energy, remains about 2 percent a year -- just at the top end of what policy makers view as their comfort zone.
 If the Fed pushes overnight interest rates to 5 percent next month, it would be nearly three percentage points above the core rate of inflation. That would be in line with historical patterns, and a major reversal from two years ago, when the Fed's benchmark was well below the rate of inflation.
 According to minutes from the Fed's policy meeting in March, most policy makers thought they were near the end of raising rates and several ''expressed concern about the dangers of tightening too much.''

HEADLINE: China Raises Rates to Slow Its Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 27 

 BODY:
China's central bank raised lending rates on Thursday for the first time in a year and a half, in a move by Chinese leaders to rein in the world's fastest-growing economy.
 The action aims to slow a spectacular surge in investment and it may potentially brake China's voracious appetite on world markets for oil and other commodities.
With interest rates already climbing in the United States and the European Union, and with monetary officials starting to tighten policy in Japan, China seems to be joining the world's central bankers in trying to gain control of speculation that has driven up prices of assets like gold and real estate. 
 From steel mills and auto factories to luxury apartment buildings and plush office complexes, China has been engaged in a nationwide building boom fueled by easy loans from banks and other financial institutions. 
 New loans soared at least 61 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the period last year, causing investment in factories and other fixed assets to climb 29.8 percent. 
 ''It is easy to borrow money,'' said Jack Lee, a manager at the Guangchan Conveyor Idlers Company in east central China, which had an 80 percent jump last year in its sales of conveyor belt rollers and is now buying more equipment to open a second production line next year.
 China's boom in lending and investment, which has contributed to the country's rapidly rising exports, pushed growth in China's economy to 10.2 percent in the first quarter. That was high even by China's extraordinary standards, and so strong that President Hu Jintao himself warned on April 16 that the country needed efficient, high-quality development and not ''excessively rapid economic growth.''
 The National Development and Reform Commission in Beijing warned on Tuesday, for example, that annual demand for cement was 1.05 billion tons while production capacity had reached 1.3 billion tons. Three-fifths of the capacity, moreover, was for low-quality cement of the sort that China's increasingly advanced economy no longer needs.
 The policy-setting agency called for local governments to limit new projects in a range of industries facing overcapacity, from aluminum to cars to textiles.
 The effectiveness of somewhat higher interest rates in slowing growth, however, remains to be seen. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, said that it was raising the benchmark lending rates on one-year loans by 27-hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.85 percent. It was the same size increase as on Oct. 28, 2004, the last time China raised rates. That increase was the first in nine years.
 The central bank said it was acting to strengthen economic controls to ''sustain fast-paced, balanced and healthy development of the economy.''
 But the central bank did not change bank deposit rates. By raising lending rates while leaving deposit rates untouched, the government will allow banks to widen their profit margins to cover losses on loan defaults.
 Moreover, by isolating deposit rates, China's move is unlikely to address calls by industrialized countries, including the Group of 7 last weekend, for China's currency to gain in value. One-year bank deposits earn just 2.25 percent in China, and leaving that rate unchanged makes it slightly less attractive for foreign investors to pump money into China and therefore bid up the value of the yuan, the Chinese currency.
 Low deposit rates also encourage Chinese consumers to spend more, a government goal, rather than save. Urban savings rates exceed 40 percent, as families realize that the government has drastically reduced its role in providing pensions, health care and education.
 Prime Minister Wen Jiabao warned on April 14 that China would move to tighten controls over lending and real estate. But most economists were taken by surprise by the central bank's decision to raise interest rates instead of imposing other lending controls. 
 ''They want to send a strong message that they are serious about seeing a slowdown in lending rates,'' said Frank Gong, the chief economist for greater China at J. P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. ''I don't think this is the start of a series of hikes, but it is to send a strong message.''
 Tim Condon, the chief Asian economist at ING, said that Chinese officials were probably not worried about inflation, given that the consumer price index in China was just eight-tenths of a percent higher in March than a year earlier. ''It's a pre-emptive strike -- they don't want investment to accelerate any further,'' he said.
 All the signs are that China's central bank has acted much earlier this time to rein in economic growth than it did the last time the economy threatened to overheat, in 2004. Chinese business leaders say that the acceleration of economic growth this spring has not caused the kinds of chaotic problems that surfaced back then, like bottlenecks in some places and excesses in others. 
 The issue instead is the volume of fresh lending and construction, which is producing gluts of capacity that are pulling down prices in China and causing Chinese companies to export more and more of their excess production to foreign markets.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Is Still Growing At Rapid Pace 

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Gas prices are rising, as are mortgage rates. House prices in many once-hot markets have started slipping. The American automobile industry shows no sign of recovery. And the paychecks of most workers have not even kept up with inflation over the last four years.
 Yet the national economy continues to speed ahead, with families and businesses spending money at an impressive pace. Forecasters expect the Commerce Department to report this morning that the economy grew at a rate of around 5 percent in the first quarter, the biggest increase since 2003.
 The industries leading the way are ones that have been receiving far less attention than cars or real estate, though they have been adding thousands of new workers each month. In the last year, hospitals, doctors' offices and other health care employers have created almost 300,000 jobs; restaurants have added 230,000; and local governments -- including schools -- have added 170,000. 
 ''The good news for the U.S. is that growth has diversified,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, an economic research firm. ''We aren't just relying on the consumer and housing.'' 
 Testifying before Congress yesterday, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that the Fed would soon take time out from steadily raising its benchmark short-term interest rate to weigh the impact of its two-year money-tightening campaign. 
 While he is counting on growth to slow to a more moderate rate, Mr. Bernanke said, ''The economy has been performing well and the near-term prospects look good.'' [Page C1.] 
 Even building contractors and real estate agencies have been hiring more workers, a sign that higher interest rates are not yet really hurting the construction industry. ''Our biggest challenge is managing cost increases that are sweeping the industry, and labor shortages,'' said Alan Torvie, a senior director at Opus West Construction who oversees projects in the West and Southwest.
 Americans seem to have noticed the boom, too. Although polling suggests that they are deeply unhappy with the war in Iraq and worried about the price of gas, they report being generally pleased with the state of the economy. 
 A well-known index of consumer confidence has risen to its highest level in four years, according to the Conference Board, a research company in New York. In the most recent CBS News poll, conducted last month, 55 percent of respondents rated the economy as good, even though 66 percent of Americans said the country was on the wrong track.
 In 23 years of polling by CBS, only once -- in late 2005 -- did a higher percentage of people say the country was on the wrong track. 
 R. Michael Welborn, the chief administrative officer of P. F. Chang's China Bistro, a fast-growing restaurant chain based in Scottsdale, Ariz., said he could sense the gap between economic growth and overall unease. ''All of the indicators look pretty positive, with the exception of gas prices,'' he said. ''But there seems to be a level of discomfort.''
 Like Mr. Bernanke, many professional economists and ordinary Americans expect economic growth to slow in the rest of the year, surveys show. Higher oil prices will effectively shift some money from the United States to the Middle East and elsewhere, and higher interest rates will make it more expensive for businesses and households to borrow. But for now, the economy is on a fast track. The fact that interest rates remain low, despite the Fed's rate increases of the last two years, is a big reason. The average rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage was 6.3 percent last month, lower than at any point in the 1970's, 1980's or 1990's, according to the Fed.
 In parts of California, Florida and the Northeast -- places where home prices soared in recent years -- houses are no longer being snapped up, and many appeared to be selling for less than they would have last summer. But the housing market is still healthy in much of the country.
 In two new high-end developments built by Toll Brothers in Chicago and Phoenix, lotteries were used to allocate homes because demand exceeded supply. ''If you had an overall depressed market, you could not have that kind of phenomenon,'' said Robert I. Toll, chief executive of the company, which is the nation's biggest builder of luxury homes. 
 Spending by upper-income families appears to be driving much of the economy's growth. The average hourly wage for rank-and-file workers -- who make up roughly 80 percent of the work force -- has fallen by 5 cents in the last four years, to $16.49, after inflation is taken into account. Yet most well-paid workers have continued to receive raises. 
 Somerset Collection, an upscale mall near Detroit, will be undergoing renovations in coming months to make room for more stores, including a Barneys Co-Op, an outlet store for Barneys New York, the high-end clothing retailer, and for Stuart Weitzman, which sells designer shoes and handbags. Restaurants around the country are also benefiting as Americans spend an ever-larger portion of their food budgets on prepared meals.
 P. F. Chang's now owns 230 restaurants -- including about 100 Pei Wei Asian Diners, which are less expensive than the chain's main restaurant -- up from 208 at the start of the year. It employs 21,000 workers; Mr. Welborn said the company had recently had to raise wages to attract workers. 
 ''It's becoming increasingly challenging for us to find talent in the markets we're opening up in,'' he said.
 Healthy economic growth in other countries, including China and India, is also playing a role. Although this country buys far more from those countries than it sells to them, strong global growth is lifting American exports, economists say. 
 Last week, the International Monetary Fund predicted that the world economy would grow at 4.9 percent this year, up from 4.8 percent in 2005.
 The Boeing Corporation, for instance, plans to deliver 395 commercial planes in 2006, up 36 percent from a year ago, many of them to foreign airlines. The company has already sold all the planes it will build this year and 98 percent of the planes it will build in 2007.
 In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Bernanke emphasized that the economy still faced serious long-term issues, chiefly the budget deficit and the trade deficit. Logic suggests that both will have to shrink at some point, curtailing economic growth when they do. But there seems to be little chance that taxes will rise, that government spending will be cut or that the trade deficit will close anytime soon.
 In the short term, the bigger economic risks may be that interest rates or gas prices reach a tipping point that damages growth. 
 James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, noted that in past decades the economy often continued to flourish even as interest rates were increasing -- until long-term borrowing costs jumped above 6 percent. At that level, companies often struggle to make a large enough profit to cover their costs, so they stop expanding.
 ''There's no magic number,'' Mr. Paulsen. ''But it does seem like the relationship changes around that 5 1/2 or 6 1/2 area.''
 The rate on 10-year Treasury notes closed at 5.07 percent yesterday, up from 4.55 percent at the end of February.

IT has been 2 years, 11 months, 3 weeks and 6 days since the Morgan Library closed for its expansion by Renzo Piano. Not that I've been counting; I have a life. Still, the time has not sped by. We revere the Met, we adore the Frick, but the Morgan is extra special, in a class of its own. No place looks like it, feels like it or has what it has: namely some of the most sensationally compact art treasures anywhere in this treasure-loving town. 
 Now the counting can stop. At 10 o'clock sharp tomorrow morning the Morgan will reopen. And all concerned parties -- you, me and everyone else in New York -- can dash over to see what's new and what's not.
 What's new: a Madison Avenue entrance into Mr. Piano's splendid four-story glass and steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators. Mr. Piano has also created two good-size second-floor galleries, and a neat strong-box of an enclosure, called the Cube, for the Morgan's famed reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. 
 In addition the library's former reading room is now a gallery for drawings. And Pierpont Morgan's baronial private study, where shrewd minds and expensive cigars once gathered, has been refurbished and Lemon-Pledged. I'll skip over the auditorium, new dining room and expanded gift shop, but will note that the Morgan Library has acquired a semi-new name; we must now call it the Morgan Library and Museum. 
 Of course the Morgan has always basically been a museum. That brings me to what is not new: almost everything in the celebratory exhibition ''Masterworks From the Morgan,'' which fills every gallery. Regular visitors will spot old favorites, like the ninth-century Lindau Gospels cover, encrusted with agates that glow like nightlights; Durer's pen-and-ink Adam and Eve; Michelangelo's smudgy sketchlets of David and Goliath; and a good-as-new Gutenberg Bible. (The Morgan has three.) 
 But there are also things on view for the first time; a suave drawing by Juan Gris is one, a recent arrival. And some are fresh from a long vacation, as in the case of a set of 35 Milanese tarot cards hand-painted with allegorical figures. The work of a 15th-century master -- Bonifacio Bembo seems likely -- they haven't worked a room at the Morgan for 20 years, but they're certainly working one now.
 Is there any logic to such eclecticism? Not really, though there is a binding thread, and it's proprietary. Much of what is on view -- the Gris is an obvious exception -- was bought and owned by the library's founder, J. Pierpont Morgan (1837-1913), or his heirs.
 Morgan was born in Hartford. He went to school in Europe, came to New York City as an apprentice banker at 20, inherited family money and made more on his own. A lot more: enough to help bail out the federal government twice. In 1895, the year he established J. P. Morgan & Company, he provided Washington with $62 million in gold to reverse an economic depression. To avert a similar crisis 1907 he scared up $25 million in an afternoon.
 He was a prodigious personality in a high-rolling age. By the late 1800's New York was what London had been, the financial capital of the Western world. What it lacked was European-style culture, so its robber-baron citizens started buying some and bringing it home. 
 In short order we got the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera, and Carnegie Hall, along with Ignace Paderewski and Marcella Sembrich, as well as the occasional Raphael Madonna. It was around this time that Morgan, well into middle age, began buying art, in part from a sense of patriotic duty, in part because that was what grandees did; and in part, I suspect, to lift himself out of bouts of despondency, to which he was prone. His first wife died from tuberculosis four months after their marriage, and he never fully recovered from the loss. 
 He wasn't an especially picky shopper, at least at first. He bought a bit of everything -- Egyptian sculpture, Renaissance paintings, Gothic tapestries -- often from a distance in odd-lot bulk: art by the box, the peck, the estate, tossing what he didn't want and keeping what he did. In 1899 he picked up the tremendous Lindau book, outbidding the British Museum for it. With that his interest in medieval art, in the form of books and devotional objects, took hold. 
 Most of that art of princes and prelates was modest, even miniaturist, in scale. Over time Morgan gave his larger acquisitions away; thousands of objects went to the Met. But he kept the small-to-tiny stuff for himself. And the library that Charles Follen McKim designed in 1902 as an annex to the Morgan home was tailored to them: it's a cross between a bank vault and a wonder cabinet. 
 What does this passion for reverse monumentality, for gorgeous smallness, for the imperialism of the minuscule mean? Does it represent a psychological return to a childhood world of controlled fantasy? An exercise in connoisseurial trophyism? A tacit acknowledgment of the fragility of beauty? Freud had many thoughts on this subject; so did Shakespeare, Einstein and Emily Dickinson. So did Morgan, through the objects he held dearest, many of which the library still has. 
 In the Marble Hall, for example, at the former 36th Street entrance, you can see a sample of his prized collection of ancient Near Eastern cylinder seals. These incised stone sculptures are so tiny, you can't make visual sense of them until you make an impression, which as often as not turns out to be a panorama of muscle-bound gods and half-human beasts engaged in cosmic wars.
 Of the European paintings that line Morgan's study, the very smallest -- three Hans Memling panels -- are by far the best. And the most spectacular of his medieval pieces, the Stavelot Triptych, a reliquary of the True Cross, is only a foot and a half high. 
 What this piece lacks in height, it makes up for in metaphoric depth and breadth. A miracle of metalwork and enameling, it is actually composed of three triptychs in different sizes, two of Byzantine origin contained within a larger Gothic one. Here Eastern and Western cultures meet. And as the reliquary draws your attention inward toward the two splinters of wood nested at its center, it also releases a spiritual ripple effect, as energy radiates from the relic, to its container, to the Cube, to the library, to the city and beyond. 
 Illuminated gospel books, some the size of a computer motherboard, work on a similar principle of worlds-within-worlds amplification. The Evangelist Luke, with a wrestler's neck and prehensile toes as portrayed in the Morgan's Reims gospel book, is a man, a saint and an embodiment of sacred history. The heavenly Jerusalem depicted in the earliest surviving complete copy of the ''Commentary on the Apocalypse'' by Beatus of Liebana, is seen in God's-eye aerial view. But with flattened walls that look like carpets and a checkerboard floor, it's an ornamental view of the End of Time, distilled to pocket size. 
 Finally, a similar sense of compressed vivacity comes through in the autograph manuscripts Morgan started buying even before he collected art. In one major purchase, he acquired all 40 volumes of Henry David Thoreau's Walden journal, along with the pine box Thoreau made to hold them. The two pages open for view in a new gallery devoted to literary and historical manuscripts are filled, top to bottom and edge to edge, with stream-of-consciousness words. In them, acute, you-are-there observation is inseparable from philosophical speculation. That's also the case with Galileo's doodly sketch of the satellites of Jupiter.
 Since Morgan's death nearly a century ago, other handwritten material, less exalted though still notable, has found its way into the holdings. My favorite acquisition, which came to the library in 1969, is a cluster of poems and stories written in feverish, eye-punishing minuscule by the four teenage Bronte children: Bramwell squeezes 2,500 words on a page; Charlotte binds her stories into books an inch wide. And bringing the Morgan more or less into the present is a Bob Dylan souvenir: lyrics for ''It Ain't Me, Babe,'' scratched on a sheet of hotel stationery. It dates from 1962 and arrived at the Morgan in 1999.
 ''Museums are cemeteries,'' Mr. Dylan once said in an interview, though his presence here suggests that the Morgan is, at least, a cemetery in active use: pages will be turned during the course of the show to avoid light damage. And the Morgan will be presenting more contemporary manuscript shows, including one of Dylan material, in coming months. Actually for the Morgan, the analogy I prefer is to a reliquary, once a carved casket of solid stone, now also a vessel of translucent crystal, thanks to Mr. Piano and Beyer Blinder Belle, the architectural firm he worked with. With reliquaries, size means nothing; the energy inside means all. It's a super-radiant energy; an entire city can be soaked in it, though, naturally, the closer you are to the source, the more you get. And transmission is instantaneous: no fuss, no worry, no wait. 

''Masterworks From the Morgan'' remains on view at the reopened Morgan Library and Museum, 225 Madison Avenue at East 36th Street on the following schedule: the drawing exhibition through July 2; music manuscripts through Sept. 3; literary and historical manuscripts, and printed books and bindings through Sept. 10; ancient Near Eastern seals in the Marble Hall through Nov. 12. The medieval treasures in the Cube -- the Clare Eddy Thaw Gallery -- are on long-term view.

HEADLINE: Alexander Trowbridge, 76, Ex-Secretary of Commerce, Dies

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Alexander B. Trowbridge, a commerce secretary in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, a former president of the National Association of Manufacturers and a longtime member of the Washington establishment, died yesterday at his home in Washington. He was 76.
 The cause of death was dementia with Lewy disease, his family said.
Mr. Trowbridge's role in government and politics was not ordained. He was a young executive with a promising career in the oil industry in 1965 when he was offered the post of assistant commerce secretary in an agency that had lost much luster and seemed headed to merge with the Labor Department. 
 As assistant secretary for domestic and international business and then as acting secretary, Mr. Trowbridge traveled widely to promote commercial interests and, by many accounts, raised department morale. 
 Becoming secretary in June 1967 made him at 36 the youngest member of Johnson's cabinet and the youngest chief in the history of the Commerce Department.
 One task was to help lower the deficit in the balance of payments by programs like one controlling private dollar investments abroad.
 The department took part in domestic social programs. In one, Mr. Trowbridge was in charge of drawing up projects to create jobs for the hard-core unemployed.
 The lingering effects of a heart attack prompted him to resign in 1968, but he recovered and months later was named president of the American Management Association, the executive development and training organization. He quit over a policy disagreement and, in 1970, took over as president of the National Industrial Conference Board, the business research organization now known as the Conference Board.
 Mr. Trowbridge became vice chairman of Allied Chemical in 1976, when a scandal erupted over dumped pollutants. At issue was the handling and disposal of Kepone, an insecticide banned after it contaminated the James River in Virginia. Mr. Trowbridge helped work out a settlement. Allied agreed to compensate the affected river users and accept responsibility for the cleanup.
 By 1980, the Environmental Protection Agency cited that response as a model for industry.
 A member of many corporate boards, Mr. Trowbridge joined that of the National Association of Manufacturers in 1978 and became president in 1980. He became the spokesman and chief lobbyist for the largest and most influential industrial trade organization in the country. 
 Alexander Buel Trowbridge, known as Sandy, was born in Englewood, N.J., the son of an academic and grandson of an architect, both his namesakes. He graduated from Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts in 1947 and Princeton in 1951. He was a Marine officer and combat platoon leader in the Korean War, earning a Bronze Star.
 After starting his career with Caltex Petroleum and Esso Standard Oil in Panama and El Salvador, Mr. Trowbridge became president of Esso Standard Puerto Rico in 1965. He was sitting in his office in San Juan when he received the call from the White House. President Johnson's talent scout, the chairman of the Civil Service Commission, had pulled Mr. Trowbridge's name from a file of 20,000 potential appointees and asked whether he was interested in working in Washington. After much thought, Mr. Trowbridge said later, he agreed that he was, and the job of assistant secretary was his.
 Long active in Democratic Party affairs, he had advisory roles in successive administrations, including Republican ones. He was a Democratic member of President Richard M. Nixon's National Commission on Social Security, headed by Alan Greenspan, and was influential in its recommendation in 1983 to maintain the basic structure and reject suggestions that the program be voluntary or geared to individuals' needs.
 He was on the first Bush administration's seven-member Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission in 1991 but was criticized for his ties to contractors servicing the bases and resigned from the panel before its final report. 
 After he retired from the manufacturers' association in 1990, he set up a consulting firm in Washington, Trowbridge Partners, and operated it until about two years ago.
 Surviving are his wife of 25 years, Eleanor Hutzler Trowbridge; two sons and a daughter from his earlier marriage, Stephen, of Dallas; Corrin, of Redwood City, Calif.; and Kimberly Parent of Greenwich, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Barbara Verdaguer of Mousterlin, France; a stepson, Charles Hutzler of Beijing; a sister, Julie Cullen of Brooklin, Me.; a stepsister, Joya Cox of McLean, Va.; and nine grandchildren. His first marriage, to Nancey Horst Trowbridge, of Kiawah Island, S.C., ended in divorce.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Friday about Alexander Trowbridge, a former secretary of Commerce, referred incorrectly to the president he served in the 1980's as a member of the National Commission on Social Security. It was Ronald Reagan, not Richard M. Nixon.

HEADLINE: Atlantic City May Lose Out in a New Version of Monopoly 

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI; Lisa Fleisher contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, April 27 

 BODY:
It has been a long time since anyone could try to buy a hotel on Ventnor Avenue for $400.
 But news that the toy maker Hasbro is planning to drop Atlantic City from its flagship version of Monopoly has left people on the streets of this gambling resort startled and local officials protesting.
Since the game made its debut in 1930, it has sold 250 million copies, making famous the names of Atlantic City's byways, like Baltic Avenue, Park Place and the Boardwalk. And while the game has spawned 200 spinoffs -- including Hawaii-opoly, Star Wars Monopoly and even a SpongeBob SquarePants edition, set in the fictional town of Bikini Bottom -- Atlantic City has remained the locale for the standard edition, which is by far the most popular. 
 Now, however, Hasbro has announced plans to update the game to a ''here and now'' version, raising rents and letting the public vote on streets, neighborhoods and national monuments to fill the 22 properties on the board. And Atlantic City is not among the choices.
 The company will still produce the Atlantic City-based, ''classic'' version of the game, but the ''here and now'' version is projected to be their best sellers.
 In Atlantic City, where many residents consider their connection with Monopoly a point of civic pride, Hasbro's decision makes about as much sense as Scrabble without vowels, and has spurred officials to organize a lobbying campaign to pressure Hasbro into reconsidering.
 ''Sure, put in the Statue of Liberty and Disney World and other places,'' said Jeffrey Vassar, executive director of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, which has a ''Help Keep Atlantic City on the Board'' petition on the city's Web site, www.atlanticcitynj.com. ''But it's a slight to not have the Atlantic City Boardwalk as one of the stops,'' he added.
 It's the latest bad news for a struggling city still trying to cope with the loss of the Miss America pageant, a smoking ban in bars and restaurants, and gambling competition from Delaware and, soon, Pennsylvania. But there have been bright spots, too. During the past year, the city's 12 casinos have been buoyed by development along the waterfront and posted record revenues.
 Some residents fear, however, that the town is fading into irrelevance. Carmine Covino, a waiter at a restaurant on Pacific Avenue, said that until recently, when he heard people compare Atlantic City unfavorably to Las Vegas, he would defend his hometown by saying: ''They don't have a board game, do they? They don't have Miss America.''
 ''Well, I guess we don't have that anymore either,'' Mr. Covino, 19, said on Thursday.
 When Monopoly was devised in the 1930's, Atlantic City was chosen because it epitomized the kind of glittering tourist destination that many Depression-era Americans could only fantasize about visiting.
 Charles B. Darrow, an unemployed salesman, sketched the prototype board game on a tablecloth at his home in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, using 21 street names from Atlantic City. (The final space, Marvin Gardens, was a name taken from the neighboring community of Margate City, where it is spelled Marvyn.)
 The Parker Brothers game company rejected Mr. Darrow's proposal, so he went to a printer and began selling it himself. It caught on so quickly that Parker Brothers eventually reversed itself. It began mass-marketing Monopoly in 1935, and that year it became the world's best-selling board game. Pat Riso, a Hasbro spokeswoman, said it decided last year to poll fans to see how they might recast the game if it were to be developed today. So the ''here and now'' version will replace railroads with airlines. Utilities will be updated (Ms. Riso would not say with what, but allowed that Internet providers is a good guess.) Rents will rise, along with the cost of bail and the $200 payment for passing ''Go.''
 In one uncharacteristic bow to the past, free parking will remain free. The company says it would not be swayed by Atlantic City's campaign to be included in the updated version.
 ''We love their passion, we think that's fabulous,'' Ms. Riso said. ''But at this time, we are not planning on changing the online vote.''
 Many residents of Atlantic City -- where a plaque honoring Mr. Darrow was erected at the intersection of Park Place and the Boardwalk -- said they would continue trying to pressure the company into changing its decision. But Carole Rodriguez, who lives on Vermont Avenue, said that whether or not the campaign succeeded, she and her husband would remain loyal to the version of Monopoly that made her neighborhood known around the globe.
 ''Whenever we play, we would buy Vermont and we would laugh,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, 28, who works in the Borgata casino. ''We said we were going to kick everybody out and have the whole block to ourselves.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about Hasbro's decision to eliminate Atlantic City as the setting of its flagship version of Monopoly misstated the cost of putting a hotel on Ventnor Avenue and referred imprecisely to another property, Marvin Gardens. A hotel on Ventnor costs $750 ($150 each for four houses and another $150 for the hotel), not $400. Marvin Gardens was the final property created by Charles B. Darrow, the man who devised the game for Parker Brothers in the 1930's; the final space on the board is Boardwalk. The article also misspelled the name of the neighborhood in Margate City, N.J., that inspired Marvin Gardens. It is Marven Gardens, not Marvyn.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade, In Good Hands

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 You assert that the European Union looks ''for every excuse'' to ''avoid ending Europe's odious farm subsidies.'' 
 In 2003 the E.U. committed to its biggest ever reform of agricultural spending. About 90 percent of our payments to farmers are now non-trade distorting. We are the only World Trade Organization member to offer cast-iron commitments to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies. 
 As well as cutting subsidies, in the Doha Round, the E.U. has offered to cut its highest farm tariffs by more than 60 percent, and to halve its average farm tariff to around 12 percent. This is a small revolution.
 In contrast, United States trade-distorting farm spending is actually rising. The European Union may spend more over all, but Europe has some 12 million farmers; the United States has fewer than two million. The average American farmer receives almost twice as much trade-distorting support as his E.U. equivalent.
 Both sides of the Atlantic must face up to farm reform. To characterize the European Union as shying away from reform is simply wrong.

PERSON: Howard A. Newman

HEADLINE: Howard A. Newman, 85, Industrialist and Investor Friend of Buffett

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Howard A. Newman, who helped transform a struggling coal-mining company into a diversified conglomerate in the 1950's and 60's and later employed a similar strategy with the Western Pacific Railroad, died on April 12 at his home in Wellington, Fla., near West Palm Beach. Mr. Newman, who also had a home in Bedford, N.Y., was 85. 
 The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, a son, William, said. 
After more than 30 years at the helm of major American companies, and better known on Wall Street than on Main Street, Mr. Newman orchestrated the sale in 1986 of Western Pacific Industries, formerly the Western Pacific Railroad, and stepped down as chairman and chief executive. 
 He never retired, but spent the rest of his life picking and managing investments, searching for undervalued businesses, and devoting himself to philanthropies including the Jewish Guild for the Blind. A horseman all his life, he was a former president of the Bedford Riding Lanes Association. 
 Mr. Newman was the son of Jerome Newman, a Wall Street investor who joined forces in 1926 with Benjamin Graham to found the Graham-Newman Corporation, an investment firm. Mr. Graham, a groundbreaking proponent of finding and investing in undervalued companies known as value investing, hired and was a mentor to Warren E. Buffett, the founder and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. 
 Mr. Newman, was born on Feb. 2, 1921, in Cedarhurst, N.Y., and was widely known as Micky. He developed a lifelong friendship with Mr. Buffett when they both worked at Graham-Newman.
 Mr. Newman, who graduated from Cornell University with a degree in economics in 1942, joined the firm after serving as a Naval officer in the Pacific during World War II, starting an import-export business in New York and selling it for a small fortune. 
 Though Mr. Newman worked on a smaller scale, he and Mr. Buffett eventually took over troubled businesses and turned them into holding companies that expanded through acquisitions.
 Mr. Newman was catapulted to the top post of the coal-mining company, the Philadelphia and Reading Corporation, at the age of 34 after Graham-Newman bought a significant interest in the company. It had already moved into manufacturing clothing. Mr. Newman added boots, optical equipment and other products, and eventually sold the coal business. 
 After merging the Philadelphia and Reading with Northwest Industries in 1968, Mr. Newman was chairman for two years, then became president and chief executive of the Western Pacific Railroad. He revived the railroad, but changed the company's name to Western Pacific Industries and emphasized manufacturing things like hand tools and precision instruments. 
 Fruit of the Loom and Acme Boot were two units of Mr. Newman's Philadelphia and Reading Corporation that later went into decline. In 2001, long after he had left the corporate world, Mr. Newman helped Mr. Buffett engineer the purchase by Berkshire Hathaway of Fruit of the Loom. Mr. Buffett also bought the assets of Acme Boot. 
 Mr. Newman was married four times; the first three marriages ended in divorce. Besides his son William, of Northampton, Mass., from his first marriage to Carole Kobin Newman, he is survived by two other children from that marriage, Jeffrey and Cynthia Newman-Diaz, both of New York; his fourth wife, Maria Tesseire Newman of Bedford, N.Y., to whom he was married for 30 years; two children from that marriage, Jessica Newman, of Paris and Wellington, and Jerome Newman, of Bedford, N.Y.; a sister, Patricia Nanon, of New York; and five grandchildren.

There are certain truths about New Jersey that have always seemed to be immutable: It is the most densely populated state. It has the highest property taxes in the country. And it is one of the few places left where you cannot pump your own gasoline. 
 But if Gov. Jon S. Corzine has his way, drivers may soon be in for a cultural about-face.
Mr. Corzine proposed Thursday that the state lift its self-serve ban as part of a package of transportation proposals on carpooling, mass transit and enforcement, intended to cushion residents from rising gasoline prices. And while he cautioned that his proposal was just a pilot program that would be limited to perhaps three months, he said that self-serve gasoline could save drivers about 5 or 6 cents a gallon, if properly handled.
 ''We think it's a responsible thing to do,'' he said. ''If we can enforce the pass-through and we can mainstream that over a period of time, then it would be permanent and broadly applied throughout the state.''
 The proposal would first be tested on the New Jersey Turnpike, where 8 of the 12 rest areas will be equipped with credit-card readers at the pumps by Memorial Day, said Kris Kolluri, the state's transportation commissioner. And since many drivers are from out of state, they would be familiar with the procedure.
 The idea does require legislative approval, however, and early reaction was mixed. Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, a Democrat from Middlesex County who is chairman of the transportation committee, said in a statement, ''Telling a motorist that self-serve will save them money at the pump is like telling someone that they could save money on a new home by building it themselves.''
 But Senator Gerald Cardinale, a conservative Republican from Bergen County, praised Mr. Corzine. ''I think he's on the right track,'' he said. ''I've been at this for over 20 years, and it's the first time that a governor has seriously looked at this issue.''
 Should New Jersey lift the ban, Oregon will be the only state prohibiting self-serve stations. But Oregon has no sales tax, and Mr. Corzine in his recent budget proposed that New Jersey's sales tax go from 6 percent to 7 percent to help fill a $4 billion shortfall.
 ''The joke is when babies are born in Oregon, the doctor slaps their bottom, 'No self-serve and no sales tax,' '' said Dan Lavey, a public relations executive in Portland. ''That about sums it up. It's as much a cultural issue as an economic issue. It's a way of life.''

HEADLINE: City Marketing Officer Quits; He Oversaw the Snapple Deal 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The city's first chief marketing officer, who was hired in March 2003 to promote New York City as a globally recognized brand, will resign from the $150,000-a-year position to return to private business, city officials announced yesterday. 
 The official, Joseph M. Perello, the president of the city's Marketing Development Corporation, resigned amid continuing criticism of a deal with Snapple to sell its beverages in city-owned buildings, but Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg maintained yesterday that he was satisfied with Mr. Perello's handling of the deal. The resignation was first reported yesterday by The New York Post. 
''I'm disappointed that he's chosen to go on,'' the mayor said. ''He's done a great job. Some of his things worked and parts didn't. In some programs, they all worked, and in some cases, they didn't work at all.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who cited the example of Bloomberg L.P., the financial-information business he founded, said managers should be rewarded for innovation even when they fail. ''Risk-taking is something that we appreciate and that we want to encourage, and we will continue to do that, and I'm sorry that Joe is leaving,'' the mayor said. 
 Kimberly D. Spell, a spokeswoman for the corporation, a nonprofit group created in July 2003, said that Mr. Perello had given a three-year commitment to Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, and that Mr. Perello was leaving to make more money to support his family. 
 The Harvard Business School yesterday released a 25-page study of the Bloomberg administration's marketing efforts. The study quoted Mr. Perello as saying the Snapple deal was hampered from the start by a ''skeptical media environment'' and by a lawsuit filed by Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., who criticized it because competitive bidding was not used. 
 Under the deal, which began in April 2004, Snapple was given the exclusive right to sell teas, water and chocolate drinks through vending machines and concessions on city property, in exchange for commissions and money for advertisements and special events, like free concerts. 
 The deal was supposed to generate $126 million in cash and marketing activities for the city, but last month the city disclosed that only 50,000 beverage cases were sold in the first year of the deal, though the goal was one million. This month, a city panel approved a scaled-down deal that is projected to raise $33 million for the city, a 74 percent reduction. 
 A New Jersey native, Mr. Perello, 37, said in an interview last month, ''If you can package New York City in an appropriate way, it can become a beacon for corporate partners.'' 
 Ms. Spell said yesterday that Mr. Perello was not available to comment on his resignation. A departure date has not been set. 
 Mr. Perello has had to contend with two other entities that try to market the city: NYC Big Events, which tries to bring big concerts and award ceremonies to the city, and NYC & Company, the city's convention and tourism bureau. In January, Mr. Bloomberg suggested that the three agencies needed to ''work more closely together'' to support his goal of attracting 50 million visitors a year to the city by 2015.
 V. Kasturi Rangan, a Harvard professor and the writer of the study, said Mr. Perello's position was made more difficult by the need to recruit private partners and persuade city agencies to cede some control over their marketing sites, whether park concessions or bus-stop shelters. ''New York City is at the cutting edge for even thinking of a job of chief marketing officer,'' Dr. Rangan said. ''The concept is brilliant.''

HEADLINE: Shares Are Up on Signal Of Pause in Interest Rises 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday for a second day after Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, signaled that the central bank might soon take a break from interest rate increases.
 That prospect enabled the market to bounce back from initial losses that were tied to China's unexpected decision to lift its benchmark interest rate.
 FirstEnergy and Bank of America led gains in utilities and financial companies, which are among the most sensitive to borrowing costs, after Mr. Bernanke testified to Congress that the Fed might ''decide to take no action at one or more meetings.'' 
 ''Few people thought that he would be that explicit,'' said Frederic H. Dickson, chief market strategist at D. A. Davidson & Company in Great Falls, Mont., which manages $16 billion. ''We're getting closer to the end of the Fed interest rate hikes.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 4.31 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,309.72, just 0.2 percent from a five-year high. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 28.02 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,382.51, a six-year high.
 The Nasdaq composite index added 11.32, or 0.5 percent, to 2,344.95, helped by Intel, which rose after it said it would cut costs sharply.
 Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was the second-busiest this year, as 2.08 billion shares changed hands. About the same number of stocks rose and fell on the Big Board.
 The market opened lower after the People's Bank of China said it would increase the one-year lending rate to 5.85 percent, from 5.58 percent. The action may slow China's economy, hurting demand for commodities and construction materials.
 A gauge of utilities jumped 1.6 percent as Treasury yields declined. Lower bond yields make the dividends paid by utilities more attractive. The utilities measure has a 3.6 percent dividend yield, twice the S.& P. 500's yield of 1.8 percent.
 FirstEnergy, the owner of electric utilities in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, gained $1.45, to $50.89. Exelon climbed 75 cents, to $54.16. Duke Energy advanced 41 cents, to $28.87.
 The S.& P. 500 financials index jumped 1.4 percent to a record. Stable or lower interest rates increase the value of bonds owned by banks, brokers and insurers, and increase demand for mortgages and loans.
 American Express gained $1.80, or 3.5 percent, to $53.70 for the best performance in the Dow industrials. Bank of America rose $1.33, to $49.04. J. P. Morgan Chase added $1.29, to $43.95.
 Intel, the No. 1 maker of computer chips, gained 59 cents, to $20.08, after the chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, said the company would cut costs within 90 days as it tries to cope with slowing computer demand and a slide in market share.
 Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum producer, retreated $1.56, or 4.5 percent, to $33.40, on the China announcement, for the steepest loss in the Dow average. American depositary receipts of BHP Billiton, the world's largest miner, slumped $1.56, to $44.36. China is the biggest consumer of copper and steel.
 Prices of United States Treasury securities rose after Mr. Bernanke's comments on interest rates. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to9521/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.07 percent, from 5.10 percent on Wednesday. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.610
High Yield: 4.964
Low Yield: 4.895
Median Yield: 4.930
Total applied for: $29,664,619
Accepted: $17,500,019
Noncompetitive: $159,069
Interest set at: 4 7/8
The five-year notes mature April 30, 2011.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Don't Get This Economy Down 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
GRIM news about energy prices collided with great news about the economy this week, but it was no contest. Optimism triumphed; oil prices stalled and then retreated slightly. Stocks rallied.
 Worried that stubbornly high gasoline prices might erode consumers' optimism and buying power, President Bush suspended some air pollution rules and stopped adding to the country's strategic oil reserves. Congress, meanwhile, proposed sending each taxpayer $100, to arrive just about when midterm elections are under way.

FULL STEAM AHEAD -- A widely anticipated barometer of consumer confidence rose sharply, to its highest level in almost four years. The Conference Board said its index rose to 109.6 in April from 107.5 in March; analysts had forecast a slight decline.
At the same time, consumer spending rose, home sales increased and orders for durable goods -- those that last three years or more -- shot up 6.1 percent from the same month last year, more than three times the rate Wall Street economists had forecast. 
 There were some worrying signs. While home sales rose, the median price of new homes fell more than 6 percent. A slump in the property market and continued high oil prices could turn consumer sentiment around, economists said. For that reason, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, told a Congressional committee that the Fed might take a break from raising interest rates to control inflation.
 The government is scheduled to release further signs of the economy's health next week, with personal income on Monday, and employment and payrolls on Friday.

CRUDE OIL SEESAW -- After peaking above $75 a barrel -- a nominal record, though still well below the record of the early 1980's when adjusted for inflation -- crude oil prices fell for four consecutive days as people appeared to cut back on driving.
 Still, economists and politicians said it was only a matter of time before energy prices began to drag on the economy. In large cities, for example, gasoline cost more than $3 a gallon, and there were reasons to worry that prices could stay high. Gasoline demand continued to rise, although at a slower pace than expected. And inventories of both gasoline and crude oil fell 5.6 percent last week.
 High prices are inflating oil company profits, leading federal officials to reconsider $2 billion in tax breaks that Congress approved in August. And prominent Democrats pushed for repealing oil and gas tax breaks worth more than $10 billion over the next five years.
 The Federal Trade Commission is completing an investigation into whether businesses used Hurricane Katrina to manipulate gasoline supply and prices last fall. It is scheduled to deliver its report to Congress by May 19.

PAPER TRANSACTION -- The McClatchy Company, which bought the 32-newspaper Knight Ridder chain last month, turned around and sold 4 of the papers to the MediaNews Group for $1 billion. McClatchy will use the cash to pay down the $4.5 billion cost of acquiring Knight Ridder.
 MediaNews bought two of the newspapers, The San Jose Mercury News and The Contra Costa Times, directly. It acquired the other two, The Pioneer Press in St. Paul and The Herald in Monterey County in California, in cooperation with the Hearst Corporation. In exchange, Hearst will acquire an interest in the 40 papers that MediaNews owns outside of the Bay Area.
 McClatchy is still negotiating to sell eight other former Knight Ridder papers, analysts say. The Inquirer and The Daily News in Philadelphia are likely to be sold next.

EXECUTIVE PLEAS --Two former executives of Computer Associates, the software company now known as CA Inc., pleaded guilty to eight counts each of securities fraud and obstruction of justice in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The pleas came just weeks before the men -- Sanjay Kumar, the former chief executive, and Stephen Richards, its former top salesman -- were to go on trial.
 Mr. Kumar and Mr. Richards admitted to a wide-ranging conspiracy to inflate the company's sales in 1999 and 2000 and to interfere with a federal inquiry into the fraud by lying to their lawyers and to federal investigators. Mr. Kumar even authorized paying $3.7 million to buy the silence of a potential witness, according to the indictment.
 Judge I. Leo Glasser is scheduled to sentence the men on Sept. 12. Obstruction of justice carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, while each fraud charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years.

A PIONEER RESIGNS -- After helping to start Sun Microsystems and then running it for 22 years, Scott G. McNealy stepped down as chief executive of the company, a Silicon Valley fixture that has recently fallen on hard times.
 Mr. McNealy chose Jonathan Schwartz, 40, the company's president and a former software entrepreneur as his successor. Mr. Schwartz joined Sun in 1996. Mr. McNealy's record of recognizing talent is well known. Among the leaders who worked under him are Edward J. Zander, now the chief executive at Motorola; Carol Bartz, chairwoman of Autodesk, the engineering software firm; and Eric E. Schmidt, chief executive of Google.
 In an effort to reverse sliding sales of its workstations and servers, Sun is using microprocessors made by Advanced Micro Devices in addition to its custom Sparc processors. It is also selling hardware that can run either Linux or Windows software easily.

COURTROOM DRAMA -- Enron's founder and former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, lost his cool on the witness stand in his criminal fraud trial in Houston. Under cross-examination by a prosecutor, John C. Hueston, Mr. Lay accused a cabal of former Enron executives, investors and journalists of precipitating the company's collapse in late 2001.
 Mr. Lay acknowledged that he had violated Enron's code of ethics by investing in Photofete, a company run by a woman who was then the girlfriend of his co-defendant, Jeffrey K. Skilling. He also acknowledged that he had tried to meet with some of the witnesses against him, an effort Mr. Hueston characterized as attempted witness tampering.
 The cross-examination of Mr. Lay will continue on Monday.

HEADLINE: Europe's Trade Gap With China: Behind U.S. but Catching Up

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, as the United States discovered that its trade deficit with China was growing rapidly, there was more than a little smugness in Europe. Its deficit with China was very small, a sign that its residents were not like the profligate Americans who insisted on spending money they did not have on Chinese imports.
 But this week the trade numbers for the euro zone -- the 12 countries that use the euro as currency -- came out. The February deficit with China was 6.9 billion euros, bringing the total over the last 12 months to a record 78 billion euros ($97 billion). 
To be sure, that is well below the $204 billion trade deficit the United States chalked up with China over the same period, and as a percentage of gross domestic product is about half as large.
 But as the accompanying charts show, the euro zone's trade deficit with China, measured as a percentage of G.D.P., is growing at almost exactly the same rate the American deficit was growing five years ago. The difference may have been in timing, not in magnitude.
 ''The Wal-Martization of the U.S. consumer market is an old story,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of the brokerage firm ITG/Hoenig. ''But that extraordinary inflow of consumer products made in China is building irresistible momentum in Europe.''
 What may be happening is that manufacturers of consumer goods in some European countries, most notably Italy, were protected by the sometimes byzantine details of European rules. But the single currency, and the opening to Eastern Europe, is breaking down barriers. Mr. Barbera says he thinks problems for those companies ''will get worse as competition from China heightens.''
 There are some important differences. While the euro zone's overall trade balance has fallen recently -- and it ran deficits in four of the last five months -- it still shows a small trade surplus over the last 12 months. And the euro zone's trade surplus with the United States comes fairly close to offsetting its deficit with China.
 In addition, as the other charts show, Europe has done a better job than America of exporting to China. In 2005, the euro zone's exports to China exceeded 43 million euros (or more than $50 billion). The United States, with a larger economy, had exports of $42 billion to China.
 Many of the European exports have been in the form of machinery needed by Chinese factories to produce the shoes and clothing that Europe once made. Eventually, China will slow its purchase of such machinery, but the products of those factories will keep pouring out.
 It is no wonder that one thing the Group of 7, the conference of industrialized countries, was able to agree on a week ago was the need for China to allow its currency to rise against both the dollar and the euro. So far, China has shown no willingness to depart from its policy of very slow appreciation of the yuan.

 The charts show trade balances with China as a percentage of gross domestic product for the United States and the 12 countries that use the euro as a currency, but begin at different times.
 For the United States, the line begins with the first quarter of 1990. For Europe, it begins five years later. The other two charts show exports to China and imports from China on the same basis.

 BODY:

11 P.M. (Fox) MAD TV -- ''Medium,'' NBC's drama about a psychic with prophetic dreams and a slightly chaotic home life, is given the sketch-comedy treatment. Crista Flanagan (right) plays the title character (played on the real show by Patricia Arquette) and Michael McDonald is her sometimes annoyingly low-key husband. 


7 P.M. (HGTV) DREAM HOME -- Viewers can take a tour of the fully furnished 5,000-square-foot house with Blue Ridge Mountain views, a covered porch, a terrace and separate guest quarters. Then, in a 40-minute live special at 8, one of three finalists will turn the front-door key and win the place, which is in North Carolina. The winner also receives a matching dream doghouse, a new GMC Yukon and $250,000 in cash.

9 P.M. (Starz) BEWITCHED -- (2005). The casting is inspired: Nicole Kidman (above left) as Samantha the reluctant witch; Will Ferrell as her slightly goofy mortal husband, Darren; and Shirley MacLaine as her disapproving mother, Endora. The premise is clever: Hollywood is doing a remake of the television series, but they've accidentally hired a real witch. And this movie still doesn't work.

10 P.M. (Sundance) TREES LOUNGE -- (1996). Sometimes a well-meaning adult isn't just going through a rough patch. Steve Buscemi wrote, directed and stars in this painfully sad film about an unemployed car mechanic whose life really is going downhill fast, with no reversal in sight.

10 P.M. (IFC) THE HENRY ROLLINS SHOW -- Mr. Rollins puts Bill Maher (right), of HBO's ''Real Time With Bill Maher,'' in the talk-show guest's seat. The musical guest is Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Los Angeles-based band that has been compared to, among others, the Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, early Oasis and Lou Reed.

4:30 A.M. (TCM) DANCING LADY -- (1933). And here we have Joan Crawford and Clark Gable in a musical. She's Janie Barlow, an aspiring dancer reduced to burlesque houses. He's Patch Gallagher, a charming, financially struggling Broadway producer. Franchot Tone is a rich guy who wants Janie and manages to get her a part in Patch's latest show. Guess which guy Janie likes best. Fred Astaire turns up in a very small role and does a big number, ''Let's Go Bavarian.'' ANITA GATES

HEADLINE: Renovating With Profit in Mind? It Just Might Not Pay 

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
When Mike McDonald and Jill Martenson bought their little Craftsman house on Locksley Street in Oakland, Calif., in 1999 for $325,000, the couple knew it needed a lot of work.
 ''It was the worst house on the block,'' Mr. McDonald said.
He and his wife pulled off the vinyl siding, threw away the plastic shutters and stripped layers of paint off the interior Douglas fir woodwork. Then they rebuilt the front porch, reshingled the house, rewired it, added copper plumbing, a bedroom and two bathrooms. Their kitchen remodeling included trendy concrete countertops and cherry cabinets.
 Mr. McDonald said he was not quite sure of the exact cost of the six-year project but that it was probably around $300,000. 
 This month they sold the house for $1.15 million, $155,000 over the asking price. ''Whether it is the hot real estate market or my brilliance, I don't know,'' he said. 
 The funny thing is, no one else really does either. In the last 12 months, American homeowners spent about $155 billion on remodeling, an increase of more than 4 percent over the previous 12-month period, despite rising interest rates, said Kermit Baker, senior research fellow at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. 
 Yet Mr. Baker and other experts say there is little research into the returns that American homeowners get on that investment.
 The most widely quoted figures come from a construction trade magazine, Remodeling, with a circulation of 80,480. Every year, it publishes the Cost vs. Value Report, an estimate of the cost of various projects in 58 cities balanced against estimates of how much those projects increased the value of a house. 
 Last November's report, which also appeared in the December issue of Realtor magazine, said a minor kitchen remodeling would cost $14,913 and return 98.5 percent of that investment when the house was sold. Adding a midrange master bedroom suite, with a walk-in closet and dressing area as well as a bathroom, would cost $73,370, with only 82.4 percent of that being recouped. A modest bathroom redo, costing $10,499, could earn back 102.2 percent of the investment, Remodeling said. 
 The magazine acknowledged that the projections of return on investment were reliable only on the broadest regional or national level. The estimates for its return-on-investment data come from a survey of about 1,600 real estate agents and appraisers. That is a reliable sample size, but it is often too small to provide reliable estimates on a city level, said Grant Farnsworth, president of Specpan, the Indianapolis company that manages the survey. 
 Mr. Baker said researchers at the Harvard center ''threw up their hands'' after trying to determine the return on investment of remodeling projects. ''How a bathroom renovation affects value depends on a lot of things that are hard to quantify,'' he said. ''To do it well, you need neighborhood level estimates, but that would be very difficult.'' 
 Consider, for instance, the question of adding a bathroom. The Remodeling magazine report estimates that it would cost $22,977, with a 86.4 percent return, at best. But agents may say that a house with one bathroom in a neighborhood where two bathrooms is the norm is at a disadvantage when the house goes on the market. Mr. Baker said that the homeowner might then see a good return on the investment by making the house competitive. But, he said, someone adding a third bathroom to a house in that neighborhood might get little return. 
 You could call that keeping up with the Joneses, but it is an essential rule of remodeling, architects and remodeling contractors said. ''I encourage people to think about what the mainstream is doing,'' said Mark G. Richardson, president of Case Design/Remodeling, one of the largest firms in the country. ''Your tastes may be a liability.'' 
 What the Remodeling magazine data shows is just how few projects yield a positive rate of return. Of the 22 projects it analyzed, only two -- an upper-range siding replacement and the modest bathroom remodeling -- would make money. That suggests that remodeling projects ought to be regarded not as a creator of value, but as a consumer product, like a car or purse, that appeals to taste and style. Consumers usually don't think about a financial return when they make those purchases. 
 ''Do the renovations you want and don't worry too much about resale,'' advised Mr. McDonald, who now does remodeling for others. ''Someone will appreciate your fantastic kitchen, and you get to enjoy it in the meantime.''
 How quirky a redesign should be depends on how long the homeowner plans to live in the house. Speculators, or those who intend to stay in a house a short time, will tend to do remodeling jobs that maximize their returns -- installing granite countertops and stainless steel appliances, for example. 
 People who intend to live in a house for decades can feel safer designing a more personalized project because they will derive nonmonetary value from it. 
 Those who want to satisfy their eccentricities might consider hiring a designer. The trend among remodeling contractors for the last decade has been to join forces with an architect or designer. The homeowner may have to pay at least 10 percent of the cost of the project upfront on planning, but design and building firms lay out a convincing case for why it pays off. 
 Selecting as many of the finishes, appliances and fixtures early with the designer may cut down on costly change orders. Designers, working with the contractor, can often see possibilities that homeowners cannot, like a wall that may be removed. Expanding a kitchen out into other rooms can be cheaper and take less time than adding onto the house because there are fewer permits and objections from neighbors. 
 Working with a designer, the contractor has less room to argue that a sloping floor or the need for additional lighting was not foreseen.
 Another advantage of spending on design upfront is that the renovation can be planned for construction in phases. That way, a contractor can do the hard work and leave the rest for the determined do-it-yourselfer or the time when more money becomes available.
 Getting the money is not as easy as it was even a year ago. As interest rates fell and home prices appreciated, homeowners could borrow money against the increased value of their homes or just take out cash in a refinancing. But the rates on home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, usually tied to the prime rate, have gone up faster than mortgage rates. Bankrate reports that the rate on a home equity line of credit is about 7.5 percent, while a 30-year fixed mortgage is bumping up against 6.1 percent. 
 Refinancing is probably not an option, because a new mortgage would most likely come with a higher interest rate. And many remodeling companies dislike projects with construction loans because it injects one more meddler, the bank, into the process. So they may charge more for the annoyance. 
 That does not leave a lot of good alternatives other than fixed-rate home equity loans. But lenders are hungry for this business and it is possible to find a good deal. 
 Low interest rates, and the opportunities they gave Americans to refinance homes and extract cash, fueled the remodeling boom. Mr. Richardson of Case, based in Bethesda, Md., said the rising rates might not lower the demand enough to reduce the costs of a renovation. ''People who would have moved into a new home stick with their old house and invest in it,'' he said.
 But once homeowners decide to renovate, delaying the project will only cost more money, he warned. Costs have been going up 7 percent to 10 percent a year in many regions of the country. ''I don't see that changing,'' Mr. Richardson said.

HEADLINE: Economy Sets Fastest Pace Since the Summer of 2003 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Propelled by a burst of consumer spending and vigorous business investment, the gross domestic product surged at a 4.8 percent rate in the first quarter of the year, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, the fastest pace of growth since the summer of 2003.
 But the roaring American economy may be turning quieter. Even as the government report portrayed an economic engine firing on all cylinders, most economists argue that growth is poised to settle into a more moderate pace, slowed by high energy prices, rising interest rates and a softer housing market. 
''This is the last big G.D.P. number we are going to get in this economic cycle,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. ''We are headed toward a slowing path.''
 Businesses and consumers started 2006 with remarkable vigor. Consumer spending expanded at an annualized rate of 5.5 percent compared with the last quarter of 2005. Business investment jumped 14.3 percent, the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2000. Even the government contributed to growth, powered by a 10 percent increase in military spending.
 While residential construction slowed slightly, investment in commercial structures like factories, hospitals and office buildings jumped to 8.6 percent from 3.1 percent. ''Everywhere people seem to be upbeat and extremely busy,'' said Kenneth D. Simonson, chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of America.
 But amid the echoing din of cash registers at stores across the nation, economic growth seems to be moderating. Some economists argue that it could slow markedly.
 The burst of growth in the first three months of the year was in part a snapback from the last quarter of 2005, when the phasing out of incentives by automakers, compounded by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and a spike in oil prices, sharply slowed economic growth, to 1.7 percent.
 ''You are seeing a nice rebound from the hurricane-distorted fourth quarter, with strength broadly based across the economy,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers.
 Averaged out over the last two quarters, the economy grew somewhat less than the 3.5 percent rate clocked in 2005 and substantially less than the 4.2 percent pace of expansion in 2004.
 And despite their spending spree in the first three months of 2006, American consumers are showing some signs of fatigue, as the University of Michigan reported yesterday that its index of consumer expectations declined in April. Wage gains, according to the government report, actually slowed during the first quarter rather than improving with the rising economy. 
 ''A majority of households now expect an economic downturn and bad financial times by the end of this year,'' said Richard Curtin, the director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers.
 For typical Americans, who have begun to reap the benefits of the economic expansion through more jobs and modestly rising wages, the big question is how much the economy will slow. The answer will depend, in part, on how much of a hit rising interest rates and energy prices take out of consumers' spending power. 
 But perhaps more important, it will hinge on what happens in the housing market.
 A weaker housing market is expected to weigh on the economy in two ways. To begin with, construction will probably slow from its recent fast pace. Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said that by the third quarter of the year, home building would stop contributing to economic growth and become a slight drag on the economy. 
 Some of this decline will be compensated by strong business investment. For instance, Gulf Atlantic Constructors, a road-building contractor based in Pensacola, Fla., is preparing for a slowdown in its business with residential developers by bidding on more commercial projects like shopping centers.
 ''We are trying to even out the balance a little bit,'' said Pamela H. Caddell, the company's president. 
 But a softer housing market will also slow growth by making it harder for consumers to borrow against the rising values of their properties. Home equity loans and mortgage refinancing, which have fueled spending on furniture, electronics and other household goods, have already started declining and could fall faster if interest rates jump or home prices fall.
 ''By the end of the year, home sales will be down 30 to 40 percent,'' Mr. Sheperdson of High Frequency Economics predicted. ''That's a meltdown in my book.''
 Still, with inflation remaining modest, fatter payrolls and additional jobs are expected to support consumer spending. That's why many economists contend that any slowing of the economy is likely to be gradual and mild. They note that gasoline prices, while rising, make up less than 5 percent of household budgets today.
 And falling housing prices, which are likely to be concentrated in areas that boomed over the last few years, would directly affect only part of the population. ''It takes time for people to adjust to their housing wealth,'' said Mr. Harris at Lehman, ''and last year you had the biggest gain in housing wealth in history.''
 The report on economic activity also offered other reassuring signs. The closely watched core price index for personal consumer expenditures, excluding food and energy, increased just 1.9 percent over the previous year, a more modest rate of inflation than the previous quarter.
 But if the economy does not downshift soon, some -- in contrast to those predicting a sharp deceleration -- fear that the economy could even overheat.
 ''We haven't yet seen compelling proof of a slowdown,'' said Robert DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup. ''We are not out of the woods yet.''

HEADLINE: Hyundai Chairman Accused of Embezzling 

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI and CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, April 28 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Hyundai Motor Company, the world's seventh-largest automaker and a pillar of South Korea's economy, was arrested Friday on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. 
 Prosecutors said the chairman, Chung Mong Koo, 68, who led the company's global expansion and raised its image by emphasizing quality, had set up a $105 million slush fund to bribe government officials and politicians. He is also facing a charge of breach of trust, accused of causing more than $315 million in damage to the company through his misconduct.
Prosecutors portrayed the arrest as a testament to the commitment of regulators to crack down on corruption in the country's family-controlled business groups. 
 In a late-night broadcast live on national television, Mr. Chung, flanked by prosecutors, emerged from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office to be taken to a jail near Seoul.
 Facing a crowd of television crews and photographers, he bowed slightly but did not say a word. He was arrested immediately after the Seoul Central District Court granted the arrest warrant Friday evening.
 ''The accused keeps denying the charges and, therefore, there is the possibility of the accused trying to go into hiding or destroying evidence,'' a senior district court judge, Lee Jong Seok, told reporters.
 The arrest capped a monthlong investigation into Hyundai and companies affiliated with the family-controlled conglomerate, South Korea's second-largest after Samsung. It focused renewed attention on the power of the country's conglomerates, known as chaebol, and their ties with government officials and politicians.
 In Hyundai's case, prosecutors have said that senior executives used the slush fund to bribe government officials and politicians. They also contend that Mr. Chung acted illegally to transfer assets to his son, Chung Eui Sun, 35, president of Kia Motors, which is part of Hyundai.
 The battle to arrest Mr. Chung was closely monitored by industry analysts and ordinary South Koreans as a power struggle between state regulators and the conglomerate.
 During the hearing, Mr. Chung's lawyers said his arrest would hurt the South Korean auto industry by depriving Hyundai of a charismatic leader credited with building the company and its affiliate, Kia Motors, into a global competitor.
 But prosecutors said his incarceration would send a strong warning against corruption.
 As the investigation unfolded in the last month, the Chungs apologized to the public and announced that they would donate $1.1 billion in personal assets to charity.
 The move came after a similar one by Samsung. Last year, audiotapes emerged revealing Samsung executives giving illegal donations during the 1997 presidential election. The conglomerate's chairman, Lee Kun Hee, left South Korea for the United States for several months until he was cleared of wrongdoing. Immediately after Mr. Lee returned here and asked South Koreans for forgiveness, Samsung announced in February that it would donate $840 million to charity.
 Like the Hyundai chairman, Lee Kun Hee was also under investigation for illegally trying to transfer the conglomerate's control to his son, Lee Jae Yong.

HEADLINE: 4th Airport Idea Is Back, but Cab Could Be Costly

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Worried about a looming traffic jam in the skies over New York City, aviation officials have begun studying ways that other airports -- some more than 60 miles from Midtown Manhattan -- could help relieve the congestion.
 Executives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three airports -- La Guardia, Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International -- say they fear that the increasingly crowded airspace could crimp the region's economy, driving some business travelers and tourists to other cities. They are mulling a range of incremental improvements that would allow them to squeeze more planes and passengers through the airports they have.
 But the Port Authority's chairman, Anthony R. Coscia, said he believed a bolder, more controversial solution would be necessary. The time has come, Mr. Coscia said, to start creating another major airport to serve the metropolitan area.
 ''I think we have to start now planning the development of a potential fourth airport,'' Mr. Coscia said in a recent interview. ''We don't want to solve our aviation problem by slowing down our economy.'' 
 A proposal for a fourth airport is not an original idea, just one that few public officials have dared broach for about 30 years. But in spite of the concept's checkered past and the Port Authority's history of overestimating growth in air traffic, the need for a fourth airport is inescapable this time, Mr. Coscia said. 
 The three airports are already so plagued by delays that they rank at the bottom of the list of big American airports for on-time performance. And, with passenger counts rising steadily, officials predict that the three big airports will reach the limit of their capacity in just 15 years.
 This year, after resuming growth that was interrupted only by Sept. 11, they are on pace to handle more than 100 million passengers for the first time. Even with a modest rate of increase and a long list of improvements planned, they will reach their full capacity of 130 million annual passengers within 15 years, said William DeCota, the Port Authority's director of aviation. 
 ''The trajectory always is up; there's no doubt about that,'' Mr. DeCota said. ''By the year 2020, we will have reached and slightly exceeded our ability to serve 130 million passengers.''
 In round numbers, he said, that would leave each of the airports at what is believed to be its maximum annual load: 50 million passengers at Kennedy, 30 million at La Guardia and 50 million at Newark. 
 The Port Authority expects cargo to pour in faster, compounding the problem. Mr. DeCota forecast that the amount of freight moving through the three airports could increase to four million tons annually by 2020, from less than three million last year.
 To avert gridlock on the runways, Mr. Coscia said, ''We're thinking into the future and working on developing viable options.''
 One point of consensus among aviation officials and analysts is that no major airport will be built from scratch within a two-hour drive of Midtown Manhattan. The only feasible solutions involve expanding existing airports on the periphery of the metropolitan area, they said.
 ''You can't build a 'green-field airport' because there is no green field,'' said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, a consulting firm in Evergreen, Colo. ''There is no place within 100 miles of New York City where you can buy land for less than a bazillion dollars.''
 Mr. Coscia said a study of six other airports in the region that was commissioned by the Federal Aviation Administration could help identify one that could be expanded into a major airport. The study is analyzing the potential of Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, N.Y.; Long Island Islip MacArthur Airport; Westchester County Airport; Trenton Mercer Airport; Atlantic City International Airport; and Lehigh Valley International Airport in Allentown, Pa.
 None of them represent anything like an ideal solution. Some are more than 60 miles from Manhattan, and none can be reached easily by mass transit. But they are all that aviation officials have to work with -- though each one lies outside the Port Authority's territory, which extends 25 miles out from the Statue of Liberty.
 ''Adding new runways in an urbanized area is almost impossible, especially runways that are capable of taking commercial aircraft,'' said Roger Moog, manager of aviation planning for the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission.
 The commission, based in Philadelphia, is working with the F.A.A., the Port Authority and the New York State Transportation Department on the study, which will gauge how much traffic each of the other airports could absorb and what political, physical and financial constraints would stand in the way, Mr. Moog said.
 The political hurdles may be the most formidable for Mr. Coscia in his quest for a fourth airport. The phrase itself comes loaded with a lot of battered baggage, especially for the Port Authority.
 In 1959, Mr. Coscia's predecessor Austin J. Tobin made a similarly bold declaration. Predicting that New York's three airports would reach their breaking points in about 15 years, he announced that the agency would spend $220 million to build what he called the ''fourth jetport'' on 10,000 acres near Morristown, N.J., about 25 miles west of Manhattan.
 But the affluent owners of farms and estates in Morris County used their influence to put a noisy stop to his plan. The land Mr. Tobin had set his sights on became the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, which for 45 years has stood as a reminder to politicians of the powerful ''not in my backyard'' sentiments that the roar of jet engines can stir.
 ''Rather than finding a fourth airport, we're finding a bunch of half-airports,'' said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior fellow with the Regional Plan Association. ''If what you're trying to do is capture 25 percent of the market, no one of those is going to do that.''
 He, like other analysts, says there are a variety of ways of diverting some of the overflowing traffic without designating a fourth hub. Some outlying airports, for instance, might attract growing low-fare carriers, which might lure leisure travelers away from the bigger airports, those analysts said. The secondary airports might also capture some of the cargo bound for their areas. 
 Four decades ago, the region still held plenty of possibilities for a fourth airport. In 1961, the Port Authority investigated 17 sites, including the New Jersey Meadowlands and Pine Island, an onion-farming hamlet in Orange County, N.Y. That study concluded that Morris County was still the ideal location.
 After the battle over the Great Swamp, the notion of a fourth airport lay dormant for about a decade before it was revived in the early 1970's by New York's governor, Nelson A. Rockefeller, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 In 1970, the transportation authority took over the Stewart Air Force Base, about 20 miles north of West Point, and proposed spending $1 billion to turn it into a super jetport.
 Consultants hired by the authority forecast that the region's airports would have to accommodate more than 160 million passengers a year by 1990 (and 250 million by 2000) and that Stewart could handle almost one-fourth of them.
 The Regional Plan Association warned that those predictions could be wildly optimistic and that, with sharply rising oil prices dampening demand for travel, a fourth airport might never be needed.
 ''All that growth never happened in the 1970's,'' Mr. Zupan said. ''There was a flattening out. New York took anosedive economically. The economy and aircraft travel are very closely related.''
 Mr. Coscia and Mr. DeCota are acutely aware of that relationship. That is why they recently paid a visit to Charles Seliga, the managing director of Stewart International, which is operated under a 99-year lease by a British company, National Express Group.
 Mr. Seliga, who once managed Kennedy Airport, showed off the master plan for expanding Stewart, which includes building a passenger terminal and lengthening the shorter of two runways to 8,000 feet from 6,000 feet. The airport's other runway, at almost 12,000 feet, can handle the largest commercial aircraft in use, he said.
 Stewart is bigger than MacArthur, Westchester and even Newark. It sits on 2,200 acres near the junction of two interstate highways, the New York State Thruway and I-84.
 Although it is 65 miles from Manhattan, Mr. Seliga said that distance should make Stewart more attractive as a reliever for the big three. Mr. Coscia would also like to see some of the private aircraft traffic diverted from the Port Authority's Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to Stewart.
 ''The beauty of us is that our airspace is completely different,'' Mr. Seliga said. ''We're not near the water, so my weather is completely different.''
 Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, endorsed the idea of a fourth airport as ''a wise strategy for the 21st century'' and said he favored Stewart because of its size and location. Stewart ''is especially well suited for air cargo,'' Mr. Moss said, because ''it has better highway linkages than any existing airport to the Midwest and New England.''
 Mr. Coscia said the Port Authority might invest in improvements at Stewart to attract airlines, even though doing so would probably require legislative changes in Albany and Trenton to the authority's charter.
 ''Most people don't want an airport in their backyard,'' Mr. Coscia said. But he added, ''By and large, everybody's been supportive about Stewart.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, recently endorsed the proposal for a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River between Manhattan and New Jersey in part because it could eventually provide train service between the city and Stewart. The tracks of the Metro-North Railroad in Rockland County already pass within several miles of the airport.
 But not every official of the Port Authority supports Mr. Coscia's big idea. Charles Gargano, the vice chairman, said he would prefer to concentrate on technological improvements and scheduling changes that could help squeeze more traffic through the existing airports.
 ''I feel very strongly that what we have to look at is how to use our airspace more efficiently,'' Mr. Gargano said. The solution, he said, ''may not be a fourth airport, but rather new technology.''
 Mr. Zupan, an ardent advocate of mass transportation who lives just 30 miles from Stewart, said he doubted Stewart could attract enough travelers to justify building a rail link to it. For the near future, he said, there will be the big three airports and everything else. ''The sooner we stop using the phrase 'the fourth airport' the better,'' Mr. Zupan said, ''because what you're going to have is bits and pieces.''

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about a proposal for a fourth airport to serve the New York City area misidentified the location of a Metro-North Railroad line that comes within several miles of Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, N.Y., which is being considered for expansion. It is Orange County, not Rockland.

HEADLINE: Forests in Southeast Asia Fall to Prosperity's Ax

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: LONG ALONGO, Indonesia 

 BODY:
For as long as anyone can remember, Anyie Apoui and his people have lived among the majestic trees and churning rivers in an untouched corner of Borneo, catching fish and wild game, cultivating rice and making do without roads. But all that is about to change. 
 The Indonesian government has signed a deal with China that will level much of the remaining tropical forests in an area so vital it is sometimes called the lungs of Southeast Asia.
For China, the deal is a double bounty: the wood from the forest will provide flooring and furniture for its ever-expanding middle class, and in its place will grow vast plantations for palm oil, an increasingly popular ingredient in detergents, soaps and lipstick.
 The forest-to-palm-oil deal, one of an array of projects that China said it would develop in Indonesia as part of a $7 billion investment spree last year, illustrates the increasingly symbiotic relationship between China's need for a wide variety of raw materials, and its Asian neighbors' readiness to provide them, often at enormous environmental cost. 
 For Mr. Anyie and his clan, the deal will bring jobs and the opportunity for a modern life. ''We love our forest, but I want to build the road for my people -- I owe it to them,'' said Mr. Anyie, 63, an astute elder of the Dayak people. ''We've had enough of this kind of living.''
 From Indonesia to Malaysia to Myanmar, many of the once plentiful forests of Southeast Asia are already gone, stripped legally or illegally, including in the low-lying lands here in Kalimantan, on the Indonesian side of Borneo. Only about half of Borneo's original forests remain. 
 Those forests that do remain, like the magnificent stands here in Mr. Anyie's part of the highlands, are ever pressed, ever prized and ever more valuable, particularly as China's economy continues its surge. 
 Over all, Indonesia says it expects China to invest $30 billion in the next decade, a big infusion of capital that contrasts with the declining investment by American companies here and in the region. 
 Much of that Chinese investment is aimed at the extractive industries and infrastructure like refineries, railroads and toll roads to help speed the flow of Indonesia's plentiful coal, oil, gas, timber and palm oil to China's ports. 
 In one of the latest deals, on April 19, Indonesia announced that China had placed a $1 billion rush order for a million cubic yards of a prized reddish-brown hardwood, called merbau, to be used in construction of its sports facilities for the 2008 Olympic Games. 
 Merbau wood, mostly prevalent in Papua's virgin forests, has been illegally logged and shipped to China since the late 1990's, stripping large swathes of forest in the Indonesian province on the western side of the island of New Guinea. 
 The decision to award a $1 billion concession to China will ''increase the deforestation of Papua,'' a place of extraordinary biodiversity, said Elfian Effendy, executive director of Greenomics, an Indonesian environmental watchdog. ''It's not sustainable.'' 
 The plan for palm oil plantations on Borneo was signed during a visit by the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, to Beijing last July. 
 Under pressure from environmental groups, the Indonesian environment and forestry ministries have come out against the plan. The coordinating minister for economic affairs, who goes by the single name Boediono, said in April that he was still weighing the pros and cons of executing the entire plan. 
 The commander of the Indonesian military, Gen. Djoko Suyanto, whose forces are heavily involved in Indonesia's illegal forestry businesses, strongly backed the plan during a visit to the border region in March. 
 Certainly, there are profits to be made. Major consumer companies like Procter & Gamble say they are using more palm oil in their products instead of crude oil; palm oil is favored for cooking by the swelling Chinese middle class, and it is being explored as an alternative fuel. 
 Indonesia's environmentalists, and some economists, say chopping down as much as 4.4 million acres of the last straight-stemmed, slow-growing towering dipterocarp trees on Borneo would gravely threaten this region's rare ecosystem for plants, animals and people. 
 Maps for the project have aroused fears that it would encroach into the forest in Kayan Mentarang National Park, where the intoxicating mix of high altitude and equatorial humidity breeds an exceptional diversity of species, second only to Papua's, biologists say. 
 The area is the source of 14 of the 20 major rivers on Borneo, and the destruction of the forests would threaten water supplies to coastal towns, said Stuart Chapman, a director at the World Wildlife Fund in Indonesia. 
 For years, Mr. Anyie, the Dayak elder, said he had resisted offers from commercial contractors to cut down the forest around his village, next to the park. 
 He worked hard, too, to keep the old ways of life, which until 40 years ago included forays into headhunting, he said, showing visitors the skull of a Malaysian soldier stowed in his attic, a souvenir from the 1965 border war with Malaysia. 
 But now it is time for change, he said. ''People have told me, 'Wood is gold, you're still too honest,' '' said Mr. Anyie, a diminutive man with brush-cut black hair. 
 His own grown children have deserted the village for big towns, and the villagers left behind are tired of traveling everywhere by foot (three days to neighboring Malaysia where jobs in palm oil plantations are plentiful) or by traditional long boats powered by anemic 10-horsepower engines. 
 For those seeking to visit, the journey is just as arduous. The area can be reached only by light plane, a pummeling voyage over rapids in a wooden canoe and then a trek through tangles of trees and creepers. 
 A three-day stay at a research station deep inside the forest told what is at stake for the ecosystem, first documented by Charles Darwin's colleague, Alfred Russel Wallace, in an account in the late 1850's called ''The Malay Archipelago.'' 
 Wild mango trees, tropical oaks, pale-trunked myrtles, sago palms, rattan trees and pandanas with shiny leaves like long prongs crowded the hills that rise almost vertically above the river.
 Exceedingly tall and elegant dipterocarps towered over all, their green canopies filtering shards of occasional sunlight. Underfoot, tiny dew-encrusted green mosses, still damp in the afternoon, clung to rocks, and miniature versions of African violets poked their mauve flowers just above the ground. 
 Wildlife abounds, said Stephan Wulffraat, 39, a Dutch conservation biologist and the director of the research station run by the World Wildlife Fund. The forest is home to seven species of leaf monkeys, he said, and at high noon, a crashing sound high in the trees announced a group's arrival. A red-coated deer made a fleeting appearance and dashed off. 
 On the gloomy forest floor, Mr. Wulffraat, who fends off leeches by tucking his pant legs into knee-length football socks, has set more than a dozen camera traps to photograph wild creatures too shy to appear. 
 Three years ago, an animal the size of a large cat with a bushy tail with a reddish fur sauntered by the camera. Mr. Wulffraat, a seven-year veteran of the forest, said that the animal resembled a civet, but he added that he and other experts believed that it was an entirely new species. 
 The discovery of a species of mammal like a civet is unusual, but dozens of new species of trees, mosses and herbs, butterflies, frogs, fresh water prawns and snakes have all been found since the station opened in 1991, he said. ''This field station has more frogs and snake species around than in all of Europe,'' Mr. Wulffraat said. 
 Until now, the forests at these higher elevations have been protected by their sheer inaccessibility. To get back to the coast from the research station, for instance, takes a 15-hour journey along a 350-mile stretch of the Bahau and Kayan Rivers in a wooden longboat powered by three outboard motors.
 In contrast, the forests in lowland Kalimantan, where roads have been hacked into the land already, are so ravaged by logging that they will have disappeared by 2010, the World Bank says. 
 As the roads start penetrating the area of Mr. Anyie's clan, the upland forests will begin to disappear here, too. The solution is to adopt sustainable management plans, Mr. Wulffraat said. 
 Such plans allow logging only in specially certified areas, he said. But so far, he said, they have proved a losing proposition. 
 ''In about 30 years,'' Mr. Anyie said, ''the forest will be gone.''

HEADLINE: Trading Frenzy Adds to Jump In Price of Oil 

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
A global economic boom, sharply higher demand, extraordinarily tight supplies and domestic instability in many of the world's top oil-producing countries -- in that environment higher oil prices were inevitable. 
 But crude oil is not merely a physical commodity that fuels the world economy; powers planes, trains and automobiles; heats cities; and provides fuel for electricity. It has also become a valuable financial asset, bought and sold in electronic exchanges by traders around the world. And they, too, have helped push prices higher.
In the latest round of furious buying, hedge funds and other investors have helped propel crude oil prices from around $50 a barrel at the end of 2005 to a record of $75.17 on the New York Mercantile Exchange last week. Back in January 2002, oil was at $18 a barrel.
 With gasoline in the United States now costing more than $3 a gallon, high energy prices may be a political liability for the Bush administration. But for outside investors -- hedge funds, investment banks, mutual funds and pension funds and the like -- the resurgence in the oil market has been a golden opportunity. 
 ''Gold prices don't go up just because jewelers need more gold, they go up because gold is an investment,'' said Roger Diwan, a partner with PFC Energy, a Washington-based consultant. ''The same has happened to oil.''
 Changes in the way oil is traded have contributed their part as well. On Nymex, oil contracts held mostly by hedge funds -- essentially private investment vehicles for the wealthy and institutions, run by traders who share the risks and rewards with their partners -- rose above one billion barrels this month, twice the amount held five years ago.
 Beyond that, trading has also increased outside official exchanges, including swaps or over-the-counter trades conducted directly between, say, a bank and an airline. And that comes on top of the normal trading long conducted by oil companies, commercial oil brokers or funds held by investment banks. 
 ''Five years ago, our futures exchange was a small group of physical oil players,'' said Jeffrey Sprecher, the chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based electronic exchange where about half of all oil futures are traded. ''Now there are all sorts of new investors in trading commodity futures, much of which is backed by pension fund money.''
 Such trading is a 24-hour business. And more sophisticated electronic technology allows more money to pour into oil, quicker than ever before, from anywhere in the world. 
 In the Canary Wharf business district of London, for example, the trading room of Barclays Capital is filled with mostly young men in identical button-down blue shirts, staring intently at banks of computer screens where the prices of petroleum products -- crude oil, gasoline, fuel oil, napthene and more -- flicker by. 
 Occasionally a trader breaks from his trance to bark instructions to a floor broker a couple of miles away, delivering the message through a black speaker box. Above them is a television screen, where President Bush this week was telling America to ''get off oil.''
 Experienced oil traders are in heavy demand, and average salary and bonus packages are close to $1 million a year, with top traders earning as much as $10 million.
 The rush of new investors into commodities has meant a rash of new clients for banks like Barclays. 
 Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse have recently beefed up their oil trading teams to compete with market leaders like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
 ''Clearly the big attraction of commodity markets like oil is that they've been going up,'' said Marc Stern, the chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, a New York wealth manager with $45 billion in assets. ''Rising prices create interest.''
 This year alone, oil prices have gained 18 percent; they were up 45 percent in 2005 and 28 percent in 2004, a performance far superior to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, whose gains in these years have been in the single digits. And to some extent, the rising price of oil feeds on itself, by encouraging many investors to bet that it is likely to continue doing so.
 ''The hedge funds have come roaring into the commodities market, and they are willing to take risks,'' said Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, an investment firm in New York.
 Energy funds make up 5 percent of the global hedge fund business, with about $60 billion in assets, according to Peter C. Fusaro, principal at the Energy Hedge Fund Center, an online research community. 
 The gains on the oil market have attracted a fresh class of investors: pension funds and mutual funds seeking to diversify their holdings. Their investments have been mostly channeled through a handful of commodity indexes, which have ballooned to $85 billion in a few years, according to Goldman Sachs. Goldman's own index holds more than $55 billion, triple what it was in 2002. 
 Pension funds have been particularly active in the last year, said Frederic Lasserre, the head of commodity research at Societe Generale in Paris. These investors, seeking to diversify their portfolio, have added to the buying pressure on limited commodity markets.
 While all this new money has contributed to higher prices, by some estimates perhaps as much as 10 percent to 20 percent, the frantic trading ensures that even the biggest players -- including the major oil companies -- cannot significantly distort the market or tilt it artificially in their favor. It also makes oil markets more liquid, meaning a buyer can always find a seller.
 ''The oil market has been driven by speculators, by hedge funds, by pension funds and by commodity indexes, but the fact of the matter is that it's mostly been driven by the fundamentals,'' said Craig Pennington, the director of the global energy group at Schroders in London. ''Prices are supported by the fact that there is no spare capacity.''
 The inability to increase output fast enough to keep up with global demand accounts for most of the oil price rise over the last three years, analysts say. And until more investments are completed in oil production and refining, markets will remain on edge, with the slightest bit of bad news likely to push prices up further.
 ''The reality is that the world has no supply cushion left,'' said Edward L. Morse, an executive adviser at the Hess Energy Trading Company, a New York oil trading firm. 
 Political strife and circumstance played major parts as well. A crippling strike in Venezuela's oil industry in 2002, the invasion of Iraq, civil unrest in Nigeria, and last summer's hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, among other things, have all contributed to pinching supplies.
 ''If we didn't have politics,'' said William Wallace, a trader on the Nymex for Man Financial, ''we'd be like corn.'' 
 According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy consulting firm owned by IHS, Iraq is 900,000 barrels a day below its prewar output; Nigeria has shut 530,000 barrels a day; Venezuela is still 400,000 barrels below its prestrike production; and the Gulf of Mexico remains down by 330,000 barrels a day. In all, this amounts to more than two million barrels of disrupted oil, Cambridge Energy estimates.
 The latest reason for gains on energy markets is the growing fear that the diplomatic standoff between the Western powers and Iran over nuclear technology will get out of hand.
 ''All the risk,'' said Eric Bolling, an independent trader on Nymex, ''has been on the upside.''
 One characteristic of today's futures market is the sharp increase in volatility, which industry insiders largely attribute to hedge funds and other speculators looking for a quick profit.
 ''It is the case,'' complained BP's chief executive, Lord Browne, ''that the price of oil has gone up while nothing has changed physically.''
 In the end, supply and demand call the tune. 
 ''The idea that speculators can systematically push the price up or down is wrong,'' said Robert J. Weiner, a professor of international business at George Washington University and a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan think tank. ''But they can make it more volatile. They can't raise water levels but they can create waves.''
 Not all bets have turned out to be profitable. Veteran commodity market traders have been stymied by the high prices of oil, which have exceeded their expectations, and many now predict a steep decline in prices is ahead. But they have been wrong so far. 
 ''We found the last 18 months difficult,'' said Russell Newton, director of Global Advisors, a New York and London hedge fund with $400 million in assets under management that had a down year in 2005. 
 In one often cited example, the Citadel Investment Group, a Chicago-based hedge fund, lost tens of millions of dollars after betting oil prices would fall just before Hurricane Katrina struck.
 ''Everybody is jumping into commodities, and there is a log of cash chasing oil,'' said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a consultant and a former senior adviser on energy policy at the Treasury Department. 
 ''The question is when does the thing stop. Eventually they will get burned.''

HEADLINE: New Terror Accusations Keep a Georgia Man in Custody

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM; Brenda Goodman contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A 19-year-old Georgia man charged with lying to F.B.I. agents was held without bail yesterday after a prosecutor told a Brooklyn judge that he traveled to Washington last year to make ''casing videos'' of the Capitol, the World Bank and a fuel storage depot.
 Speaking at a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, the prosecutor said the man, Ehsanul Islam Sadequee, was to send the recordings to ''overseas brothers,'' but he did not elaborate. Mr. Sadequee, the prosecutor said, had also helped arrange for military training at a terrorist camp in Pakistan for another man, who was charged last month in a related case in Georgia with providing material support to terrorists. 
Mr. Sadequee, an American of Bangladeshi descent, is charged with lying to F.B.I. agents who questioned him about a trip that prosecutors say he and the other man made to Canada in March 2005 to meet with ''like-minded Islamic extremists.'' Five months later, Mr. Sadequee flew to Bangladesh and had been living there since then. Bangladeshi authorities took him into custody on April 17, and he was later turned over to F.B.I. agents, who flew him to the United States on April 21.
 A law enforcement official, who was granted anonymity because the investigation is continuing, said the case was linked to the arrests of three men in November in Britain, where the police seized images Mr. Sadequee had made on his trip to Washington along with computer images containing instructions for making car bombs and suicide bombing vests.
 Mr. Sadequee's family has maintained his innocence, and his mother, two sisters and brother traveled from Georgia for the hearing. Family members had said Mr. Sadequee went to Bangladesh to marry and had been planning to stay until he could secure immigration papers for his wife.
 Yesterday, family members declined to discuss the case.
 The authorities have indicated that the charges against Mr. Sadequee and the other man, Syed Haris Ahmed, 21, a Georgia Tech student and naturalized citizen who was born in Pakistan, grew out of a broader terrorism investigation. Court papers in Mr. Sadequee's case say Mr. Ahmed acknowledged the pair met regularly on their Canada trip with ''at least three subjects of an F.B.I. international terrorism investigation.'' Much of the information supporting the accusations against Mr. Sadequee came from Mr. Ahmed.
 The prosecutor, Colleen Kavanagh, an assistant United States attorney, said yesterday that Georgia prosecutors were considering more serious charges against Mr. Sadequee, who was born in Fairfax, Va., and went to high school in Canada.
 Mr. Sadequee's lawyer, Douglas M. Morris, suggested to Judge Sandra L. Townes of Federal District Court in Brooklyn that his client might have been kidnapped in Bangladesh. But Mr. Morris provided no details, and it was unclear whether he was referring to Bangladeshi authorities or the F.B.I. After the hearing, he would not discuss the case.
 Mr. Morris argued that his client should be released on bond because of his close ties to his family in Georgia. But the judge, noting that he also had strong family ties in Bangladesh, said the flight risk was too great. 
 Mr. Sadequee, clad in blue prison trousers, a baggy white T-shirt and blue slip-on sneakers, appeared somewhat shaken at the hearing, as Ms. Kavanagh and Mr. Morris presented their arguments.
 Judge Townes heard the case after the government appealed a decision by a federal magistrate, Steven M. Gold, who held a bail hearing earlier in the day and ordered Mr. Sadequee released on a $250,000 bond. But during that proceeding, Ms. Kavanagh did not mention the accusations of videotaping and training.
 In fact, at the hearing before Judge Townes, Ms. Kavanagh said she had sought the authority ''to reveal to the court some additional information.''
 She went on to say that one month after Mr. Sadequee and Mr. Ahmed traveled to Canada to meet with the Islamic extremists, they made the video recordings.
 ''They went to Washington, D.C., for the purpose of making a series of videos -- we call them casing videos,'' Ms. Kavanagh said, adding that they included footage of the Capitol, the World Bank building, a Masonic temple and a ''fuel tank farm.''
 She said that Mr. Sadequee, Mr. Ahmed and a third man also ''would go into the mountains of Georgia to conduct military training exercises.'' Though Ms. Kavanagh did not elaborate on the training, she said that the third man, whom she described as an associate of Mr. Sadequee's, had corroborated an account of the exercises provided by Mr. Ahmed.

HEADLINE: Third World Bloc Thwarts U.N. Reform Plan

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 28 

 BODY:
The group representing nations from the developing world succeeded Friday in stalling and possibly scuttling Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan for overhauling the management of the United Nations.
 A vote in the powerful budgeting committee of the General Assembly on Mr. Annan's proposal exposed the deep divisions between wealthy and poor nations over the issue and provoked predictions from a number of ambassadors of damaging consequences for the entire organization.
 It also effectively halted progress on management reform proposals that were a centerpiece of Mr. Annan's program for his final year in office and served as a response to the criticism the United Nations faced after the scandal surrounding the Iraqi oil-for-food program. 
 By a vote of 108 to 50, with three abstentions, the budgeting committee approved a resolution offered by South Africa in the name of the developing nations' association, the Group of 77, which has grown to 132 members, and China. The resolution in effect rejected or delayed major parts of Mr. Annan's plan, which had been submitted to the committee for review in March with an April 18 deadline of reporting to the full General Assembly. 
 Ambassadors also protested the fact that the leader of the Group of 77's effort, Dumisani Kumalo of South Africa, had provoked the vote in a committee that traditionally settles its arguments by consensus.
 ''I fear there will be no winners in this vote, and if there are losers, it is reform of the organization,'' said Kenzo Oshima, the Japanese ambassador. ''It is likely to be interpreted as rejection or at best deferral of these necessary reforms.'' 
 Gerhard Pfanzelter, the Austrian ambassador and a spokesman for the European Union, who failed in a last-minute move to broker a compromise, said: ''We are worried that it will polarize the membership of the United Nations on this important question of management reform. This is not in the interest of the European Union and cannot be in the interest of any member state.''
 The vote on Friday produces a delay in considering Mr. Annan's plan that is likely to provoke a potentially larger conflict in June when the United Nations must establish its budget. 
 Under an arrangement put forward by the United States, member nations agreed under pressure in December to tie the budgeting for the second half of this year to achievement of changes in management.
 Theoretically, the rich nations could withhold the $950 million needed to pay salaries after June 30, though John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, has insisted that he did not intend to prevent the organization from functioning. 
 In the background of the debate was the threat that some rich countries might cite the failure to rein in the bureaucracy of the United Nations as reason to begin reducing their dues, which represent the bulk of financing for the organization. The two largest contributors are the United States, which provides 22 percent of the budget, and Japan, which accounts for 19.5 percent.
 Mr. Bolton made no mention of that possibility on Friday, saying only, ''Absent top-to-bottom management reform, the United Nations will continue to be ill-equipped to meet the current demands that we as member states place upon the organization.''
 Since he arrived at the United Nations in August, however, Mr. Bolton has frequently referred to widespread misgivings about the organization in the United States Congress. A bill that would withhold dues if specific reform proposals were not carried out passed the House last year.
 On Thursday, after the second of three contentious committee meetings, Mr. Bolton said the vote would have ramifications in Washington.
 ''If the American public and Congress can see what actually goes on up here as opposed to the confusion and fog that often accompanies debates at the United Nations, then they'll be in a position to draw their conclusions,'' he said. ''That's what happens in a democratic system, you lay all this out for the sun to shine in and then people can react.''
 In the committee debate Mr. Kumalo complained that Mr. Annan's proposals took authority from the 191-member General Assembly, where poorer nations feel they are represented, and transferred it to the 15-member Security Council and the office of the secretary general where, in his group's view, rich countries hold sway.
 In particular, he said, the developing nations objected to what they saw as a move to give large contributors more power than smaller ones.
 ''We believe in the Group of 77 and China in the right of every member state to have an equal say in the decision making of this organization,'' Mr. Kumalo said. ''This right for us is not dependent on the financial contributions of member states to the budget of this organization.''
 In an action that could make them unwitting allies of critics who contend the United Nations is incapable of being reformed, the developing nations pushed for passage of the measure under the committee's traditional procedure of approval by consensus, even in the knowledge that 45 nations had signed a document saying they were opposed to it.
 At issue in Mr. Annan's plan was how much control the secretary general would have over reallocating jobs and money without approval from the budgeting committee.
 The plan called for more financial oversight, modernized hiring, firing and recruiting procedures, career planning, a onetime staff buyout, modernized communications and technology and flexibility in assigning staff and resources.

HEADLINE: Fiddling While Fuel Burns

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Congress and President Bush are promising to solve the crisis of $3-a-gallon gasoline. But before we get to their eight-point plan and other scams, a brief digression: How about trying something that works? 
 If your goal is to get Americans to burn less gasoline, then we've already hit on the best strategy. As long as the price of gas is high, people will drive less and buy cars with better gas mileage, just as they did during past price spikes. But there's no guarantee the price of gas won't soon plummet -- unless it's propped up by a tax. 
A gas tax is a far better way to encourage conservation and combat global warming than the method mentioned by Bush this week: mandating more fuel-efficient cars. A tax would work much more quickly than the mandate, since it would affect all cars now on the road, not just new ones. The tax would also cost Americans about 20 percent less to achieve the same fuel savings as the mandate would, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
 The fuel-economy mandate is more expedient politically because the costs are hidden in the prices of new cars instead of being visible at the pump. But automobile executives know how expensive it is to comply with those rules. They don't like advocating a gas tax on the record, but privately some of them consider it the lesser of two evils.
 ''There are a lot of people within the industry who would embrace a gas tax,'' the lobbyist for a major car company told me. ''If you offered them the tax as an alternative to new fuel-economy rules, they'd jump on it.''
 The problem would be selling the tax to voters, but it could be phased in discreetly -- say, a new dime of tax whenever the gas price declines 20 cents -- with the promise that all the money would be given back. The new revenue could be evenly divvied up each year, either by mailing a check to every car owner or (my pet proposal) by putting it into a new private account for every worker now paying into Social Security.
 A 50-cent gas tax would probably raise enough revenue to give each worker over $400 per year, much more impressive than the $100 checks that Republicans are now proposing to appease angry motorists this year. Instead of being a one-shot gimmick, these gifts would be an annual ritual -- a chance for everyone, voters and their representatives, to congratulate themselves for another year of sensible conservation. 
 But I know it's naive to think anyone in Washington really cares about sensible conservation. Both parties have been too busy this week blaming each other, demonizing oil companies and repeating the mistakes of the 1970's energy crisis.
 Republicans promise the kind of investigations into ''price gouging'' that proved fruitless in the past. Democrats want to revive a version of the ''windfall profits'' tax of the 1980's, which reduced domestic oil production and increased imports of foreign oil -- without even generating much revenue. 
 With Big Oil the new enemy, both parties want to take away some of its tax breaks, an idea that's not bad. But both parties are still determined to help out their favorite industries. And just as the 1970's energy planners lavished money on fuels of the future that turned out to be duds, Congress still seems to have a knack for backing losers.
 Right now, for instance, the best alternative to gasoline is probably the cheap ethanol produced in Brazil and other foreign countries. But instead of giving drivers a chance to switch to this fuel, Congress is imposing a stiff tariff on it to protect the Midwestern farmers who produce higher-priced ethanol. 
 The best way to promote alternative fuels is to give them all a chance by imposing a tax on gasoline. That would give investors the incentive to find cheaper alternatives, and the market would sort out the winner -- natural gas, ethanol, methanol, soy diesel, whatever works. 
 Now that President Bush doesn't have to worry about winning the Iowa caucuses, he could afford to give drivers a break by subjecting corn farmers to competition from Brazil. He could reduce fuel consumption and global warming with a gas tax -- and maybe in the bargain leave a legacy of Social Security private accounts. But if he sticks with the 1970's tactics, he'll be remembered about as fondly as Jimmy Carter.

HEADLINE: Bush Enters Anthem Fight On Language

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
President Bush has never been shy about speaking Spanish in public, and he is known to love all kinds of music: country, folk and even Tex-Mex style rock. But one thing you will not find on his iPod: ''Nuestro Himno,'' the new Spanish version of the national anthem that was released on Friday as part of the growing immigrants' rights movement.
 Asked at a news briefing in the Rose Garden on Friday whether he believed the anthem would have the same value in Spanish as it did in English, Mr. Bush said flatly, ''No, I don't.'' 
''And I think people who want to be a citizen of this country ought to learn English,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And they ought to learn to sing the national anthem in English.''
 Mr. Bush has tried to occupy a middle ground in the raging debate over immigration, supporting legislation that would grant immigrant workers temporary legal status and perhaps a path to citizenship, while pushing for immigrants to learn English also pressing for more steps to stop the flow of newcomers over the border. But his statement about the anthem was taken by members of both parties as a clear signal to conservatives that he stood with them on what many of them see as a clash between national identity and multiculturalism.
 His remarks touched directly on the divide over the impact of immigrants on the nation's culture, crystallized this time by the release of the Spanish version of the anthem, loosely translated and featuring Spanish-language stars like Gloria Trevi and Carlos Ponce.
 Adam Kidron, chief executive of the label that released the new version of the anthem, Urban Box Office Records, said in a statement that the song helped those who did not speak English ''to fully understand the character of 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' the American flag and the ideals of freedom that they represent.''
 The song, which includes some departures from the original lyrics, was distributed to Spanish-language radio stations, many of which have been encouraging huge numbers of protesters to take to the streets in recent weeks. Another large action is scheduled for many cities on Monday, when some immigrant rights groups are calling for a nationwide economic boycott.
 The anthem has fed into a backlash on talk radio, the Internet, cable television and Capitol Hill, with conservatives complaining that it was encouraging the very cultural balkanization that they have feared all along.
 Mr. Bush's comments were striking for a president who has embraced Spanish in his political life. Mr. Bush grew up in Midland, Tex., alongside Spanish-speaking children. As a politician who became governor and ran for president aiming to build a broader Republican coalition, he seized every chance to win over the fast-growing Hispanic population.
 ''He recognized that Texas was rapidly becoming a state that would have more Hispanics and more African-Americans than it would Anglos,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who plans to introduce a resolution on Monday ''to remind the country'' why the national anthem should be always sung in English. 
 Mr. Bush took aim at Hispanics as an important voting bloc during the last two president campaigns. Mr. Bush has starred in his own Spanish-language advertising, and he was the first president to give his weekly radio address in Spanish. (The Spanish wire service Agencia EFE once said he spoke the language poorly, ''but with great confidence.'')
 Mr. Bush ventured into a little Spanish on Friday, using the Spanish pronunciation for the smugglers known as ''coyotes'' while outlining the need for stricter border enforcement.
 Democrats and Republicans alike said Mr. Bush seemed to be making clear to conservatives -- for the grassroots and for those in Congress opposing guest worker and citizenship provisions in the immigration legislation -- that there were limits to his support for the pro-immigration agenda. Should the Senate pass immigration legislation this year that creates a guest worker program and a path to citizenship for some workers in the United States illegally -- provisions that most conservatives oppose -- Mr. Bush would play a main role in working on a deal with the House, which has passed a bill that addresses just border security.
 ''The president is working hard to try to pass the bill, and he's thrown a bone to the right here,'' said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democrat Network, a centrist group that focuses on Hispanic issues.
 White House officials said Mr. Bush was not being politically calculating and has always believed that new immigrants should embrace the national language and culture.
 Mr. Bush made his comments in a wide-ranging session with reporters in which he also said he opposed calls for a windfall-profits tax on oil companies.

 BODY:

HEADLINE: Erika Meitner and Steven Trost 

BYLINE: By JEN McCAFFERY

 BODY:
SHE was on a short list to become an online diarist writing about dating in Charlottesville, Va., in a ''Sex and the City'' sort of column. But Erika Meitner was short of fresh material. Her life was, she said, closer to ''Celibacy in the Country.'' 
 Still, she had her eye on someone. Ms. Meitner, a published poet lauded by one reviewer for ''cataloguing pockets of turbulence, gospels of lust,'' met Steven Carl Trost, then a Ph.D. candidate in economics, in January 2000 at a basement disco party at the University of Virginia, where she was working on a master's in creative writing. 
She showed up, she said, in an ''East Village drag queen miniskirt, totally inappropriate.'' As Mr. Trost, the party's D.J., played ''Shadrach'' by the Beastie Boys, she eyed his hipster sideburns and athletic build and thought he looked funkier than the average graduate student in economics.
 They talked music, and she developed a small crush. But she wasn't sure she'd see him again. Then she ran into him at a coffee shop, where she gave him her phone number, inspired, she said, to be brasher than normal by the prospect of the column. 
 But Mr. Trost didn't call. Now 32 and an economist at the International Trade Commission in Washington, he remembered being overwhelmed by the grueling doctoral program and said he really wasn't looking for a girlfriend at that time.
 She wasn't giving up on him, however. She figured out his coffee shop schedule. They dated. Sort of. Their outings typically came to a close with what she called an ''end of the night door dance,'' during which both shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot.
 Ms. Meitner landed the dating column that spring and fed it, she said, by ''scraping the bottom of the Charlottesville dating barrel.'' She also wrote about Mr. Trost, who was unaware of the column. 
 ''I'm so frustrated,'' read one of Ms. Meitner's postings. ''I've just gotten home from another anti-date with my wonderful friend, Math Ph.D. Boy. What's an anti-date? Well, that would be a social interaction that has all the qualities of a date -- two people alone, possibly chemically altered, watching a movie/eating/taking in an event/doing something fun -- but no physical interaction occurs at all. In fact, there is nothing that signifies that this is a date in any way, other than some possibly imagined or possibly real sticky sexual tension.''
 Ms. Meitner is now 31 and a doctoral student in religious studies at Virginia. Her volume of poetry is called ''Inventory at the All-Night Drugstore'' (Anhinga Press). She grew up in Queens and on Long Island and is known by friends as a fearless rabble-rouser with tattoos, who tried to dismantle the fraternity system at Dartmouth as an undergrad there. But she has also worked as a financial consultant and considered becoming a rabbi.
 Mr. Trost grew up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, has trekked through Nepal and played saxophone and bass in bands. Friends describe him as kind, calm and consistent. 
 But he needed a nudge toward Ms. Meitner. At a Halloween party in 2000, Nathan Roberts, a friend of Mr. Trost, cornered him about ''the obvious mutual attraction'' between them.
 ''Feeling quite fly in my baby-blue bell-bottomed leisure suit, I decided to make a move,'' Mr. Trost recalled. 
 And so their anti-dates ended. Suddenly he was attending poetry readings and dinner parties, ''even on school nights,'' said Loren Smith, a friend of his. And Ms. Meitner found herself standing in line with economists to see X-Men movies.
 They twice endured a year of long-distance romance, first when Ms. Meitner moved to Wisconsin and then to California to teach poetry. 
 They married on April 22 at the Veritas Vineyard and Winery in Afton, Va., west of Charlottesville, Ms. Meitner in an ivory strapless gown. The ceremony, held before about 140 guests in an unfinished reception hall because of rain, blended new and old Jewish elements. A klezmer band called the Vulgar Bulgars played as guests danced the hora. Even Ms. Meitner's 93-year-old grandmother, Frances Zimmerman, a Holocaust survivor, ventured onto the dance floor.
 Meeting Mr. Trost didn't change Ms. Meitner's poetry, said her mentor, Rita Dove, the United States poet laureate from 1993 to 1995.
 ''She just bloomed a little more,'' Ms. Dove said.

HEADLINE: Suburbs Want Downtowns of Their Own

BYLINE: By KEVIN MALER

DATELINE: BURNSVILLE, Minn. 

 BODY:
PAT AND JEFF JERDE raised their two sons in a 6,000-square-foot home in this booming suburb about 20 miles south of downtown Minneapolis. After the boys moved out, the Jerdes were ready for the big move downtown.
 Downtown Burnsville, that is.
The latest thing in suburban development is something very old: city living. For a variety of reasons, a handful of suburban areas around Minneapolis-St. Paul have begun ambitious plans to create town centers, with pedestrian friendly sidewalks, condos, restaurants and shops. If it looks like a city, well, it is supposed to.
 ''We've always been intrigued by the urban environment, but I didn't want to raise my children in that,'' said Pat Jerde, a painter who has run a private art school with her husband for 15 years. ''I wanted them to have a yard.''
 Yet a loft in the artists' enclaves of St. Paul or Minneapolis was not a real option, in part because their art school in Burnsville would lose students if they moved it downtown. 
 The mixed-use project in Burnsville called Heart of the City gave the Jerdes the chance to have an urban home in the suburbs, and in late 2004 they became the first to buy a unit in the development. Their new 2,500-square-foot, three-level unit cost $342,000.
 For city officials, Heart of the City is a response to concerns of its citizens that Burnsville lacked a community gathering place. The land had been slated for a downtown since the early 1970's, but the development of a regional mall, Burnsville Center, in 1977 shifted the retail center of gravity away, said Jenni Faulkner, the city's community development director. 
 The city has currently approved some 628 units, and about 196 have been completed. Another 191 are under construction. (Some of the units in the project are rentals, including some that are subsidized.) 
 The growing residential population makes the retail space -- a big part of the project -- more viable. 
 There is space in Heart of the City for an upscale restaurant, although it remains vacant. A proposed 1,000-seat arts and theater center, if approved by the City Council, might be the catalyst that brings a top restaurant, Ms. Faulkner said.
 Other so-called outer-ring suburbs -- about a half dozen around the Twin Cities -- have undertaken development projects.
 In nearby Apple Valley, for example, a swath of some 70 acres is slated for high-density housing, restaurants and a hotel, according to Tom Lawell, Apple Valley's city administrator. The city has planned for some 1,300 rental and condominium units in its Central Village; about 105 town homes have already been completed and are selling well, he said.
 Downtown developments are not confined to the suburbs that took off in the 1960's and 70's, however. Like Burnsville, St. Louis Park first began the long process of creating its downtown by holding community meetings in the mid-1990's. But St. Louis Park, a first-ring suburb that shares a border with the city of Minneapolis, faced different issues.
 ''At the time, Excelsior Boulevard was an aging corridor that didn't look very good,'' said Jeff Jacobs, an attorney who is also the mayor of St. Louis Park. ''It was a boulevard on the cusp. It wasn't blighted, but it was tired.'' The project, called Excelsior & Grand, has sparked both spin-off development and a remodeling boom.
 While the risk that the project could falter was real, the risk of not doing anything was also great, according to Tom Harmening, the city manager for St. Louis Park. 
 ''First-ring suburbs really have to fight to stay relevant and to stay vital,'' Mr. Harmening said. ''There has to be constant attention to renewal to compete in a rigorous market. Cities like St. Louis Park have to do things to give people a reason to live and do business in our community.''
 One factor that is common to all the projects is demographics: empty-nesters who are tired of maintaining their suburban homes and do not need all that space anymore.
 Phil Finkelstein and Barbara Bank raised three children in St. Louis Park in a large house next to wetlands and a yard that generated dozens of bags of leaves each fall. Their children were leaving the house (their youngest daughter, a high school senior, still lives with them), and they decided to move too. 
 ''My wife and I would rather spend time with people and not dealing with weeds,'' Mr. Finkelstein said. He works as an attorney for the Minnesota Nurses Association, and his wife is a doctor.
 They bought a corner unit in the Excelsior & Grand project in the new St. Louis Park downtown. The unit has 1,600 square feet, with three bathrooms and two bedrooms. ''Our suburb was in search of a soul, and they wanted a downtown,'' said Mr. Finkelstein, who is also a City Council member. 
 He admits that he gets some ribbing from his children. ''My son teases me and calls it instant urbanism,'' he said. 
 Nonetheless, he and his wife say they find themselves walking more, to restaurants, coffee shops and movies. ''It's hard to be stressed when you're walking.''
 Both city officials and developers emphasize that community backing is essential to a successful redevelopment. Both St. Louis Park and Burnsville spent years listening to residents about what they wanted and what they did not want before ground ever broke. 
 ''When I say we had a hundred meetings, I mean we had more than 100 meetings,'' said Mr. Jacobs, the St. Louis Park mayor. That kind of participation makes the use of sometimes unpopular powers, like the threat or use of eminent domain, more palatable. 
 Both cities also had a bit of good luck: They were well positioned when the condominium market began to boom.
 Indeed, the St. Louis Park project was reconfigured to greatly increase the number of owner-occupied units as trends shifted, said Bob Cunningham, principal of the TOLD Development Company, the lead developer.
 Developers have also learned a thing or two about the urban-suburban condo market: Buyers generally want units that are all on one level. In one phase, for example, TOLD was marketing four units that had two levels, despite the advice against it by a national marketing firm. 
 ''None were reserved; none were purchased,'' said Mr. Cunningham. The developer split them into eight units, each on one level.
 It is also important for developers to price the units so that homeowners nearby -- particularly empty-nesters -- can buy them with the equity they have built up in their houses, said Wallace Johnson, president of the Stonebridge Companies in Apple Valley, which is developing units in Burnsville. 
 Indeed, Stonebridge came into the project after a previous developer pulled out -- the firm had ambitious plans for a very upscale project. ''You have to price where people are selling,'' he said. ''I don't think Burnsville is ready for $700,000 condo units.'' 
 Although the Twin Cities condo market is showing clear signs of a glut, other suburban cities will probably follow the path set by cities like Burnsville and St. Louis Park, developers say.
 ''We are the poster child of this new urbanism,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''We're proving it's doable. You'll see more and more communities'' doing it.

HEADLINE: Grand Buildings, but Also a Sense of Community

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
IF each neighborhood were a nation, Lincoln Square might win points for patriotism. Its residents tend to cheer frequently about how wonderful it is, and they rarely want to pack up and move away.
 And to be fair, it can be hard to begrudge them. The older sections of this West Side neighborhood, those closest to Central Park, can seem downright utopian. The area is graced with buildings as grand as castles, and yet, like a small country village, people know their neighbors' names as well as their butcher's.
But despite its intimacy, Lincoln Square, which runs from Central Park West to the Hudson River and from West 59th Street to West 72nd, is unmistakably urban.
 The population is ethnically diverse, and many residents are employed in the media and arts. Lincoln Square has some of the nation's finest private and public schools, and Lincoln Center, home to world-class performances of music, opera and dance, is at its geographic and cultural heart. 
 In the next year or so, emigrating to Lincoln Square will be easier, with the opening of a handful of new condominium buildings. The 1,000 new apartments will be some of the city's most luxurious, with landscaped rooftop bars, in-house dining rooms, 35-seat screening rooms and 75-foot-long swimming pools.
 This building boom, mostly around the neighborhood's southern and western edges, rivals the urban renewal projects of the 1960's in terms of square footage. But this time around, entire blocks of the neighborhood are protected within a landmark district that is the largest in the city in terms of the number of buildings, thanks to residents like Arlene Simon, who in 1985 founded Landmark West, a still-active preservation group.
 Mrs. Simon worries that the new condos will be merely be pieds-a-terre and consequently, that their owners won't have much of a stake in the community.
 ''When you're a brownstone owner, you talk about your modest garden and restoring your stoop,'' said Mrs. Simon, a former children's clothing designer who has lived with her husband, Bruce, a labor lawyer, in the Lincoln Square neighborhood since 1960. Their current home is a 2,300-square-foot duplex, with five bedrooms and two and a half baths, that they bought for $60,000 in 1973.
 ''With these new buildings, it's all about who has the best view, and too much 'can you top this?' '' she said.
 Yet at least some people who are buying new condos plan on living in them full time and are just as die-hard about Lincoln Square as the old guard like Mrs. Simon.
 Last September, Justin Marcus, who runs a staffing company in Manhattan, paid $2.73 million for a 1,500-square-foot condo with two bedrooms and two and half baths on the 23rd floor of 15 Central Park West, currently a mishmash of cranes and scaffolding.
 Mr. Marcus, who is single, said his second bedroom would become a rehearsal space -- he plays both piano and guitar -- and when his second CD comes out next January, he hopes to hold the release party at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, the theater in the Time Warner Center where he attends jazz performances.
 ''There used to be a concentration of musicians in the East Village and West Village, but they all left for Brooklyn or Queens,'' Mr. Marcus said. ''This is one of the few places left in New York that retains its musical heritage.''

What You'll Find
 Lincoln Square's most memorable buildings may be the co-ops with multiple towers along Central Park West. The neighborhood's other defining architectural style can be found on the side streets: four-story brownstones, whose twisting stoops and rampart facades resemble fairy-tale forts.
 Yet new buildings are never far away in Lincoln Square. At Columbus Circle, sales recently closed on the last of the Time Warner Center's 200 units. Along the Hudson, residents have moved into 120 Riverside Boulevard, the seventh and final building in the complex developed by Donald Trump. 
 At 15 Central Park West, 60 percent of the 199 units have been spoken for. They range from one-bedrooms to full floors, priced from $2 million to $45 million. Sales of apartments on the lower floors of the 43-story building won't close until the spring of 2007, said Richard Wallgren, the sales director.
 The 20-story Hudson, at 225 West 60th Street, between West End and Amsterdam Avenues, has 80 units, starting at $625,000 for one-bedrooms. Fifty-five percent have been sold, though buyers can't move in until this summer, said Samantha Behringer, the sales manager.
 On the same block is 10 West End Avenue, which is expected to be completed in about a year. It will have 173 apartments, ranging from small one-bedrooms up to four-bedrooms, priced from $750,000 to $4.5 million.
 Next door, at 555 West 59th Street, the foundation is being completed for the Element, which will have 198 apartments and 35 stories, along with a basketball court and three pools. Its one- to four-bedrooms are $750,000 to $6.5 million. 
 Closer to the river, the 32-story Avery, at 100 Riverside Boulevard, is also at the foundation stage. Gary Barnett, the president of the Extell Development Company, the project's developer, said that 35 percent of its one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, priced from $850,000 to $3 million, have been sold.
 ''Even a year ago, people wanted prewar character and charm and all the old moldings,'' said Barry Rudnick, a vice president of the Corcoran Group who has been selling apartments in Lincoln Square for four years. ''Now it's all about service and luxury and new construction.''

What You'll Pay
 When all the new condominiums come to market, Mr. Rudnick said, they may push prices down. But for now, prices for both condos and co-ops seem to be holding their own, he said. Prices are about the same no matter the type of ownership. The condos tend to have a little more space and higher quality finishes, but the co-ops are in older sought-after buildings. The two factors tend to equalize prices. 
 The listing price for a 500-square-foot studio in Lincoln Square would typically be $400,000, Mr. Rudnick said, while a 750-square-foot one-bedroom, one-bath unit might be listed at $800,000. 
 With two-bedrooms, there's greater range in price, Mr. Rudnick said. While a typical Lincoln Square 1,300-square-foot two-bedroom might cost $1.75 million, he recently sold a 1,450-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath condo at 220 Riverside Boulevard for $2.45 million. It went for its asking price, he said, because it was on the 44th floor and had great views. 
 Rentals make up about half the market in Lincoln Square, said Josephine Vinci, a sales associate at Citi Habitats. The most in-demand rentals, she said, are in brownstones; one-bedrooms start at $2,600 a month, and two-bedrooms at $4,000. 
 In Lincoln Square's newer high-rises, studios start at $2,300 a month, one-bedrooms at $3,200 and two-bedrooms at $5,000, Ms. Vinci said.
 Demand for condos, as opposed to co-ops, seems to be growing in lockstep with the wave of construction in the neighborhood. Condos require a lower down payment and are easier to sublet, two of the factors that are winning favor among buyers. 
 Gregory Heym, the chief economist at Brown Harris Stevens, said that in the first quarter of 2006, 70 percent of all units sold in Lincoln Square were condos. The median sales price was $972,000, a 43 percent increase over the same quarter a year earlier but in line with other highly desirable addresses elsewhere in the city.
 ''You don't have the action at the high end of the market that you had a year ago,'' Mr. Heym said, referring to the Time Warner Center. ''But the whole market has shifted upward.''

What to Do
 Whatever the city offers, so does Lincoln Square. And then some.
 Two spectacular parks -- Central and Riverside South -- form the neighborhood's bookends. And the median malls along Broadway, planted with fresh beds of red tulips, end like an exclamation point at the refurbished Columbus Circle. 
 There, on a recent weekday afternoon, a lunchtime crowd of political activists, teenage skateboarders and office workers reading books gathered around the tall monument at the circle's center. 
 For those who can't afford Lincoln Center's indoor offerings, there are free outdoor shows in the warmer months. At Pier One in Riverside Park South, a seasonal restaurant is set up in summer, along with a screen for outdoor movies. 
 And for the fit and dexterous, there are two indoor rock-climbing walls, one in the Harmony Atrium, at Broadway and 62nd Street, and the other at Recreation Center 59, at 533 West 59th Street. 
 The Shops at Columbus Circle offer three floors of stores like J. Crew, Tumi and L'Occitane. Trendier wear can be found along Columbus Avenue at boutiques like Betsey Johnson, Theory and Lucky.

The Schools
 Some of the city's best public high schools are in Lincoln Square. Fiorello H. La Guardia, at 100 Amsterdam Avenue (65th Street), is strong in the arts and offers a pre-conservatory program. In 2004, 77.2 percent of its seniors went to four-year colleges.
 On the SAT reasoning tests in 2004, La Guardia students had an average verbal score of 536 and an average math score of 534, compared with 444 verbal and 472 math for the city.
 Another well-regarded high school is Beacon, at 227 West 61st Street. In 2004, seniors' average SAT scores were 506 verbal and 502 math; 70.7 percent went to four-year colleges.
 Some of the city's top private schools -- among them, Collegiate, Calhoun, Dwight and Trinity -- are in the neighborhood, or close to it. Annual tuitions are steep. At Trinity, for example, high-school students will pay $29,770 for the next school year.

The History
 The land along the Hudson River south of Riverside Park was once home to a bustling, smoke-belching industrial area. New York Central trains clacked down the piers with loads of grain, milk and vegetables. 
 At Pier D, at the foot of 67th Street, a rusting hulk is all that's left of a warehouse that burned down in 1971. When a breeze blows through, its metal ribs clang like industrial-size wind chimes. 

What We Like
 Because the developers worked so closely with neighborhood residents in planning them, the massive new buildings seem to fit in, giving Lincoln Square a pleasant mix of old and new.

Going Forward
 The new buildings seem designed to give their residents little reason to go out, and this could compromise the neighborhood's friendly feel and vibrant street life.

Release of Detainees Slowed
An effort by the Bush administration to send home many of the terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been stymied in part because of concern among United States officials that the prisoners might not be treated humanely by their own governments, officials said. 1

Success Varies in Measles Fight 

Through a national vaccination campaign, Nepal has led the global push to cut the number of children who die from complications of measles. That success is overshadowed by the grievous toll measles continues to take in neighboring India, which has not made the disease a priority. 1

Tacit Concession in Italy
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi came close to admitting that he had lost Italy's close national elections, though he did not use the words ''concede'' or ''defeat.'' 8

More Iraqis Flee Violence
A new estimate by one of Iraq's vice presidents has put the number of Iraqi families fleeing sectarian violence at 100,000, far outstripping previous projections and raising the possibility that a half-million people could be displaced. 12

Rural Japan's Depopulation
Rural communities in Japan, many of which never recovered from the long economic recession, have become increasingly depopulated and, along with their traditions and histories, risk vanishing from one of the world's fastest-aging societies. 18

Rebels Kill 15 Hostages in India
Maoist rebels who had kidnapped 48 villagers from a government relief camp in India this week have killed 15 of them in the past day, police officials said. A day after finding two dead hostages, who had been shot, the police found the bodies of 13 others, whose throats had been slit, near where they had been kidnapped in the Dantewada district. 8

New Pressure on Journalists
The Bush administration is exploring a radical measure to protect information it says is vital to national security: the criminal prosecution of reporters under the espionage laws. Such an approach would signal a radical revision of the informal rules of engagement that have governed the relationship between the press and the government for many decades. 1

Charity Remains Steady
After Hurricane Katrina, Congress was so concerned that donations for hurricane relief efforts would cut into other charitable giving that it passed one of the biggest temporary tax breaks in history. But concern about so-called donor fatigue was largely unfounded. 22

Jewish Groups Help in Darfur
Over the last two years, Jewish groups, congregations and individuals have taken a lead role in organizing grassroots responses to the killing in Darfur. 21

The Justice Department's inspector general has found no evidence to support claims that the Federal Bureau of Investigation interrogated political demonstrators before the 2004 Democratic and Republican Conventions to keep them from protesting. 22

HEADLINE: Pork Under Glass? Small Museums and Their Patrons on Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By BILL MARSH

 BODY:
THE ''nationally recognized teapot collection of Sonny and Gloria Kamm,'' as its keepers call it, needs a home. Thus the proposed Sparta Teapot Museum in Sparta, N.C. 
 The museum's Web site suggests the trove will draw 60,000 yearly visitors to the remote mountain region, creating ''synergies with the state's tourism industry'' and offsetting local job losses.
Its grand plans, like those of hundreds of small museums across the nation, rely to some degree on Congressional largess -- in this case, $500,000. But setting aside even modest amounts for hometown projects in an era of ballooning deficits and Medicaid cuts is risky for politicians. Rather than subject the proposals to debate, the items are slipped into spending bills as ''earmarks,'' individual grants numbering in the thousands annually.
To spending critics, it's just pork.
 Last week, the House barely passed a lobbying reform bill that required public airing of all earmarks. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert promised that the provision would survive negotiations with the Senate on its version of the bill.
 Meanwhile, earmarking continues apace. The Senate's most recent emergency spending bill, intended to pay for the Iraq war and hurricane relief, is salted with add-ons.
 A furor last year over two costly ''bridges to nowhere'' in Alaska drew wide attention to the use of earmarks. (The bridges were eventually canceled -- sort of. The $442 million was simply given to the state, stripped of the requirement that it go to the bridges, but allowing the projects to go forward with that same money if the state so chooses.)
 The outcry drew more attention to earmarks, large and small.
 This year, government watchdog groups have held up small museums as symbols of ridicule. Besides the teapot museum, a glass-blowing museum in Ohio and a federally financed parking lot for an art museum in Omaha have been singled out by budget hawks in Congress in speeches and press releases.
 Citizens Against Government Waste, a budget watchdog group, is trying to keep track of them. It has identified 1,030 museum-related projects approved since 1995, worth $527.4 million; 79 have appeared in the current fiscal year, for $27.3 million.
 Compared with skyscraping sums given to highways, the military and social programs, the museum grants are governmental loose change. Many recipients enjoy broad public support as beloved historical icons and popular local attractions; for politicians, they are hoped-for economic engines as well as political plums.
 Some defend earmarks to small cultural groups in rural or disadvantaged urban areas as essential for their survival. While the Metropolitan Museum of Art can tap big benefactors for support, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Wash., can't.
 But critics say that some of these organizations and museums have significant private backing, and even if they don't the funds should not be based on the whims of powerful lawmakers who happen to be on appropriations committees.
 ''It's not about the size of your project,'' said Keith Ashdown, vice president of policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense, another watchdog group. ''It's about the size of your politician.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 7, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about earmarks -- the federal grants that are inserted into spending bills -- misstated the progress of a House bill that would require greater disclosure of them. A vote on the bill April 27 cleared the way for debate but did not approve it. The House eventually passed the bill on Wednesday. 
 Because of an editing error, a chart listing small museums that have benefited from earmarks misstated the given name of the Nebraska Democratic senator who has been criticized for supporting one for an Omaha museum. He is Ben Nelson, not Bill.

HEADLINE: Thinking Globally And Acting Globally, Too

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
AN Iranian-American director, influenced by the Italian neo-realist movement, the American New Wave of the 1970's and current Iranian cinema, makes a movie, in English and Urdu, about a Pakistani pushcart vendor's daily life in post-9/11 New York. 
 A Korean-American director draws on her memories of growing up in the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles for her first feature. She shoots her film, an intimate portrait of a withdrawn young girl, in Canada, almost entirely in Korean, and names it after a teen-angst anthem by the British pop band the Cure.
Two Filipino-American directors, friends since their high school days in San Diego, Calif., return to the Philippines, where they were born, in search of affordable locations for a no-budget thriller. Their movie, in Tagalog and English, ventures into rarely seen terrain -- the slums of greater Manila -- even as it pays homage to the Hollywood bomb-on-a-bus blockbuster ''Speed.'' 
 The films in question -- ''Man Push Cart,'' ''In Between Days,'' and ''Cavite'' -- are among the most striking American independent movies of the past year, in part because they test the basic assumptions of what constitutes an American film (for starters, that it be in English or be set in the United States). The directors are first- or second-generation immigrants, and their movies, though hardly overt in their identity politics, are obliquely concerned with race and the challenges of assimilation. 
 To their credit these films make taxonomy tricky, but they could be bracketed under the rubric of Asian-American independent cinema, a diffuse and (until now) largely stagnant sector of the industry. Still, they go beyond dutiful multiculturalism. Implicit in their mix-and-match aesthetics is the utopian notion that all of world cinema is up for grabs.
 They may be the first small rumblings of the globalization of the American independent film. (Robinson Devor's ''Police Beat,'' now playing at Anthology Film Archives, is another example. A dreamy vision of perpetual transit, it chronicles a week in the life of a Senegalese-born Seattle bicycle cop who delivers the dislocated voiceover in Wolof.)
 ''The idea of national cinema doesn't make sense the way it used to,'' said Ramin Bahrani, director of ''Man Push Cart,'' which was shown at the New Directors/New Films series in New York in March and is set to open this fall. ''I find it frustrating when people expect a certain country to produce a certain kind of cinema. There's economic and cultural globalization, but also physical mobility. People move around more.'' 
 Chi-hui Yang, director of the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, the largest such festival in the country, says that as Asian-American films become more difficult to categorize, they also get more interesting. ''People are realizing that it can't just be about identity,'' he said. ''Issues of immigration and assimilation are getting more complicated, and you're finding more in-between kinds of experiences -- filmmakers who are mixed race or born and raised in another country.''
 ''In Between Days,'' which encapsulates that fracturedness in its title, won a special jury prize at Sundance this year for its director, So Yong Kim. (It will have its New York premiere on May 18, as part of the Sundance Institute at BAM series.) Ms. Kim, 37, born in Pusan, South Korea, came to the United States when she was 12. ''It's true to my experience of living in this little bubble,'' she said of her film. ''I didn't know English and in Koreatown, I didn't have to learn.''
 Ms. Kim's alert, economical style amounts to a meticulous transcription of the no man's land of adolescence, compounded by a sense of cultural displacement. The movie's subtle naturalism connects it to Asian art-house imports and its unstinting focus on a lone, uncommunicative character strongly recalls the work of the Dardenne brothers from Belgium.
 Ms. Kim and her husband and collaborator, Bradley Rust Gray, are directors without borders, nomadic by habit and open to casual cross-pollinations. Mr. Gray, 35, a co-writer and producer of ''In Between Days,'' shot his 2003 directorial feature debut, ''Salt,'' a jaggedly poetic road movie produced by Ms. Kim, in Iceland with an Icelandic cast and crew.
 Mr. Bahrani, 31, born to Iranian immigrants in North Carolina, also began his filmmaking career abroad. After graduating from Columbia film school, where he was influenced by the Iranian master formalist Abbas Kiarostami, he went to Iran for the first time and stayed for three years. He made a semi-autobiographical film, ''Strangers,'' in which he played an Iranian-American in search of his ancestral home. Returning to New York in 2001 as the war in Afghanistan was beginning, he found unlikely inspiration in the vendors who were selling him his morning coffee and bagel. The image of these men steering their carts down New York streets reminded him of Camus's ''Myth of Sisyphus.''
 Mr. Bahrani was motivated in part to capture the anxiety and self-consciousness of being Muslim-American in the age of Patriot Act detentions. ''I didn't want to make a message movie, but this paranoia had to be part of the film,'' he said. 
 Politics are also built in to Ian Gamazon and Neill Dela Llana's ''Cavite'' (pronounced kuh-VEE-tay). If Mr. Bahrani and Ms. Kim represent international cine-literacy, Mr. Gamazon and Mr. Dela Llana represent a more familiar type of globalization: the imposition of an American model on a third world locale. The twist is that the duo pulled off their Hollywood-style thriller for little more than the cost of two economy-class tickets from San Diego to Manila.
 Mainly told in first-person and in real-time, ''Cavite'' (set to open in New York and Los Angeles on May 26) weds a high concept to a brashly topical narrative. A lapsed Muslim returns to his hometown, Manila, and is dragged into a terrorist plot, taking instructions on his cellphone from an Abu Sayyaf operative who has kidnapped his family. The film was made with a two-man cast and crew: Mr. Dela Llana behind and Mr. Gamazon in front of the camera. 
 Both men were born in the Philippines, but while Mr. Dela Llana, 32, had visited relatives there, Mr. Gamazon, 32, had not returned since his family left Manila when he was 9. ''Cavite,'' the tale of an expatriate's nightmare homecoming, functions as an exaggerated documentary of Mr. Gamazon's culture shock. As he struggles with the language, squirms under the scrutiny of the locals and undertakes a forced tour of dumping grounds and squatter camps in Cavite, on the outskirts of Manila, Mr. Dela Llana said, ''that look on Ian's face was definitely genuine.'' 
 ''Cavite'' won its makers the Someone to Watch prize at this year's Independent Spirit Awards. But subtler diasporic dispatches may find a harder time making their way. Ms. Kim said that at a recent screening in Hong Kong, a Korean journalist asked why ''In Between Days'' was not more concerned with ''immigrant issues.'' ''When you're 14, it's not like you're thinking, 'Oh, I'm Korean American, what does that mean?' '' she said. ''You're thinking, 'Oh, I have a zit on my face.' '' 
 Mr. Bahrani balks at the idea that a film about a minority group should also fulfill an ethnographic purpose. One industry professional, he said, ''read the script and told me, 'After seeing your film, I should want to have a really good Indian meal.' '' If that professional catches the finished version of ''Man Push Cart,'' it might compel him to buy a bagel and a coffee.

HEADLINE: Back to Basics: Are Stocks Too Cheap, or Too Expensive?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN recent years, investors have been picking stocks based on a host of variables, from oil prices to interest rates to earnings growth. But one factor that hasn't played a significant role in the investment calculus lately is valuations.
 In other words, investors haven't been paying much attention to how expensive or cheap the stock market is.
You can chalk that up to several factors. For starters, interest rates have remained reasonably low in recent years, despite the Federal Reserve's recent efforts to raise short-term rates. And low market rates ''tend to support higher-than-average valuations,'' said James B. Stack, editor of InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter published in Whitefish, Mont.
 Moreover, for the last several quarters, corporate profits have been growing much faster than expected. And when profits grow faster than stocks rise, the market actually becomes cheaper, even though share prices are climbing. 
 But now that corporate profit growth is slowing and long-term bond yields are beginning to rise -- the yield on 10-year Treasury notes recently hit 5 percent for the first time in nearly four years -- ''valuations are going to matter again,'' said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, the chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia.
 To be sure, not many professional investors or analysts think that stocks are expensive right now. Consider the price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The P/E ratio is the most widely used method of valuing stocks; for the S.& P., the ratio has fallen to 18 from more than 28 in the summer of 2003, according to Ned Davis Research.
 ''From the standpoint of valuations, things look pretty good,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's.
 Stocks also continue to look cheap relative to bonds, based on the so-called earnings yield. To calculate the market's earnings yield, take the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio. In this case, the S.& P.'s earnings yield would be 1 divided by 18, which works out to 5.6 percent. Because 10-year Treasuries are still yielding less than that, stocks are said to be the better buy, according to many market watchers.
 But the problem isn't that the market's P/E ratio is too high. It's that the market may push that ratio even lower in coming months. 
 If enough investors fear rising interest rates, for example, they may decide that stocks are too expensive, even at today's relatively modest ratios. That would drive down equities, reducing the price in the price-to-earnings equation.
 ''The main determinant of the P/E ratio will be interest rates,'' said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. With rates rising, he added, those ratios are unlikely to rise, because higher interest rates tend to slow corporate profit growth while making higher-yielding bonds a more attractive alternative to equities. History shows that P/E multiples fall significantly during periods of rising long-term bond yields.
 Ned Davis Research recently studied this relationship going back to 1954, looking at periods when 10-year Treasury yields have risen. At the beginning of such periods, the S.& P. 500's price-to-earnings ratio was 18.1, on average. At the end of those periods, the average was 14.2. Conversely, P/E ratios tend to rise -- noticeably so -- during stretches when 10-year Treasury yields fall.
 Equally important is why long-term interest rates are rising. If they're climbing because of growing inflationary pressures -- and the recent report on consumer prices showed a bigger-than-expected jump in core retail inflation -- this could be even worse for equities because there is an inverse relationship between stock market valuations and inflation.
 Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Company, recently studied market valuations in various inflation climates. When inflation has been running at an annual pace of less than 2 percent, Ms. Sonders found, the average price-to-earnings ratio for the S.& P. 500 has been 23.4, dating back to 1960. 
 But when inflation climbs to 3 to 4 percent, the average ratio falls to 17.6. And when inflation jumps to 4 to 5 percent, the ratio drops to 14.8, on average.
 ''One of the reasons why the market has had a tough time making its way out of this trading range is the uncertainty surrounding interest rates and inflation,'' Ms. Sonders said.
 Not everyone thinks that price-to-earnings ratios are likely to decline. Mr. Kleintop at PNC, for example, said that there was a decent chance that those ratios could rise modestly so long as the economy continued to grow at a healthy pace. But whether the ratios rise or fall, he added, investors need to be mindful of valuations.
 Mr. Kleintop says he believes that health care and technology are among the sectors that are likely to perform best in the current environment, because their P/E ratios have already fallen significantly. The average ratio for the information technology sector of the S.& P. 500, for example, fell to 22 last year from more than 40 in 2003.
 Of course, picking stocks based solely on valuations doesn't always work. Many market strategists point out that even if a stock's price-to-earnings ratio is low, it can always drop further. But while valuations may not be a ''valid timing tool for investors,'' Mr. Stack said, they can still be used to reduce risk in one's portfolio.
 Ms. Sonders agreed. She suggested that investors shy away from equities that are trading at higher valuations relative to their historical norms -- as they have the most room to decline if price-to-earnings ratios fall. She said that these would include utilities stocks. The P/E for that industry's stocks in the S.& P. 500 climbed to 16.4 last year from 13.5 in 2003.
 Investors may also want to take some profits off the table for their small-capitalization stocks, whose P/E ratios have had similar climbs. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks, which has outperformed the shares of many large, blue-chip companies for more than five years, is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.7, well above the average of 22.6 going back to December 1978.
 Small-cap value stocks have enjoyed even greater P/E expansion in recent years. The Russell 2000 Value index, for example, currently trades at a multiple of 23.2, versus its historical multiple of 18.1. 
 STUDYING market valuations ''isn't going to tell you how to generate fantastic returns,'' said Stephen P. Wood, portfolio strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash. ''But it will point out places in the market where you can avoid outsized losses,'' he added. 
 ''In my experience observing investor behavior,'' he said, ''avoiding large losses is one of the main engines that drives long-term performance.''

HEADLINE: Are Poor Nations Wasting Their Money on Dollars? 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
IT'S often argued that foreigners funnel their money into the United States because it is a great investment. But for many countries, plowing money into the United States these days is not all that compelling a deal. 
 Poor nations are financing much of the United States' current account deficit. They are losing money in the process, and as the losses mount, they will be tempted to do something better with their cash.
Consider Russia. Over the last five years, its foreign currency reserves have multiplied by eight, to more than $200 billion. 
 Like most monetary authorities across the globe, the Russian central bank does not disclose the composition of its investment portfolio or the kind of returns it receives on its reserves. But the typical process of reserve acquisition and management is well known. 
 To accumulate reserves without stoking inflation, the central bank will typically get the necessary cash by selling ruble bonds, which are paying a return of about 12 percent a year. It will then buy dollars or euros to invest in American or European government securities, which offer yields around 5 percent or less.
 Seven percentage points are a lot to give up. With the ruble stable on foreign exchange markets, the annual cost to the Russian government of maintaining $200 billion in reserves could amount to $14 billion a year or more, about three times what it spent on education in all of 2004.
 Russia's central bank is not the only one that is leaving a fortune on the table. China has amassed one of the largest stashes of reserves in history: more than $800 billion at the end of last year. Reserves of the African countries reached $162 billion at year-end. 
 Altogether, by the count of the International Monetary Fund, international reserves held by developing countries doubled in just three years, reaching $2.9 trillion at the end of 2005, equivalent to almost one-third of their total gross domestic product. Much of this money is languishing at low rates of return in American government bonds.
 ''It is an irony of our times that the majority of the world's poorest people now live in countries with vast international financial reserves,'' Lawrence H. Summers, the president of Harvard and a former Treasury secretary, told an audience of Indian economists in Mumbai last month. ''It seems appropriate that part of the focus of the international financial architecture move toward the challenge of deploying their large reserves as effectively as possible.''
 There is a logic to this investment strategy, unprofitable as it is. The Treasury bond binge by China is part of a policy of exchange-rate management to keep the value of its currency competitive against the dollar -- a core component of the nation's export-led economic strategy.
 For most other developing nations, these reserves are simply insurance against financial disaster. A long list of developing countries have experienced devastating crises in the last 15 years: Mexico in 1994; Thailand, Indonesia and other Asian countries in 1997; Russia in 1998; Brazil in 1999; and Argentina in 2002.
 The crises followed a more or less standard path. Investors pulled money out of the country; the country ran out of foreign currency and devalued its own currency; if it had a lot of short-term foreign debt, it defaulted; and interest rates soared.
 These crises exacted a heavy cost. Michael M. Hutchison and Ilan Neuberger, economists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said the affected countries lost 13 to 15 percent of their output over three years. 
 And they turned the developing world into a much more prudent place. As the dust settled over the ruins of many former ''emerging'' economies, a new creed took hold among policy makers in the developing world: Pile up as much foreign exchange as possible.
 These days, many poor countries are guided by what is known as the Guidotti-Greenspan rule -- named after Pablo Guidotti, a former Argentine finance official, and Alan Greenspan, the former American Federal Reserve chairman who called for developing countries to amass enough foreign reserves to cover all their foreign debt coming due within the next year.
 Dani Rodrik, an economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, calculated that if a country had a 10 percent chance of suffering a big reversal in capital inflows in any given year, and if a financial crisis would cost about 10 percent of its G.D.P., it would not be unreasonable for it to pay an insurance premium equivalent to 1 percent of G.D.P.
 But developing countries seem to have been carried away by prudential excess. Many poor countries hold vastly more in reserves than recommended by the Guidotti-Greenspan guidelines. Russia has ''excess reserves'' equivalent to about a fifth of its G.D.P., Mr. Summers said. Malaysia's excess is equivalent to half its total output.
 India, Mr. Summers told his Mumbai audience, has excess reserves of more than $100 billion. If it invested them better, he said, it could reasonably expect a return equivalent to 1 to 1.5 percent of its $785 billion gross domestic product; that share would be more than the Indian government spends on health care. 
 These calculations should concern not only policy makers in India and other developing countries. As an American somewhere spends another Indian-supplied dollar, American authorities should be worrying about what to do when the spigot is shut off, as one day it will surely be. 
 There are cheaper forms of insurance: rather than accumulating reserves, poor countries could achieve the same level of financial security by limiting the accumulation of short-term debt, Mr. Rodrik said.
 Moreover, years have gone by without new financial disasters, and the memory of past crises is fading. If this continues, governments across the developing world will question the value of such costly insurance when there are so many other things to do with the money. 
 ''People are going to start to re-evaluate the objectives of economic policy,'' Mr. Rodrik said. ''They are likely to put more weight on employment and economic growth and a little less weight on avoiding a financial crisis.''

ABSURDISTAN 
 By Gary Shteyngart. 
 333 pp. Random House. $24.95.
Why praise it first? Just quote from it -- at random. Just unbutton its shirt and let it bare its chest. Like a victorious wrestler, this novel is so immodestly vigorous, so burstingly sure of its barbaric excellence, that simply by breathing, sweating and standing upright it exalts itself. 
 ''I stood there listening to my father's killers. Oleg and Zhora were of Papa's generation. All three had been made fatherless by the Great Patriotic War. All three had been raised by the men who had managed to avoid battle, the violent, dour, second-tier men their mothers had brought home with them out of brutal loneliness. Standing before the menfolk of my father's generation, I could do nothing. Before their rough hands and stale cigarette-vodka smells, I could only shudder and feel, along with fright and disgust, appeasement and complicity. These miscreants were our country's rulers. To survive in their world, one has to wear many hats -- perpetrator, victim, silent bystander. I could do a little of each.'' 
 The young writer supplying the lines is Gary Shteyngart, who moved to the United States from Russia when he was 7, while the young bereaved oligarch he's speaking through is Misha Vainberg, who attended college here but ended up marooned back in St. Petersburg. Misha is extraordinarily fat, ambivalently Jewish, unapologetically rich and -- as his homeland's best comic heroes often are -- infinitely thwarted. During his collegiate heyday, he gorged at the American buffet, slurping up rap music, psychotherapy and the sky's-the-limit complacent optimism that we take for granted as a birthright but that Misha sees for what it is: a glorious geo-historical accident.
 All he needs to return to the party (and to Rouenna, his beloved trash-talking black girlfriend from the Bronx who asks him, while touring his native city, the grand imperial center of Czarist tradition, ''Where the niggaz at?'') is a visa from our consulate. Tough luck. As the heir to an ill-gotten bloody fortune in mobbed-up post-Soviet Russia, Misha can have anything he lusts for -- top-shelf liquor, pharmaceutical sedatives, human pyramids of prostitutes and multiple alcoholic servants -- but because of his murdered father's global misdeeds he can't have that stamp on his passport.
 He sulks and schemes. And Russia, in its wretched boom, sulks with him. ''Let us be certain: the cold war was won by one side and lost by another.'' This epic collapse is continuing, we sense, inside the circus tent of smutty new money that Misha has. Shteyngart is a master panoramist who paints in just three tones: exhausted grays, despairing browns and superficial golds. When he mixes them, he gets moments like this one, which deserves to be reproduced at its full scale:
 ''The windswept Fontanka River, its crooked 19th-century skyline interrupted by the postapocalyptic wedge of the Sovietskaya Hotel, the hotel surrounded by symmetrical rows of yellowing, waterlogged apartment houses; the apartment houses, in turn, surrounded by corrugated shacks featuring, in no particular order, a bootleg CD emporium, the ad hoc Mississippi Casino ('America Is Far, but Mississippi Is Near'), a kiosk selling industrial-sized containers of crab salad, and the usual Syrian shawarma hut smelling invariably of spilled vodka, spoiled cabbage and some kind of vague, free-floating inhumanity.''
 Shteyngart and Misha, exuberant depressives, don't stint on the syntax or the verbiage when objects huge and rotten hulk into view. Their thick, overloaded style is what happens, though, when socialist realism decays into black comedy. This is the prose of heroic disappointment, faintly labored at moments but fitted to the task of shoveling up mountains of cultural debris. Hemingway's clean sentences wouldn't do here. A man needs commas, semicolons, adjectives. He requires linguistic heavy machinery.
 Which Shteyngart operates with a light touch as his story gains speed, leaving behind the rubble of the past for the about-to-be rubble of the near-future. After being foiled in dull St. Petersburg, Misha lights out for flashy Absurdsvani, an oil-blessed former Soviet republic where he hopes to finesse his visa problem. He flies there, accompanied by the only servant he hasn't pensioned off with petty cash and by an American college buddy who now runs a DVD business in Russia called ExcessHollywood (a name that, in another novel, would indicate a playful author but which, in this one, suggests a playful author and a numb society). 
 Quartered in a gleaming Hyatt, Misha is just days from freedom when Shteyngart starts turning back the hands on Absurdsvani's political clock. Dictatorship looms like a thug in a cheap suit. The spirit of democracy strikes back with its hand-lettered cardboard sign. There are billions of petro-dollars at stake, which liquefy and ooze corruption on everyone. Misha is mired. As a Russian, that's his lot. Borders can be crossed, regimes replaced, economic systems re-engineered, but -- for Shteyngart -- identity persists. It's that frustrating last 10 pounds of history that folks can't seem to shed, no matter how much they modernize their diets. 
 And it's a weight people cling to, the novel hints, to keep their souls from floating off into the bewildering thin air of purely notional internationalism. Misha is stuck with his inborn inertia as surely as if he'd sat down in wet cement. He's no match for the nimble, more Asiatic locals who can outfox him in their sleep. Meanwhile, over in the land of progress, his plucky ghetto girl is moving on up -- and into the clutches of her lecherous writing teacher. Misha's Nabokovian nemesis is an emigre poseur with a name resembling Shteyngart's and a novel on his resume whose title pornographically alludes to Shteyngart's first effort, ''The Russian Debutante's Handbook.'' He's a naturalized monster who trades on his own foreignness (or the aura of what's left of it) to scoop up chicks and critical attention.
 There are a lot of stereotypes here and plenty of intellectually incorrect exercises in racial and group determinism. Shteyngart, via Misha, thinks in peoples, not just individuals. He jokes in peoples, too, and not only about Jews and Russians, as his heritage entitles him to, but about Muslims, Germans, Brooklynites and every other in-group he can outrage. One envies his sense of entitlement to biases, and his frank understanding of the fact that such crude distinctions make the world go round. Especially these days, when they're not supposed to. When, ostensibly, we're all United Nations blue. 
 It's self-consciousness that defines our species, though, and Shteyngart is hilariously aware that the selves we invent in order to be conscious of them can be based on almost any difference. Ours is the species that insists it's not one. How else could we justify warring for common resources? Absurdsvani, for example, is divided between two ancient Christian traditions. The schismatic distinction is the tiny line that the sects draw through the bottoms of their crosses. One party's line slants up from left to right, the other's is angled in reverse. Sometimes the Absurdis laugh off the split, sometimes they fight about it. Almost always, though, some ambitious profiteer or maniac is plotting new ways to use it to his advantage. 
 Despite being jammed with charged references to Halliburton, Bechtel and other big-name players in the latest round of the great game, ''Absurdistan'' isn't a book of social issues or geopolitical controversies. It rides on top of them much as Huckleberry Finn rode atop his raft. Not surprisingly, considering the times, it rides them straight downstream, tugged by a bubbling current of worldly pessimism. Misha can't make much headway against such suction. He's sluggish. Obese. He's consumed his way into a corner. Shteyngart has built an apt hero in this respect: a self-defeating fatso globalist. His appetites drive the strife and fuel the tensions that provoke him to keep eating. 
 Compared with most young novelists his age, who tend toward cutesy involution, Shteyngart is a giant mounted on horseback. He ranges more widely, sees more sweepingly and gets where he's going with far more aplomb. His Absurdistan, to Americans, may seem amusingly far away at first, but the longer one spends there, hunkered down with Misha in a hotel room high above the rocket fire, the closer and more recognizable it gets. Absurdsvani is far, but Absurdistan is near.

HEADLINE: Letters From China

Jonathan Spence teaches modern Chinese history at Yale. Among his books are ''The Death of Woman Wang'' and ''The Search for Modern China.'' He is currently writing a book on the fall of the Ming dynasty.

 BODY:
ORACLE BONES
 A Journey Between China's Past and Present.
 By Peter Hessler.
 491 pp. HarperCollins Publishers. $26.95.
HOW can one catch today's China in words? It is a country in constant motion, defying the laws of economic gravity, reaching out insistently around the world for raw materials to fuel its growth, eating up its land and its past, enticing outsiders to help it achieve new levels of wealth and power, opening up class fissures that were thought to be closed, testing the limits of rapid urban growth while giving its people chances for self-exploration and intellectual transformation they have not known for over half a century. 
 Fortunately, Peter Hessler has not been dismayed by the challenge. Instead, after teaching English and freelancing as a journalist, he decided to give up the world of deadlines and throw himself into this boisterous hurly-burly of noise and images as the Beijing correspondent for The New Yorker. Serenely confident, he has a marvelous sense of the intonations and gestures that give life to the moment; he knows when to join in the action and when simply to wait for things to happen. Today's China could have been made for him. If you don't believe me, dip into the chapters in ''Oracle Bones'' called ''Starch'' and ''Wonton Western,'' which focus on the worlds of industry in Manchuria and film-making on the edge of the Tarim Basin. You will be hooked.
 Hessler must have spent a good deal of mental energy developing a structure for his book, determined to strike an aesthetic balance between the personal lives of the individual Chinese whose stories he tells and the physical and historical spaces they inhabit. He achieved this by constructing a narrative scaffolding some readers may initially find distracting. But rest assured: everything soon falls into place.
 What you might call the horizontal level is provided by 24 chapters covering Hessler's experiences in China from May 1999 (when the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was bombed by American planes during NATO's intervention in the Balkans) to June 2002 (when Hessler, on a return trip to the United States, visited two elderly Chinese scholars at a retirement home in Reston, Va.). Intersecting these modern chapters are 13 others, the vertical shafts that Hessler calls ''Artifacts'' since each is related to events deep in China's past -- or to those who excavate and study that past.
 The ''oracle bones'' of Hessler's title, found in profusion in and around the ancient city of Anyang, date from the second millennium B.C. and are incised with divination texts written in the first known form of what we now call Chinese. When the diviners applied searing heat to the bones -- many were in fact the flat lower carapace of tortoises -- the surfaces cracked, yielding patterns that predicted the chance of success for a given enterprise. Though the inscriptions are often brief and fragmentary, they are a source of passionate interest to scholars, both Chinese and Western. They also provide a rich metaphor for the search for meaning in China's past -- and for prognostications about its future. In these separate ''Archives'' chapters, Hessler plays elaborate and intriguing games with the possibilities of the bones: with the scholars who have excavated and interpreted them and with the Chinese written language as it developed from these beginnings.
 Elsewhere, Hessler offers unexpected views of the West. Particularly chilling is a vivid portrait of hostility to the United States, in part due to the Belgrade bombing and the downing of an American spy plane two years later, that spilled out in the days after 9/11, when China was flooded with doctored DVD's of the wrecked twin towers and the damaged Pentagon, interspersed with clips from miscellaneous Hollywood disaster films and vignettes of American leaders uttering random, often unintelligible, pronouncements.
 A good part of the modern story line is provided by the coming-of-age of three of Hessler's Chinese students from his language-teaching days in Sichuan Province in the late 1990's (the subject of his first book, ''River Town''), conveyed through their letters and their occasional meetings. Written in an English that is idiomatic and frank with just occasional slips of usage or spelling, the students' letters are entrancing and genuinely moving. (''My parents and relatives all wanted to introduce girlfriends to me,'' one of his former student wrote. ''So they introduced one and one, but the one and one passed me and didn't become my wife.'') The students provide an absorbing view of the difficulties faced by young Chinese from remote provinces as they try to find decent jobs in the sweatshops and the sleazily managed schools of boom areas like Shenzhen or Wenzhou. Their new world is fiercely competitive: through their eyes, Hessler shows us the difficulties of maintaining honesty in the cutthroat system of present-day China. Their stories also contain intriguing subsidiary characters like the radio-show call-in hostesses, often from rural backgrounds themselves, whose sympathy and common-sense advice play a crucial role in boosting the morale of hundreds of thousands of migrants.
 Appearing at intervals in various locales is another figure who also provides narrative continuity: a middle-aged Uighur from Xinjiang Province whom Hessler calls Polat, to prevent him from being identified by the authorities in either China or the United States. Polat and Hessler became friends in the spring of 1999 in a Uighur restaurant in Beijing, after Polat defended Hessler against Chinese diners angered by the Belgrade bombing. The Uighurs, many of whom are Muslim and have distinctly un-Chinese features, have been designated as one of the state's official ''minority peoples.'' Some are also separatists and support the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which the Chinese government eventually persuaded the United States to designate a terrorist organization.
 Though Polat does not seem to have had terrorist contacts, he operated a host of illegal commercial activities, including black-market money-changing. He and Hessler, both stuck in grubby and unattractive lodgings, used to meet at a restaurant in the former Russian section of Beijing for beer and dumplings and to talk about the world. Some time later, a Chinese ''visa consultant'' created a fictitious identity for Polat, which enabled him to obtain a visa and enter the United States. After a brief stopover in Oklahoma, he moved to Washington, D.C., and found a job delivering takeout Asian food. His is an astonishing story, full of racial tensions, finely told -- and not one to inspire readers who are security-conscious.
 Demonstrating his versatility, Hessler intersperses Polat's story and those of his other Chinese acquaintances with accounts of the different archaeologists who featured in the hunt for and decipherment of the oracle bones. Here too there are dark ripples, some of them circling out from the death of one of China's finest scholars, Chen Mengjia, who was denounced as a ''Rightist'' in 1957 and committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution. At least one of those who denounced him is still living, and in a rare burst of moralistic posturing, Hessler confronts him, pushing him to make a confession of regret.
 Hessler is surely right about the echoes that still vibrate from China's unvarnished past. The bones, like the country, need endless deciphering. But as an 80-year-old Chinese scholar, who suffered humiliations of his own, says to Hessler, there is little point in trying to settle old scores. ''The things that people said and wrote in those days don't count,'' he explains. ''The ones who criticized me the harshest, I hardly remember them. I don't hate them.''
 The bones, like the lives of China's people, can swirl into unexpected conjunctions.

HEADLINE: What's Inequality? Ask a Former Doorman

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AS the only business columnist I know who was once a doorman, I couldn't read about the last-minute contract agreement for New York's apartment-building workers without thinking about the guillotine. 
 It's not that my experience -- three summers at the portal of a classy old pile on 69th and Lexington -- turned me into a revolutionary. Quite the contrary, those summers gave me the wherewithal to grab a low spot on the totem pole of bourgeois life, a spot to which I have clung desperately ever since.
No, I think of the guillotine because those summers and the years that followed taught me something about the changing nature of income inequality and class resentment. Back in 1978, when I made off with an Ivy League diploma, my first job paid less than I had been making opening doors and helping old ladies with their packages. Worse yet, it took me four years of full-time work before my white-collar wages exceeded what I would have earned in uniform back on East 69th Street. Even at that point, however, I was still in the hole. Think of all those semesters of forgone earnings. Think of the tuition, room, board and bookstore expenses. And think about the cost of all that capital. 
 I have to acknowledge that in those days, I resented the wages of Teamsters and sanitation workers almost as much as I did hereditary wealth. Much has been written lately about the enormous earnings advantage conferred by a college education, but what's striking to me is that this advantage was once so scant. Thirty years ago, in fact, the economist Richard Freeman published a book called ''The Over-educated American,'' and although I was too young and stupid to realize it, I was one.
 It's true that I chose a line of work -- newspapers -- that is notorious for low entry-level wages, but the broader data bear me out. In 1978, men with a bachelor's degree had an estimated wage premium of just 21 percent over men who were high school graduates, according to ''The State of Working America 2004-2005'' by Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein and Sylvia Allegretto. 
 But in my case, even that modest premium was illusory. My new white-collar job required a car and crazy hours; there was little overtime pay. The progressive tax system probably further eroded the college premium, because higher earnings were subject to higher levies.
 In 2003, the most recent year for which the book contained data, the male college wage differential was 41.5 percent -- practically double what it was when I started out. Although it's possible that my current modest prosperity is entirely a result of good looks (that would account for why it's so modest), chances are that education played a big role in making me better off financially than the doormen among whom I once worked.
 In coming years, the earnings premium for educated Americans will probably increase because of factors like new technology, outsourcing, large numbers of unskilled immigrants and the tendency of the educated to marry one another. Within the economic arena, I doubt that much can be done about this differential. 
 Today, it's doubtful that many college graduates would envy the pay and benefits of most blue-collar workers. Those who inherit money, meanwhile, can't be blamed for their own dumb luck. So most of us direct our class-based ire at what might be called the new earnings aristocracy. Consider Sanford I. Weill, the former Citigroup chairman, who made nearly $1 billion on the job yet still departs with an annual pension exceeding $1 million -- as well as medical and dental insurance. Or how about William W. McGuire, the chief executive of the UnitedHealth Group, who is reported by The Wall Street Journal to have $1.6 billion in unrealized gains on stock options when workers and employers are battling over who will pay for soaring medical premiums? 
 THAT'S where the guillotine comes in. I'm not expecting anything like the French Revolution, of course. The guillotine I'm talking about is more figurative than literal. It could take the form of punitive marginal tax rates, new trade barriers or excessive regulation of private enterprise -- changes that will make everyone poorer.
 If those at the top of the heap are really so smart, they should start advocating some orderly increase in redistribution -- at the very least, in the form of national health coverage. They should do this if only to maintain social peace -- to prevent the less fortunate, in other words, from losing their heads. Because, if that happens, the rich may lose theirs as well.

HEADLINE: Night Spots for a Select Few Thousand

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

 BODY:
NIGHT life is big business in New York, very, very big right now. Stylish new restaurants like Morimoto, Buddakan and Buddha-Bar, which have opened within several months (and several blocks) of one another in and around the meatpacking district, pace off at 12,000, 16,000, and 15,000 square feet, respectively.
 In a town obsessed with real estate, it's not hard to imagine the sex factor involved with walking into a place that has space to burn. Add lounges and a club mentality to the dining rooms, and you have a kind of fun-efficient, one-stop shopping for a night out.
But if exclusivity -- as in hard to get into -- is New York's best-played blood sport, then what do you do with a restaurant like Buddakan that can seat 320 simultaneously and entertain 950 a night? That's one Airbus A380, or the hangar you park it in. Or Buddha-Bar, where the cocktail bar and the sushi bar that faces it are 30 yards away from each other, and to see or be seen is hard without field glasses? 
 For many New Yorkers, where the average condo size runs just over 1,200 square feet, big is a big thrill. You go out and enjoy an evening in something more than 10 times the size of your apartment, and expensively decorated, too. Buddha-Bar, designed by Didi Pei, a son of I. M. Pei, and Stephane Dupoux, cost $10 million. Morimoto, by Tadao Ando, was $11 million. Buddakan, designed by Christian Liaigre, was $13 million.
 For those who accuse the city of suburbanization, a restaurant like Buddha-Bar, with a 35-foot-high glass atrium ceiling, indoor fish ponds and a 17-foot black Buddha, looks like a prototype for a night-life mall, which is not an unclever idea given where many younger, newer New Yorkers grew up or arrived from. You come here to see your dreams realized in ways you couldn't realize them back home. The Red Lobster in Times Square, which seats 306, should be downgraded as a threat. ''It wasn't like I came here to open giant restaurants,'' said Stephen Starr, a Philadelphia restaurateur who opened Buddakan, at 75 Ninth Avenue, and Morimoto, at 88 10th Avenue, this year. Mr. Starr said drama and ''an economy of scale'' dictated the designs.
 ''You can feel the volume when you walk in,'' he said, referring to Buddakan, adding that that same volume represented potentially ''great amounts of revenue.''
 Mr. Starr resisted the suggestion that his restaurants might be the prow of a trend -- fusion megaplexes -- pushing through the dark waters of Manhattan night life. He cited the two Megus, and recalled China Grill, on West 53rd Street, which opened in 1987. (I would add the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of New York's greatest party spots since 1978 -- pools, views, a wacky Egyptian build-in, everything a night-life mogul could want).
 But Mr. Starr agreed that New Yorkers had a sense of entitlement that was an ever-present issue. And when you believe that the fact of living here now makes you famous by default, more is more capacity when it comes to letting in an expanding crowd that demands to win at the door.
 ''Everybody is somebody,'' Mr. Starr said with polite exasperation. ''It's hard.'' There are no ropes; there is a private telephone line for reservations.
 Soho House, a members-only club in the same neighborhood, has seating in its lounge and restaurant for 240, and just over 2,000 members. Between Morimoto and Buddakan, Mr. Starr could move them through in two nights.
 At 25 Little West 12th Street on Tuesday, there was no one within 20 yards of Buddha-Bar's clublike entrance. At the corner of Ninth Avenue, Pastis was mobbed, inside and out, with people who looked as if they had been called in to provide a crowd for a crowd scene being shot in the meatpacking district. Pastis now has ''security'' on weekends: people paid to tell people they can't come in.
 A man with a list stopped me at the top of Buddha-Bar's steps, asked if I had a reservation, told me I couldn't come in when I told him I didn't, told me a business card wasn't proper identification when I said I was trying to report an article for the newspaper I work for, and argued with the manager who came out and walked me into the restaurant.
 Inside, past a tunnel of beatific small Buddhas, Buddha-Bar loomed large. House music, under the direction of a house D.J., Sam Popat, slush-slushed lazily as a handful of people dined under the Didi Pei roof. 
 Buddha-Bar originated in Paris in 1996, and is famous for its music, which has helped it sell a series of successful CD compilations. Jean-Yves Haouzi, a manager there, bought the license to open and operate Buddha-Bar in New York from Raymond Visan, the founder. Mr. Visan has plans for a chain of hotels, with Buddha-Bars in the lobbies.
 Mr. Haouzi, who looks like a French Matt Dillon, stopped by the cocktail bar to say hello. I was sitting with Brendon Phalen, a customer with a reservation, who was drinking a whiskey and Coke and looking for his date on his cellphone, for fear that she was somewhere else in the restaurant waiting, out of sight. A bartender practiced extended cocktail shaker flips behind us, for lack of anything else to do. 
 Buddha-Bar, vast and ambient with candles and world music, and pockets of people in suits, looked more like a night-life convention than night life. 
 ''I had no idea it was this big,'' said Aafia Chaudhry, Mr. Phalen's date, sitting down on a gold bar stool. Ms. Chaudhry and Mr. Phalen, as it turns out, were M.D.'s, not Web site designers, as I had posited, who live in the neighborhood. Mr. Phalen walked by the other day, asked for a reservation, and got it.
 At Buddakan, the house was roaring with fire. Every square foot was occupied -- one of those excellent loft parties where no one knows the owner. The music was loud. No one was at the door, but instead, inside, there was a long steel reservations desk that looked like the check-in at a hotel. Buddakan, like the other big new restaurants, is basically a hotel without the rooms upstairs. Mr. Liaigre, the designer, also designed the Mercer hotel in SoHo. 
 The river of young professionals that courses through the meatpacking district nightly eddied, pooled, and spilled through the palatial spaces, with a palpable happiness that expectations were being met and exceeded. Buddakan proves you have to jump into the fire to play in New York. It's just that the fireplaces are getting bigger.
 As I left, a silver Porsche S.U.V. bleated like a calf being killed as a police tow truck removed it from 16th Street. At the corner of Tenth Avenue, ''the largest traditional Japanese noren curtain ever created,'' according to Morimoto's press release, whipped in the wind of a thunderstorm bearing down.
 At Morimoto's blue plexiglass bar, the woman sitting next to me made a cellphone call and left this message: ''Dear Doug, I might be drunk, but, how are you.'' She was drinking raspberry vodka and soda.
 Her friend, speaking with a third, male friend, said ''I keep seeing him, and I don't talk to him.'' Two women with one man seemed to prevail as a social model. The three on my other side paid their bar bill with three credit cards, as if they had been trying on clothes together in separate dressing rooms, not taking one another out.
 Morimoto looks like a cosmetics store in SoHo. Mr. Ando, the Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect, has created a game of mirrors with architectural angles, not mirrors, and walls of glittering bottle glass. Of the three restaurants I visited on Tuesday, Morimoto, at 12,000 square feet, was the smallest. After Buddakan, it felt five minutes old.
 Buddha-Bar may be five minutes late. The New York minute is as sacred as the square foot -- and being the biggest can't stop the clock. 
 I asked Mr. Haouzi if he was worried about being the last in town with a big new Asian-style barn, in a city with a recent surfeit of them. Buddha-Bar played host to a Conde Nast party, and a Maxim party is booked for May 17.
 But, in the light of day, these are office parties, not the handsome herds now stampeding the meatpacking district, that make or break night life in New York. Mr. Starr listed them, after actors and baseball players, as ''the people who pay the bills.''
 Mr. Haouzi showed reasonable doubt. He knew going in he had competition. Buddakan is leasing the space that Buddha-Bar leased several years ago when it first tried, unsuccessfully, to locate in New York.
 ''To tell you how long I'm going to stay, I don't know,'' he said of Buddha-Bar's tenure. ''Will the place succeed? I don't know.''
 ''The client will decide.''
 Or several thousand of them.

HEADLINE: Between Gags, a D.J. Rallies Immigrants

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
IT'S the rush hour, and that means Eduardo Sotelo, Los Angeles's highest-rated morning radio show host, must be up to something.
 One moment he's crank-calling a young listener's boyfriend, posing as her irate father. (The girl later explains to the boyfriend that she's not really pregnant.) Another he's asking a lobby guard to demand a $100 bribe from three visitors he is expecting from Fresno before letting them into the studio. (The visitors pay, and the money is later returned.)
 Such pranks -- and jokes, music, interviews and help-line-type calls from listeners -- have catapulted Mr. Sotelo, known as Piolin, to the top of the radio heap. His nationally syndicated ''Piolin por la Manana'' (''Piolin in the Morning'') is heard not only in Los Angeles, where his show on Univision Radio's KSCA-FM beats all competitors in Spanish or English, including Ryan Seacrest, but in 18 other markets six days a week.
 Mr. Sotelo, 35, is a comedian better known as Piolin or Tweety Bird because of his plump lips and short stature. But now Tweety Bird, the entertainer, has become Tweety Bird, the political figure and catalyst of the newly galvanized immigrant rights movement. 
 Last March, when his guests included the organizers of a march in Los Angeles against a pending bill in Congress that would make it a felony to be in this country illegally, Mr. Sotelo deemed the bill ''inhumane.'' After all, he too slipped into the country illegally, on foot and stuffed in the trunk of a car.
 ''If we have jobs, that means that they need us in this country,'' he said in an interview. ''Our people suffer when they don't have documents. Our relatives die in Mexico, and we can't go to bury them. To hear immigrants called criminals pains me.''
 When he called up his competitors on Spanish-language radio to set an example of unity and to plot a course of action, about a dozen of the disc jockeys and radio personalities responded. They urged listeners not only to march but also to make a good impression: they asked participants to wear peaceful white T-shirts, wave American flags and bring trash bags to pick up after themselves.
 In a stunning turnout, more than half a million of them did.
 Now, to honor the next major pro-immigrant action -- a May 1 boycott of work, school and shopping to show the economic strength of immigrants -- Mr. Sotelo's seven-hour show will not be broadcast tomorrow. The station will play music while he joins two marches in downtown Los Angeles, one of them organized by the Roman Catholic archdiocese. Mr. Sotelo announced his plans on Thursday and immediately spurred calls from other D.J.'s in Dallas, Nashville and Las Vegas vowing to go silent too. 
 ''He's definitely risen to an extremely important position of outreach that the movement hasn't had for years,'' said Jesse Diaz, a organizer of the pro-immigrant march and boycott. ''He's a vehicle for the message of the movement, a message of dignity, of peace and of hope.''
 Mr. Sotelo, who is surprisingly serious in person, says he is not entirely comfortable in his new shoes. He first tried to stay neutral on the polarizing boycott, but changed his mind. Mindful of his influence, he said: ''I feel a great responsibility, and I should be careful. I'm not going to do things because a politician or anyone else who calls me talks to me. I'll only do what comes from my heart.''
 He now appears at press conferences alongside Catholic bishops and union leaders, and he has become a media darling, sought after by American television networks and international publications to speak for the illegal immigrant.
 ''How do you feel now about being a political leader?'' a television interviewer for ''Despierta America,'' Univision's early morning show, asked him last week.
 ''I don't consider myself political,'' he said. ''I'm one more immigrant who has come to the United States looking for a better life, a person who brings one more brick to the construction of our unity here.'' 
 But in heavily Latino cities like Los Angeles, Mr. Sotelo and other popular ''locutores'' like Renan Almendarez Coello (''el Cucuy'' or ''the Boogeyman'') hold sway over their audience the way Rush Limbaugh and Lou Dobbs do with theirs, but as a counterpart to the conservative media chatter in English. 
 And in showing what can happen when radio jocks turn serious, those familiar with the power of radio say, Mr. Sotelo is a reminder that even in the age of iPods and blogs, radio is as effective as ever.
 ''We can't underestimate the power of people who spend hour after hour a day speaking in this intimate, candid way,'' said Robert Thompson, professor of popular culture at Syracuse University.
 That power is more concentrated in Spanish because of fewer outlets, and while Mr. Sotelo and the others are undoubtedly treated like celebrities -- they are stopped on the street for autographs and photographs and a couple of them have stars on Hollywood's Walk of Fame -- they are also regarded as friends.
 ''When people don't know an emergency number, they call the radio station,'' Jackie Madrigal, Latin format editor for Radio & Records, a trade publication, said of Spanish radio listeners. ''The audience sees them not just as celebrities, but as 'my buddy.' ''
 But during lulls in all the silliness, Mr. Sotelo brings to the politically charged immigration debate the weight of his personal story and the success he has achieved. He left poverty in Jalisco, Mexico, at 16 in 1986; paid a smuggler for a harrowing passage in which he ran across a freeway, and spent hours gasping for air in the trunk of a car. He then worked menial jobs, recycling cans, washing cars and cleaning apartments while attending a Santa Ana high school and breaking into radio in the early 1990's.
 HE said he and his father, mother and two brothers now live legally in this country, and he plans to become a citizen this year.
 An estimated 11 million people reside illegally in this country, and Congress is wrestling with immigration bills in the middle of an emotional national debate about whether those illegally here should be punished for breaking the law or given amnesty. The Senate favors a compromise that would legalize many immigrants and seems to be favored by President Bush, who has said huge deportations are not possible. But House Republicans are pushing for much tougher legislation that would turn those illegally here into felons. 
 Surrounded by his five-man morning crew, which feeds him information from laptops and makes appropriate background noises, Mr. Sotelo is devoting much of his 4-to-11 a.m. weekday show to giving a voice to illegal immigrants in the raging debate. But at some point, some radio experts say, he will have to move on. 
 ''This is fleeting,'' said Rob Balon, chief executive of the Benchmark Company, a market research business in Austin, Tex. ''If Piolin decides to become a Limbaugh type, his audience is going to be bored.''
 So far, it seems there is little danger of that. Between pro-immigrant outbursts, pranks and the daily flurry of activity, Mr. Sotelo still took time the other day to try to find an exterminator in San Jose who could help a listener who said her house was infested with termites.
 ''She said she's getting bitten,'' Mr. Sotelo said, shaking his head. ''It's unbelievable. We have to help her.''
 His listeners, of course, will hear all about that too.

HEADLINE: Lessons From Roosevelt Island 

 BODY:
When 68 passengers became stuck on the Roosevelt Island tramway above the East River recently, a lot of people began to wonder, understandably, ''Who's in charge of this thing?'' 
 The answer is that the island and its tram are managed by the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, a small, often unnoticed cog in New York State's huge shadow government. The corporation is one of about 700 public authorities established in the belief that they could operate in a more efficient, business-like manner than government agencies. But over the years, they've morphed into largely unregulated entities that carry out the public's business in a less-than-public way.
 Like the Long Island Power Authority and the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency, and even the faculty-student association at the State University at Stony Brook, the Roosevelt Island authority lives in a kind of no man's land that is barely overseen by the state and not really required to comply with the kinds of good governance rules we now expect from the best of corporate America.
 What is needed -- and what we hope will be provided very soon by the New York State Legislature -- is a new authorities law. Ideally, that law would establish a code of conduct for directors, grant the comptroller explicit authority to review all contracts and create an independent office to see that everybody does things openly and for the betterment of the public at large.
 Comptroller Alan Hevesi and his staff of auditors have been working their way through the long list of authorities since January 2003, finding transgressions large and small.
 In one case, Mr. Hevesi uncovered millions of dollars spent without proper contracts on temporary personnel at the Urban Development Corporation. In another, auditors discovered that the Nassau County Health Care Corporation had awarded nearly $1 million in construction contracts without the competitive bidding required by the corporation's own guidelines.
 In other cases, the scrutiny has clearly helped. At the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for instance, Mr. Hevesi fought his way through layers of complicated, opaque budgeting that seemed designed precisely to keep the public from knowing what was going on, and in the end produced a more transparent process. 
 A state law approved last year will force more transparency. Other reform proposals are expected soon from a commission appointed by Gov. George Pataki and led by Ira Millstein. With billions of dollars at stake, these authorities need more daylight, more oversight, more accountability. That may be a tall order for New York's Legislature, but this is a big hole in the reform agenda.

HEADLINE: Camden Still Finds Itself Treading Water

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
THE parking lot seems almost abandoned as you look down and just south from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge here. When the bridge was opened in 1926 as a civic centerpiece to welcome the sesquicentennial celebration in neighboring Philadelphia, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world, and the land along the Delaware River where the parking lot now stands bustled.
 The Victor Talking Machine Company had a dozen buildings there making gramophones and records and other sound equipment. J. B. Van Sciver's furniture warehouse and showroom were just back across Delaware Avenue, and Campbell's Soup had a factory nearby. New York Shipbuilding was a little farther down river, and boats and trains stopped the length of the way to get products to and from market.
 All of that is gone, save for a couple of the Victor buildings back from the river. There is primarily just the parking lots, about 33 acres of them. Three years ago, with great fanfare, Gov. Jim McGreevey announced the transfer of development rights for those 33 acres to Steiner and Associates, a Cincinnati firm, along with a $3 million grant and a $15 million loan to get started on a proposed $53 million renovation of the state aquarium, the linchpin, according to Steiner's plans, of a retail/entertainment/commercial/residential development that would transform Camden. 
 Three years later, Adventure Aquarium, as it is now called, is there, but the rest of the site is still made up of those parking lots. There is a tremor of hope and sporadic activity, but the vision of some that the Camden waterfront would transform one of the nation's poorest cities into an urban jewel is still a bit off, even to the strongest supporters of that vision.
 ''The development on the waterfront may not have gone as fast as some people would like,'' said Carl Dranoff, a developer whose renovation of The Victor, one of the remaining industrial buildings on the waterfront, into luxury apartments is the only high-end residential development there so far. ''Everything is contingent on and related to everything else.''
 While the Victor's 341 loft apartments, many of which overlook the Philadelphia skyline, have been mostly filled since its opening in 2004, nothing else has been built since. The refurbished aquarium, which opened in May 2005, is ''on target,'' said Steiner's president, Barry Rosenberg, for about a million visitors in its first year. 
 Still, that is far fewer than the 1.6 million who came to the less fancy and smaller state aquarium its first year in 1992. The old aquarium was mostly one big tank with some good educational exhibits. The Adventure Aquarium has swimming hippos, opportunities to dive with sharks and several walk-through tunnels and exhibits next to multicolored fish in architecturally diverse tanks. Yet, there has not been a stampede of customers.
 Mr. Rosenberg said Steiner plans to break ground on what the company is calling the Ferry Terminal Building, since it is adjacent to the aquarium near where the Philadelphia-Camden ferries used to dock in the days before bridges spanned the Delaware. It is planned as a 100,000-square-foot four-story office building. About half the office space will be taken up by Susquehanna Patriot Bank, the New Jersey subsidiary of Susquehanna Bancshares, a Pennsylvania holding company. Downstairs, Mr. Rosenberg said, he is negotiating for two restaurants.
 ''I don't know what glorious means today, but the reality is we have to move in baby steps,'' said Mr. Rosenberg, acknowledging that one 100,000-square-foot building does not a grand waterfront development make. ''We have to view this as an overall 10-year process. We anticipate, eventually, $1 million condos, at least one hotel, close to 700 or 800 residential units. If you put that together, that becomes powerful. But it is not going to happen overnight.''
 Camden's city council president, Angel Fuentes, is a bit skeptical that waterfront development will mean much for the neighborhoods where his constituents live.
 ''Steiner is talking about hotels and restaurants and office space and a banquet hall,'' Mr. Fuentes said. ''Residents are saying: 'Why the waterfront? What about the neighborhoods?' We need to be fixing the infrastructure here. At the same time, we do need jobs and are waiting for the construction so there might be some.''
 One longtime Camden gadfly, though, is encouraged that people are at least thinking about building on the waterfront. Frank Fulbrook has been through picketing and protests and neighborhood lobbying for the 38 years since he moved into the Cooper Grant section near Rutgers-Camden, just east of the waterfront, which he said is finally reviving after decades of steady decline.
 ''Maybe people didn't understand me all along, but I have always been pro-revitalization, just that I don't think you need to displace people to have it,'' said Mr. Fulbrook, who is an adjunct professor in urban studies at Rutgers-Camden and is the head of the Cooper Grant Neighborhood Association. ''But in order to make commercial development successful here, you need more residents year round, not summertime tourists for the aquarium and the baseball field and the Battleship New Jersey.''
 He said he is less worried about any office buildings that Steiner may build on the waterfront and more excited that his Cooper Grant neighborhood now only has two vacant buildings out of 90 houses and apartments. He is also looking forward to Mr. Dranoff's renovation of another old Victor Company building, Radio Lofts, which will made up of 86 condominiums, not just apartments like The Victor.
 Mr. Dranoff said: ''You can't see fancy cranes or big buildings, but I assure you projects are about to start in the next year. In the Radio Lofts, we are doing environmental remediation. You don't go down Cooper Street and see a construction site, so I guess that is what worries people.
 ''There is a germination period for these things. Hoboken and Jersey City weren't built in one year. It took at least a decade. I'm sorry that people think we should be further along, but building a building is like having an iceberg. It's the part you don't see early on that is the most important.''
 The New Jersey Economic Development Authority -- through the Camden Economic Recovery Board -- has essentially run the city after legislation passed in 2002 that mandated the state to take over much of the city's finances. The authority's first building is an almost-ready technology incubator about three blocks from the waterfront in yet another warren of parking lots.
 One of the tenants will be Gestalt, a technology planning and software business that concentrates on military contracts. While William Loftus, the company's chief executive, waits for new offices, he supervises his 50 employees in a shared space at the L3 company's building nearby.
 ''You want to pick the up-and-coming place and be there first, rather than to be going where everyone goes and be the last in line,'' Mr. Loftus said. 
 He said that his company is mostly made up of highly educated employees, and he wants to draw from both the Princeton area and Philadelphia, so Camden seemed like a good central location. Still, Mr. Fuentes worries that not many shovels are turning, either at the waterfront or anywhere else in the city.
 ''There are water pipes still being used that are made of wood in South Camden, things like that,'' he said. ''If everything were moving at the waterfront, at least you would feel that progress might be coming to the neighborhoods, too.''

HEADLINE: Way North of the Border

BYLINE: By SUSAN WARNER

DATELINE: BRIDGETON 

 BODY:
NOE and his wife, Yolanda, crept over the border from Mexico through Texas in a car six years ago, bound for work in the tomato and blueberry fields of New Jersey. Noe would have liked to stay in Texas because it was closer to home, but the North beckoned.
 ''There's more money the more north you go,'' he said. ''Mexicans will go to the farthest place in the world, if they can make more money.''
Noe, 28, and Yolanda, 27, now have two small sons. Noe has worked his way up from the fields to factory jobs, including a stint in a turkey processing plant.
 He learned English, and now works in construction. Someday, he hopes, he will own a construction company. 
 Noe also dreams of going back home to visit, but that is just a dream. 
 ''I cannot go to Mexico, I would never be able to come back,'' he said over a Sunday dinner of tacos and beans at Tacos Bravos, a roadside restaurant in this Cumberland County city that is filled with Mexican songs on the jukebox. Noe and Yolanda, who would not give their last names, are among the surging population of Mexicans living and working in New Jersey illegally.
 As Mexican immigrants, legal and illegal, became bolder and more emphatic in their demands for inclusion in American society at rallies nationwide this spring, the current debate over a national immigration policy has increasing importance in New Jersey.
 Mexicans now make up about 20 percent of the state's estimated population of 355,000 illegal aliens, up from about 10 percent in 2000, according to the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington. In 1990, the number of Mexicans living illegally in the state was negligible, said Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior research associate at the center. Now New Jersey ranks eighth in the nation in the number of residents born in Mexico, he said, and about 75,000 are illegal immigrants.
 ''We have seen a huge increase,'' said Daniel Santo Pietro, executive director of the Hispanic Directors Association of New Jersey, a nonprofit umbrella organization of Latino social service groups. ''New Jersey is now a magnet because it does offer some very good work opportunities.''
 For decades, New Jersey drew migrant farmworkers from Mexico, Puerto Rico and Central America. Many worked summers, illegally or in guest worker programs, then returned home in the winter after the crops were harvested.
 After the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, control over the border with Mexico was tightened, forcing Mexican workers to choose between the two countries. As a result, more Mexicans are making New Jersey a year-round home, working in a range of businesses that includes restaurants, hotels, food-processing factories and construction.
 ''What's happened with Mexicans, specifically, is they have diversified remarkably around the United States,'' Mr. Passel said. He said a recession in California in the early 1990's forced Mexican workers to look to other parts of the country for opportunity.
 At the same time, anti-immigrant sentiment was growing in California, said Douglas S. Massey, a professor of sociology at Princeton University. Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot proposal that would have denied social services and public education to illegal aliens, was approved by 59 percent of the voters, but was ultimately overturned in the courts. 
 ''California has ceased to be the overwhelming destination,'' Professor Massey said. ''Now Mexicans are going to places all over the country, and many of these places have never experienced Mexican immigrants before.''
 From 1985 to 1990, two-thirds of all Mexican immigrants settled in California, Professor Massey said, but from 1995 to 2005, that figure dropped to one-third.
 Jose, another illegal Mexican immigrant in Bridgeton who would not give his last name, said he worked in California for five years before moving to New Jersey seven years ago to work in the produce business. ''Not so many people are going to California,'' he said. ''They are going to all places.''

The New York Gateway
 In New Jersey, the number of Mexican immigrants more than quadrupled in five counties during the 1990's, according to the State Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Cumberland had an increase of 560 percent, Ocean 474 percent, Atlantic 401 percent, Monmouth 363 percent and Middlesex 335 percent. Four counties -- Passaic, Middlesex, Hudson and Monmouth -- are home to a total of 53.6 percent of the Mexican immigrants in the state, according to the 2000 census.
 New York City has increasingly become a gateway for Mexicans, creating an overflow into New Jersey, Professor Massey said.
 New Jersey, in effect, has two distinct Mexican immigrant populations, he said. In the north, there is an urban group with ties to New York City, including a large number of Mexican natives in Paterson. More recently, Mexicans have arrived in the central and southern parts of the state, in rural and suburban areas where demand for low-wage workers is high.
 In Ocean, Monmouth and Morris Counties, disputes have developed between Mexican immigrant day laborers and municipalities seeking to restrict people from gathering at street corners and parking lots to wait for employers to pick them up. Here in Cumberland County, second- and third-generation Mexican-Americans, whose predecessors initially came to work in the fields, have begun to put down roots and are attracting new immigrants to live and work in a community filled with Mexican culture.
 At Casa Sosa, a variety store on Commerce Street in downtown Bridgeton, the owner, Praxedis Sosa, caters to the newcomers. He sells phone cards and money orders, hats with the insignias of Mexican soccer teams, Mexican DVD's, straw sombreros, blue jeans and cowboy boots.
 Mr. Sosa arrived from Mexico 30 years ago, worked in warehouses in Brooklyn and eventually won United States citizenship in an amnesty program. Three years ago, he opened the store. ''There are so many people coming, but there are problems with the government,'' he said. ''I don't know why. Mexicans are doing the jobs in New Jersey that nobody wants to do.''

A Source of Tension
 But Frank Shallis, who owns a small elevator-repair and manufacturing firm in Bound Brook, sees New Jersey's rising Mexican population as a huge problem.
 Mr. Shallis is state coordinator of the New Jersey chapter of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, which conducts volunteer patrols of the country's borders with Mexico and Canada. He has already done a stint on the Canadian border and is planning a trip to the Arizona border to try to keep Mexicans from entering the United States illegally. ''In New Jersey there are Mexicans everywhere you look,'' Mr. Shallis said. ''It's adding so much to the cost of everything -- schooling, medical, social services. It's just unfair to law-abiding, tax-paying American citizens.''
 Frank Argote-Freyre, a member of the Hispanic Directors Association from Monmouth County, who negotiated a dispute over where immigrants seeking day work could gather in Freehold, said the tensions were rooted in a failed national immigration policy that looks the other way when employers need workers, then denies immigrants legal protection.
 ''There is inertia in Congress, and cowardliness in Congress,'' he said. ''The lack of responsibility in establishing an immigration policy has led us to these problems. Obviously, industry wants these workers. So to target them is just wrong. It's narrow-minded, and the reason a lot of local municipalities have injected themselves into these problems is a total lack of leadership in Washington.''
 Deborah Dowdell, president of the New Jersey Restaurant Association, a trade group, said its members rely on Mexican workers because the state's population of young people, a traditional source of restaurant workers, is not keeping pace with rising demand. The need for restaurant employees is growing one and a half times faster than the work force as a whole, she said.
 ''We're constantly battling these challenges,'' Ms. Dowdell said, ''and immigration is one of the ways in which the industry hopes to have access to workers.''
 By law, employers are required to make a good-faith effort to document that workers have proper papers, said Keith Talbot, senior attorney here in Bridgeton with the Farmworker Project, a program run by Legal Services of New Jersey. But many illegal immigrants have fake documents, he said.
 ''We have created an off-the-books culture,'' Mr. Talbot said.
 The growing number of illegal immigrants has also contributed to an increase in complaints that employers are refusing to pay workers, he said. Many employers are using subcontractors, particularly in the construction industry, to hire illegal workers, believing it will shield them from penalties for wage and hour regulations.
 Some subcontractors, he said, withhold payment from illegal workers because they think the workers are afraid to challenge employers and risk deportation. ''When workers don't get paid, that really riles them,'' Mr. Talbot said. ''That's when they come forward and approach legal services, more than any other complaints, including housing or discrimination.''
 He cited the case of a Mexican immigrant, whose immigration case is pending, who won a $2,000 settlement for unpaid construction wages and has been waiting for more than a year to be paid.
 Though some illegal immigrants from Mexico have been moving up the ladder from field work to landscaping to jobs in construction, they are generally not making the leap to home ownership or starting their own businesses as easily as immigrants who came to the United States legally. Their legal status keeps them from receiving bank loans and other government approvals for businesses, said Mr. Passel of the Pew Center.
 ''If you're undocumented, it's hard,'' he said. ''There are some financial institutions that seem to be developing ways to make home loans to undocumented immigrants, but that's a new phenomenon.''
 He said that nearly all men who have come to the United States illegally from Mexico have jobs that withhold taxes and Social Security based on fake Social Security documents. An estimated $5 billion to $6 billion a year is being withheld from their wages, he said.
 In New Jersey, Assemblyman Joseph Vas is trying to give illegal immigrants some status with a proposed Driving Privilege Card. The card would require applicants to pass a written exam and driving test, but could not be used as a form of primary identification.
 Mr. Santo Pietro, of the Hispanic Directors Association of New Jersey, said that Latino advocates began calling for a driving card, like those available in 11 other states, to prevent accidents. A Mexican woman was killed in Freehold while walking to work along a busy highway because she could not get her driver's license renewed, he said.
 Mr. Vas said the card could help prevent similar cases.
 ''There are increasing numbers of unlicensed drivers on the road, and it's a problem that is leading to unsafe conditions,'' he said. ''In my opinion, this is the morally correct thing, in light of what these people are providing in contributions to our economy.''

Living Here in Limbo
 The rise in illegal immigrants is creating a new generation of New Jersey residents who came to the state from Mexico as children but turn into undocumented adults at age 21. Though they had no say in the decision to live in the United States, they are in a legal limbo.
 Mr. Passel said that about two-thirds of the children of illegal immigrants from Mexico are born in the United States and are citizens. But they often fail to apply for services to which they may be entitled, for fear of drawing attention to their parents' status. 
 For many, it is easier to remain under the radar than to risk exposing family members to legal hassles and, possibly, deportation.
 For the one in three children of illegal immigrants who were born in Mexico and then brought here, life is more complicated. They remain noncitizens, and although they can attend school and receive medical care at hospitals, when they reach 21 they run into the same problems that confront their parents. 
 ''They've played by the rules, they've gone to school and grown up in the United States, but after they graduate they're still undocumented immigrants,'' said Mr. Passel, who estimated that 65,000 children of illegal Mexican immigrants to the United States become undocumented adults each year.'
 Marisol Conde-Hernandez, 19, is among them. Her parents brought her to New Jersey when she was just 18 months old, and the family settled near Princeton. Her grandfather had come ahead and worked in the fields to raise money to bring her family to the United States. Later, her grandfather and father, and eventually Marisol, worked in restaurants owned by Greek immigrants.
 ''I knew I was undocumented, and my parents knew not to tell anybody,'' she said. ''But I was always different. If I got sick I had to go to the emergency room. We didn't have a private doctor.''
 One year she was invited to attend a summer program at Princeton University, but she could not go because the application required her parents' Social Security numbers. 
 Now Ms. Conde-Hernandez is a student at Middlesex County College in Edison, where she is studying sociology with the hope of becoming a lawyer. 
 ''All I want to do is go to school and pay taxes,'' Ms. Conde-Hernandez said. ''I want to get a tax return. I want to be able to drive, and I want to work. I want to get everything straight. I'm so tired of living under the table.''

HEADLINE: Speaking in (Many) Tongues Can Be Profitable

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WANTED, and in many instances urgently needed: translators and interpreters of numerous languages into English. Opportunities especially good in New York and other cities with large and highly varied immigrant populations. And in government agencies where certain Middle Eastern and Asian languages have surged in priority in the post 9/11 world.
 That, labor market and other experts say, sums up the outlook in the United States today for translators and interpreters, professions that have grown sharply since the 2001 terrorist attacks, though not solely in response to them. And with the routes into these specialties diverse -- they all require a mastery of English and at least one other language, but there is no single form of certification in the country -- people can enter them with varied educational backgrounds. 
Take, for example, Ethel Ugbebor, the founder and owner of the Universal Language Corporation in Rego Park, Queens. Her company's stable of more than 60 interpreters and translators can render 28 languages into English, including some once considered peripheral to American interests but nowadays crucial, like Pashto and Dari, major languages in Afghanistan; Farsi, spoken in Iran; and Urdu, one of Pakistan's languages. The company's clients include the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
 But such a career was not on Ms. Ugbebor's radar when she came to New York from Nigeria in 1988. She arrived to pursue a master's degree in chemistry at City College, having been employed for a decade at Nigeria's food and drug agency. 
 She was working as a part-time receptionist at the Nigerian Consulate in Manhattan while at City College when she fielded a phone call in 1990 from Federal District Court in Brooklyn, which was seeking an interpreter for a Nigerian drug-trafficking defendant who understood only Ibo, one of Nigeria's major languages. 
 Thus began her trajectory from irregular $250-a-day courthouse stints to heading a company with $1 million in revenue last year. But more about that later.
 Although many people call anyone who renders one language into another a translator, practitioners reserve that word for people who convert written material in one language into written material in another, or speech in one language into a transcript in another. They refer to those who convert speech in one language into speech in another as interpreters.
 The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics says there were 31,000 translator and interpreter jobs in the country in 2004, up 40 percent since 2000, and estimates a further increase to 37,000, or 20 percent more, in 2014. (The bureau notes that the number of people in the business is ''probably significantly higher'' because many work part time.) The average full-time salary in 2004 was $38,000, with those employed by federal agencies averaging more than $70,000. About 2,000 of the jobs in 2004 were in New York State and about 500 in New Jersey and Connecticut.
 But Kevin Hendzel, a spokesman for the American Translators Association, which represents about 8,000 translators and interpreters, predicted even sharper future growth, ''based on the current demand.'' Aside from a severe shortage in ''national security languages,'' among them Arabic, Farsi, Pashto and Dari, the demand, he said, is being driven by, globalization and by the need for interpreters in hospitals and courtrooms. The need at hospitals has been made more acute by a 2000 requirement that institutions receiving federal aid provide more effective service to people lacking English proficiency, he said.
 As for Ms. Ugbebor, 54, she received her master's in chemistry in 1993, but has not worked as a chemist since then. Her courthouse work with defendants speaking Ibo and Yoruba, another major Nigerian language, led her supervisor at the court to refer her to the F.B.I. and D.E.A., for which, after getting security clearances, she translated secretly recorded conversations in drug-trafficking investigations involving Nigerians. In 1993, she said, she earned $100,000 from that and her court work.
 Her company's growth, she said, has more recently been aided by guidance from the federal Small Business Administration and a larger company, Comprehensive Technologies International, which also provides translation services and for which she is a subcontractor. Ms. Ugbebor said that early on, she was concerned that working as an interpreter and translator would not provide as much long-term security as a career in chemistry. ''But I took the risk,'' she said, ''and it paid off.''

HEADLINE: In Baldwin, It's Revival for Some, Survival for Others

BYLINE: By RICHARD KORMAN

DATELINE: Baldwin 

 BODY:
LOOK behind the timeworn empty storefronts to see the signs of family life on the west side of Grand Avenue near the corner of Merrick Road. 
 Down an alley between the shops is an open door, and just inside are mailboxes for the Baez and Gonzales families. Across the alley, behind an empty shop with a shredded awning, is a patch of lawn with a red infant swing hanging from a tree branch.
 To Nerys Mendes, a 33-year-old mother from the Dominican Republic who has been living in a modest $975-a-month one-bedroom apartment off the alley for eight years, it is not ''the best place in the world,'' but the local schools are good, one of her children works nearby, and she wants to stay. 
 To the Town of Hempstead and many homeowners in Baldwin, though, the northwest corner of Merrick and Grand is an eyesore and a breeding ground for crime. The town wants the corner to be redeveloped with upscale shops and a new home for the old Nunley's Carousel. 
 That means using the town's eminent-domain power to condemn the properties, displacing several thriving businesses and the tenants of 47 apartments, and then turning the seized land over to private developers -- a practice that has caused controversy in other communities. 
 And to some critics, it raises the question of whether the purpose is to clear Baldwin of unwelcome old buildings, or unwelcome new people.
 Either issue has the potential to tie up the project, which is still in the planning stage, in protracted, politically sensitive court battles. 
 ''Hempstead wouldn't want to get into a situation with enormous controversy, because there may be endless litigation,'' said Thomas W. Merrill, a law professor at Columbia University who follows land-use issues. When property owners in a depressed section of New London, Conn., fought the town's attempt to condemn their neighborhood and turn it over to private developers, the dispute, known as the Kelo case, went all the way to the United States Supreme Court on the issue of whether such a project served a legitimate public purpose. 
 Though the court ruled in the town's favor, the project drew so much popular criticism that the governor of Connecticut decided not to order evictions. Since then, several states have begun adopting new restrictions on their use of eminent domain. 
 Condemnation and eminent domain, intended originally for obtaining land for public uses like roads and parks, have been part of the urban renewal toolkit for many years. Older suburbs like Nassau County have begun using it to try to eradicate social problems by, for example, seizing hotels and apartment buildings used for drug dealing or prostitution. In those cases the seizing government has no need for the property, but simply wants to change its ownership and use. 
 Housing experts and property-rights advocates say New York State's eminent domain law is broad, and regularly used by towns to seize property and resell it to developers. The Hempstead town supervisor, Kate Murray, said that the Baldwin plan relied on ''a very traditional basis for condemnation that existed prior to the Kelo case,'' that is, combating blight. 
 Baldwin's downtown area, where traffic roars along Merrick Road, has posed a particularly challenging problem for the town and Nassau County. As in many other villages, competition from malls and big-box retailers has drawn away shoppers and shop owners. But unincorporated Baldwin has also suffered from its location between two incorporated villages, Rockville Centre to the west and Freeport to the east. 
 Rockville Centre is considerably more affluent than Baldwin, and major retail chains looking for a location in the area have tended to choose Rockville Centre first. Freeport, meanwhile, though mainly lower on the income scale and more ethnically diverse than Baldwin, has seen a recent revival of its upscale district near the bayfront. 
 ''Rockville Centre has 60 nice restaurants, and Freeport has its Nautical Mile,'' said Joseph Scannell, the Democratic county legislator from Baldwin.
 The departure of a big bridal shop from the corner of Grand and Merrick about two years ago accelerated a business exodus in the area, Ms. Murray said. ''Since then, there is a precipitous decline, and it feeds off itself and becomes less and less attractive,'' she said. ''It's a domino effect.''
 The town and county tried to halt the fall of the dominoes by spending money to spruce up building facades and sidewalks, but to little avail. None of the owners of buildings on the west side of Grand Avenue showed up for meetings with town officials to hear about incentives to make improvements, Mr. Scannell said. 
 So the town hired a planning and consulting firm, Saccardi & Schiff, to conduct a ''blight study'' of the corner last year, and adopted its report on March 7, opening the way for the condemnation plan. 
 The carousel, the centerpiece of what town and county officials envision for the corner, was operated for decades at a site on Sunrise Highway, and is now in storage. Nunley's Carousel lives in many an idyllic memory of childhood in Baldwin. 
 The carousel was briefly the subject of a political tug of war last year when the singer Billy Joel suggested setting it up in Oyster Bay. Mr. Scannell threatened to defect to the Republicans and tip the balance in the Legislature when the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, a fellow Democrat, showed interest in the idea; it has since been shelved. 
 Now, Mr. Scannell said, the carousel can be used as a magnet for a revived downtown Baldwin. ''We want to have our nice carousel corner,'' he said, adding that the project ''will really help our identity.''
 Town officials are conducting appraisals and doing the legal groundwork to condemn an area reaching from the corner of Merrick and Grand almost all the way to Gale Avenue to the west and Prospect Street to the north. The town will then seek proposals from developers to use the land, along with the existing town parking field behind the stores, to install the carousel and build new retail stores. The process will take at least 18 months before construction can begin. 
 Some Baldwin homeowners say they can't wait. 
 ''I'm thrilled that they would take this all down and create a place for Nunley's,'' Bill Pepino, 47, a lifelong Baldwinite, said about the corner. ''I'll take my kids here, and they'll take their kids here.''
 Unmentioned by elected officials, though, is the social and ethnic dimensions to the project. The plan would sweep away the Hispanic immigrants and others who rent the apartments in the block and who patronize the businesses there, including two delicatessens, a hair salon (''Hola Latinas,'' says a sign in the window), a psychic palm reader and a bright blue nightclub called the Mambo Cafe. Another shop, Bonao Centro Corporation, offers ''envios, llamadas y mas'' (messages, calls and more).
 Homeowners and business people in the rest of Baldwin are generally careful to say that they respect hard-working immigrants, whether legal or illegal, and bear them no malice. But it is not hard to detect a grating irritation with the immigrants' presence as well, and a belief that increased crime and economic decline follow on their heels. 
 What happens on the sidewalk and parking lot outside the shops on Grand Avenue strikes some Baldwinites as an unwelcome intrusion of city atmosphere into their suburban town. In summer, they say, some tenants of the block seek refuge from steamy apartments by sitting on beach chairs on the sidewalks outside. On a warm spring afternoon recently, nine young men were sipping beer behind one of the delis.
 A week earlier, on a much cooler day, a gaunt man in a wool cap towed a couple of toddlers up the Grand Avenue sidewalk, one of them a girl in a pink jacket holding a floppy-armed doll. As they made their way, a cigarette butt came arcing from an apartment window overhead, almost hitting the girl. The man, full of outrage, shouted a vulgarity-laced threat of a broken jaw up at the window and whoever was inside.
 Occasionally, more serious trouble breaks out. On Feb. 25, the Nassau police arrested a man for assault at a Grand Avenue nightclub called Papa Doc's, within the area slated for redevelopment, after a fight involving baseball bats broke out at the club at 4 a.m. The police said the man admitted to being a member of MS-13, a well-known violent gang with origins in Central America. 
 ''I didn't realize I had bought a business in Roosevelt or South Hempstead,'' Joe Curet, the owner of a deli at 753 Merrick Road, just outside the redevelopment area, said sarcastically, as he described the host of police cars he saw outside Papa Doc's after the fight. 
 Ms. Mendes said that in the last few months, she had twice heard shots fired at night. She said the presence of the night clubs was to blame for the crime problems. 
 Mr. Curet, who bought the deli last year, said the disappearance of other businesses from the block had cut into his cash flow by taking away workers who would stop in for lunch or coffee. 
 The frowsy, unkempt facades in the redevelopment area stand in contrast to the smartened-up buildings and sidewalks just across the street on Grand Avenue, where the town shared the cost of facade repairs with the owners of a bowling alley and other buildings, and on Merrick Road, where the town trimmed new sidewalks with red brick and installed Victorian-style street lamps.
 The true condition of the threatened buildings is also a mixed picture. The town's blight study found that only 2 of the 38 properties were in poor condition; 27 were rated fair and 9 good. Two of the biggest remaining businesses in the block have well-maintained buildings: Baldwin Kitchen and Bath Designs and the Fullerton Funeral Home, whose driveway is freshly paved. 
 Howard Gainsburg, who has operated the kitchen and bath business at its present location since 1975, said he favors the redevelopment project and understands why it is needed. But he is worried about finding another site to match his current building, with several thousand square feet of space for an an assembly shop right next to a retail showroom. 
 ''I wanted it cleaned up,'' he said of the immediate area. ''I just didn't feel my building was one of the reasons it had to be cleaned up.'' When he is relocated, he said, ''I would like to be made whole.''
 The funeral home's owners did not respond to requests for comment. 
 However attractive new store buildings and the carousel may be, concerns about crime are the main reason local home- and shopowners offer for favoring the project. 
 James Cunneen, 73, a former Marine, said that he, ''a tall guy who has walked the streets of Manhattan since I was 18,'' nonetheless steers clear of the parking area behind the shops on his way to the Baldwin Public Library, even though that makes his walk a bit longer.
 Deputy Inspector Rick Capece, who commands the Nassau police's First Precinct, said problems in the area have been related to assaults and drug activity. Though the violence has been minimal, he said, ''it's not like you are taking a piece of real estate where nothing has happened.'' 
 For Ms. Mendes, the 33-year-old Dominican immigrant, the threat of being displaced from her home, along with her husband and two teenage daughters, has been looming for some time.
 ''They said something about this three or four years ago, and we've got to see if it's serious this time,'' she said. ''We don't know what to expect now. I'm so upset, because they aren't thinking of the people who live here.''
 Ms. Murray, the Hempstead supervisor, said the town would help displaced tenants and businesses find new homes, though she did not say whether those homes would be in Baldwin or elsewhere. Ms. Murray expressed optimism that the relocations would be done humanely. 
 For the businesses in the area that cater to the tenants, the revitalization project makes little sense.
 Francisco Lopez, the manager of Andy's Mini Market on Grand Avenue, said he does not see any urgent need to empty and raze the storefronts in the block. 
 As he spoke with a reporter, he was interrupted repeatedly by local people stopping in to buy meals and snacks. The hot buffet table in the deli draws plenty of customers, Mr. Lopez said, especially in the morning when residents head for work.
 To Mr. Lopez, the redevelopment plan seems unfair.
 ''We bought the store, the refrigerators, we fixed the kitchen, and every night before we go, we sweep in front,'' he said. 
 Shown the photos of cracked walls and forlorn store signs featured in the Town of Hempstead's blight study, he said, ''They've got the worst pictures, but they don't show the good stuff.''

HEADLINE: Outgrowing Jane Jacobs

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
TIME passes. Jane Jacobs, the great lover of cities who stared down Robert Moses' bulldozers and saved many of New York's most precious neighborhoods, died last week at 89. It is a loss for those who value urban life. But her death may also give us permission to move on, to let go of the obsessive belief that Ms. Jacobs held the answer to every evil that faces the contemporary city.
 For New Yorkers, Ms. Jacobs's life remains suspended between two seismic events: The publication, in 1961, of ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'' and her showdown in the late 60's with Mr. Moses over a proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway that would have reduced much of SoHo's handsome cast-iron district to rubble. The expressway was killed by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1969. 
By then, Ms. Jacobs had fled for Toronto, and Mr. Moses, who died in 1981, had lost much of his power and prestige. But in the popular imagination, the two are forever at odds: the imperious city planning czar versus the tireless public advocate. Today, the pendulum of opinion has swung so far in favor of Ms. Jacobs that it has distorted the public's understanding of urban planning. As we mourn her death, we may want to mourn a bit for Mr. Moses as well.
 Her argument was simple enough, radically so. Horrified at the tabula rasa urban renewal strategies of the 1950's, she argued for a return to the small-scale city she found in Greenwich Village and the North End of Boston -- the lively street life of front stoops, corner shops and casual personal interaction.
 Mr. Moses, tellingly, once dismissed her and her ilk as ''nobody but a bunch of mothers.'' He was partly right. By standing up for the intricate, individual relationships that define the inner life of cities, she allowed a generation to challenge the authority of patronizing -- and uniformly male -- city planners in gray suits.
 An urban flaneur of the first order, she reminded us that cities could only be fully understood with our eyes, feet and ears -- not from the distant abstraction of architectural drawings.
 But the problems of the 20th-century city were vast and complicated. Ms. Jacobs had few answers for suburban sprawl or the nation's dependence on cars, which remains critical to the development of American cities. She could not see that the same freeway that isolated her beloved, working-class North End from downtown Boston also protected it from gentrification. And she never understood cities like Los Angeles, whose beauty stems from the heroic scale of its freeways and its strange interweaving of man-made and natural environments.
 The threats facing the contemporary city are not what they were when she first formed her ideas, now nearly 50 years ago. The activists of Ms. Jacobs's generation may have saved SoHo from Mr. Moses' bulldozers, but they could not stop it from becoming an open-air mall. 
 The old buildings are still there, the streets are once again paved in cobblestone, but the rich mix of manufacturers, artists and gallery owners has been replaced by homogenous crowds of lemming-like shoppers. Nothing is produced there any more. It is a corner of the city that is nearly as soulless, in its way, as the superblocks that Ms. Jacobs so reviled.
 Nor did Ms. Jacobs really offer an adequate long-term solution for the boom in urban population, which cannot be solved simply through incremental growth in existing neighborhoods. 
 Just as cities change, so do our perceptions of them. Architects now in their mid-40's -- Ms. Jacobs's age when she published ''Death and Life'' -- do not share their parents' unqualified hatred of Modernist developments. 
 They understand that an endless grid of brick towers and barren plazas is dehumanizing. But on an urban island packed with visual noise, the plaza at Lincoln Center -- or even at the old World Trade Center -- can be a welcome contrast in scale, a moment of haunting silence amid the chaos. Similarly, the shimmering glass towers that frame lower Park Avenue are awe-inspiring precisely because they offer a sharp contrast to the quiet tree-lined streets of the Upper East Side.
 Perhaps her legacy has been most damaged by those who continue to treat ''Death and Life'' as sacred text rather than as what it was: a heroic cri de coeur. Of those, the New Urbanists are the most guilty; in many cases, they reduced her vision of corner shops and busy streets to a superficial town formula that creates the illusion of urban diversity, but masks a stifling uniformity at its core.
 This is true in large-scale projects as diverse as Battery Park City or Celebration, Fla., where narrow streets and parks were supposed to create an immediate sense of community. As it turns out, what the New Urbanists could not reproduce was the most critical aspect of Ms. Jacobs's vision, the intimate neighborhood that is built -- brick by brick, family by family -- over a century.
 For those who could not see it, the hollowness of this urban planning strategy was finally exposed in New Orleans, where planners were tarting up historic districts for tourists, even as deeper social problems were being ignored and its infrastructure was crumbling. 
 The answer to such superficiality is not to resurrect the spirit of Robert Moses. But in retrospect his vision, however flawed, represented an America that still believed a healthy government would provide the infrastructure -- roads, parks, bridges -- that binds us into a nation. Ms. Jacobs, at her best, was fighting to preserve the more delicate bonds that tie us to a community. A city, to survive and flourish, needs both perspectives.
 The lesson we should take from Ms. Jacobs was her ability to look at the city with her eyes wide open, without rigid prejudices. Maybe we should see where that lesson leads next.

A Tree Grows in Wainscott
 Mitchell Kriegman, the visionary behind children's television shows like ''Clarissa Explains It All'' and ''Bear in the Big Blue House,'' knows it's a jungle out there. Which may be why his latest PBS series, ''It's a Big Big World,'' the first product of his new digital production studio in Wainscott, is set in a rain forest.
Or more specifically, on what Mr. Kriegman calls a world tree. 
 From a distance, the tree looks like any other. But close up, it is a tangle of branches and leaves, nooks and crannies, teeming with habitats for the menagerie of animals calling it home.
 The residents include Snook, a peppy giant sloth; a pair of rambunctious marmoset siblings named Smooch and Winslow; an eager-to-please singing tree frog called Wartz; Madge, an ancient turtle with a map of the world on her back; and Burdette, a bird who knows it all, or thinks she does.
 Each has something educational to offer, in keeping with the show's emphasis on science and geography appropriate for the absorbent minds of young viewers. The characters are created through a process called shadowmation, which integrates bunraku-style team puppetry and computer graphics.
 ''We have developed characters that have real hands and are articulated beyond what Pooh could do,'' Mr. Kriegman said, referring to ''The Book of Pooh,'' another series he produced. ''These characters have a lot more character.''
 Mr. Kriegman, who moved to Wainscott with his family in 2003, decided to build a 10,000-square-foot studio there last year after three decades of working his magic in Manhattan.
 He said the decision was spurred by both economic and technical necessity.
 ''I was in the city full time, and I really wanted to use this shadowmation process,'' Mr. Kriegman said, ''but each time we had a production, we had to shut it down.'' The circuitry in his old-fashioned West Village studio could not handle the load.
 ''So I decided to move full time,'' Mr. Kriegman said. ''And now I have a studio three or four times the size of that one, at about a quarter of the cost.''
 The building, called Wainscott Studios, has two stages; the larger has 4,000 square feet of floor space under 56-foot ceilings, and uses a 3-D program called Brainstorm that helps bring the puppet characters to life.
 Mr. Kriegman, who writes the scripts for ''Big World,'' employs 7 people year-round and as many as 70 from September through April, when the show is in production. Forty episodes of the show have been ordered. After its debut in January, the program ranked among the 10 most popular for preschoolers. 
 Mr. Kriegman's own children are far beyond the target age group, he said, but they still inspire the show in mysterious ways.
 ''It's really funny, because I was in my daughter's classroom when I was developing the show,'' he said. ''I kept looking at pictures of rain forest animals in her room and thinking what great characters they were, and wondering what their personalities would be like. And then I thought, 'What am I doing?' 
 ''Well, this is what I was doing.'' 

Asking for More in Bellport
 It's not exactly a mass influx. Nevertheless, the population of Bellport will increase by five Broadway performers when the Gateway Playhouse opens its 2006 season on May 10 with a production of the musical ''Oliver!'' 
 The experienced cast includes Michael J. Farina (''42nd Street''), Melinda Tanner (''The Robber Bridegroom''), Michael Hayward-Jones (''Me and My Girl''), Dan Cooney (''Kiss Me, Kate'') and Raul Aranas (''Miss Saigon''). 
 They will sing and dance their way through family-friendly numbers like ''Consider Yourself'' on a new multilevel set based on a Victorian puzzle box. The set was conceived by Kelly Tighe, the Gateway's scenic designer.
 ''Oliver!'' runs through June 3, with school performances on May 18, 24 and 26. Tickets: $36 to $42; $25 for children 12 or younger. Information: (631) 286-1133 or go to www.gatewayplayhouse.com.

HEADLINE: The Lesson of the Lobsters 

 BODY:
It may be difficult for the imagination to grasp how a lobster and a mosquito are the same, especially when you try to picture the latter steamed and dipped in melted butter. But if you remember that both are arthropods -- having exoskeletons and segmented bodies, among other things -- and that immense populations of both were destroyed in this region in September 1999, a time that happens to coincide with the widespread aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion to combat the West Nile virus, a lightbulb may go off. 
 Were the lobsters chemically slaughtered, or was that just a coincidence? We may never know for sure, because a lawsuit filed on behalf of Long Island Sound's commercial lobster fishermen was settled this month. The lobstermen had sued the manufacturer of a pesticide called Fyfanon, whose active ingredient is malathion, charging that the spraying of Fyfanon in New York City and on Long Island, followed by hurricane-induced runoff into western Long Island Sound, was the main cause of the 1999 lobster massacre.
The die-off was sudden -- it took a matter of days -- but overwhelming. Hundreds of fishermen lost their livelihoods almost overnight. The lobster population has not recovered; the annual yield is now about one million pounds, down from six million in the late 1990's.
 Just before the trial was to begin, Cheminova, the New Jersey company that makes Fyfanon, agreed to pay the lobstermen $12.5 million, while admitting no responsibility for the lobsters' fate. Although the plaintiffs may have wished for more, environmental lawyers say they were lucky to get what they did, since the obstacles to winning their case in court were daunting. 
 The lawyers for the lobstermen would have had to place pinpoint blame on only one chemical as the murder weapon. That would have meant ruling out a depressing array of other plausible causes, like unusually warm water (lobsters like the New England chill, and Long Island Sound is already the southern limit of their natural range), oxygen depletion, parasites and other pollutants. The shocking speed of the lobsters' deaths may have been circumstantially compelling, but the law requires definitive conclusions, which current science cannot provide.
 The lobstermen will be compensated, but others of us who also care about the health of Long Island Sound are left to wonder what light the trial might have shone on the chemical dangers faced by the creatures who live in and around it. We may simply have to settle for a vivid reminder of something we should have already known: that Long Island Sound is a habitat stressed to its limits, and that our dim-witted actions on land can have far-ranging consequences on the water. Few people before 1999 would have thought to consider the possible connection between mosquitoes in suburban backyards and unemployed lobstermen, but many more will now.
 Another piece of good news is that a small part of the settlement, $100,000, is being donated to the Lobster Institute at the University of Maine, which first raised the possibility of the pesticide link in the die-off, for research into the Long Island Sound lobster fishery. The more we understand these delicious bug-eyed creatures, the better off they -- and their precious, threatened habitat -- will be.

HEADLINE: The Bell Tolls For the Future Merry Widow

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
MEN are catching up to women in the life expectancy game; the National Center for Health Statistics reports this month that the gap between them has shrunk to five years, the narrowest since 1946. If current trends continue, in 50 years men and women will live the same length of time. 
 This is better news for men than for women, if you believe some economists and therapists. It's not just the extra years; it's all those extra meals to prepare. 
By necessity, women have gotten used to a life lived for long periods without men. They have had the advantage in life expectancy since the late 19th century, when overall longevity started to climb. More than men, women have developed strong friendships to support them in their frailest hours. They have forced doctors to pay attention to their health concerns. They no longer have to cater to men. Travel companies now cater to their interests.
 ''Women don't need men as much as men need women,'' said John Gray, the therapist and author of, most famously, ''Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.''
 But for all that, consider how women would be better off. 
 Men living longer means women are less likely to suffer the fate that Miranda from ''Sex and the City'' so feared: dying alone with only the cat to rake over her rotting bones. With the existing gap, women are more likely than men to be widowed -- 71 percent of people over the age of 85 are women, and the majority of them will have been married. And being alone increases their risk of dying or getting sick. No one is there to help when they fall; they eat less, and poorly.
 ''Even given the limited capacity of men, having a surviving spouse is going to mean that women do not go as early to nursing homes when they have chronic illnesses,'' said Ronald D. Lee, an economist and the director of the Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging at the University of California, Berkeley.
 And a shorter widowhood means women will be better off financially, largely because, as Heidi Hartmann, a labor economist and the president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, said, ''Money attaches to the men.'' 
 Men, typically the higher wage earners, get bigger Social Security checks. And if the couple is living on his checks alone, she gets less when he dies. The surviving spouse's cost of living is about 80 percent what the couple's was, economists estimate, but the Social Security payments decline to about 65 percent.
 Men are much more likely to have pensions, too, leaving women dependent on them, and one-third of men, Ms. Hartmann said, do not leave theirs to their wives. (That number used to be higher, she said, until wives were required to sign off on the deal.)
 But men and women growing old together is not always easy. 
 ''Men have this expectation that women should take care of them,'' Dr. Gray said. ''And she has her own expectations, that she should be there for him.''
 Particularly after retirement, she is not used to having him around quite so much. ''It's different taking care of him for dinner, as opposed to him being home all the time, and expecting her to make every meal,'' Dr. Gray said. 
 Though some may object to the assumption that sex roles will be this traditional by 2040, recent studies have shown that among husbands and wives who both work, the woman still does the much larger share of the housework. As one Connecticut woman in her 70's was heard to retort recently when her husband asked if they were ready to move to an assisted-living facility, ''You've had assisted living for 40 years.''
 This dynamic is reflected in the statistics: men are four times as likely as women to remarry after the death of a spouse, experts on aging say. (Men who divorce also remarry faster; within three years, compared with nine for women.) They're looking for love, Dr. Gray said, but they're also looking for lunch.
 Marriage lowers everyone's risk of death, Professor Lee said, but the benefits go mostly to men; women lower their risk only slightly by marrying. Similarly, a man's risk of death increases sharply after the death of a spouse; a wife's does only negligibly.
 ''Women are very helpful for men,'' he said. ''Men are not very helpful for women as spouses.''
 Women not only do fine despite a spouse's death, they may even do better.
 ''In married couples, women tend to be the ones who manage the social sphere,'' said Laura L. Carstensen, a professor of psychology at Stanford University and director of the Life-span Development Laboratory there. ''They're the ones who make dinner plans and invite friends over for weekends. So a man loses a social network, whereas a woman continues to make plans and see people.''
 People have traditionally felt sorry for older widows, thinking they had so few prospects for remarrying, she said. The truth is, they may not want to remarry.
 ''They're the ones taking care of everyone; they've often taken care of a frail husband, and doing it again isn't necessarily appealing.''
 Then there are the disputes over sex. Dr. Gray said a woman's sex drive increases as she ages, while a man's declines. But then, is Viagra upsetting that balance, putting men in retirement homes permanently on the prowl? 
 On that count, at least, things may even out. And that may be true over all.
 ''There is a lot of poverty among older single women, so if men live longer, that's good economically, for women and men,'' Ms. Hartmann said. ''Men are generally happier when they're married. The women may not be happier, but at least they've got more money.''

HEADLINE: Riches That Can't Be Taxed

BYLINE: By John Robben. 
John Robben, a columnist for The Greenwich Time, is the author of ''Particles of Time,'' a collection of essays.

 BODY:
PEOPLE think I'm rich because I live in Greenwich. And I am rich, but not in the way people think. Everyone who lives in Greenwich is rich, or can be, regardless of how much money they have, but there are rich people in Greenwich, and then there are THE rich.
 ''The rich,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald told Ernest Hemingway in their famous exchange, ''are different from you and me.'' ''Yes,'' Hemingway replied, ''they have more money.'' 
Fitzgerald was trying to persuade his friend that there was something different about rich people, but Hemingway would have no part of it. Hemingway believed the only difference between the rich and the poor was in the amount of their money.
 I didn't move to Greenwich because I was rich, nor did I move here hoping it would make me rich. I moved to Greenwich because it was a beautiful place to live. Because it was near the water and close to Manhattan where I worked, had good schools and was well and carefully maintained.
 I wasn't born in Greenwich, nor was my wife, nor any of our five children. But my guess is that the same is now true for many Greenwich residents. We came here looking for a good place to live and a good place to raise our families.
 Most of us can probably look back at our childhood homes with great affection, regardless of the economic status of our parents. Mine were middle class, and during the Great Depression lived through difficult times. My father was out of work for three years, and during that time my mother sustained the family as a waitress at Woolworth.
 But as a child I never felt poor, though obviously in economic terms I was. My parents provided me with life's basic needs but just as importantly showered me with love and approval, and that was rich enough for me.
 Greenwich is unquestionably one of the world's wealthiest communities, and whenever I tell someone that's where I live an eyebrow arches. ''Oh,'' that eyebrow seems to be saying, ''you must have money.'' Well, I DO have money, enough anyway, and because I spent most of my life in Greenwich and have enough money I'm envied. Envy, however, often precludes admiration. But the minute you begin to judge others by the amount of their money, the more faulty is your judgment.
 I grew up in the Bronx, and our lives did not revolve around money. When my father came to watch me play baseball he was giving me something more valuable than his assets, he was giving me his time. And these days when I go to the post office, the drugstore or the barbershop and run into neighbors, I'm meeting more than just the people who live across the street or around the corner, I'm meeting fellow human beings who are sharing a similar planet, whose views I seek and whose stories I listen to, and as a result I feel less alone and more capable of appreciating another day.
 These are the riches of Greenwich, the true ones, and they're available to all of us regardless of where we live. If I feel rich it's not only because I live in Greenwich, but because the values I was brought up with in the Bronx are similar to the ones I'm finding here in our town. And even though there are days when it feels as if I've traveled thousands of miles since my childhood, I realize I've only shifted a few miles north.
 These riches are available to each of us regardless of where we live. If I feel rich it's not only because I live in Greenwich, but also because the gifts my parents endowed me with I still have.

HEADLINE: Iran Strategy: Cold War Echo

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ELAINE SCIOLINO; David E. Sanger reported from Washington for this article, and Elaine Sciolino from Vienna.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29 

 BODY:
Iran and the United States have begun to reveal new strategies in their nuclear dispute that seem bound to escalate their confrontation, as both nations seek to turn to their advantage a highly critical report that portrays a nuclear program proceeding at full tilt, in growing secrecy.
 In many ways, what has unfolded in the past three days resembles cold-war deception and brinkmanship, with some decidedly new twists for a very different nuclear age. As in the early days of the cold war, both sides have tried to write the rules on the fly, using every tool available -- from American threats of sanctions to Iranian threats to cut off oil.
 Iran, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, has been successful in gradually blinding the agency's inspectors, increasingly denying them access to crucial sites and steadfastly refusing to answer questions about suspected links between Iran's civilian nuclear program and its military. 
 While Iran denies any clandestine effort to build a nuclear weapon, it is clearly drawing on the diplomatic playbook of a country that has done just that -- North Korea. Iran has gone so far as to boast about, and perhaps exaggerate, its nuclear prowess to try to convince the West that its program is now unstoppable. 
 Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the chairman of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, and other Iranian officials on Friday described their nuclear program as ''irreversible.'' They argue that the United States should simply accept this -- much as it now accepts that Pakistan and India will never give up nuclear technology. 
 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's fiery president, said Saturday that giving up enrichment ''is our red line, and we will never cross it,'' according to state television.
 In Washington, senior Bush administration officials have taken a position at the opposite extreme. In the words of Robert Joseph, the State Department's top proliferation official, the administration is determined to ensure that ''not one centrifuge spins'' in Iran.
 In interviews in the past two days, the officials have described a plan to turn the United Nations Security Council's ''requests'' that Iran cease enriching uranium into an enforceable requirement. What has chilled the Chinese, the Russians and some others in Europe, however, is that the administration is insisting on citing Iran under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which authorizes the use of penalties, and if that is inadequate, of military force. 
 This is still not a contest between nuclear powers -- Iran is not believed to have a bomb yet, and intelligence estimates say that day is still 5 to 10 years away, assuming there is no clandestine effort that no one has detected. 
 Instead, it is an effort by the United States and some other nations to refashion the nuclear rules. They want to declare that even if Iran is legally entitled under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to enrich uranium for civilian purposes, Mr. Ahmadinejad cannot be trusted to do so. By deceiving the nuclear agency about its activities, President Bush and British, French and German officials say, Iran has given up whatever treaty rights it once enjoyed.
 Mr. Bush has also acknowledged that America's credibility has been deeply harmed by the intelligence failures over Iraq. 
 On Friday, he tried to allay concerns that he was proceeding down the same path he used to give a legal basis for the invasion he ordered 37 months ago. ''There's a difference between the two countries,'' he told reporters, even as his European allies worry about similarities in the American strategy. 
 For the first time, the administration has publicly declared, as it did in the case of Iraq, that if the Security Council fails to act, Mr. Bush will organize ''like-minded nations'' to begin to impose punishment. 
 ''We have not conceded the point and we will not concede the point that Iran will become a nuclear weapons power,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, who directs the diplomatic talks for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. 
 He insisted that Iran was mistaken if it thought that the Bush administration would ever allow its nuclear activity to go ahead-- which is essentially what has happened in North Korea for the past three years, while negotiations have dragged on to the brink of collapse.
 ''The difference in the two situations is that in Iran you have a state situated in the most volatile area of the world, where they are the leading central banker of terrorist actions,'' Mr. Burns said. ''What they can't count on is a compliant and divided international community.''
 The strategies have only hardened the other side's position.
 Washington's episodic saber-rattling -- from the president's vague comments that ''all options'' are on the table if diplomacy fails, and the increasingly public discussion of whether he or the Israelis will ultimately opt for a military strike -- has so far failed. 
 The Iranians have responded with threats of their own, knowing that even the specter of confrontation rattles the oil markets and sends prices to new levels, enriching Iran and heightening the pain for Mr. Bush and American consumers.
 The Iranians may have also overplayed their hand.
 While they insist that their current activities are within their treaty obligations, they ignore the I.A.E.A.'s finding that Tehran hid some of its activities for two decades. And Friday's report accuses Iran of continuing to hide vital information.
 But this dispute is about more than transparency. It is also about national pride and Iran's insistence on self-sufficiency and independence. That may help explain why Iran has celebrated enrichment with dancers in traditional dress, who paraded on national television while holding a small box said to contain the fruits of their atomic labors.
 The inspectors' report confirmed that Iran had succeeded in enriching uranium at a low level, but it would take significantly more processing, equipment, and problem-solving to produce fuel for a bomb. Fabricating a warhead would take even more time, and risk detection. 
 ''The real fight here is not over whether they have a weapons program, it is over whether they can create a nuclear weapons option,'' said Gary Samore, who led nonproliferation efforts in the Clinton administration and continues to study the Iranian program, speaking earlier this year. ''And that is the smoke-and-mirrors game, convincing everyone that they have that capability.''
 That is what most concerns senior officials inside the Bush administration. Officials who deal with nuclear strategy note that it is now widely assumed that North Korea has several to 10 nuclear weapons -- even though the North Koreans have never conducted a nuclear test. 
 ''We think the Iranians looked at the Koreans and learned a lesson,'' said a senior official, who would not speak for attribution on a matter of nuclear strategy. 
 It would be a very different approach than the one taken by the Russians in the late 1940's, or the Chinese in the early 1960's, or the Indians and Pakistanis in the late 1990's, all of whom set off nuclear explosions to prove their powers. Given the limited access allowed I.A.E.A. inspectors, officials here and in Vienna say, there would be no way to verify, or disprove, Iran's claims.
 Mr. Bush has therefore taken the position that Iran must give up everything. He said Friday, ''The Iranians should not have a nuclear weapon, the capacity to make a nuclear weapon, or the knowledge as to how to make a nuclear weapon.''
 The Russians and Chinese view that as unrealistic; a senior Russian official said it was time for a ''detente'' with Iran, drawing another term from the cold war. 
 In Vienna, Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the atomic agency, has made it clear in conversations with diplomats that he believes pragmatism will eventually dictate that Iran be allowed some limited form of enrichment, monitored constantly by his agency.
 But there is the fear -- here, and in Vienna -- that the I.A.E.A. is seeing only part of the program, and that the evasive answers to its questions hide a clandestine effort, somewhere under the desert. As Tehran restricts international inspections, it will be harder to know whether its program more closely resembles the very real one in Pakistan, whose scientists sold technology to Iran, or the nuclear mirage in Iraq.

U.S. Rejects Offer on Inspections
TEHRAN, April 29 (AP) -- Iran said Saturday that it would allow United Nations inspectors to resume inspections of its nuclear facilities, but only if the dispute was returned to the United Nations' nuclear monitor.
 The White House rejected the offer.
 Iran gave no ground on the United Nations Security Council's demand that it stop enriching uranium but offered to allow the inspections if the Council dropped the matter; Council members have been at odds over imposing sanctions on Iran.

HEADLINE: Defending Big Oil

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
John C. Felmy, the chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, the main trade association for the oil business, sounds frustrated. 
 As an undergraduate at Pennsylvania State University, he said, he drove to Boston with his debate team during the Arab oil embargo. More than 30 years later, he can recite the topic for 1973-74 without hesitation: ''Resolved, the federal government should control the supply and utilization of energy in the United States.'' 
On the drive back, Mr. Felmy recalled, his group was almost stranded in Connecticut because no gas was available, a result, he said, of government misallocation. Government, Mr. Felmy said, can make energy problems worse. 
 ''I thought we'd learned from bad energy policy by now,'' he said, although there are days when he is not so sure. Those are the days when his computer flashes with hate e-mail from people who blame the American oil industry for the rise in oil prices. 
 ''People just simply don't know the facts,'' he said, ''but they accuse you of everything you can imagine.'' 
 Mr. Felmy's organization has been arguing to anyone who will listen that over the long haul, oil company profits are almost identical to the average for manufacturers in the United States, and that since 1982, the price of petroleum products is up less than the price of pulp and paper or lumber, and only about one-third as much as drugs and pharmaceuticals. But it has been tough going, with the public and with legislators, he said. 
 ''The politicians are reading all the polls, they know how concerned consumers are, and they are trying to figure out what to do about it,'' he said. ''Some are lashing out, attacking the industry, using information that is simply inaccurate.''
 Mr. Felmy said he was proud of what he did for a living, and he called institute members ''honorable companies.''
 ''They're doing what they should do, what is legally required for their shareholders, unlike other companies you've heard about in the news,'' he said. ''They are managing their business properly, keeping fuels flowing to consumers, even though we're operating in places where sometimes people are shooting at us.'' 
 His industry, Mr. Felmy said, is ''1.4 million Americans working to keep your gas tank full 24 hours a day.'' MATTHEW L. WALD

HEADLINE: New Hope for Ethanol

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
These are happy days for an ethanol man.
 The price of grain-alcohol fuel is up sharply as demand has surged, and Colorado's newest ethanol plant is almost ready to open after four years of preparation and sweat by Dan R. Sanders and his family. 
''It's great for us,'' said Mr. Sanders, 28, as he watched one of the first loads of corn -- ethanol's main ingredient -- arrive on Friday morning from a farm in northeastern Colorado. 
 When Mr. Sanders's company, Front Range Energy, begins shipping next month from this $60 million factory in Windsor, Colo., an hour north of Denver, it will just about double Colorado's ethanol production, adding 40 million gallons a year to the pipeline. And at least two other plants around the state are in planning. 
 Ethanol, which is essentially identical to the old corn liquor of moonshine fame, is increasingly blended with gas to reduce emissions and replace other additives like MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, which is a suspected carcinogen. 
 But more and more vehicles are also able to burn commercially available ethanol fuels like E85 -- 85 percent grain alcohol -- and kits can also be bought that allow cars to burn an even higher percentage of ethanol. All this has further increased the demand, and the price. In most parts of the country, E85 sells for 30 cents to 60 cents a gallon less than regular unleaded gasoline, but most cars get fewer miles to the gallon burning ethanol.
 Ethanol has its critics. Some economists say that farm subsidies blur the fuel's real cost, making it a less than perfect long-term alternative in thinking about the world after oil.
 But here in Colorado, people like Mr. Sanders say the economics make more sense than ever. Until recently, ethanol could only make money if distilled close to its fuel source, he said. That is why corn-country Iowa dominates the nation's production.
 Increasing demand is shattering that boundary, making factories feasible closer to where the product gets sold. About half of Front Range's output, Mr. Sanders said, will go no further than Denver. 
 The Sanderses have also lined up local buyers for the waste. The left-over corn mash will be sold as cattle feed, while the carbon dioxide produced by fermentation will be made into dry ice and sold in the Denver market.
 But operations like this are still small potatoes by the scale of big oil. On a day when the Chevron Corporation was announcing $4 billion in profits, Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jana, and their 2-year-old daughter, Ellie, were watching the corn arrive. And Ellie was not even very interested. KIRK JOHNSON

HEADLINE: Welcome to Our Town. Or, Maybe Not.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: KANAB, Utah 

 BODY:
Most businesses in this southern Utah town have a tourism booster sticker in their front windows saying, ''Everyone Welcome Here,'' which sounds pretty tame until you get to the little rainbow-colored people beneath the text.
 Are those little people gay? 
Terril Honey, for one, is convinced that they are. ''The rainbow colors are their symbol,'' said Mr. Honey, a member of the City Council and owner of Honey's Jubilee, a grocery store. Mr. Honey has decided not to post the stickers at his store because he believes they would offend some of his customers.
 Victor Cooper, who owns the Rocking V Cafe with his wife, Vicky, and led the drive in March to introduce the stickers, said people like Mr. Honey were reading things into the sticker message that are not there.
 The mayor, Kim T. Lawson, recently floated a compromise to bridge the sticker gap: another sticker, similar but without the rainbow people. And the Kanab Chamber of Commerce intends to have new stickers, with the Chamber of Commerce logo replacing the little people, ready in time for the start of the tourism season next month.
 ''We don't want to step on the merchants that came together and did the 'everybody welcome' campaign, but on the other hand we want every business in town to feel comfortable putting out the same message,'' said Ted Hallisey, the acting president of the chamber. ''If that means a little different sticker, we're O.K. with that -- the main message is that everybody's welcome.''
 The fight began in January, when the City Council unanimously passed a resolution voicing its support for ''the natural family,'' with a mother, father and ''a full quiver of children.'' The nonbinding resolution, formulated by the Sutherland Institute, a conservative advocacy group in Salt Lake City, said that the marriage of a ''woman to a man and a man to woman,'' was ''ordained of God,'' and that protection of that natural family was the ''first responsibility,'' of local government.
 ''A natural family is a fundamental part of our infrastructure that we need to protect and promote,'' Mr. Lawson said in an interview.
 But although the resolution is essentially symbolic, with no force of law, it hit Kanab like a thunderclap, creating divisions within the community and raising concerns in a tourism-dependent economy that people around the country might see themselves as ''unnatural'' in Kanab's eyes and stay away. The first wave of stickers was issued to address those fears and declare that the town had open arms, in hopes that people would continue to visit Kanab for the nearby red rock formations and spectacular desert scenery of Zion National Park.
 ''I think they knew what they were saying: that unless you're a natural family, we don't want you here,'' said Tammie Leslie, the general manager of the Shilo Inn, which lost $14,000 in March, she said, mainly from a big tour group that pointedly told her they were changing their plans because of the resolution.
 The travel writer Arthur Frommer labeled the Kanab resolution ''homophobic'' in his nationally syndicated column in March and called for a boycott. Kanab's weekly newspaper, The Southern Utah News, has printed hundreds of letters. Mr. Hallisey at the Chamber of Commerce said the e-mail was running two-to-one against the resolution.
 ''It's taken on a life of its own,'' said Dixie Brunner, the newspaper's editor.
 Many people here say the fight is really about holding on to a vision of what Kanab has traditionally been: an outpost of about 3,200 people on the Arizona border, mainly populated by the descendants of the Mormon pioneers who settled the area in the 1800's. In recent years, the old balance has begun to shift as newcomers have been drawn by the beauty, relatively low housing costs and economic opportunity.
 Now each side accuses the other of fostering division and tells anecdotes about people who are said to be moving in or moving out. 
 Real figures are hard to come by, and tourism numbers are complicated by other factors, including $3 a gallon gasoline. Kortney Stirland, a pharmacist who describes himself as a conservative Republican and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, displays the sticker and opposes the natural family resolution, which he has twice asked the council to rescind. He says he has also been offended by people in the community who have told him that a person cannot oppose the resolution, as he does, and still believe in traditional values.
 ''Originally it was a religious issue, then it became a gay and lesbian issue, but for me now, it's economic,'' Mr. Stirland said. Mr. Cooper at the Rocking V said the fight over the stickers might ultimately have a greater impact on Kanab than the resolution itself, because the debate is revealing where people stand on the question of just who is welcome -- or not -- in Kanab.
 ''The more they fight, the more it hastens change,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Small Market Hampers Mine Safety Advances

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va., April 29 

 BODY:
The drive to harness new technology to make underground coal mining safer is being hindered by a simple economic reality: the market, as it exists now, is too small. 
 Government regulators and industry insiders say there is not enough profit potential to attract the capital needed to develop and manufacture modern tracking and communications equipment for coal mines.
 There is also little incentive to increase production of established products like emergency air supplies carried by miners.
 As a result, observers say it will be difficult, if not impossible, for mining companies to comply with new safety standards approved by West Virginia and the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration after two accidents killed 14 West Virginia miners in January.
 ''Can we meet all the requirements of the law at the current time?'' said Jim Dean, West Virginia's acting mine safety director. ''That's pretty tough.''
 West Virginia now requires mines to provide emergency communication and tracking equipment, underground stockpiles of emergency breathing equipment and rescue chambers, among other things. And the mining agency has mandated that all underground coal mines store additional air supplies and install lifelines to guide miners to safety.
 The problem is, much of that equipment does not exist. And what does exist, chiefly emergency air equipment, is scarce.
 Entrepreneurs have come up with novel ideas for communications, tracking, air supplies and even emergency shelters in response to West Virginia's new law and federal rules.
 Most of those products are still unavailable, have they not been deemed safe by regulators and would not be profitable because of the small market.
 Coal mining is a giant industry, dominated by multibillion-dollar international companies. The United States has more than 625 underground coal mines employing 43,000 miners.
 But industry insiders say those numbers are deceptive, especially when it comes to rare purchases like emergency communications equipment and air supplies. They say the market is small, stagnant and prone to boom-and-bust cycles.
 Take the case of emergency air equipment called self-contained self-rescuers. Regulators and industry insiders say there is at least a 10-month backlog of orders, but the devices rarely need replacing.
 At $600 apiece, every American miner could be supplied with two for $52 million.
 Concern about air packs was renewed Thursday when the sole survivor of the Sago Mine accident in West Virginia said 4 of his crew's 12 self-rescuers did not work.
 The mining agency maintains that testing of air packs recovered from Sago showed that those that were activated would have functioned properly, but the agency has found problems with that maker's air packs before.
 Bruce Watzman, a lobbyist for the National Mining Association, said the industry's size had been a constraint for years.
 ''We are a small industry,'' Mr. Watzman said. ''For many, that size has been a hindrance to them entering the marketplace.''
 Even established vendors say the market is too small to recover the cost of developing, testing and marketing emergency communications equipment.
 Motorola stopped making radios for underground coal mining two years ago, leaving the industry without federally approved handheld radios until last week, when two Kenwood USA models were approved.

HEADLINE: Science Panel Report Says Physics in U.S. Faces Crisis

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
Physics in America is at a crossroads and in crisis, just as humanity stands on the verge of great discoveries about the nature of matter and the universe, a panel from the National Academy of Sciences concludes in a new report. 
 The United States should be prepared to spend up to a half-billion dollars in the next five years to ensure that a giant particle accelerator now being designed by a worldwide consortium of scientists can be built on American soil, the panel said. If that does not happen, particle physics, the quest for the fundamental forces and constituents of nature, will wither in this country, it said. 
''That is a risky investment,'' Harold T. Shapiro, an economist at Princeton and the chairman of the 22-member commission, said Wednesday at a news conference in Washington.
 But, Mr. Shapiro added: ''It's the least risky path we could find. To stay where we are is equivalent to folding our cards.''
 Failure to build the machine, the International Linear Collider, in the United States, the panel said, would force American particle physicists to do their research in Europe, where a major machine is to come online next year, and other places, perhaps Japan.
 The blow to American physics would erode the base of science and technology that has fueled innovation, provided intellectual and cultural inspiration and bolstered national security over the last century. 
 The collider recommendation, along with others, was in a new report, ''Revealing the Hidden Nature of Space and Time, Charting the Course for Elementary Particle Physics.'' Among its other recommendations, the group said the United States should energetically pursue international collaborations in high-energy physics, expand programs in related fields of research like cosmology and underground experiments and take steps to make a long-term plan for particle physics research and then carry it out.
 The report says: ''The committee has concluded that the price the United States would pay by forfeiting a leadership position in particle physics is too high. Leadership in science remains central to the economic and cultural vitality of the United States.'' 
 The report comes on the heels of a widely publicized National Academy report last year, ''Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which is credited with spurring the Bush administration to propose increasing money for physical science in the president's most recent budget.
 The International Linear Collider will shoot electrons and their antimatter opposites, positrons, at each other through a tunnel some 20 miles long. 
 Working in tandem with the Large Hadron Collider, another giant machine to begin operating at the European Center for Nuclear Research, CERN, outside Geneva, next year, the linear collider will enable physicists to explore ''revolutionary new physics,'' probe the origins of mass and investigate the nature of the mysterious dark matter that dominates the universe, scientists say.
 Dr. Shapiro said, ''We concluded that this might be the most exciting moment in particle physics in a generation.''
 But just as things are becoming exciting in particle physics, support for such work in the United States has stagnated, and many large projects are closing down. Last winter, scientists at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island kept a major experiment going only after James Simons, an investment manager and mathematician, raised $13 million for the laboratory.
 The most powerful accelerator now operating, the Tevatron at the Fermi National Laboratory outside Chicago, is scheduled to shut down in 2010, leaving Fermilab with an uncertain future.
 An even larger accelerator that would have been the world's largest, the Super Conducting Supercollider, under construction in Texas, was canceled by Congress in 1993.
 The report was commissioned two years ago by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.

HEADLINE: Sharing Wealth Prompts a Few Questions

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
THE focus of revenue-sharing money is usually on the clubs that receive the most money, like Tampa Bay and Florida. But perhaps the most intriguing snapshot from last year's payments captures Philadelphia and Baltimore in the lens. 
 The Phillies and the Orioles were among the recipients of the smallest payments -- the Phillies $6 million and the Orioles $2 million -- but the intrigue comes from their receiving any money at all. 
The revenue-sharing system, which is designed to funnel money from wealthier clubs to poorer ones, large markets to small markets, transferred $312 million last year. The Yankees contributed $77 million into the revenue-sharing pot, the Red Sox $52 million.
 Philadelphia is by no means a small market. It has the fourth-largest television market in the country. Baltimore doesn't have the population of New York or Los Angeles, but the Orioles drew more than 3.4 million fans in six of the first seven years (not counting 1994, the strike year) at Camden Yards.
 But the Orioles have allowed themselves to deteriorate, and their attendance has shrunk. The Phillies have been bad for so long that they have turned off their fans, too. Last year, their attendance was ninth in the National League. 
 The revenue-sharing game is about revenue. Forget market size. High-revenue teams are payers, low-revenue teams payees. 
 The revenue-sharing pool is created with each team's contribution of 34 percent of its net local revenue (local revenue minus actual stadium expenses). The pool is divided equally among the 30 clubs.
 Teams like the Yankees are not thrilled about subsidizing teams like the Phillies and the Orioles. The wealthier teams accept the concept noted in the collective bargaining agreement, recognizing ''that the participation of two clubs is necessary for the production of the on-field competition that the clubs sell to the public.'' 
 But they question why some teams are in the receiving category and whether poorer clubs use the revenue-sharing money for the intended purposes: ''to improve its performance on the field.''
 The commissioner's office monitors clubs' use of the money. Recipient clubs have to report by April 1 ''on the performance-related uses'' of the money from the previous year. The commissioner, the agreement states, ''may impose penalties on any club that violates this obligation.''
 ''I would if the facts determined it,'' Selig said, speaking of taking disciplinary action. ''I'm sensitive to that.'' But he quickly added that he had not had to penalize any clubs.
 ''There's a lot of mythology, but I don't receive complaints in these matters from any clubs,'' Selig said. ''Sometimes people try to make judgments off one year, and you can't do that. I don't think there's any question revenue sharing is doing what it was meant to do.''
 Still, questions about the system remain. Last year, the Devil Rays received $33 million, more than their payroll of $26.6 million. They also received $34.5 million that each club got from national television, cable and radio and the sale of major league merchandise. What did they do with the rest of the $67.5 million? 
 ''We're not in the practice of talking about last year,'' said Matt Silverman, the club president under the new principal owner, Stuart Sternberg. ''It wasn't anything that we had control over. Going forward, our goal is to become a payer into the system. Our goal is to make it a healthier organization and become a payer. A lot more goes into it than major league payroll, but we know it will have to grow over time.''
 The Devil Rays began this season with a $35.4 million payroll, up $9 million. The Marlins, on the other hand, slashed their payroll to $15.9 million from $56.3 million. They received $32 million in revenue sharing last year and can expect more this year.
 ''I don't want to talk about revenue sharing other than saying we want to be revenue-sharing contributors, not receivers,'' said Jeffrey Loria, the Marlins' owner. ''That's why we need a stadium. We're working to get a stadium deal done to be contributors to the industry.''
 The commissioner's office is not concerned with the way the Marlins spend their money.
 ''We've seen what the franchise has done before,'' Rob Manfred, baseball's chief labor executive, said. ''There is a point in time when they recycle. You can't be critical of this team that has won and proved their strategy.''
 The Kansas City Royals haven't proved anything except that they're getting worse. When they set a franchise record with 106 losses last year, they had a $34.9 million payroll and received $64.5 million, including $30 million in revenue sharing. Their payroll this year is $47 million.
 Dan Glass, the Royals' president, offered no comment on the team's economic practices. He did not return a half-dozen calls seeking comment.

HEADLINE: Many Dismissing 'Donor Fatigue' as Myth

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
After Hurricane Katrina, Congress was so concerned that donations for hurricane relief efforts would cut into other charitable giving that it passed one of the biggest temporary tax breaks in history.
 The legislation, which allowed a larger deduction than usual for cash donations, cost the government billions in revenue, but in some cases spurred wealthy donors -- including Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife -- to accelerate their giving.
But concern about so-called donor fatigue was largely unfounded, according to a new survey by the Association of Fundraising Professionals. Some 76 percent of the 506 respondents said they had raised as much or more in 2005 than they had in 2004. And among the nearly one-fourth of those organizations that said their fund-raising had fallen below their 2005 goals, most cited stiff competition for donor dollars from other charities, rather than donor fatigue caused by last year's natural disasters. 
 The survey is regarded as a harbinger of the more comprehensive study of annual giving also sponsored by the association, Giving USA, which comes out in June.
 ''The statistics are pretty clear,'' said Paulette V. Maehara, the association's president and chief executive. ''The impact of Katrina and the tsunami on giving last year was minimal.''
 More and more leaders of nonprofit groups are dismissing donor fatigue as a myth. They note that the $5 billion that was donated last year to relief efforts for Katrina and the tsunami in Indonesia amounted to less than 2 percent of the total donated to charity in 2004.
 ''I'm not aware of any data that support the concept,'' Michael Clark, president of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, said, alluding to fears that charitable donations had fallen off.
 ''I just don't know what the evidence for it is,'' said Mr. Clark, whose group represents more than 1,400 charities in the New York metropolitan area. 
 Diana Aviv, president and chief executive of the Independent Sector, a trade organization representing some 550 nonprofit organizations, went even further. 
 ''I think some of the nonprofits worrying about donor fatigue are simply crying wolf,'' Ms. Aviv said. ''Often in the charitable sector, good news is hard for us to live with. It's easier for us to feel we're fighting many demons, including a funding demon.''
 In a recent survey by the Conference Board, a research company in New York, 89.4 percent of the 5,000 respondents said their donations for hurricane relief were in addition to, rather than in lieu of, the other charitable gifts they planned to make.
 The tax break for charitable giving allows donors who made cash gifts from Aug. 28 through Dec. 31 to deduct an amount equal to virtually 100 percent of their annual adjusted gross income, twice the normal limit. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Cheney, for example, showed an adjusted gross income of $8.82 million on their 2005 income tax report, but most of the money was not taxable because they set aside $6.87 million in proceeds from stock options for charity. As a result, the Cheneys' taxable income was $1.96 million. The couple paid $2.5 million in taxes through withholding and estimated tax payments and are due a refund of about $1.9 million.
 Legislators said they passed the tax break out of concern that the flood of contributions pouring into relief organizations was diverting money from charities that were not involved in the hurricane and tsunami recovery efforts, and they cited what happened to charities after Sept. 11.
 A number of respondents reported a decline in fund-raising in 2002, according to the Association of Fundraising Professionals' survey for that year. But 60 percent said fund-raising had remained consistent or had improved from 2001. There has been a debate ever since over whether the charities that experienced declines did so because of donor fatigue or the economic downturn that followed the terrorist attacks.
 ''There might have been a little fatigue right after Katrina, like what we saw after 9/11, but in short order after both those events, giving got right back on track,'' Ms. Maehara, the association executive, said.
 Fund-raising experts said it was unlikely that the tax break accounted for the success reported in the association's survey because many charities did not know about it in time to capitalize on it.
 ''That was a sideshow,'' said Robert F. Sharpe Jr., a fund-raising consultant.
 Mr. Sharpe said higher interest rates and stock market gains, which affect the older people who are the biggest donors, were the biggest factors.
 Delane Butler, the vice president of marketing at the United Way of the Plains in Wichita, Kan., said his organization probably benefited from coverage of the philanthropy directed at Hurricane Katrina. 
 ''We were seeing that it was actually raising more awareness for the needs that are out there,'' Mr. Butler said. He added that fund-raising was up by an average of 12 percent at 296 -- or about a third -- of the companies where the United Way ran workplace campaigns.
 The group still saw a decline in fund-raising, but Mr. Butler said the falloff had more to do with changes in ownership and management of several large companies whose employees contribute to the organization. The Boeing Corporation, for instance, spun off part of the operations of a plant that was one of the area's biggest employers.
 The organization raised $14.1 million last year, a 9.8 percent drop from 2004. ''I think if it had anything to do with donor fatigue, the decreases we saw would cut across all companies and not be limited to certain groups of companies,'' Mr. Butler said.
 Similarly, the Union Gospel Mission in Seattle saw a $300,000 budget shortfall looming in September after Hurricane Katrina hit. But the organization saw a turnaround after it mailed a special appeal to its regular donors, raising about $14 million and exceeding its goal, according to Herb Pfiffner, its executive director.
 ''Donor fatigue, as the press is calling it, may be a factor, but it's only one of many and not a particularly big one, I think,'' Mr. Pfiffner said. ''A bigger factor is that everyone is trying to do more in the way of fund-raising. There is a real and significant increase in appeals and competition for discretionary funds.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about a study by the Association of Fundraising Professionals showing that hurricane relief efforts had not cut into other charitable giving misattributed a more comprehensive study, Giving USA, which is to come out in June. It is published by the Giving USA Foundation, not the Association of Fundraising Professionals.

HEADLINE: Give Them Liberty, and a Family Atmosphere 

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI.

 BODY:
They talked about the two Spoons and the shot. They laughed at the mention of Radio City Music Hall and squirmed at the thought of a tiny but tenacious opponent named Debbie Black. They were grateful to have known Olga, who rarely left the bench but still managed to play her way into the hearts of thousands at Madison Square Garden.
 Larry Weinstock of Huntington, N.Y., and Lynne and Harold Theurer of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, then toasted the 10th anniversary season of the Liberty, whose first game is May 20 at the Connecticut Sun. 
''I'd give up my Knick season tickets before I'd give up my Liberty season tickets,'' Weinstock, 47, said recently during lunch with the Theurers in Manhattan. ''It's not even close.''
 Season-ticket holders from Day 1, they never doubted that the Liberty and the Women's National Basketball Association would survive despite the number of women's leagues that had come and gone before 1997, the W.N.B.A.'s inaugural season.
 ''There was so much excitement and enthusiasm in that very first home game,'' said Harold Theurer, 49, who watched the Liberty defeat the Phoenix Mercury, 65-57. He one of 17,780 fans who set an attendance record for a women's professional basketball game in the United States. 
 ''I remember turning to Lynn and saying, 'This is going to stick.' ''
 Weinstock, whose 9-year-old daughter, Stephanie, accompanies him to most Liberty games, said that accessibility -- ''the game, the players, the prices'' -- was the key to the Liberty's success.
 Before one game last season, the Liberty locker room was open to fans, including the Theurers' 10-year-old son, Harold Jr.
 ''Vickie Johnson and Becky Hammon signed a jersey for Harold,'' said Lynn Theurer, a former point guard at Williams College. ''Just watching his face light up was one of our most memorable moments.'' 
 There have been other moments, like the fight between Black of the Miami Sol and Teresa Weatherspoon of the Liberty at the Garden in 2002, and the six games played on the stage at Radio City Music Hall in 2004 when the Republican National Convention took over the Garden. (It was noted by all that the Liberty, 5-1 in Radio City performances, clearly had the home-stage advantage.)
 But no moment rivals the shot Weatherspoon made at Houston in the final seconds of Game 2 of the 1999 W.N.B.A. finals, a halfcourt, game-winning heave that ripped through the cords just as confetti began falling from the rafters. Alas, it delayed the Comets' third consecutive championship for only one game. 
 T-Spoon, not to be confused with her former teammate Sophia Witherspoon, ran the floor before adoring fans who didn't need a box score to tell them whom to root for. Just ask the former Liberty center Olga Firsova, a 6-foot-6 player from Ukraine who earned waves of cascading cheers without working up a sweat. 
 Weinstock, who followed the Liberty online, play by electronic play, in the days before all their games were televised, said the W.N.B.A.'s likeability factor was tied to the game's economics.
 ''N.B.A. players earn so much money, they take the court with a sense of entitlement,'' he said. ''But the women aren't making big salaries, so they understand that it's a privilege to be out there. They are just regular people putting forth an extraordinary level of athletic effort.''
 Weinstock and the Theurers said the kind of family atmosphere they enjoyed at Liberty games could not be duplicated at Knicks games.
 ''At Liberty games,'' Weinstock said, ''there is no such thing as booing the home team.''
 Could there really be such harmony in Libertyville?
 ''Yes,'' said Amy Scheer, vice president for marketing and communications with the Liberty. ''As a matter of fact, some of our season-ticket holders have refused upgraded seats because they did not want to leave friends they made near their original seats.''
 At Madison Square Garden, home of the Liberty and the Knicks, some relationships are still worth toasting.

HEADLINE: Making a Flophouse a Home, And a Decent One at That

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
The lowly flophouse has all but vanished from the urban landscape, swept away by the well-meaning forces of housing reform, city planning and gentrification. But Rosanne Haggerty, whose work housing the homeless won her a MacArthur fellowship in 2001, thinks it is time to give the flophouse a second chance.
 The immediate object of Ms. Haggerty's affection is one of the last surviving lodging houses on the Bowery in Manhattan, the Andrews House, a 97-year-old ''cubicle hotel'' where aging men, many of them alcoholics, have whiled away countless decades in sunless cubicles, television screens flickering on nicotine-stained walls.
Ms. Haggerty is now reinventing the Andrews House and, in the process, she hopes to answer an unexpected question: Could a flophouse -- a good flophouse, well designed and humanely managed -- become, for people who have steered clear of other forms of housing in favor of the street, a critical first step toward a permanent home? 
 The undertaking, by the organization Ms. Haggerty founded in New York City in 1990, Common Ground Community, one of the country's largest nonprofit developers of so-called supportive housing, has attracted the attention of people who work with the homeless in other cities including Toronto, San Francisco, Minneapolis and Chicago. 
 ''We are fundamental believers in permanent housing,'' said Ms. Haggerty, who hopes to move residents into renovated parts of the Andrews House in August. ''We're calling the Andrews first-step housing. We want to get people now alienated from the idea of living in housing to enter in on their own terms, and then work with them from there.''
 Once, most major cities had a lodging house district, a skid row. In the 1930's and early 40's, there were 50 to 100 flophouses along the Bowery. The street was home to thousands of men, mostly single -- a ready industrial army of unskilled migrant day laborers for any employer in need of gang labor.
 But after World War II, industries moved out of cities and mechanization changed the demand for labor. Skid rows became repositories of retired, elderly men. Without lobbies, men socialized on sidewalks, some with bottle in hand. Lodging houses were perceived as squalid magnets for a rough crowd and the occasional criminal. 
 ''Any kind of single-room-occupancy hotel was seen as a bad thing,'' said Paul Groth, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and author of ''Living Downtown: The History of Residential Hotels in the United States.'' ''They were the favorite target of urban renewal. It was the old, messy city; these were people you didn't want around. They reminded you that capitalism wasn't working for everyone all the time.''
 Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, believes that the decline of the lodging houses, boarding houses and S.R.O.'s (where residents could rent not a mere cubicle but a fully enclosed room) ''was probably a big contributor to the emergence of homelessness.'' 
 Ms. Haggerty's project arose out of more than 100 interviews that Common Ground conducted in soup kitchens and shelters in 1997. The aim was to understand the group of homeless people who seemed uninterested in the kind of housing, with on-site social services, that Common Ground offered. What would they prefer?
 Many said they wanted something small, private, safe, cheap; they wanted just enough space for themselves and their belongings. They had a little money, though not enough for an apartment. They could pay. And they wanted anonymity.
 ''They were really talking about a lodging house,'' Ms. Haggerty said. ''Nothing grand, a modicum of privacy, anonymity.'' Today in New York City, fewer than 40,000 legal S.R.O. units remain, down from 150,000 to 200,000 in the late 1950's. The number of cubicle hotels -- a step down from an S.R.O. -- has dwindled to fewer than a dozen, most of them within a few blocks of the Andrews.
 ''None of us had focused on the Bowery -- a place you could get a toehold, where for a couple of bucks a night you could get something safe, private, no questions asked,'' Ms. Haggerty said. The interviews, she said, ''got us thinking, almost against our wishes: What if you were to take what we're hearing seriously and try to fill this need?''
 Common Ground invited homeless people to focus groups: What would the ideal unit look like? Over and over, people would ask for paper and pencil, then sketch the simplest outline of a Monopoly house -- a three-sided box with an upside down V for a roof.
 Common Ground met with the Fire Department and Department of Buildings to discuss complying with codes. Potential residents wanted the cubicles to be roofed, for security. But the Fire Department said the walls could not reach the ceiling; there had to be space for light, air circulation and sprinkler systems.
 In 2000, Ms. Haggerty spent several months in Japan on a fellowship from the Japan Society studying efficient design. She met with people in the prefabricated construction industry and the designers of capsule hotels, places where businessmen bed down for the night in cubbyholes the size of refrigerator boxes for, say, $30.
 She came to think that design is the great ''bridger.'' It is not the amount of space that matters; it is how well the space is designed. The context of the space -- the other amenities nearby -- is also important. And there is more than one way to design a unit.
 Common Ground was already looking for a suitable building. Lofts were too expensive, and Common Ground was outbid for one lodging house by a man who planned to convert it into luxury condos. Finally, Common Ground found the Andrews and bought it in 2002 for $2.3 million.
 Built to house 200 people, the building was six stories high and only 17 feet wide. Inside, submarine-style corridors lined with cubicles ran lengthwise into gloom. The number of residents had dwindled to 90, men in their 40's to their 80's. Shari Siegel, now the director, said that men were dying there at a rate of about one a month.
 ''The only appointment I'm keeping is with the undertaker,'' one resident told his caseworker when she pressed him to keep a doctor's appointment, Ms. Siegel remembers. Two days later, the man was dead. A fellow resident peered over the top of the cubicle.
 ''Shari,'' he said. ''I think you've got a dead body upstairs.''
 It took 13 Dumpsters to empty the Andrews of detritus -- old suitcases, calendars, clothing, Chinese menus, whatever residents agreed to part with. The exterminator came to be called, jokingly, part of the case-management team. Common Ground installed Ms. Siegel, who is a nurse; it set up a health clinic and brought in a social worker.
 In 2003, Common Ground and the Architectural League of New York held a design competition for the units, 175 to 300 square feet. They received 189 full submissions from 13 countries. A jury, including the chairman of the architecture department in the Harvard Design School, selected five winners. Two prototypes went on display at the Municipal Art Society last summer.
 Among those who visited was Arthur Harttman, a 73-year-old Air Force veteran and former dance instructor who moved into the Andrews 13 years ago, drawn by the ''old-timers.'' Mr. Harttman has become an admirer of the new Andrews House social worker, whom he calls the Princess and who recently helped him get a new set of teeth.
 ''Sometimes the Princess and I used to go to the nursing home, on Greenwich Street, and volunteer our time and dance with the old-timers,'' Mr. Harttman, rail thin with wispy gray hair, said in an interview. Offered a chance to go to the Municipal Art Society exhibit, he eagerly went. 
 ''I thought it was great,'' he said. He liked the prototype called ''The Ordering of Things'' best. It was bigger than his current cubicle, which fits barely more than a cot. It had lots of shelves and a bed on rollers. The top half of the door could swing open -- perfect for summer.
 ''They've done a wonderful thing for all us fellows here,'' Mr. Harttman said.
 The first phase of the Andrews renovation will be completed this summer. Eventually, there will be room for 146 men, including the 48 current residents, who can stay as long as they like. New arrivals can stay for three weeks on their own terms; after that, they will be required to accept certain services, including housing-placement counseling. The charge will be $7 a night.
 ''We don't want to encourage the lodging houses to be permanent housing,'' Ms. Haggerty said. ''But we see the need for them as a complement to other housing as a place for people who need a place to start. We need a much bigger range of housing options if we're going to find a place for everyone.''

HEADLINE: Sweeter Deal For Managing Central Park 

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
In what the parks commissioner compared to a renewal-of-vows ceremony by a long-married couple, the city has renewed its contract with the private nonprofit group that took over much of the day-to-day management of Central Park in 1998.
 The commissioner, Adrian Benepe, signed a renewal of the agreement with the Central Park Conservancy on Friday. He and the president of the conservancy, Douglas Blonsky, had extended the old contract when it expired last year, and negotiated the new deal in recent months. 
The two officials said that the new deal was similar to the old one as far as management arrangements went, but that the new financial terms would be sweeter for the conservancy.
 ''Maintaining Central Park, as with everything else, has gotten more expensive,'' Mr. Benepe said, ''and as the conservancy fixed up areas, landscapes and buildings, they were taking on additional expenses in maintaining them. The city's contribution was staying the same, so the city's contribution was being reduced in percentage terms.'' 
 He said that led to concern on the conservancy's side that the city ''wasn't holding up its end of the partnership.''
 The city has been paying the conservancy about $3.7 million a year. That amount will continue, the two officials said. 
 But the conservancy stands to receive more under the new agreement because it removes a limit on revenue from concessions -- the fees that are paid for everything from hot dog carts to restaurants like Tavern on the Green. 
 Under the old contract, the city gave the conservancy 50 cents of every dollar of concession revenue between $6 million and $10 million, but never more than $2 million a year, even if revenue exceeded $10 million annually.
 The $10 million figure seemed distant when the first contract was worked out. Now it is closer: Mr. Benepe estimated that concessions bring in about $9.5 million a year now. Under the new contract, the city and the conservancy will divide all revenue above $6 million.
 The Parks Department characterized the change as something of a gamble for the conservancy, but Mr. Blonsky was upbeat.
 ''We have historically seen the concession revenue go up 3, 4, 5 percent a year from inflation,'' he said. ''It didn't benefit us before to be concerned about concessions in the park. Now, we can see ourselves as being helpful, looking at concessions differently: how can we make them better, how can we make them serve the public better.''
 The new contract also adds fees from concerts and other special events to the total amount that could be shared by the city and the conservancy.
 ''It's a way of recognizing that the Central Park Conservancy through its work has increased the value of Central Park, and not just aesthetically,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''It's fiscally more valuable to the city, it can be argued, because each year it gets nicer and attracts more visitors.'' 
 The conservancy, which has raised more than $325 million since 1980, now takes in about $17 million a year in donations. It is widely credited with leading the park's renaissance, and in the years before the 1998 management agreement, it had taken on more and more of the responsibility for park operations. 
 ''We believe the conservancy has made substantial improvements to the park,'' said David Liston, the chairman of Community Board 8, on the Upper East Side. ''We also believe the conservancy has become increasingly responsive to the community board.
 ''They've come to us early and often, seeking our input and our suggestions and keeping us apprised of what they're doing, which we think makes their work more effective.''
 Under the new contract, the city will continue to regulate the concessions and handle such administrative chores as issuing softball permits.
 Mr. Blonsky said the renewal ''validated not only the success of what we've done over the last 8 years, but over the last 25 years.''

HEADLINE: New York Gives Tax Breaks To Parents and Shoppers 

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 28 

 BODY:
Most parents of school-age children will get money. People shopping for clothes will see their dollars go further at the mall. And married couples will get just a bit more money -- enough to see a movie -- the next time they file their taxes. 
 While a standoff held up one of the Legislature's main tax cut proposals, a plan to send property tax rebate checks to homeowners, the $112.1 billion state budget that emerged last week after a series of vetoes and overrides contains a number or tax breaks for a variety of New Yorkers.
Parents of school-age children emerge as the biggest beneficiaries of the changes. Many parents will receive up to $330 for each child between the ages of 4 and 17. 
 The tax credit is largely aimed at the middle class, with married parents who make $25,000 to $110,000 receiving the full credit. Single parents who make $25,000 to $75,000 are also eligible for the full credit, which will be deducted on their tax returns.
 The tax credit begins to phase out at $110,000 for married parents and at $75,000 for single parents. The child tax credit will cost the state roughly $600 million annually, according to the Legislature and the governor's budget division. 
 The Legislature also agreed to eliminate the state sales tax on clothing and shoe purchases of less than $110, which will cost the state $600 million each year, according to the budget division.
 The change means plenty of tax-free shopping in New York City, where the city repealed its sales tax as well. But because local municipalities, such as city and county governments, can impose their own taxes, shoppers in Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties will still pay the local sales tax, typically around 4.5 percent. 
 The Legislature also eliminated part of the so-called marriage penalty. Under the previous tax policy, single taxpayers could claim a standard deduction of $7,500, while married couples filing separate returns could claim only $6,500 and those filing jointly could deduct only $14,600. Those amounts for married couples will increase to $7,500 and $15,000 to match the deduction for single taxpayers. 
 The real impact of the change, however, is modest, with an average savings of $27, according to the state budget division. Couples who make $150,000 to $10 million will receive the maximum benefit, $30. Over all, the change will cost the state about $50 million over the next two years, according to the budget division. 
 ''Really the only people that will notice a difference are the parents with children,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center, a conservative fiscal policy research group. ''For married couples, the change amounts to a cheap dinner -- a dinner at a diner.'' 
 The Legislature's most ambitious tax cut proposal, which would have sent direct property tax rebate checks and cost the state about $4.1 billion over the next two years, was vetoed by Gov. George E. Pataki, who called the plan unconstitutional.

HEADLINE: A Real Estate Boom That Keeps on Giving

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
INVESTORS in commercial real estate have profited handsomely in the last two years or so as a stable economy, job growth and keen interest from pension funds and other institutions drive demand for properties or companies that hold them. 
 In fact, investors who put their money into the companies that broker deals, manage buildings and provide related services have reaped particularly rich returns.
''The real pickup has been on the transaction side -- with the commercial real estate brokers,'' said William L. Baldwin, a principal at Baldwin Anthony Securities of Dallas, who follows the stocks of companies in the sector.
 Shares of the biggest publicly traded commercial real estate services companies, bolstered by robust earnings, outpaced most other stocks in 2005 and are trading near their 52-week highs this year. 
 Leading the pack is CB Richard Ellis, whose shares are up 167 percent for the 52 weeks that ended on Friday. The stock of Jones Lang LaSalle has soared 131 percent in that period, while Trammell Crow has climbed 82 percent. The stock price of Grubb & Ellis, which struggled in the early part of the decade, has gained 128 percent in the most recent 52 weeks.
 By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained 16.8 percent in the last 12 months. 
 As commercial markets around the country have picked up steam, even as the residential real estate has cooled, industry analysts predict that commercial services companies will continue to do well. (Their strong performance will also help the many mutual funds that hold them.)
 ''My forecast is for earnings growth in 2006, driven by strong real estate fundamentals: a growing economy and demand for real estate,'' said William C. Marks, a managing director and senior analyst at JMP Securities. ''Many corporations are hiring more,'' he said, ''and with more people they need more space.'' 
 Indeed, office vacancy rates nationwide are expected to average 11 percent by year-end, down from 13.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, according to the Commercial Real Estate Outlook, a report published last month by the National Association of Realtors. Rents for office space are projected to rise 5 percent, the association said.
 Sales of all types of commercial property, meanwhile, reached a record $274 billion last year, 47 percent higher than the previous record, $187 billion, set in 2004, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research and consulting firm that tracks transactions of $5 million or more. A sizable portion involved institutional investors, with pension funds investing $51 billion in property last year, Real Capital Analytics said. 
 The institutions ''now see commercial real estate as an important asset class and are increasing their asset allocation,'' relative to stocks and bonds, said Michael J. Fox, a senior analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities. ''That is causing commissions on investment properties to be much stronger than what they would normally be at this stage of the economic cycle.'' 
 But the three big companies have far more going for them than just commissions and fees from rising sales and leasing transactions. They are also involved in developing property, managing assets and consulting, among other services, and they are steadily expanding overseas. 
 ''Geographic diversification allows these firms to increase their market share,'' while also helping to insulate them from changing economic conditions in the United States, Mr. Marks said. ''It's a little less risky.''
 Jennifer Pinnick, a vice president at Morgan Stanley who also follows the sector, noted too that ''the overseas markets are less developed and offer more long-term growth.''
 Ms. Pinnick is especially bullish on Jones Lang LaSalle, based in Chicago, which derives more than half of its revenue from overseas operations, in 50 or so countries. 
 Like competitors, the company has been focusing lately on the thriving economies of India and China, and it has been taking aim at Japan, where there is an expanding market in real estate investment trusts and, subsequently, an increase in real estate transactions. In the United States, it recently completed the acquisition of Spaulding & Slye, a private real estate services and investment company with offices in Boston and Washington.
 The stock of Jones Lang LaSalle jumped more than 10 percent on Wednesday after it reported operating income of $8.7 million in the first quarter, historically a period when it reports a loss because of the seasonal nature of its business. Revenue rose more than 40 percent in the quarter. 
 CB Richard Ellis, based in Los Angeles, had earnings of $217.3 million last year, more than triple the $64.7 million of 2004. It continues to expand overseas as well, in part through mergers and acquisitions.
 Last year, for instance, it acquired a majority interest in its Japanese affiliate, Ikoma CB Richard Ellis, and bought Dalgleish & Company of Britain, a specialist in retail real estate. This month, it announced the purchase of a controlling interest in Noble Gibbons, a real estate services firm in Russia. 
 In a February conference call with analysts to discuss last year's earnings, Brett White, the chief executive and president of CB Richard Ellis, said: ''We do believe that M.& A. is a core source of growth for this company going forward. In the U.S., we're currently looking at dozens of relatively small companies. They run the gamut from businesses that are in the property management business, the mortgage business, to the leasing or sales.''
 Trammell Crow, meanwhile, acquired a 30 percent interest in Chesterton Meghraj Property Consultants of India last year, and doubled its stake in Savills, a British company that has a presence in China, to nearly 20 percent. Trammell Crow's chairman and chief executive, Robert E. Sulentic, said the company saw tremendous growth potential for outsourcing services in India, in particular. ''A lot of our big domestic customers have an interest in doing business there,'' he said. ''It started out with call centers and has gone way beyond that.'' 
 The company's earnings grew 52 percent last year, to $59.4 million from $39.1 million, and on Thursday it reported a climb of 79 percent in its net income in the first quarter.
 Analysts say the company's strong point is in development. ''Trammel is by far the leader in that area,'' said Mr. Baldwin at Baldwin Anthony Securities. 
 Trammell Crow, based in Dallas, has several major projects in the works, including 2000 Avenue of the Stars, a 12-story office building near the company's Century Plaza Towers in West Los Angeles, and an office building and surgery center for the Memorial Hermann Healthcare System in the Houston area. Providing services to the health care industry ''is something that we're hanging our hats on for future growth,'' Mr. Sulentic added.
 Many analysts think that the prospects for future growth will help to support the market values for commercial services companies. 
 ''A year ago, if you looked at CB Richard Ellis and Jones Lang stock prices, they were about half of what they are today; they're now more fairly valued,'' said David Gold, an analyst at Sidoti & Company who nonetheless thinks that prices are likely to continue to rise. 
 If the investment climate is favorable, why aren't more commercial real estate services companies choosing to go public? 
 LoopNet, which operates a Web site listing commercial real estate properties for sale or lease, recently announced plans for an initial public offering. 
 But other than Cushman & Wakefield, which has no immediate plans for an offering, ''there are very few other companies that are large enough to go public,'' said Mr. Marks.

HEADLINE: Challenging Toyota's Hybrid Hegemony

BYLINE: By LINDSAY BROOKE

 BODY:
IF the crossword puzzle clue is ''hybrid car,'' the answer is probably ''Prius.'' Since Toyota brought that model to the United States six years ago, the company has basked in a green public-relations glow -- even though Honda was first with a modern gas-electric car (the Insight) and Ford sold the first hybrid S.U.V. (the Escape).
 But with a mix of creative engineering, clever promotion and fortunate timing, Toyota has set the de facto standard for the entire class of eco-friendly vehicles. It has licensed its software to Ford and is selling hybrid components to Nissan. Toyota has half a dozen hybrid models in showrooms or on the way -- twice as many as any other automaker -- ranging from the miserly Prius to the $100,000-plus Lexus LS 600hL.
Yet the domination of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive is coming under assault from some of the auto industry's top engineers. For more than a year, in nondescript buildings in Troy, Mich., north of Detroit, a German-American consortium of BMW, DaimlerChrysler and General Motors has been working quietly to develop a distinctly different type of hybrid powertrain. 
 On Friday, the consortium's top executives formally unveiled that system, which they call a two-mode hybrid, at an industry conference in Vienna. Until then, most important details were kept under wraps by the joint development group, called the Global Hybrid Cooperation. 
 The two-mode system will be available in a wide range of cars, trucks and S.U.V.'s made by the three companies, starting with the 2008 Chevrolet Tahoe that goes on sale in fall 2007. G.M. says that compared with conventional Tahoes, the hybrid version will achieve 25 percent better mileage in combined city and highway driving.
 While the two-mode system takes a new approach to hybrid drive technology, there are some similarities. Like all hybrids, the two-mode combines the power of a gasoline engine with that of electric motors; it captures energy from braking that would otherwise be lost; and it shuts off the engine at a stop. Like most of today's hybrids, batteries alone can power the vehicle at low speeds.
 But the new technology is different in some crucial respects. It has the potential to operate much more efficiently at highway speeds, with a greater boost from the electric motors. The components are lighter and more compact and can be readily adapted to different types of vehicles. It is particularly well suited to large trucks and S.U.V.'s -- the biggest gas hogs in Americans' garages -- where it will have the greatest impact on overall fuel consumption. 
 Larry Nitz, hybrid engineering director of G.M. and an executive in the consortium, noted that hybrid technology had not gained a foothold in these heavy vehicles. Big luxury cars from BMW, Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz are also candidates for the system.
 Existing hybrid systems have a single mode of operation, using a single planetary gear set to split the engine's power -- routing it to drive the wheels or charge the battery -- for both city and highway driving. 
 These systems are effective at low speeds because they can move the car without running the gas engine. But at higher speeds, when the engine is needed, using the electric motors has much less benefit; sending power through electric motors and a variable transmission is roughly 20 percent less efficient than driving the car through a purely mechanical power path, using gears.
 Also, driving a single-mode vehicle at higher speeds by electric power requires larger, heavier, costlier electric motors, and is less than ideal for towing or hauling.
 The two-mode system also has a variable transmission but adds two planetary gear sets (which multiply the torque from the power source). This arrangement provides two operating modes for the electric motors. The first is for accelerating from a standstill to second gear; another phase takes the car from second gear to overdrive.
 The system adds two clutches, which can engage different gear combinations to provide an overlay of four fixed (not variable) gear ratios. To the driver, these feel and function like the stepped gear changes of an automatic transmission. 
 Because the torque is multiplied by the gears, the electric motors can be much smaller -- small enough, in fact, to fit in the same housing as the transmission. And because the whole package is so tidy and integrated, it can be manufactured in modules that each of the three companies can install on its own cars and trucks.
 ''Ours offers the mechanical power path that's more efficient than a one-mode's mostly electric path,'' Mr. Nitz, the G.M. engineer, said. 
 The two-mode system also makes better use of cylinder-deactivation systems -- these shut down half the cylinders when not needed, improving gas mileage -- of the G.M. and Chrysler V-8's that will power many of the hybrid trucks and S.U.V.'s. 
 Hybrid sales in the United States have roughly doubled in four of the last five years, a fact regularly cited by supporters of the technology. But the roughly 206,000 hybrid cars and trucks sold in the last year amounted to only 1.2 percent of the total auto market. The Prius accounted for slightly more than half of hybrids sold in 2005. 
 ''There is still a lot of guessing about the hybrid customer,'' said Andreas Truckenbrodt, an executive director of the two-mode consortium who works for DaimlerChrysler. ''And how long will he be willing to pay extra for hybrids?'' 
 The consortium's two-mode system is a scaled-down evolution of a heavy-duty hybrid powertrain developed by Allison, a unit of G.M.'s powertrain group, that is used in more than 400 hybrid-electric city buses. Development began in the 1990's as an outgrowth of G.M.'s short-lived EV-1 electric car.
 G.M. and DaimlerChrysler formed the consortium in 2005 after learning that they were working on similar approaches. BMW then signed on.
 The two-mode system will be the first ''full hybrid'' from G.M., DaimlerChrysler or BMW, finally giving them technology to counter Toyota, which is developing its third-generation hybrid. A full hybrid is capable of driving the vehicle on battery power alone at low speeds. 
 Because the two-mode design uses some off-the-shelf components and spreads costs across three companies, it should be less expensive. High costs have hindered mainstream acceptance of hybrids, said Wolfgang Epple, vice president for BMW's program and a consortium director.
 Despite the common parts, the system will be calibrated to match each company's engines and brand character, Dr. Epple said. He promised that a two-mode installed in a BMW X5 sport wagon, for example, would feel and perform differently from one installed in a Cadillac Escalade or Dodge Durango.
 The system is being configured for both rear- and front-drive applications, and is designed to be easily scaled up or downsized, depending on a vehicle's type, size and power. 
 Having the automakers share a common design and manufacturing operation -- the transmission will be produced at a G.M. plant in Baltimore next year -- also helps to lower costs through economies of scale.
 The plant is capable of building more than 300,000 transmissions a year. Whether they are two-mode hybrids or conventional six-speed automatics will depend on demand. According to a recent forecast by CSM Worldwide, an industry research company in Farmington Hills, Mich., the three automakers' two-mode production could reach 83,000 by 2010; well over half of those units will go into full-size G.M. trucks, CSM said.
 Eric Fedewa, director of global powertrain forecasting at CSM, said the two-mode system would bring benefits beyond fuel efficiency to larger trucks and cars. ''Smooth running on the battery alone at low speed gives added refinement to trucks in particular,'' he said.

(pg. 4)Chart/Diagram: ''A New Generation of Fuel Savers''Engineers are exploring new ways to integrate gasoline engines and electric motors. A cooperative venture of General Motors, BMW and DaimlerChrysler will introduce a ''two mode'' hybrid system next year that it says is an advance over today's technology, especially for large vehicles and for driving at higher speeds.With its electric motors and variable-ratio transmission contained in a single housing, the two-mode system can be readily adapted to a variety of models.With four fixed gear ratios, it is possible to use smaller electric motors, making the system potentially lighter and less expensive.On the highway, the two-mode design lets the electric motors deliver an extra boost while using much less battery power. That helps to keep the gasoline engine operating at peak economy.

HEADLINE: Jobs Data May Guide The Fed 

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WALL STREET expects the economy to have added about 200,000 jobs in April, a not-too-strong, not-too-weak number that would be near the middle of the range for the last several months. 
 If the forecast proves correct when the government employment report is released on Friday, the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to take a break from its relentless interest rate increases, said Edward E. Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates.
 ''The Fed is not against economic growth,'' he said. ''The main concern is whether all these jobs that are being created lead to inflation.''
 The fact that inflation has remained quiescent, after energy and food prices are factored out, is the crux of what Mr. Yardeni called ''the Bernanke conundrum.''
 ''The economy and employment are doing well, and yet core inflation has remained remarkably subdued,'' he said. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his colleagues would find that puzzling because, in a conventional economic cycle, hiring expands and pushes up labor costs, and consumer prices follow suit. 
 ''I don't think they want to overdo it to find an inflation problem that is not really visible,'' Mr. Yardeni said. But he said that only an intermission -- not the finale -- of the Fed's tightening cycle might be visible. Another one-quarter point increase in May is a done deal, he said; after that, he anticipates no action in June, then another increase in August.
 Comments made by Mr. Bernanke to a congressional panel on Thursday were taken by traders as a signal that just such a pause might be coming, although there was no hint of when it might occur.
 But if the jobs number overshoots the market's prediction -- a Bloomberg News poll of economists estimates 200,000 net new jobs in April, after 211,000 in March -- then investors should not count on that pause in June, Mr. Yardeni said.
 ''The real surprise would be a really strong number, say, 250,000'' net new jobs, Mr. Yardeni said. In that case, he warned, ''May is definitely not the last increase.'' Such a high number of new jobs ''would completely change the perception of the strength of the economy,'' he said, ''and people would anticipate more rate hikes.''

DATA WATCH -- One way to maintain job creation at just the right pace that minimizes inflation is to have an economy that runs as efficiently as possible. Two statistics on Thursday, on productivity and unit labor costs, will help show whether such efficiency is being achieved.
 In the Bloomberg poll, productivity is projected to have increased by 2.9 percent, at an annual rate, in the first quarter, after a decline of 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter last year. In line with a forecast of better productivity, unit labor costs are expected to have risen by 1.3 percent in the first quarter, compared with 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: From Mean Streets to Clean Streets

BYLINE: By JOHN CLARK

 BODY:
OVER the last several years, New York has become a kind of permanent film set, a glorified back lot, replete with enormous trailers, groaning craft-services tables, blazing lights and barking production assistants. A partial list of coming films that were shot or are scheduled to shoot in the city includes ''August Rush'' (starring Robin Williams), ''Pride and Glory'' (Colin Farrell), ''Perfect Stranger'' (Bruce Willis), ''Che'' (Benicio Del Toro), ''American Gangster'' (Russell Crowe), ''Michael Clayton'' (George Clooney) and ''The Nanny Diaries'' (Scarlett Johansson).
 It's a far cry from the lean days when the director Sidney Lumet shot Times Square through a car windshield for ''Stage Struck'' (1958) and filmed street dancers for the shattering finale to ''Fail Safe'' (1964). ''I grabbed those shots at the end of 'Fail Safe' from streets around the studio, on 10th Avenue and 54th, where the Puerto Ricans sat on the steps in the summertime,'' he said in a recent interview in his small theater-district office. ''We didn't have any money.'' 
Now, of course, entire blocks would be shut down to film those exteriors. The city has changed along with the budgets and scale of today's studio films. Times Square, once home to drug dealers, prostitutes and beleaguered theaters, has morphed into a Mickey Mouse mall. The West 50's, formerly part of the notorious Hell's Kitchen, have sprouted condos, fancy restaurants and the Comedy Central studio. Nobody knows this better than Mr. Lumet, who grew up on the Lower East Side, around Second Street and Avenue A. 
 ''When I was kid,'' he said, ''you didn't dare walk on an Irish or Italian block, and they didn't dare walk on our block, which was Jewish. But that is gone. It's getting very chic down there.''
 It's gotten very chic almost everywhere in Manhattan. And while that may be good for those who live in the city, it's not necessarily a good thing for filmmakers seeking qualities that can't be found anywhere else. ''As America has gotten more like New York, New York has become more like America,'' said James Sanders, editor of ''Scenes From the City: Filmmaking in New York, 1966-2006,'' to be published by Rizzoli this fall.
 Even as more and more movies and television shows are being shot in New York, the city that turns up on the screen is far more likely to be the teeming, terrifying, exhilarating, unforgiving New York of the popular imagination. Kevin Lima's coming film ''Enchanted,'' for example, is about a peasant girl who is banished from her fairy-tale world to a New York that is both gritty and romanticized. As Mr. Lumet put it, ''If a director comes in from California and doesn't know the city at all, he picks the Empire State Building and all the postcard shots -- and that, of course, isn't the city.'' To many filmmakers, the postcard is all that's left.
 David Thomson, author of The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, said: ''There's been a sea change. I can remember well into the 70's films where there is the terrific sense of New York as being this adventurous place. Certainly if you go back to the 30's and think of a film like 'My Man Godfrey,' New York is a great, dangerous playground. Those films really had a sense of how jazzy and exciting it was to be in New York. I can't think of the last film I've seen that had that feeling.'' 
 Paul Mazursky, the Brooklyn-born director of New York films like ''Next Stop, Greenwich Village'' (1976) and ''An Unmarried Woman'' (1978), echoed this view: ''I'm trying to think of the last good New York movie.'' (He's still thinking.)
 For Mr. Sanders, the essential challenge facing today's filmmakers is: ''Can you make character stories in a city without character? There is a sense that the city is an ordinary place.'' 
 To a large extent, the driving force behind the flood of productions is less creative than pedestrian: New York offers competitive logistics and cost efficiencies. There been a big expansion of studio space, thanks to facilities like Silvercup Studios in Queens and Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, and the state and city offer tax rebates of 15 percent to filmmakers who shoot at least 75 percent of their movies in New York City. 
 These new economies have opened the door for films that might have been shot elsewhere in the past, notably in Toronto, which has long been a cheaper substitute for New York City exteriors. In fact, the stories nowadays don't even have to be specific to the city: Martin Scorsese, a quintessential New Yorker, let the city stand in for Boston in some scenes for his next movie, ''The Departed.'' (And some recent films set squarely in New York have been shot elsewhere, as when Peter Jackson used technical wizardry to reconstruct Depression-era Manhattan in New Zealand for ''King Kong'' and Oliver Stone repaired to a set near Marina del Rey in Southern California to shoot ground zero for his coming 9/11 project, ''World Trade Center.'')
 Even now, though, shooting a big-budget movie is still expensive enough that most filmmakers need a good reason to shoot in the city. Robert Greenhut, who has produced more than 20 Woody Allen films and is currently an executive producer of Kirsten Sheridan's ''August Rush,'' said that reason is often the city's character, which endures, even in muted form. 
 ''New Yorkers' personalities are different than Chicago,'' he said. ''It's a different kind of hard-edged. There's a certain kind of vibrancy and tone that you can't get elsewhere.'' 
 Mr. Greenhut, who recently presided over a scene in Irving Plaza that featured 300 extras, added: ''The labor pool is more interesting than elsewhere -- the salesgirl with one line, or the cop. That's who directors are looking for.''
 Traditionally, one of the most cinematically exploitable aspects of New York has been its reputation as a cauldron of organized crime, corruption and narcotics. The author and screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi (''GoodFellas'') said Hollywood reflected, or at least dramatized, this reality in the 30's with gangster films like ''The Roaring Twenties.'' In the 50's, he said, it was ''the corrupt city exemplified by 'Sweet Smell of Success,' '' with its malevolent gossip columnist, J. J. Hunsecker. In the 60's, ''narcotics arrive and the city becomes a horrendous place.'' The director William Friedkin memorably hammered home this point in 1971 with ''The French Connection,'' in which the hero cop, played by Gene Hackman, is nearly as corrupt and brutish as the criminals he's chasing.
 Eventually Mr. Friedkin and other filmmakers were deprived of much of this subject matter (unless they were making period movies) by, among other things, the success of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Of course, there's still plenty of New York crime, especially on television. ''Law & Order'' and the proliferation of ''Law & Order'' spinoffs are all shot in the city, but Mr. Sanders emphasized that the word ''order'' in these titles suggests that ''crime is treated as an aberration, and it's corrected.'' 
 ''Order'' had another meaning in the New York of the 60's and 70's. It also referred to the social order, which was seen as threatened by crime and by transit, newspaper and garbage strikes. A slew of films, many of them black comedies, documented this period: ''Midnight Cowboy'' (1969), ''Little Murders'' (1971), ''Death Wish'' (1974), ''Dog Day Afternoon'' (1975), ''Taxi Driver'' (1976). As the film critic Pauline Kael wrote in The New Yorker in 1971, ''I doubt if at any other time in American movie history there has been such a close relationship between the life on the screen and the life of a portion of the audience.'' 
 The city, of course, has since prospered, as has much of the audience. As Mr. Pileggi put it, Ratso Rizzo, the slimy hustler in ''Midnight Cowboy,'' ''wouldn't be hanging around those Disney joints'' in Times Square. Still, Mr. Sanders said, living in Manhattan has always been a struggle, at least for some people, and on-screen characters have been squabbling for ages about certain subjects -- like New York rents. '' 'Rosemary's Baby' opens up with a discussion that they can't afford the apartment,'' Mr. Sanders said of the Roman Polanski film from 1968. But it's worth noting that the most visually aggressive recent exploration of the subject, Chris Columbus's ''Rent,'' was shot in no small part on a soundstage in Burbank; a fable about the eternal battle between bohemians and the bourgeoisie found its look on the Warner lot.
 Certainly some local directors -- in particular Spike Lee, most recently with ''Inside Man'' -- continue to make movies that display an intimate knowledge of New York. And independent filmmakers, who have a long pedigree in the city dating back to John Cassavetes's first film as a director, ''Shadows'' (1959), have stepped in to tell small stories about daily life, or about figures too marginal to merit the big-studio treatment (''Basquiat,'' for example, and ''Pollock,'' both about New York artists). The directors Noah Baumbach (''The Squid and the Whale'') and Dylan Kidd (''Roger Dodger,'' ''P.S.'') have continued the tradition of depicting quirky, neurotic New Yorkers. The Tribeca Film Festival, which closes May 7, has an entire series consisting of 13 independent films about New York. 
 But many filmmakers have to burrow deeper or look farther afield for fresh perspectives on New York life. Mr. Mazursky has devised an idea for a New York film about, he said, ''this old guy, somewhat like me, who goes back to New York and can't find it; he meets his old friends, who are doddering wrecks, and their kids, some of them doing well, some of them not.'' 
 Mr. Sanders foresees a new crop of filmmakers who will chart new territory in movies about the crosscurrents emanating from ethnic neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. ''We are going to see the story of a Pakistani kid meeting the Hindu kid,'' he said. In fact, he added, because the very nature of the city forces people into close contact with one another, New York still transcends the malls, the box stores and the coming of Trader Joe's. ''There is no rival for the life of the street,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''You run into lovers, ex-lovers. There are so many ways for different kinds of people to meet each other. That has never changed.''

HEADLINE: If No One Utters 'Housing Bubble,' No One Need Worry

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
A pyramid scheme, with each new round of players making earlier rounds richer, is a foolproof way to make money -- until it isn't. What is the breaking point? Probably about the time some spoilsport whispers ''pyramid scheme,'' and there's a mad dash for the exits. 
 Echoes of housing prices? Not exactly, because you can't flee the housing market without living on the street. Still, an almost pyramid-like frenzy has engulfed some areas in recent years, with buyers paying ever-loftier prices for homes, convinced that within months they will find someone who will pay even more for them.
If there are whispers of a ''housing bubble'' -- ominous words that could make check-writing hands distinctly shaky -- most people still haven't heard them. As recently as a year ago, according to a survey by the Gallup Organization, just 23 percent of Americans were even moderately familiar with the term. In the latest survey, that jumped to 40 percent. 
 And 24 percent now say that a bubble is likely within a year -- though, naturally, only 7 percent expect it in their own backyard. HUBERT B. HERRING

HEADLINE: Challenge for a New Iraqi Leader

 BODY:
A great deal now depends on the wisdom and skills of Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the man who emerged from relative political obscurity last weekend to become Iraq's prime minister-designate. His actions over the next weeks will determine whether Iraq can reverse the drift toward sectarian civil war and build a national government. If it can, the more than 130,000 American troops now in Iraq will have a definable mission to achieve and a definable exit strategy. If not, America's predicament in Iraq will very likely only grow worse. 
 That's why Washington was right to use all the leverage it had to encourage the disastrous former prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, to withdraw his candidacy for a second term. Mr. Maliki comes from the same Shiite fundamentalist milieu as Mr. Jaafari. But there are at least some reasons to hope he can be a more effective leader.
His single biggest challenge will be to break the power of the Shiite party militias operating inside and outside the official security forces. These have terrorized Sunni neighborhoods and tortured Sunni detainees with impunity for much of the past year. 
 Mr. Maliki has won praise for pledging that only government forces will be allowed to carry arms. But that will do little good if he merely merges militia units into the Iraqi army and police forces as he suggested Thursday in deference to a crucial political ally, Moktada al-Sadr, who happens to head one of the deadliest Shiite militias. If that turns out to be Mr. Maliki's plan, there can be little hope of avoiding civil war. 
 It seems unlikely that the Sunni and Kurdish parties that welcomed Mr. Maliki's nomination as part of a larger power-sharing arrangement would settle for such an unsatisfactory non-solution to the country's most dangerous problem. The commitments and compromises that lubricated that deal should become clearer when Mr. Maliki unveils his new cabinet, which he now says will be done as soon as next week. It is now more than four months since Iraqis voted for a new government, and while the politicians dickered, the country has been falling apart. Mr. Maliki needs to choose both quickly and wisely. 
 It is encouraging that he has promised to keep the Defense and Interior Ministries out of the hands of sectarian politicians. He also needs to make sure that his appointees to key economic ministries, including the Oil Ministry, put competent professionals in charge of day-to-day management. And the Constitution should be adjusted to assure the central government a sufficient share of Iraq's oil revenues. 
 If all these pieces fall into place -- a long shot -- it's possible to imagine things finally turning around in Iraq. The first test will be whether Mr. Maliki starts confronting powerful allies like Mr. Sadr over the future role of the militias, and insists that the Iraqi Army and police forces take their orders only from a broad-based national government.

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld Learns to Curb His Enthusiasm

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
THERE were Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld last week, standing before the cameras in the heavily fortified American headquarters on the Tigris River, proclaiming that another little-known former Iraqi exile, the third in two years, had just had greatness thrust upon him. Only Ms. Rice, the secretary of state, seemed able to summon enthusiasm.
 ''Our message here was that the United States wants to be a supportive partner in this work,'' Ms. Rice said, speaking of the new prime minister designate, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who became the nominee of the Shiite political bloc after a long and bitter stalemate. At the news conference, Mr. Rumsfeld made plain his eagerness to hand off the task of nation-building to Ms. Rice, and his lack of interest in the process. He was, for example, seen doodling at a news conference while Ms. Rice went on at length about her hopes and dreams for Iraq's future. 
The scenes were a stark contrast to 2003, when the Pentagon eagerly seized the reins in Iraq, sidelined State Department experts and took control of the political and economic reconstruction. Now Mr. Rumsfeld seemed content to focus on training Iraqi forces so he can get American troops out. 
 Asked if any Iraqis told him they wanted fewer American troops here, the defense secretary responded that they didn't say that, but he did.
 The joint appearance inevitably raised questions about how much a recent barrage of criticism has hurt his position.
 His aides said he had weathered the demands for his resignation from several retired generals, among others, who say he committed colossal blunders in prosecuting the war. If anything, the aides said, such calls have guaranteed that Mr. Rumsfeld will stay, because no American president can be seen to bow to the demands of a handful of retired generals, however much their criticism is echoed in public and private from others.
 ''Those generals have given him a new lease on life,'' said one Rumsfeld loyalist. 
 But while President Bush has remained publicly confident of Mr. Rumsfeld, some people close to the White House, who insisted on anonymity while discussing the president's situation, say he is acutely aware of past Pentagon mistakes and that this may have been behind his decision to order the defense secretary to go to Baghdad alongside Ms. Rice.
 Another sign of presidential disenchantment, some officials say, is Mr. Bush's willingness to have former Secretary of State James A. Baker III help lead a bipartisan committee authorized by Congress to come up with ''fresh ideas'' to salvage Iraq. 
 One thing that was clear on the trip was the extent to which the war itself has changed in the last year. Critics of administration policies used to say that everything could be solved if only the United Nations were brought in to broker the political process and more foreign troops joined the effort to secure the countryside. But such talk seems to have vanished.
 The reason is that the biggest security problem now, according to defense officials, is not the Sunni-dominated insurgency's efforts to overthrow the government but infiltration by thousands of Shiite militia members into the Iraqi Interior Ministry's security forces, from which they initiate violence against Sunnis. The result has been a cycle of violence between Sunnis and Shiites that no foreign army seems able to stop. 
 Ms. Rice and Mr. Rumsfeld agreed that only Iraqi political reconciliation can end the spiral of retaliatory killings. But there, too, their enthusiasm levels were different. 
 What can the United States really do to help? Not much, Mr. Rumsfeld seemed to be saying. The Iraqis, many Pentagon officials agree, have to do the job themselves. 
 Ms. Rice seemed to accept that the responsibility has fallen to the State Department to at least try to superintend the task. She has ordered a strengthening of Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad's political team and assigned one of her top aides to work with Mr. Maliki to set up his office. 
 What are the prospects? The first step, one embassy official sardonically observed, was to get cellphones for Mr. Maliki's aides so they would return calls. The next step is to help Mr. Maliki get the power grid back up, secure Baghdad and rebuild Iraq in a way Iraqis will notice. American training of Iraqi security forces must continue. 
 But even if all that can be accomplished, some State Department officials wondered whether the trip by Ms. Rice would backfire. In its wake, some acknowledged, Mr. Maliki and his government might look more than ever like American pawns. ''Is this a kiss of death?'' one American official asked.
 When Ms. Rice herself was asked that, she noted that 11 million Iraqis voted to elect the lawmakers who now seem to be coalescing behind the untested Mr. Maliki, and that this must count for something.
 ''There are leaders here,'' she asserted. ''And I'm quite certain the great majority of the Iraqi people are determined that they will not be torn apart.''

PERSON: John Kenneth Galbraith

HEADLINE: John Kenneth Galbraith, 97, Dies; Economist Held a Mirror to Society

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE and DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
John Kenneth Galbraith, the iconoclastic economist, teacher and diplomat and an unapologetically liberal member of the political and academic establishment that he needled in prolific writings for more than half a century, died yesterday at a hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 97.
 Mr. Galbraith lived in Cambridge and at an ''unfarmed farm'' near Newfane, Vt. His death was confirmed by his son J. Alan Galbraith.
Mr. Galbraith was one of the most widely read authors in the history of economics; among his 33 books was ''The Affluent Society'' (1958), one of those rare works that forces a nation to re-examine its values. He wrote fluidly, even on complex topics, and many of his compelling phrases -- among them ''the affluent society,'' ''conventional wisdom'' and ''countervailing power'' -- became part of the language. 
 An imposing presence, lanky and angular at 6 feet 8 inches tall, Mr. Galbraith was consulted frequently by national leaders, and he gave advice freely, though it may have been ignored as often as it was taken. Mr. Galbraith clearly preferred taking issue with the conventional wisdom he distrusted. 
 He strived to change the very texture of the national conversation about power and its nature in the modern world by explaining how the planning of giant corporations superseded market mechanisms. His sweeping ideas, which might have gained even greater traction had he developed disciples willing and able to prove them with mathematical models, came to strike some as almost quaint in today's harsh, interconnected world where corporations devour one another.
 ''The distinctiveness of his contribution appears to be slipping from view,'' Stephen P. Dunn wrote in The Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics in 2002.
 Mr. Galbraith, a revered lecturer for generations of Harvard students, nonetheless always commanded attention.
 Robert Lekachman, a liberal economist who shared many of Mr. Galbraith's views on an affluent society that they both thought not generous enough to its poor or sufficiently attendant to its public needs, once described the quality of his discourse as ''witty, supple, eloquent, and edged with that sheen of malice which the fallen sons of Adam always find attractive when it is directed at targets other than themselves.'' 
 From the 1930's to the 1990's, Mr. Galbraith helped define the terms of the national political debate, influencing the direction of the Democratic Party and the thinking of its leaders. 
 He tutored Adlai E. Stevenson, the Democratic nominee for president in 1952 and 1956, on Keynesian economics. He advised President John F. Kennedy (often over lobster stew at the Locke-Ober restaurant in their beloved Boston) and served as his ambassador to India. 
 Though he eventually broke with President Lyndon B. Johnson over the war in Vietnam, he helped conceive Mr. Johnson's Great Society program and wrote a major presidential address that outlined its purposes. In 1968, pursuing his opposition to the war, he helped Senator Eugene J. McCarthy seek the Democratic nomination for president.
 In the course of his long career, he undertook a number of government assignments, including the organization of price controls in World War II and speechwriting for Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kennedy and Johnson. 
 He drew on his experiences in government to write three satirical novels. One in 1968, ''The Triumph,'' a best seller, was an assault on the State Department's slapstick attempts to assist a mythical banana republic, Puerto Santos. In 1990, he took on the Harvard economics department with ''A Tenured Professor,'' ridiculing, among others, a certain outspoken character who bore no small resemblance to himself. 
 At his death Mr. Galbraith was the Paul M. Warburg emeritus professor of economics at Harvard, where he had taught for most of his career. A popular lecturer, he treated economics as an aspect of society and culture rather than as an arcane discipline of numbers. 

Keeping It Simple
 Mr. Galbraith was admired, envied and sometimes scorned for his eloquence and wit and his ability to make complicated, dry issues understandable to any educated reader. He enjoyed his international reputation as a slayer of sacred cows and a maverick among economists whose pronouncements became known as ''classic Galbraithian heresies.'' 
 But other economists, even many of his fellow liberals, did not generally share his views on production and consumption, and he was not regarded by his peers as among the top-ranked theorists and scholars. Such criticism did not sit well with Mr. Galbraith, a man no one ever called modest, and he would respond that his critics had rightly recognized that his ideas were ''deeply subversive of the established orthodoxy.''
 ''As a matter of vested interest, if not of truth,'' he added, ''they were compelled to resist.'' He once said, ''Economists are economical, among other things, of ideas; most make those of their graduate days last a lifetime.'' 
 Nearly 40 years after writing ''The Affluent Society,'' Mr. Galbraith updated it in 1996 as ''The Good Society.'' In it, he said that his earlier concerns had only worsened: that if anything, America had become even more a ''democracy of the fortunate,'' with the poor increasingly excluded from a fair place at the table.
 Mr. Galbraith gave broad thought to how America changed from a nation of small farms and workshops to one of big factories and superstores, and judgments of this legacy are as broad as his ambition. Beginning with ''American Capitalism'' in 1952, he laid out a detailed critique of an increasingly oligopolistic economy. Combined with works in the 1950's by writers like David Reisman, Vance Packard and William H. Whyte, the book changed people's views of the postwar world.
 Mr. Galbraith argued that technology mandated long-term contracts to diminish high-stakes uncertainty. He said companies used advertising to induce consumers to buy things they had never dreamed they needed. 
 Other economists, like Gary S. Becker and George J. Stigler, both Nobel Prize winners, countered with proofs showing that advertising is essentially informative rather than manipulative.
 Many viewed Mr. Galbraith as the leading scion of the American institutionalist school of economics, commonly associated with Thorstein Veblen and his idea of ''conspicuous consumption.'' This school deplored the universal pretensions of economic theory, and stressed the importance of historical and social factors in shaping ''economic laws.''
 Some, therefore, said Mr. Galbraith might best be called an ''economic sociologist.'' This view was reinforced by Mr. Galbraith's nontechnical phrasing, called glibness by the envious and antagonistic. 
 Mr. Galbraith's pride in following in the tradition of Veblen was challenged by the emergence of what came to be called the new institutionalist school. This approach, associated with the University of Chicago, claimed to prove that economics determines historical and political change, not vice versa.
 Some suggested that Mr. Galbraith's liberalism crippled his influence. In a review of ''John Kenneth Galbraith: His Life, His Politics, His Economics'' by Richard Parker (Farrar, 2005), J. Bradford DeLong wrote in Foreign Affairs that Mr. Galbraith's lifelong sermon of social democracy was destined to fail in a land of ''rugged individualism.'' He compared Mr. Galbraith to Sisyphus, endlessly pushing the same rock up a hill that always turns out to be too steep.
 Amartya Sen, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, maintains that Mr. Galbraith not only reached but also defined the summit of his field. In the 2000 commencement address at Harvard, Mr. Parker's book recounts, Mr. Sen said the influence of ''The Affluent Society'' was so pervasive that its many piercing insights were taken for granted.
 ''It's like reading 'Hamlet' and deciding it's full of quotations,'' he said. 
 John Kenneth Galbraith was born Oct. 15, 1908, on a 150-acre farm in Dunwich Township in southern Ontario, Canada, the only son of William Archibald and Catherine Kendall Galbraith. His forebears had left Scotland years before.
 His father was a farmer and schoolteacher, the head of a farm-cooperative insurance company, an organizer of the township telephone company, and a town and county auditor. His mother, whom he described as beautiful but decidedly firm, died when he was 14.

The Farming Life
 Mr. Galbraith said in his memoir ''A Life in Our Times'' (1981) that no one could understand farming without knowing two things about it: a farmer's sense of inferiority and his appreciation of manual labor. His own sense of inferiority, he said, was coupled with his belief that the Galbraith clan was more intelligent, knowledgeable and affluent than its neighbors.
 ''My legacy was the inherent insecurity of the farm-reared boy in combination with the aggressive feeling that I owed to all I encountered to make them better informed,'' he said.
 Mr. Galbraith said he inherited his liberalism, his interest in politics and his wit from his father. When he was about 8, he once recalled, he would join his father at political rallies. At one event, he wrote in his 1964 memoir ''The Scotch,'' his father mounted a large pile of manure to address the crowd. 
 ''He apologized with ill-concealed sincerity for speaking from the Tory platform,'' Mr. Galbraith related. ''The effect on this agrarian audience was electric. Afterward I congratulated him on the brilliance of the sally. He said, 'It was good but it didn't change any votes.' '' 
 At age 18 he enrolled at Ontario Agricultural College, where he took practical farming courses like poultry husbandry and basic plumbing. But as the Depression dragged down Canadian farmers, the questions of the way farm products were sold and at what prices became more urgent to him than how they were produced. He completed his undergraduate work at the University of Toronto and enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his master's degree in 1933 and his doctorate in agricultural economics in 1934.
 A major influence on him was the caustic social commentary he found in Veblen's ''Theory of the Leisure Class.'' Mr. Galbraith called Veblen one of American history's most astute social scientists, but also acknowledged that he tended to be overcritical.
 ''I've thought to resist this tendency,'' Mr. Galbraith said, ''but in other respects Veblen's influence on me has lasted long. One of my greatest pleasures in my writing has come from the thought that perhaps my work might annoy someone of comfortably pretentious position. Then comes the realization that such people rarely read.''
 While at Berkeley, he began contributing to The Journal of Farm Economics and other publications. His writings came to the attention of Harvard, where he became an instructor and tutor from 1934 to 1939. In those years the theories of John Maynard Keynes were exciting economists everywhere because they promised solutions to the most urgent problems of the time: the Depression and unemployment. The government must intervene in moments of crisis, Lord Keynes maintained, and unbalance the budget if necessary to prime the pump and get the nation's economic machinery running again.
 Keynesianism gave economic validation to what President Roosevelt was doing, Mr. Galbraith thought, and he resolved in 1937 ''to go to the temple'' -- Cambridge University -- on a fellowship grant for a year of study with the disciples of Lord Keynes.
 In 1937 Mr. Galbraith married Catherine Merriam Atwater, the daughter of a prominent New York lawyer and a linguist, whom he met when she was a graduate student at Radcliffe. 
 In addition to his wife and his son J. Alan, of Washington, a lawyer, he is survived by two other sons, Peter, a former United States ambassador to Croatia and a senior fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation in Washington, and James, an economist at the University of Texas; a sister, Catherine Denholm of Toronto; and six grandchildren. 
 Mr. Galbraith became an American citizen, and taught economics at Princeton in 1939. But after the fall of France in 1940, Mr. Galbraith joined the Roosevelt administration to help manage an economy being prepared for war. He rose to become the administrator of wage and price controls in the Office of Price Administration. Prices remained stable, but he grew controversial, drawing the constant fire of industry complaints. ''I reached the point that all price fixers reach,'' he said, ''My enemies outnumbered my friends.'' 
 He was forced to resign in 1943 and was rejected by the Army as too tall when he sought to enlist. He then held a variety of government and private jobs, including director of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey in 1945, director of the Office of Economic Security Policy in the State Department in 1946, and a member of the board of editors of Fortune magazine from 1943 to 1948. It was at Fortune, he said, that he became addicted to writing.
 In 1949 he returned to Harvard as a professor of economics; his lectures were delivered before standing-room-only audiences. And he began to write with intensity, rising early and writing at least two or three hours a day, before his normally full schedule of other duties began, for most of the rest of his life. 
 He completed two books in 1952, ''American Capitalism: The Concept of Countervailing Power'' and ''A Theory of Price Control.'' In ''American Capitalism,'' he set out to debunk myths about the free market economy and explore concentrations of economic power. He described the pressures that corporations and unions exerted on each other for increased profits and increased wages, and said these countervailing forces kept those giant groups in equilibrium and the nation's economy prosperous and stable.
 In his 1981 memoir, he said that though the basic idea was still sound, he had been ''a bit carried away'' by his notion of countervailing power. ''I made it far more inevitable and rather more equalizing than, in practice, it ever is,'' he wrote, adding that often it does not emerge, with the result that ''numerous groups -- the ghetto young, the rural poor, textile workers, many consumers -- remain weak or helpless.'' 
 He summarized the lessons of his days at the Office of Price Administration in ''A Theory of Price Control,'' later calling it the best book he ever wrote. He said: ''The only difficulty is that five people read it. Maybe 10. I made up my mind that I would never again place myself at the mercy of the technical economists who had the enormous power to ignore what I had written. I set out to involve a larger community.''
 He wrote two more major books in the 50's dealing with economics, but both were aimed at a large general audience. Both were best sellers.
 In ''The Great Crash 1929,'' he rattled the complacent, recalled the mistakes of an earlier day and suggested that some were being repeated as the book appeared, in 1955. Mr. Galbraith testified at a Senate hearing and said that another crash was inevitable. The stock market dropped sharply that day, and he was widely blamed. 
 ''The Affluent Society'' appeared in 1958, making Mr. Galbraith known around the world. In it, he depicted a consumer culture gone wild, rich in goods but poor in the social services that make for community. He argued that America had become so obsessed with overproducing consumer goods that it had increased the perils of both inflation and recession by creating an artificial demand for frivolous or useless products, by encouraging overextension of consumer credit and by emphasizing the private sector at the expense of the public sector. He declared that this obsession with products like the biggest and fastest automobile damaged the quality of life in America by creating ''private opulence and public squalor.''
 Anticipating the environmental movement by nearly a decade, he asked, ''Is the added production or the added efficiency in production worth its effect on ambient air, water and space -- the countryside?'' Mr. Galbraith called for a change in values that would shun the seductions of advertising and champion clean air, good housing and aid for the arts.
 Later, in ''The New Industrial State'' (1967), he tried to trace the shift of power from the landed aristocracy through the great industrialists to the technical and managerial experts of modern corporations. He called for a new class of intellectuals and professionals to determine policy. While critics, as usual, praised his ability to write compellingly, they also continued to complain that he oversimplified economic matters and either ignored or failed to keep up with corporate changes. Mr. Galbraith conceded some errors and revised his book in 1971.

A Move Into Politics
 One of his early readers was Adlai Stevenson, the governor of Illinois, who twice ran unsuccessfully for president against Dwight D. Eisenhower. Mr. Galbraith often wrote to Mr. Stevenson, introducing him to Keynesian taxation and unemployment policies. In 1953, Mr. Galbraith and Thomas K. Finletter, the former secretary of the Air Force and later ambassador to NATO, formed a sort of brain trust for Mr. Stevenson that included Ambassador W. Averell Harriman, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and the foreign policy specialist George W. Ball.
 Although Mr. Galbraith did not at first regard Kennedy, a former student of his at Harvard, as a serious member of Congress, he began to change his view after Kennedy was elected to the Senate in 1952 and began calling him for advice. The senator's conversations became increasingly wide-ranging and well informed, Mr. Galbraith said, and his respect and affection grew.
 After Mr. Kennedy won the presidency in 1960, he appointed Mr. Galbraith the United States ambassador to India. There were those, Mr. Galbraith among them, who believed that the president had done this to get a potential loose cannon out of Washington.
 He said in his memoir: ''Kennedy, I always believed, was pleased to have me in his administration, but at a suitable distance such as in India.'' Mr. Galbraith was fascinated with India; he had spent a year there in 1956 advising its government and was eager to return. 
 He spent 27 months as ambassador, clashed with the State Department and was more favorably regarded as a diplomat by those outside the government. He fought for increased American military and economic aid for India and acted as a sort of informal adviser to the Indian government on economic policy. Known by his staff as ''the Great Mogul,'' he achieved an excellent rapport with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and other senior officials in the Indian government. 
 When India became embroiled in a border war with China in the Himalayas in 1962, Ambassador Galbraith effectively took charge of both the American military and the diplomatic response during what was a brief but potentially explosive crisis. He saw to it that India received restrained American help and took it upon himself to announce that the United States recognized India's disputed northern borders. 
 The reason he had so much control over the American response, he said, was that the border fighting occurred during the far more consequential Cuban missile crisis, and no one at the highest levels at the White House, the State Department or the Pentagon was readily responding to his cables. 
 Mr. Galbraith published ''Ambassador's Journal: A Personal Account of the Kennedy Years,'' a book based on the diary he kept during his time in India, in 1969. A year earlier he published ''Indian Painting: The Scenes, Themes and Legends,'' which he wrote with Mohinder Singh Randhawa. An avid champion of Indian art, he donated much of his collection to the Harvard University Art Museums.
 In 1963, Mr. Galbraith added fiction to his repertory for the first time with ''The McLandress Dimension,'' a novel he wrote under the pseudonym Mark Epernay. 
 After Kennedy was assassinated, Mr. Galbraith served as an adviser to President Johnson, meeting with him often at the White House or on trips to the president's ranch in Texas to talk about what could be accomplished with the Great Society programs. Mr. Galbraith said that Johnson had summoned him to write the final draft of his speech outlining the purposes of the Great Society, and that when the writing was done, said: ''I'm not going to change a word. That's great.'' 
 The relationship between the two men soon broke apart over their differences over the war in Vietnam. Nevertheless, when Adlai Stevenson died in 1965, the ambassadorship to the United Nations became vacant, and word reached Mr. Galbraith that the president was considering him as Mr. Stevenson's successor.

A Job Declined
 Not wanting to be placed in the position of having to defend administration positions he strongly opposed, Mr. Galbraith suggested Justice Arthur J. Goldberg of the Supreme Court. The president named Mr. Goldberg, and Mr. Galbraith later blamed himself for a ''poisonous'' mistake that ''cost the court a good and liberal jurist.'' Others said he took too much credit for what happened. 
 In 1973 he published ''Economics and the Public Purpose,'' in which he sought to extend the planning system already used by the industrial core of the economy to the market economy, to small-business owners and to entrepreneurs. Mr. Galbraith called for a ''new socialism,'' with more steeply progressive taxes; public support of the arts; public ownership of housing, medical and transportation facilities; and the conversion of some corporations and military contractors into public corporations.
 He continued to rise early and, despite the seeming effortlessness of his prose, revised each day's work at least five times. ''It was usually on about the fourth day that I put in that note of spontaneity for which I am known,'' he said. 
 He served as president of the American Economic Association, the profession's highest honor, and was elected to membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters. He continued to pour out magazine articles, book reviews, op-ed essays, letters to editors; he lectured everywhere, sometimes debating William F. Buckley Jr., his friend and Gstaad skiing partner. He was so prolific that Art Buchwald, the humorist, once introduced him by citing his literary production: ''Since 1959 alone, he has written 12 books, 135 articles, 61 book reviews, 16 book introductions, 312 book blurbs and 105,876 letters to The New York Times, of which all but 3 have been printed.''
 In 1977 he wrote and narrated ''The Age of Uncertainty,'' a 13-part television series surveying 200 years of economic theory and practice. In 1990 he wrote ''A Tenured Professor,'' about a Harvard professor who devised a legal, foolproof and computer-assisted system for playing the stock market and used his billions of dollars in profits on programs for education and peace -- only to be investigated by Congress for un-American activities and forced to shut down his operations. 
 In 1996, as Mr. Galbraith approached his 90th year, he wrote ''The Good Society.'' Matthew Miller wrote in The New York Times Book Review, ''We're not likely to find as elegant a little restatement of the liberal creed, or its call to conscience.''
 Mr. Galbraith said Republicans out to roll back the welfare state made a fundamental error in thinking that politicians and their actions drive history. In fact, he argued, it is the reverse. Liberals did not create big government; history did.
 Mr. Galbraith, who received the Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 2000, continued to make his views known. Some were surprising, like his speech in 1999 praising Johnson's presidency, which he had helped to bring down by working with McCarthy.
 There always seemed to be one more book. One, ''The Essential Galbraith'' (2001), was a collection of essays and excerpts that a reviewer in Business Week said remained very timely. Another, ''Name-Dropping from F.D.R. On'' (1999), recounted encounters with the powerful, including President Kennedy's response when Mr. Galbraith complained that an article in The New York Times had described him as arrogant. 
 Kennedy retorted that he didn't see why it shouldn't: ''Everybody else does.''
 In 2004, Mr. Galbraith, who was then 95, published ''The Economics of Innocent Fraud,'' a short book that questioned much of the standard economic wisdom by questioning the ability of markets to regulate themselves, the usefulness of monetary policy and the effectiveness of corporate governance.
 He remained optimistic about the ability of government to improve the lot of the less fortunate. ''Let there be a coalition of the concerned,'' he urged. ''The affluent would still be affluent, the comfortable still comfortable, but the poor would be part of the political system.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 7, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Monday and in late editions on Sunday about the economist and diplomat John Kenneth Galbraith referred incorrectly to his family at several points. He had a younger brother, William, who died several years ago; he was not an only son. A sister, Catherine Denholm, also died several years ago; she was not among his survivors. Mr. Galbraith had 10 grandchildren, not 6. Because of an editing error, the term for his wife's vocation was truncated in some copies. She is a linguist. A caption misstated the date of a photograph of the Galbraiths taken at their home in New Delhi while he was an ambassador. It was in 1956, not 1966.
A picture caption on Monday and in late editions on Sunday with the obituary of the economist and diplomat John Kenneth Galbraith misstated the date of a photograph of the Galbraiths. And a correction on this page on Thursday gave a second erroneous date. The photo was made at the Galbraiths' home in New Delhi during his term as ambassador to India, 1961-63, not in 1966 or 1956.
An obituary on May 1 and in late editions on April 30 about the economist and diplomat John Kenneth Galbraith referred incorrectly to his position with the United States Strategic Bombing Survey in 1945. As one of several directors of the effort, he oversaw a study of the economic effects of American bombing; he was not overall director of the survey. The error was pointed out by a reader in a letter dated May 22; the correction was delayed by an editing oversight.

HEADLINE: 100,000 Families Are Fleeing Violence, Iraq Official Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Sabrina Tavernise, Omar al-Neami and Ali Adeeb contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 29 

 BODY:
A new estimate by one of Iraq's vice presidents has put the number of families who have fled their homes at 100,000, a number far greater than recent projections by other Iraqi officials and one that further clouds the debate over how deeply sectarian conflicts are affecting the nation.
 The latest estimate was made by Adel Abdul Mahdi, a Shiite leader selected as one of two vice presidents, but it was not clear where he had gotten his information. In an interview last week, the Iraqi national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, said 13,750 families had been displaced, which could mean about 70,000 to 80,000 people. 
 The conflicting numbers speak to the difficulty in estimating how many people are fleeing the violence, when most are believed to be finding shelter with relatives or friends.
 And both estimates contrast with statements by American military leaders, who have said there is no ''widespread movement'' of Iraqis fleeing from sectarian fighting. 
 Mr. Mahdi gave his estimate Friday in Najaf, while speaking to reporters after meeting with Iraq's most revered Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. If true, it would mean that as many as a half-million Iraqis have been displaced. 
 Even if his estimate proves too high, it suggests how concerned Iraqi leaders have become about the entrenched and vicious sectarian violence that has reshaped the lives of many Iraqi families, particularly since the Feb. 22 Askariya Shrine bombing in Samarra.
 Militias -- some inside the official Iraqi security forces and some outside -- have gained influence as attacks against civilians have surged, and many Iraqis say that they have more faith in the militias than in the official Iraqi security forces. Some Iraqi political leaders have warned that militias, including those with heavy representation in the Interior Ministry, could drive the country toward a civil war. 
 The country's prime minister-designate, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, has said he intends to select someone independent of political parties that have large militias to run the Interior Ministry. Negotiations on forming the new cabinet continued Saturday.
 Estimates of displaced people are notoriously hard to pin down, because most families are leaving mixed neighborhoods and may have only an hour's drive or less to find a place to stay with friends or cousins. Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, a senior American military spokesman in Baghdad, says reports of a huge number of displaced persons and refugees appear to be overblown.
 ''We see reports of tens of thousands of families displaced here in Iraq, and we chase down each and every one of those reports,'' he said Thursday. ''But we have seen some displacement, pockets of families moving, but not in large numbers.''
 ''Some of them truly are moving because they're concerned about their own personal security or their family's security, I'm sure of that,'' General Lynch said. ''Some of them are moving for economic reasons. Some of them are moving to be with their families. But we're not seeing internally displaced persons at the rate which causes us alarm.''
 But Iraqi officials say that people who live in areas where they are part of an ethnic or religious minority face continual threats, including in places far from Baghdad.
 Sheik Omar al-Jibouri, a human rights officer with the Iraqi Islamic Party, a large Sunni Arab group, said that in Zubayr, a suburb of Basra, Sunnis are being increasingly warned to leave. At least 60 Sunnis were killed there in the past month, he said.
 ''Leaflets fill the streets saying, 'Leave this district, Wahhabis!' '' Mr. Jibouri said Saturday. ''Neither students nor officials can work'' if they are Sunnis, because of the threats, he said.
 In Baghdad, 10 bodies were discovered Saturday in three neighborhoods, all shot in the head with signs of torture, an Interior Ministry official said. The United States military reported that an American soldier was killed about 4 p.m. Saturday by a roadside bomb southwest of Baghdad. And the Marines reported that a car bomb in Qaim, in western Iraq, had killed three civilians. Agence France-Presse reported that at least six Iraqi security force members were killed Saturday. 
 By itself, the terrorist group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia says it has carried out 800 suicide attacks in Iraq in the past three years, not including attacks by ''other mujahedeen,'' according to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the No. 2 Qaeda leader, who made the statement in a video posted on the Internet on Saturday.
 ''This is what has broken the back of America in Iraq,'' Mr. Zawahiri said, according to a translation by the SITE Institute, which tracks violent insurgent groups. ''America, Britain and their allies have achieved nothing but losses, disasters and misfortunes.''

HEADLINE: Tribute to a Man Who Loved New York

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In 2002, the block of East 52nd Street between Park and Lexington Avenues was dedicated as ''Lew Rudin Way.'' But ''even before there was a street,'' as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton says, ''there was the Lew Rudin way of doing things''
 Now, ''The Lew Rudin Way'' is also a documentary, a fetching 60-minute special presentation of the Tribeca Film Festival memorializing that rarest of New York breeds, the lovable landlord. 
''Lew Rudin insisted on being nice to everyone,'' Jay Kriegel, a former city official who worked with him on a number of civic campaigns, recalled. ''We told him, you don't do that in politics.''
 With his brother Jack, Mr. Rudin headed one of the city's oldest real estate dynasties. In addition to the family's legacy to the skyline, Lew Rudin was an indefatigable civic booster as chairman of the Association for a Better New York, and was among the people who were instrumental in, among other things, the city's rescue from insolvency in 1975, the expansion of the New York City Marathon to an annual five-borough extravaganza, and the successful campaign against the Reagan administration's proposal to eliminate the deductibility of state and local income taxes. 
 He died of cancer a few days after 9/11, at the age of 74. 
 ''He had been talking about doing an oral history even before he got sick,'' said his son, William C. Rudin, who succeeded his father as chairman of the Association for a Better New York. ''I said, this is great, but I want to do more.''
 He interspersed his father's oral history with interviews and jarring footage of a city that only a generation ago teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. 
 As producer of the documentary, he sent Jane Rosenthal, a family friend and co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival, an invitation to the premiere, which was to be early this month. She immediately suggested that instead, the film be incorporated into the festival.
 Ms. Rosenthal had known Lew Rudin for 17 years, since she arrived in New York, and in fact, she recalled, it was Bill Rudin who a month or so after 9/11 suggested to her that more movies hold their premieres downtown -- an idea that proved to be the genesis of the Tribeca Film Festival. 
 ''Lew Rudin would see something and say, 'What can I do about it?' '' Ms. Rosenthal said in an interview on Friday. ''I think that's the message people need: Everybody can make some contribution. You don't have to wait, you can just get up and do.''
 Narrated by Sidney Poitier, the documentary traces the arrival of the Rudin family in 1883 at Castle Garden on the Battery, which preceded Ellis Island as an immigrant landing station.
 The film recounts a surprise visit by John D. Rockefeller to the grocery store owned by Lew's grandfather on Chrystie Street on the Lower East Side. 
 Once the grandfather learned that Rockefeller lived on 54th Street, he became committed to buying a building there, and later did, sight unseen. But it was on East 54th Street, in what was then a less desirable neighborhood. It is now the site of a Rudin office building, the family's ''longest investment.''
 Years later, the Rudins and Rockefellers would encounter one another again, according to the film. A British government office was moving to a Rudin building on Third Avenue from Rockefeller Center and the owners of Rockefeller Center demanded compensation -- the exact amount seems to have been lost to history, but gets bigger with each retelling -- from the new landlords because the British had broken their lease. 
 Imagine, Lew Rudin said to his father, Sam, as they delivered the check: the son of Jewish immigrants paying the Rockefellers $100,000. 
 In the documentary, Mr. Rudin is praised by a number of former officials for persuading property owners to pre-pay $600 million in real estate taxes beginning in 1975 to keep the city solvent -- ''burden sharing,'' as Walter B. Wriston, the former chairman of Citicorp, put it.
 Mr. Wriston, who died last year, is seen elaborating on an infamous fiscal crisis epiphany. At a City Hall meeting in March 1975, he asked Deputy Mayor James A. Cavanagh how many employees were on the city payroll. Cavanagh fished a slip of paper out of his pocket, Mr. Wriston recalled, and said ''397,402 or something like that.'' But Jac Friedgut, a Citicorp economist, noticed that the paper was completely blank. 
 ''That's when I knew we were in trouble,'' Mr. Wriston said. 
 Former President Gerald Ford is also interviewed, denying that he ever explicitly said ''Drop Dead'' to New York -- as the Daily News headline famously printed. But as Mr. Poitier explains, while those weren't the president's exact words, the city was not getting much help from the federal government. 
 Lew Rudin defended the city against detractors, big and small.
 ''He was fearless, because he didn't know any better,'' Mr. Kriegel says.
 ''He didn't want to do well in New York,'' former President Bill Clinton says, ''as much as he wanted New York to do well.'' 
 ''Lew Rudin Way'' will have its premiere on Tuesday evening at Frederick P. Rose Hall at Jazz at Lincoln Center. It will also be shown as part of the festival on Friday and next Sunday.

HEADLINE: The Rehabilitation of the Cold-War Liberal

BYLINE: By Peter Beinart. 
Peter Beinart is editor at large of The New Republic. This essay is adapted from ''The Good Fight: Why Liberals -- and Only Liberals -- Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again,'' which will be published in late May by HarperCollins.

 BODY:
This fall, for the third time since 9/11, American voters will choose between Democrats and Republicans while knowing what only one party believes about national security. In 2002, Democratic candidates tried to change the subject, focusing on Social Security and health care instead. In 2004, John Kerry substituted biography for ideology, largely ignoring his own extensive foreign-policy record and stressing his service in Vietnam. In this year's Senate and House races, the party looks set to reprise Michael Dukakis's old theme: competence. Rather than tell Americans what their vision is, Democrats will assure them that they can execute it better than George W. Bush.
Democrats have no shortage of talented foreign-policy practitioners. Indeed, they have no shortage of worthwhile foreign-policy proposals. Even so, they cannot tell a coherent story about the post-9/11 world. And they cannot do so, in large part, because they have not found their usable past. Such stories, after all, are not born in focus groups; they are less invented than inherited. Before Democrats can conquer their ideological weakness, they must first conquer their ideological amnesia. 
 Consider George W. Bush's story: America represents good in an epic struggle against evil. Liberals, this story goes, try to undermine that moral clarity, reining in American power and sapping our faith in ourselves. But a visionary president will not be constrained, and he wields American might with relentless force, until the walls of oppression crumble and the darkest region on earth is set free.
 If this sounds familiar, it should. It was Ronald Reagan's story as well. To a remarkable degree, the right's post-9/11 vision relies on a grand analogy: Bush is Reagan, Tony Blair is Margaret Thatcher, the ''axis of evil'' is the ''evil empire,'' the truculent French are the truculent French. The most influential conservative foreign-policy essay of the 1990's, written by the Weekly Standard editor William Kristol and Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment, was titled ''Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy.'' And since 9/11, most conservatives have seen Bush as Reaganesque. His adherence to a script conservatives know by heart helps explain their devotion, which held fast through the 2004 election, and has only recently begun to flag, as that script veers more and more disastrously from the real world.
 Liberals don't have a script because they don't have a Reagan. Since Vietnam, they've produced two presidents: Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Carter's foreign policy is widely considered a failure. Clinton's foreign policy is not widely considered at all, because he governed at a time when foreign policy was for the most part peripheral to American politics. Ask liberals to describe a Carteresque foreign policy, and they tend to wince. Ask them to describe a Clintonesque one, and you'll most likely get a blank stare.
 But before Vietnam, and the disappointment and confusion it spawned, liberals did have a clear story of their own. In the late 1940's and 1950's, intellectuals like Reinhold Niebuhr and policymakers like George F. Kennan described America's cold-war struggle differently from their conservative counterparts: as a struggle not merely for democracy but for economic opportunity as well, in the belief that the former required the latter to survive. Even more important, they described America itself differently. Americans may fight evil, they argued, but that does not make us inherently good. And paradoxically, that very recognition makes national greatness possible. Knowing that we, too, can be corrupted by power, we seek the constraints that empires refuse. And knowing that democracy is something we pursue rather than something we embody, we advance it not merely by exhorting others but by battling the evil in ourselves. The irony of American exceptionalism is that by acknowledging our common fallibility, we inspire the world. 
 To understand this liberal story, it helps to understand the origins of the conservative one that we hear all around us today. George W. Bush's foreign policy is often attributed to neoconservatives, the ex-liberals and radicals who began moving right in the 1960's. But in fact, the vision Bush inherited from Reagan dates back a generation earlier, to the birth of the modern conservative movement itself. Since the mid-1950's, when William F. Buckley's new journal, National Review, created the ideological synthesis that still defines the American right, one overriding fear has haunted conservative foreign policy: the fear that Americans cannot distinguish good from evil.
 Over and over during the last half-century, conservatives have looked at America and seen a society enfeebled by moral relativism. In the 1950's, they saw America's enemies on the march -- with China, half of Europe and half of Korea newly in Communist hands. The culprit, they argued, was liberalism. The New Deal, with its collectivist principles, had blurred the distinction between Soviet Communism and American freedom. And modern culture was undermining old certainties, above all the belief in God. As a result, Americans lacked the ideological confidence of their fanatical totalitarian foes. And that self-doubt was making them weak. Whittaker Chambers, the communist turned conservative whose 1952 conversion tale, ''Witness,'' strongly influenced the early cold-war right, said Americans would suffer defeat after defeat until their ''faith in God and the freedom He enjoins is as great as Communism's faith in Man.'' The West, added James Burnham, the most influential foreign-policy thinker in the National Review circle, was losing ''the will to survive.''
 After Vietnam, conservatives saw the disease of self-doubt growing even more acute. Many on the American right hailed ''How Democracies Perish,'' by the French author Jean-Francois Revel, which declared, ''Democratic civilization is the first in history to blame itself because another power is working to destroy it.'' Into this dark, dispirited landscape came Ronald Reagan, saying the things conservatives had been waiting three decades to hear. ''The era of self-doubt,'' he announced, ''is over.'' And in perhaps the most famous speech of his presidency, Reagan in 1983 invoked Chambers to denounce the right's old scourge: moral relativism. Calling the Soviet Union an ''evil empire,'' he admonished listeners to resist the temptation to ''label both sides equally at fault, to. . .remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil.'' 
 When the Soviet empire fell, it became an article of conservative faith that it was Reagan's policies, and in particular the moral clarity that underlay them, that had turned the tide. In this way, the old story was transmitted to a new conservative generation, which made it their guide to the post-9/11 world.
 The liberal story also finds its roots in the early cold war. If cold-war conservatism began with the founding of National Review, cold-war liberalism emerged slightly earlier, in 1947, when Niebuhr, along with Eleanor Roosevelt, Hubert Humphrey and the United Auto Workers' chief Walter Reuther, established Americans for Democratic Action. The A.D.A. was born amid a civil war on the American left, which pitted anti-Communists like Humphrey against Henry Wallace and those liberals who saw communism less as an enemy than as an ally. But by 1949, Wallace was vanquished, and the A.D.A. increasingly defined itself against the right.
 The liberal story began with a different fear about America. If cold-war conservatives worried that Americans no longer saw their own virtue, cold-war liberals worried that Americans saw only their virtue. The A.D.A.'s most important intellectual -- its equivalent of James Burnham -- was the tall, German-American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. Niebuhr was a dedicated opponent of communism, but he was concerned that in pursuing a just cause, Americans would lose sight of their own capacity for injustice. ''We must take, and must continue to take, morally hazardous actions to preserve our civilization,'' he wrote. ''We must exercise our power. But we ought neither to believe that a nation is capable of perfect disinterestedness in its exercise nor become complacent about particular degrees of interest and passion which corrupt the justice by which the exercise of power is legitimized.'' Americans, Niebuhr argued, should not emulate the absolute self-confidence of their enemies. They should not pretend that a country that countenanced McCarthyism and segregation was morally pure. Rather, they should cultivate enough self-doubt to ensure that unlike the Communists', their idealism never degenerated into fanaticism. Open-mindedness, he argued, is not ''a virtue of people who don't believe anything. It is a virtue of people who know. . .that their beliefs are not absolutely true.''
 George Kennan, architect of the Truman administration's early policies toward the Soviet Union, called Niebuhr the ''father of us all.'' And in the first years of the cold war, Niebuhr's emphasis on moral fallibility underlay America's remarkable willingness to restrain its power. In the aftermath of World War II, the United States represented half of the world's G.D.P., and the nations of Western Europe lay militarily and economically prostrate. Yet the Truman administration self-consciously bound America within institutions like NATO, which gave those weaker nations influence over American conduct. ''We all have to recognize, no matter how great our strength,'' Truman declared, ''that we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please.'' As the historian John Lewis Gaddis has written: ''It was not that the Americans lacked the capacity to force their allies into line.. . .What is surprising is how rarely this happened; how much effort the United States put into persuading -- quite often even deferring to -- its NATO partners.''
 Kennan believed America's great advantage in the cold war was that the Soviet Union constituted an empire, which held its alliances together by force. By contrast, he argued, if the United States resisted the imperial temptation and built alliances that respected foreign nationalism, those alliances would endure. In 1947, when the Truman administration announced the Marshall Plan to help rebuild postwar Western Europe, he resisted using the aid to recast European economies in America's image. Indeed, his administration assisted socialist parties, recognizing that while they might not always prove ideologically pliant, they represented home-grown bulwarks against Soviet power. As one Truman State Department official put it, America should seek European allies ''strong enough to say no both to the Soviet Union and the United States, if our actions should seem so to require.''
 For conservatives, this willingness to indulge governments that would not bend fully to American principles and American wishes was yet another sign that Americans did not truly believe in the righteousness of their cause. While Kennan saw the Soviet empire as brittle, Burnham envied its lockstep unity and urged America to build its own equivalent. ''The reality,'' he wrote, ''is that the only alternative to the communist World Empire is an American Empire, which will be, if not literally worldwide in formal boundaries, capable of exercising decisive world control.'' 
 If different views about moral clarity produced different views about American restraint, they also produced different views on how best to defend democracy, at home and abroad. The Marshall Plan's premise was that the survival of European democracy depended on its ability to deliver economic opportunity. In ''The Vital Center,'' his famed 1949 statement of cold-war liberalism, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. compared communism to an intruder trying to enter a house. The American military could keep it from knocking down the door. But if the people inside were sufficiently desperate, they might unlock it from the inside.
 To conservatives, this talk of communism's root causes looked like an effort to rationalize evil, to suggest America's real foe was not communism itself, but the forces that produced it. ''The fact that some poor, illiterate people have 'gone Communist' does not prove that poverty caused them to do so,'' insisted Barry Goldwater, the first National Review-style conservative to win a Republican presidential nomination. 
 On domestic policy, the argument was similar. For liberals, the New Deal had tempered capitalism's instability and inequality, thus preserving Americans' belief in democracy when people were losing it around the world. America's ongoing task, Niebuhr argued, was to ''make our political and economic life more worthy of our faith and therefore more impregnable.'' But for conservatives, the liberal push for equality at home did not strengthen America in its cold-war struggle; it undermined the very ideological clarity upon which that struggle relied. Viewed from the right, Franklin Roosevelt had already moved America perilously far along what the Austrian emigre economist Friedrich von Hayek famously called the ''road to serfdom.'' And the more the United States aped communism, the less it would recognize its evil. ''The liberal's arm cannot strike with consistent firmness against communism,'' Burnham wrote, ''because the liberal dimly feels that in doing so he would be somehow wounding himself.''
 In the years since 9/11 restored foreign policy to the heart of American politics, these cold-war debates have returned in another form, with the critical difference that only one side knows its lines. Even before the attacks, many conservatives feared America was emasculating itself yet again. In a one-superpower world, they argued, America no longer had to tailor its foreign policy to the wishes of others. And yet, in the conservative view, the Clinton administration had permitted constraints on American power, playing Gulliver to foreign Lilliputians intent on binding it in a web of international institutions and international law. Predictably, conservatives attributed this submission to America's lack of faith in itself. The ''religion of nonjudgmentalism,'' wrote William Bennett in the book ''Why We Fight: Moral Clarity and the War on Terrorism,'' ''has permeated our culture, encouraging a paralysis of the moral faculty.''
 In his first eight months in office, President Bush aggressively reasserted American freedom of action, repudiating no fewer than six international agreements or institutions. And after 9/11, he began depicting this freedom to act alone as a means not merely of safeguarding American interests but also of liberating American virtue so it could remake the world. In 2002, the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer noted that ''people are now coming out of the closet on the word 'empire.' '' And that discussion had an idealistic cast. For its proponents, ''empire'' was usually preceded by the adjective ''benign'' or ''liberal.'' In other words, the United States would rid itself of external impediments but nonetheless act in the global good, uncorrupted by the temptations of unrestrained power.
 It has not turned out that way. On global warming, an America liberated from international restraint has acted irresponsibly; in our antiterrorist prisons, we have acted inhumanely. And from the moment the United States invaded Iraq, the Bush administration's complacent certainty of its own benevolence has blinded it to the dangers of colonial rule. While the authors of the Marshall Plan avoided remaking Europe's economy, for fear of sparking nationalist resentment, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, L. Paul Bremer III, unilaterally rescinded Iraq's import tariffs on foreign goods. Bremer may have thought he was acting on Iraq's behalf, even without its people's consent. But that is only because he lacked the self-consciousness and humility to see that he was not. As Larry Diamond, a more reflective C.P.A. official, noted: ''American political leaders need to take a cold shower of humility: we do not always know what is best for other people, even when we think it is their interests we have in mind. And as I saw during my time in Iraq, it was frequently our interests that were driving decisions we were trying to impose.'' Niebuhr couldn't have said it better himself. 
 But for all their practical failures, conservatives have at least told a coherent political story, with deep historical roots, about what keeps America safe and what makes it great. Liberals, by contrast, have offered adjectives drawn from focus groups and policy proposals linked by no larger theme. In his 2004 convention acceptance speech, John Kerry used variations of the word ''strong'' 17 times. For the 2006 campaign, Congressional Democrats have unveiled a national-security vision they call ''tough and smart.'' It calls for more spending on homeland security, energy independence and Special Forces. But these disparate, worthy proposals are not grounded in an account of the world America faces, or the sources of American strength.
 In fact, present conditions make liberalism's forgotten story especially compelling. The unprecedented post-cold-war gap between America's military power and every other nation's does not make international institutions unnecessary, as the right argues; it makes them even more essential. The liberals of the early cold war, who had seen depression and war cross the oceans and imperil the United States, believed America could guarantee neither its prosperity nor its security alone. And globalization makes that even truer today. The world's increased integration has left the United States more vulnerable to pathologies bred in other nations. So more than ever before, American security requires economic, political and even military interventions in the internal affairs of other nations: to stop bird flu from spreading in rural China, corruption from sparking a banking collapse in Thailand or jihadists from plotting in Pakistan.
 Yet if America pursues those interventions itself they will spark exactly the nationalist backlash that Niebuhr and Kennan feared. As Princeton's G. John Ikenberry has put it, a one-superpower world is like a town where there is only one policeman and the houses have no locks. In such a world, America's challenge isn't proving that it can wield unrestrained power; it is proving that it won't become a predator.
 Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were reaching this conclusion near the end of Clinton's second term. In Kosovo, NATO waged war so Slobodan Milosevic's domestic terror would not again destabilize his neighbors. As the bombs fell, Blair linked that intervention to the world's efforts to stabilize East Asian economies, so that their financial crisis would not spread. ''We are witnessing,'' Blair argued, ''the beginnings of a new doctrine of international community.'' In other words, the more aggressively America and Britain wanted to intervene in the internal affairs of other states, the more they needed the legitimacy that powerful international institutions bestow.
 With Clinton crippled by scandal, Blair's vision was stillborn. But it offers an intellectual foundation upon which liberals can build. In recent years, new evidence about global warming and potential pandemics has forcefully illustrated the need for coordinated action on the environment and public health. And of course, 9/11 has showed that distant countries can incubate fanaticism that can strike America without warning. Unfortunately, liberals themselves have turned away from Blair's vision. Alienated by the war in Iraq, many have grown suspicious of intervening in other countries' affairs. A recent Gallup survey shows Democrats twice as likely as Republicans to say that America should mind its own business internationally. And a 2005 poll by the Century Foundation and the Center for American Progress found self-described liberals far less interested than conservatives in promoting democracy. Indeed, in their recent manifesto, Congressional Democrats barely mentioned it as a foreign-policy goal.
 But George W. Bush is not wrong to think that America's security depends on how other countries, particularly in the Islamic world, govern themselves. In the long run, more accountable government can help drain the fury upon which jihadism feeds. Where Bush -- like Burnham before him -- goes wrong is in believing that America can unilaterally declare a moral standard while exempting itself. For President Bush, freedom is a one-way conversation. The United States calls on other countries to embrace liberty; we even aid them in the task. But if they call back, proposing some higher standard that might require us to modify our actions, we trot out John Bolton. For the rest of the world, freedom requires infringements upon national sovereignty. But for the United States, sovereignty trumps all.
 Most Muslims, according to polls, do not consider democracy an alien notion; in fact, they hunger for it. They simply do not believe that it is America's real goal. And that is largely because they do not feel that America abides by the principles it preaches. As the Jordanian journalist Rami Khouri has noted: ''George Bush talks in terms of the U.S. having a national mission to promote freedom in the world. . .everybody in the world looks at the U.S. and asks, Where is the moral and the legal and the political authority for you to do this? The authority has to come out of some kind of reference point, some legitimate reference point -- treaties, international law, international conventions, U.N. Security Council resolutions, General Assembly consensus, some mechanism that has credibility.''
 What Khouri is talking about -- and what international law and international institutions imply -- is reciprocity. To be sure, such institutions must acknowledge the realities of power, as did NATO, the U.N. and the other international bodies born at the end of World War II. But by mildly redistributing power -- by conceding that even the mightiest country must sometimes modify its behavior in pursuit of a higher good -- they build international norms that seem legitimate rather than hypocritical. In the liberal story, America's power to intervene effectively overseas depends on its power to persuade and not merely coerce. The power to persuade depends on a willingness to be persuaded. And that willingness depends, ultimately, on America's willingness to entertain the prospect that it is wrong.
 If liberals have lost faith in promoting democracy abroad, they have also lost faith in the connection between democracy and economic opportunity. From Franklin Roosevelt's global New Deal to the Marshall Plan (and Truman's efforts to extend aid to the third world) to John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, which promoted land reform and economic development in Latin America, liberals have traditionally distinguished themselves from conservatives by insisting that to promote liberty, America must promote opportunity as well. Today, however, in a historic shift, polls show liberals no more inclined to prioritize foreign aid than conservatives. And this shift, combined with the perception that Iraq has drained Americans of their willingness to spend money trying to solve other countries' problems, has left Democratic politicians virtually mute on the subject of economic assistance. 
 This is particularly unfortunate, because leading voices in the Muslim world -- for instance, the scholars who wrote the U.N.'s Arab Human Development Reports -- have themselves highlighted the old link between political freedom and economic despair. In recent years, exploding populations and stagnating economies have left governments from North Africa to South Asia unable to provide decent schools, free medical clinics, even clean water. And with states failing, Islamist groups -- some violent and theocratic -- have filled the void. As Omar Encarnacion of Bard College puts it, the Middle East has experienced a ''general 'Islamization' and radicalization of society ensuing from the rigid religious and often intolerant character of the civil society organizations now performing functions previously in the hands of state authorities.''
 It is true that jihadists are often middle class. But that's because terrorist groups are like other employers: they accept the best candidates who apply. After examining data on terrorists and would-be terrorists, Ethan Bueno de Mesquita of Washington University in St. Louis concluded that ''individuals with low ability or little education are most likely to volunteer to join the terrorist organization. However, the terrorist organization screens the volunteers,'' accepting only the best recruits. 
 But without a sympathetic population, this murderous elite finds it far harder to operate. Like all insurgents, jihadists rely on those around them for encouragement, legitimacy and protection. When terrorists lack popular support -- think of Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma City -- they cannot survive for long. But when they do, they can menace the world.
 Fostering economic opportunity in the Islamic world will require substantially reducing the Middle East's illiteracy rate among women, which is twice East Asia's, and promoting economic reform so more of the world's 57 Islamic countries -- which today receive only slightly more foreign investment than Sweden -- can compete in the global economy. And that will require a major commitment from the United States and its rich allies, along with Islamic nations themselves. 
 But while the United States can propose an Islamic Marshall Plan, it cannot dictate it. To have any chance of success, its specific features must come from the region. And if they do, they will partly diverge from American preferences, as did the Marshall Plan itself. A serious reform effort, for instance, will most likely involve those Islamists who have embraced democracy and oppose violent jihad, but otherwise offend Americans at least as much as did the socialists whom the United States aided after World II. 
 It is admittedly hard to imagine leaders in today's Washington who are modest enough to choose the pursuit of local legitimacy over the exercise of American fiat -- or ambitious enough to generously finance such an effort. But as conservatives understand better than liberals, that is the value of a usable past: it frees you from the intellectual confines of the moment. In 1947, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal declared: ''At the present time we are keeping our military expenditures below the. . .minimum which would in themselves ensure national security. By so doing we are able to increase our expenditures to assist in European recovery.'' It is that spirit -- alien today, but not alien to the liberal tradition -- that liberals must recover to tell a post-9/11 story of their own. 
 But generosity abroad also requires generosity at home. At the start of the cold war, when the United States was helping rebuild Western Europe, it was also building an economic order that provided tremendous opportunity for Americans. Between 1947 and 1973, family income roughly doubled, and significantly, it grew even faster for the poor and working class than for the rich. 
 Since the 1970's, blue-collar families have seen their incomes stagnate. And the only reason it hasn't dropped outright is that women have entered the work force in droves; today the average two-parent family works a full 12 weeks more per year than it did in 1969. Facing harsher international competition, employers have reduced health benefits and eliminated defined-benefit pensions. And rather than fill the gap, the federal government has retreated as well. Unemployment insurance and food stamps have become less generous, and taxes have become markedly less progressive.
 Such issues may seem distant from foreign policy. But for the liberals of the early cold war, the security of average Americans was essential to America's security in the world. ''Every courageous and incisive measure to solve internal problems of our own society,'' Kennan wrote, ''to improve self-confidence, discipline, morale and community spirit of our own people, is a diplomatic victory over Moscow worth a thousand diplomatic notes and joint communiques.''
 A government that leaves its people to fend for themselves in the face of rising economic insecurity will face grave difficulty asking them to support enlightened policies aimed at helping people in other corners of the globe. That is the hidden backdrop to the great popular revolt against the Dubai ports deal earlier this year -- an isolationist, nationalist spasm by a public that feels the government is more concerned with the interests of foreigners than with its own.
 Since 9/11, President Bush has often been criticized for not asking Americans to sacrifice. But government cannot just tell Americans we are all in it together; it must show them. And in recent decades it has been doing the opposite. One result has been a rise in public cynicism and a retreat from political participation, which leaves government easy prey for the forces of private interest and concentrated wealth, which -- in a vicious cycle -- further erodes the trust that government needs to call its citizens to action. 
 In America, no less than in the Islamic world, the struggle for democracy relies on economic opportunity. To contemporary ears, the phrase ''struggle for American democracy'' sounds odd. In George W. Bush's Washington, such struggles are for lesser nations. But in the liberal tradition, it is not odd at all. Almost six decades ago, Americans for Democratic Action was born, in the words of its first national director, to wage a ''two-front fight for democracy, both at home and abroad,'' recognizing that the two were ultimately indivisible. That remains true today. America is not a fixed model for a benighted world. It is the democratic struggle here at home, against the evil in our society, that offers a beacon to people in other nations struggling against the evil in theirs. ''The fact of the matter,'' Kennan declared, ''is that there is a little bit of the totalitarian buried somewhere, way down deep, in each and every one of us.'' America can be the greatest nation on earth, as long as Americans remember that they are inherently no better than anyone else.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Leaders Agree on State Budget

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 29 

 BODY:
Gov. M. Jodi Rell and Democratic legislative leaders agreed on Saturday to a one-year budget that abandoned a plan to abolish Connecticut's car tax, a centerpiece of the Republican governor's proposed budget. 
 Governor Rell's plan to phase out the state inheritance tax was not approved.
But the nearly $16.1 billion tax and spending plan, which takes effect on July 1, removed some key initiatives the majority Democrats wanted, such as a $500 tax credit for low-income taxpayers and a new earned income tax credit program, Democratic leaders said.
 Tax relief in the proposed budget comes in the form of a higher property tax credit against the personal income tax, to $500 from the current $400.
 The governor, in a statement, said the tax and spending plan controls spending and improves the state's business climate.
 ''This budget keeps us on the road to job growth and economic expansion, which have been my top priorities since I announced my budget package in February,'' she said.
 The House of Representatives has scheduled a rare session for Sunday to vote on the budget and the Senate is expected to take it up on Monday. The General Assembly is set to adjourn at midnight Wednesday.
