HEADLINE: FED CUTS KEY RATE TO BOLSTER FIGHT AGAINST RECESSION

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Acknowledging in effect that the American economy is in recession, the Federal Reserve sent a clear signal yesterday that reversing the decline -- rather than fighting inflation -- is now its top concern.
The signal came in the form of a reduction in the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent. This is the rate the central bank charges for loans to commercial banks, but since banks rarely borrow from the Federal Reserve -- unless they are in trouble -- the discount rate has become largely a signpost for policy decisions. 
 The signal this time was a strong one, coming as it did as the Fed's top policy makers concluded one of their periodic reviews of the economy. The Fed had taken a few tentative steps recently to push down rates and thus encourage consumers and business people to borrow money to spend and invest, stimulating the economy. But the action yesterday -- the first change in the discount rate in 22 months -- was seen as an unequivocal statement that policy has changed.
 
'The Debate Is Over'
 "The debate is over within the Federal Reserve," said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers. "Their action is a clarion call that they want rates down and they want people to borrow and spend."
The announcement at 3:25 P.M. listed "weakness in the economy" as the main reason for the discount rate cut. Further evidence of that weakness came yesterday morning as the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index had risen a mild three-tenths of 1 percent in November. [Page D4.]
Wall Street in general exulted, and so did Congress and the Bush Administration. The White House has been pressing for lower rates to avert a recession.
Within seconds of the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones industrial average shot up 28 points, and it ended the day 33.41 higher, at 2,626.73. [Page D8.] Interest rates on Treasury securities fell, in anticipation of further steps by the central bank, perhaps as early as today, to bring down the rates that more directly affect consumer and business loans. [Page D15.]
At their meeting yesterday, the Fed policy makers, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, had before them recent data showing that unemployment was on the rise, industrial production had plunged, Christmas retail sales were weak and inflation had declined at last.
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said the cut in the discount rate "demonstrates the intention of the Fed to assist in reinvigorating economic growth through lower interest rates." Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, issued a similar statement, endorsing the Fed's action.
For weeks, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and most of the other policy makers had resisted using their power to reduce interest rates, largely out of concern that the higher oil prices resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis would raise the nation's inflation rate. The small rise in the Consumer Price Index apparently helped to convince Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues that recession had become more of a danger than the inflationary impact of the Gulf crisis.
As recently as late November, Mr. Greenspan had been reluctant in public testimony to call the nation's economic slowdown a recession, describing it instead as a "meaningful downturn." Although he apparently acknowledges the recession now, he has indicated that he expects it to be a short, mild one.
 
Other Reductions Expected
 Many analysts predicted that the discount rate cut, which is effective today, would be followed by a reduction in the Federal funds rate and a reduction in the prime rate -- the basis for rates on bank loans to favored corporate customers. Many adjustable-rate consumer loans, like mortgages and home equity loans, are also pegged to the prime, which has been at 10 percent since January.
The Federal funds rate, currently about 7 1/4 percent, is what banks and other financial institutions charge each other for loans. Since banks borrow frequently from each other, this rate is of crucial importance in determining their cost of funds. And it is a rate directly controlled by the Federal Reserve.
When the Fed allows the Federal funds rate to decline, the banks gain the leeway to reduce their prime rate and other loan rates.
Some economists contend that the Fed has waited too long to recognize the recession and take steps to fight it. The greatest concern is that even with lower interest rates, many consumers and businesses will be reluctant to borrow during a downturn that shrinks profits and endangers jobs.
 
Additional Easing Suggested
 Recognizing this problem, Henry Kaufman, an economic consultant, said, "In this case a lot of additional easing will be needed."
Fearing inflation, the Federal Reserve had held the Federal funds rate at 8 1/4 percent from last December until July 13, when it was lowered to 8 percent. Of the four quarter-point reductions this year, one was in response to the agreement to cut the budget deficit and another was aimed at offsetting the credit crunch -- the tendency of many banks, hurt by mounting losses from real estate loans, to restrict credit even to companies planning potentially profitable projects.
Many economists had thought the Fed would reduce the Federal funds rate more over the summer and fall, but Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 once again made inflation the top issue for Mr. Greenspan and for most other policy makers -- the five governors and the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks.
But as the economy weakened, so did the inflation rate. Except for oil prices, the Consumer Price Index rose by a mild 4 percent, at an annual rate, from September through November. Recognizing that the slowdown and credit crunch were becoming increasingly more severe -- even threatening the solvency of some banks -- the Fed reduced the Federal funds rate early this month to 7 1/4 percent and also took the unusual step of reducing the level of cash reserves that banks had to hold in non-interest-bearing accounts to make loans. But over the last two decades, the Fed has come to use changes in the discount rate as its clearest policy signal, and its failure to change the rate left doubts, until now, about just how concerned it might be about the economic slowdown.
Some economists had said a discount rate cut was imminent, because the Federal Reserve rarely lets the Federal funds rate fall below the discount rate. Indeed, the announcement yesterday said that the discount rate was being cut, in part, to realign it with market interest rates. Technically, however, this is not strictly necessary, since banks have refrained from borrowing at the discount window, lest it be seen as evidence that they are in trouble and cannot borrow easily in the marketplace.
The Federal Reserve last changed the discount rate on Feb. 24, 1989, pushing it to 7 percent, from 6 1/2 percent. At that time, the big worry was inflation. The central bank was pushing up other rates as well then, trying to discourage consumers and businesses from the robust spending that drives up prices.
The Federal Reserve's governors vote on discount rate changes, acting on the requests of the regional banks, which actually lend the money. Yesterday's announcement said a rate cut had been requested by the directors of nine of the regional banks -- in Boston, New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas. The three others, in Philadelphia, Cleveland and San Francisco, later in the afternoon endorsed the rate cut.
Besides weakness in the economy and the constraints banks have placed on lending, the Fed's announcement yesterday also listed "slow growth in the monetary aggregates" as a reason for cutting the discount rate. The aggregates, also known as the nation's money supply, had been growing below the Fed's target levels. A primary reason for the slow growth is that the money supply is affected, in part, by lending levels, which have declined in a weak economy.

HEADLINE: Is a Dream Museum Dead or Progressing?Officials Disagree

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
Depending on who's talking, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, the $46 million dream museum that is envisioned as the world's largest showcase for postwar art, is going under, or going forward.
On Monday, Joseph R. Barresi, the Massachusetts Inspector General, wrote a letter to L. Edward Lashman, Secretary of Administration and Finance, saying that the museum was not a "cost-effective economic development project" and that its sponsors had failed to demonstrate its feasibility. He added that "as a practical matter," adverse findings by John I. Carlson Jr., deputy commissioner for capital and planning operations for the state, "close the book" on the project, known as Mass Moca.
But Mary Sullivan, a spokesman for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who is an advocate of the project, said yesterday, "Mass Moca is not dead by a long shot." She pointed out that in a letter to Mr. Lashman on Friday, Mr. Carlson had said Mass Moca did not meet three of the five requirements for state certification but recommended that the state draft a new grant agreement. The new agreement, Mr. Carlson said, should set forth "very specific conditions that Mass Moca must meet in order to obtain further state funding."
 
Financing in Question
 The museum was proposed five years ago by Thomas Krens, now director of the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, to occupy a vast, abandoned factory complex in the industrial town of North Adams in northwest Massachusetts. It would focus on large-scale art of the 1960's, 70's and 80's, and Mr. Krens said he had pledges of long-term loans of major holdings from the Italian collector Giuseppe Panza di Buomo of Milan, the New York art dealers Ileana and Michael Sonnabend, and the German Architectural Museum in Frankfurt. Now the Guggenheim, in response to a request from Mass Moca's development commission for a collaborator in the project, is seeking to become Mass Moca's operator.
A $35 million grant for the museum's planning, design and construction was approved more than two years ago by the State Legislature. More than $2 million of the grant has been spent on a feasibility study required by the state. Mr. Carlson's review of the much-revised study singles out five "critical areas" of feasibility for the project and says that two of them, the physical program and schematic plans for the museum building, meet requirements for certification.
But the feasibility study did not satisfy him in three other areas: "the amounts, sources and timing of the private capital funding" needed to pay the 30 percent of the museum's costs not covered by the state; the "post-opening management and operations plans for the facility," and the availability of artworks and money for installation. Before the state could give out more of the $35 million, Mr. Carlson said, the new grant agreement should be drafted with the Mass Moca Cultural Development Commission, which oversees the project.
Yesterday Steve Cotton, first assistant inspector general for the state, said: "Mr. Carlson's findings do not preclude the commission from limping ahead on its own. They can still do what has always been open to them, raise $12 million to $14 million in order to call forth the rest of the state grant. But they have failed to raise money for the last year, and nothing suggests a capacity to produce cash in the foreseeable future."
But Joseph Thompson, director of the museum's executive planning group, said yesterday, "The project is still very much alive, and we're continuing the work required to launch it.
Mr. Krens resigned from Mass Moca's commission last week to conform to a legal opinion by the Mass Moca Development Commission's chief counsel that it would be a conflict of interest for the Guggenheim actively to pursue an operating agreement while he was still a member of the commission.

HEADLINE: Sales Down, Christie's Announces Layoffs

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Christie's , the first of the major auction houses to issue its international sales totals for the year, said yesterday that its fall and year-end totals were substantially less than last year's, which has forced it to cut its staff by 10 percent.
Sales since September totaled $651 million, down from $1.06 billion in fall sales a year ago, a decline of 39 percent. Sales for the year totaled $1.96 billion, down from $2.14 billion in 1989, a drop of 8.5 percent. 
 Christie's chairman, Lord Carrington, attributed the reversal to the economic declines worldwide and the threat of war in the Middle East.
 
With Salaries Frozen
 "The United Kingdom, Japan and the United States are in the grip of economic uncertainty, which has been intensified by the situation in the Gulf," he said. "We have therefore decided to take prompt action to reduce our cost base significantly enough to weather the current climate."
As part of that action, Christie's announced it would freeze the salaries of senior level staff and board members and substantially trim its worldwide staff of 1,477.
"We are reducing our head count by just about 10 percent, which takes us back to the head count of the end of 1988, the beginning of 1989," the managing director of Christie's International, Christopher Davidge, said yesterday by telephone from London. Of the 144 employees affected, he said, the largest reductions would be made in London, with 65 layoffs and in New York with 60 layoffs.
While Christie's figures had decreased in Impressionist, modern and contemporary art sales, jewelry did better than usual. Its sale of gems in October brought a total of $31 million, the highest for a jewelry sale at Christie's, Mr. Davidge said.
Sotheby's , which last week announced a worldwide cut of 80 to 100 employees from its staff of 1,400, said it would issue its international sales figures this week.

HEADLINE: National League Narrows Expansion Entries to 6

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Three Florida candidates and three other cities -- Buffalo, Denver and Washington -- were named yesterday as the finalists for the National League's two expansion teams.
The expansion committee, some baseball officials said, is virtually certain to select at least one of the Florida entries -- Miami, Orlando or St. Petersburg-Tampa -- when it awards the franchises by the end of next season. Washington is considered the least likely of the six short-list cities to gain a team unless the financial picture of the prospective owners there improves. 
 The four-man committee compiled the list from 16 presentations it heard during the summer. Losing out were Charlotte, N.C.; Phoenix, Nashville, Sacramento, Calif., two groups each from Miami and St. Petersburg-Tampa, one from Washington and a Florida man who proposed a team that would play in four of the cities vying for a franchise.
 
Softened Statement?
 The Rich family of Buffalo, owner of the highly successful International League team there, survived a near-fatal statement made last Saturday. Robert Rich Jr., head of Buffalo's effort to get a franchise, said that the economics involved in securing and operating a team could make it too costly, adding that "we do not believe in baseball at any cost." He referred to the $95 million cost of an expansion franchise and the cost of signing free agents.
One baseball official familiar with the expansion committee's work said that Rich retracted or softened the statement before the committee met on Monday. The committee consists of Bill White, the league president, and three owners: Douglas Danforth of Pittsburgh, John McMullen of Houston and Fred Wilpon of the Mets.
Danforth, the committee chairman, said in a statement that the cities on the list were the "best in terms of market size, government commitment to support baseball and stadium facilities in place or planned."
"All prospective ownership groups on the short list," he added, "are the most qualified in terms of financial stability, significant community identification and long-term commitment to a baseball club and their community."
Probably the most heatedly contested efforts were made by groups in Miami and in the St. Petersburg-Tampa area. H. Wayne Huizenga, chairman of the Blockbuster video outlets and half owner of Joe Robbie Stadium, was designated as the prospective owner in Miami, which is viewed by some people in baseball as the No. 1 candidate in Florida and maybe over all.
Huizenga, who would spend approximately $10 million to alter his stadium so it could fit a baseball field, beat out a group headed by Abel Holtz, a Miami banker, who proposed playing in a baseball-only stadium to be built, and another group that included Mike Schmidt, the former player.
 
Long Battle Ends
 The designation of Sunshine State Baseball Associates as the prospective owner of a St. Petersburg-Tampa franchise ends the longest area competition. The two cities began jockeying for position in a race for an expansion franchise years ago, and merged their efforts only after St. Petersburg gambled and built a domed stadium.
The winning ownership group includes S. Joel Schur and Stephen Porter, part owners of St. Petersburg's minor league team; Sidney Kohl, a Palm Beach, Fla., developer, and Allen Kohl, a California developer.
The winning Washington group is headed by John Akridge 3d, a real estate developer. The losing group had proposed playing eventually in northern Virginia.
The two new franchises are expected to be awarded no later than next Sept. 30. Their minor league teams would begin play in 1992, and the new major league teams would join the National League in 1993 after an allocation draft in November 1992.
A potentially explosive side issue involves the desire by American League clubs to share in the $190 million the National League will receive from the new teams. In previous expansions, the leagues that added the new teams received all of the money, but American League owners say those sums were meager compared with the current franchise price.

HEADLINE: Is Uncle Sam Getting Stiffed?

BYLINE: By Jim Sasser; Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Early next year, the Pentagon will ask Congress for at least $20 billion in additional funds for Operation Desert Shield. That's just to keep the peace. A full-scale shooting war could cost the U.S. from $1 billion to $2 billion per day. At that rate, all of the $41 billion in deficit reductions we achieved in the budget agreement would be wiped out in a single month.
Though economic issues are clearly of lesser moment when weighed against the lives of thousands of young Americans, the economic consequences of war demand attention. 
 There is a heavy dose of irony in the specter of America mobilizing for a war to protect our economic self-determination and then sinking into economic quicksand beneath the cost of the operation itself.
All of which poses a fundamental question: Where are the financial contributions of our key allies, especially those who have more to lose than we do from a disruption of Persian Gulf oil?
Overall, the Bush Administration, preoccupied with forging international support for the use of American force in the gulf, has given scant attention to the question of who will pay. It has shown little interest in alerting the public to this issue and has exerted minimal pressure on our allies to pay up.
Japan relies on the Persian Gulf for some 70 percent of the oil it uses to sustain its $3 trillion-a-year economy. Its leaders reluctantly pledged $4 billion to the gulf effort -- $2 billion in military assistance and $2 billion in foreign assistance.
As of Nov. 30, the Pentagon reported that its Major Foreign Contributors' Responsibility Sharing Program had received from Japan only $374 million, 40,000 Sony Walkmen and a few Toyotas.
Unified Germany arguably has more to gain from stable oil prices and a reliable new world order than any other industrialized nation. Nonetheless, Bonn has offered just $800 million, and, to date, we have received only $330 million of that sum.
A more glaring case still is Saudi Arabia, whose royal family asked the U.S. to protect that nation's immense oil reserves. A safe Saudi Arabia has been able to increase oil production in a tight market and realize a windfall profit of some $150 million a day. That's at a time when Americans are paying $80 million more per day for our gulf oil imports than we did prior to the August invasion of Kuwait.
The Saudis originally promised $3 to $5 billion in cash and in-kind contributions. So far, they have contributed only $987 million in cash and materiel -- about 6.5 days' worth of their windfall oil profits.
Clearly, something is out of joint. America's share of the cost simply doesn't match our share of the international risk.
The Administration announced this week that it will seek $5 billion in additional foreign aid support from the allies to help Turkey, Jordan and Egypt offset the economic losses they have suffered since the crisis began. That seems a fair and generous course. In the meantime, Secretary of State James Baker should press the delinquent allies to pay their debts to the Desert Shield fund and not to accept "the check's in the mail" as an answer.
Every nation with a definable interest in the Persian Gulf should make a contribution that is commensurate with its interest. With our NATO allies and, especially with Japan, we should make this question a centerpiece for any future trade discussions. Moreover, we now have sufficient leverage in Saudi Arabia to simply demand a greater contribution from that country.
If we don't insist on that, our orchestra of nations against Saddam Hussein is virtually a one-man band.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Who's In Charge?

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Who, if anyone, is minding the store at the White House? What kind of Administration is it that could allow the minority-scholarship flap, without even a high-level review, to flare into fiasco?
 Such ineptitude has not been seen at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue since Donald Regan, then chief of staff to the Great Communicator, described Ronald Reagan's staff as being "like a shovel brigade that follows a parade down Main Street cleaning up." True enough, but infelicitous; and for that and other offenses against the First Family, Mr. Regan soon thereafter got the gate.
 
 This time the victim may prove to be President Bush himself. It's his Administration, after all; and the political climate he fostered led a second-level bureaucrat in the Department of Education to proclaim a major policy decision that embarrassed Mr. Bush and may have destroyed any lingering hope for a bigger Republican share of the black vote.
 In extricating itself, or something, from this dilemma, the Administration not only floundered between conflicting courses, giving new evidence of its inability to guide itself, let alone the country; it further alienated the Republican right wing, which already was holding its nose. That could be disastrous for a Republican President seeking re-election.
 This unwanted and unnecessary rumble came along just when other developments had made Mr. Bush look like the Incredible Shrinking Man: the budget flip-floppery that tumbled him out of the approval-rating stratosphere; his inability to make clear the vital national interest that requires 400,000 U.S. troops on the Saudi border; such unseemly intramural bouts as Richard Darman vs. Newt Gingrich and John Sununu vs. Ed Rollins, all topped by William Bennett's on-again, off-again, gone-again Finnegan performance in re the chairmanship of the G.O.P.
 Now, in recognition of the larger political realities, the President again has had to give the back of his hand to conservative theology. He repudiated the belief, which his Administration had seemed to foster, that no deviation can be allowed from the strictest color-blindness, even in a good cause or to correct obvious evils.
 It need not have happened. No one was agitating for an end to scholarships for minorities; the charge that "affirmative action" sometimes disadvantages some whites -- which might occasionally be true of college admissions policies -- almost never applies to minority scholarships. Nor should any competent Administration permit a policy of such profound social and political implications to be decided anywhere but at the top.
But if the Administration is looking weak, and if the Republican right threatens an insurgency against Mr. Bush in 1992, where is the Democrat to take advantage of the situation? Testimony from Iowa and New Hampshire, where would-be nominees usually are a dime a dozen, suggests that this time around no one aspires to fill the shoes of Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis.
Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who leads the speculation, did make a campaign-sounding speech to a campaign-like forum, the National Press Club in Washington. He accused Mr. Bush of being more worried about Kuwait than the U.S. economy, which could be a potential campaign theme; but Mr. Cuomo is not confessing to Presidential ambitions and has nasty budget problems of his own.
In view of the President's mounting troubles, no doubt Iowa and New Hampshire soon will receive visits from some of the usual Democratic suspects -- Senators Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Al Gore of Tennessee, for example, and certainly Jesse Jackson. Mr. Cuomo and Senator Sam Nunn are much "mentioned," as is a newcomer from a state not known for Presidential timber -- Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, an honored Vietnam veteran.
The first signs can be seen, however, of the internal warfare that characterizes the Democrats. An unnamed spokesman for the Democratic Leadership Conference -- the organization led by Senator Charles Robb of Virginia, Senator Nunn of Georgia, and other "moderates" -- said the conference hoped to be able to counter the "money and publicity" the Northeastern liberal Mr. Cuomo would receive if he became a candidate.
With the economy in decline, the Administration in disarray, the right-wing conservatives in high dudgeon and the Middle East situation in doubt, Republican prospects for 1992 might seem dubious at best. But with the Democrats in their usual muddle, the oldest rule of politics may nevertheless apply: You can't beat a horse with no horse.

HEADLINE: Banking and Securities Businesses Don't Mix

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Regulate Banks: Less, and More" (editorial, Dec. 10) disturbs me greatly. Over the last 40 years I have been an investment banker, securities salesman and, for a brief period, an employee of a bank. My experience tells me that your recommendations on the proposed deregulation for commercial banks is a terrible mistake.
Banks traditionally have been unable to operate successfully any business other than the banking business. The banking business does not include underwriting securities and trading securities. These activities are absolutely different from the typical cautious investments and loans that banks are in business to make, to monitor and to collect, and thereby make a profit.
If banks are permitted to enter the securities business 5 or 10 years from now, there will be additional losses of a substantial magnitude.
The very essence of the securities business involves risk in trading and in underwriting, which is the kind of risk that bankers should not be permitted to undertake with depositor money. Your statement that "Economists have shown this can be done without endangering the taxpayer" is absolutely untrue.
There are banking businesses, and there are securities businesses. They don't mix, and they don't complement each other. I trust that the Treasury Department will hold against the lobbying of the banking industry to allow banks to enter a business about which they know very little and in which they will not be successful.
In support of my position, you only have to look at the trading positions and losses of any of the major banks in the United States over the last 25 years from their Government bond departments.

Harsh Medicine

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 10 editorial on bank deregulation addresses a major problem: the diminishing competitiveness of United States banks because of an outmoded regulatory framework. Additional powers, coupled with closer monitoring, will determine whether or not the largest United States banks can safely and successfully compete in the world.
In the meantime, however, hundreds, if not thousands, of medium-size and smaller institutions have a more immediate problem: how to reach a way of living with bank regulators that will reinforce sound banking practice without causing grave injury to banks, their borrowers and the regional economy.
Is there a credit crunch? After small-group meetings with more than 90 of our members, I can confirm that the answer is yes. Have regulatory standards changed? Perhaps not the standards, but the rigor of their application has changed, dramatically.
Requirements for large increases in the allowance for possible future loan losses based on "worst case" assumptions, along with pressure to sell sound earning assets to meet new capital requirements (more difficult to achieve because of the write-downs) are part of the problem.
Equally important, bankers have pulled back from loans that involve even traditional levels of risk, after having experienced (firsthand or secondhand) an inflexible, uncompromising, "white glove" examination procedure that they have never known before.
The result of this fear of making mistakes -- by both regulators and bankers -- is the onset of the kind of economic damage regulation was designed to avert. In short, we are in a downward spiral where values continue to fall, partly because the credit resources that would help stabilize those values have dried up.
By all means, argue for greater freedom and more timely monitoring for financial institutions, but in the crucial short term, excessively harsh regulatory medicine threatens to cripple both banks and their borrowers.

HEADLINE: SOCIAL SECURITY IS SHORT OF MONEY

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The Commissioner of Social Security said today that she would ask the White House and Congress for additional funds because the money provided in the recent budget agreement was not enough to operate the agency through the remaining nine months of the current fiscal year.
The Commissioner, Gwendolyn S. King, said she would ask the White House to release a "contingency reserve" of $146.4 million and was preparing a separate request to Congress for supplemental appropriations. 
 Her plans came to light as the Federal budget director, Richard G. Darman, notified more than 100 Government agencies of his preliminary decisions on their budget requests for the next fiscal year. In most cases, he allowed less than had been requested.
Cabinet officers and other agency administrators have until the end of this week to challenge those decisions. President Bush will send his 1992 budget to Congress in early February, eight months before the start of the fiscal year 1992.
 
Benefits Are Not Jeopardized
 Congress earmarked $4.2 billion to cover the administrative costs of Social Security in the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. But Mrs. King and other Social Security officials said the amount was not enough.
The shortage could adversely affect services to Social Security beneficiaries, but does not in any way jeopardize the benefits of people who are legally entitled to them. Benefit payments are not subject to the statutory limit on administrative expenses.
In a memorandum analyzing the problem, Janice L. Warden, Acting Deputy Commissioner of Social Security, said the spending limits set by Congress "will cause severe cutbacks to public service" provided by Social Security field offices.
"We project that field offices, teleservice centers and program service centers will run out of supplies by the middle of the fiscal year," she wrote.
 
Effect on Training Cited
 Ms. Warden warned the agency's central records office, which makes a permanent record of earnings for millions of American workers, "will run out of both office and computer supplies during the second quarter" of the fiscal year, from January through March 1991.
In addition, she said that as a result of budget constraints, "we will not be able to provide sufficient training to the technicians we will hire this year."
Even low-paid Social Security employees are now expected to work with computers, Ms. Warden said, adding, "We gain little advantage in hiring new staff if we cannot give them adequate training."
Peter C. Toland, manager of the Boston office of the Social Security Administration, said he shared Ms. Warden's concerns.
"From October through early December of this year we have not been able to order supplies like computer paper and forms for the filing of claims, except in real emergencies," said Mr. Toland, who is president of a national group representing Social Security field office managers.
 
Agency's Staff Cut by 21%
 The problems are exacerbated by the fact that the staff of the Social Security Administration has been cut by 21 percent, or 17,000 people, over the last six years, even as the number of beneficiaries was increasing.
Officials in the Bush Administration contend that Social Security employees, working with new computers, are more productive. But Mr. Toland said the personnel cuts "have resulted in reduced service to the public."
Mrs. King said the Administration would ask Congress for extra money to review claims filed by hundreds of thousands of poor children with severe physical and mental disabilities. The Supreme Court ruled in February that the Government had improperly denied benefits to such children, using eligibility criteria far stricter than those established by law.
"Readjudication of the children's disability cases will require a tremendous amount of additional resources," Mrs. King said. She did not specify the cost.
 
Claims for Jobless Benefits
 The Labor Department is also drafting plans for a supplemental budget request to cover administrative costs of the unemployment insurance program. Those costs have soared with the increase in claims for jobless benefits across the country.
Congress provided nearly $2 billion to operate unemployment insurance offices in the current fiscal year. Cheryl A. Templeman, a spokeswoman for the Interstate Conference of Employment Security Agencies, said at least $150 million more was needed to keep up with the increase in claims. The conference is composed of state officials who administer unemployment insurance laws.
Other Federal agencies are also considering supplemental budget requests. For example, Medicare officials said they did not have enough money to pay contractors who review claims filed by Medicare beneficiaries, doctors and hospitals.
Donald R. Cohodes, administrator of Federal programs at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said the 1991 budget for contractors was inadequate, in part because Medicare officials had underestimated the number of claims.
Without additional funds, he said, those who provide health care "will not be paid promptly for their Medicaid services" and "improper payments will inadvertently be made" from Medicare trust funds.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Profit Squeeze In TV Retailing

BYLINE: By Isadore Barmash

 BODY:
THE "mall in the living room," as some people call in-home shopping by television, has had success attracting customers who like to avoid real stores. But the industry's giant, Home Shopping Network Inc., like other retailers in this laggard Christmas selling season, has found that its customers want bargains, so profits are under pressure from price-cutting and are drifting downward.
Home Shopping is actually a holding company with various direct-marketing activities, like catalogue and mail-order sales. But its main business is selling discounted merchandise -- everything from clothes to can openers -- on cable television systems and on 11 broadcast stations it owns in New York, Miami, Dallas, Chicago and other cities.
 
 And while sales are brisk -- up almost 14 percent for the season and the year -- profits from Home Shopping's television-shopping operations are down about five-tenths of 1 percent so far this year, and they are not particularly promising for the rest of the Christmas season. The company earned a record $38.8 million in its last fiscal year, which ended Aug. 31, on a 30 percent rise in sales, to slightly more than $1 billion.
Investors do not seem sure how to react to the recent earnings slide. The stock closed at $4.125 a share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, up 12.5 cents. The shares' 52-week high is $8.50, and the low is $2.875.
Nonetheless, some analysts suggest that HomeShopping Network -- with half the industry's sales -- will continue to dominate despite the recent merger of two competitors, QVC Network Inc. and the CVM Companies.
"In an industry which could generate $2 billion in calendar 1990, versus less than $100 million as recently as 1985, the company appears to be a stride closer to tracking $1 billion in annual volume," said Robert M. Lilly, an analyst for J. W. Charles Securities, in Boca Raton, Fla. "QVC Network is having a difficult time integrating the acquisition, servicing its additional debt load and realizing a profit."
Mr. Lilly sees 1990 as a transitional year for Home Shopping.
"H.S.N. has quickly grown," he said, "but its execution isn't perfect. It broadcasts to two-thirds of the viewing population but only sells 5 percent. Also, it has succeeded in selling jewelry and clothes, but has not done well with financial services or upscale electronics."
He also said that Home Shopping had a high rate of merchandise returns, about 18 to 20 percent of sales.
Roy M. Speer, chairman and chief executive of Home Shopping, in a telephone interview from company headquarters in St. Petersburg, Fla., conceded that profits were softening. He said that merchandising profits before expenses in November were 34.6 percent of sales, compared with 36.2 percent of sales in October and 36 percent of salesin September. He said merchandising profits were down five-tenths of 1 percent in the quarter, compared with the quarter last fiscal year.
During the holiday season, Home Shopping's best sellers are costume jewelry and gold jewelry sold by weight. Women's apparel has also been popular, with dresses priced from $25 to $80 selling best. Although they are not held during the current season, "Barganthons" in most months help clear leftover merchandise, with discounts of 50 percent to 60 percent off traditional store levels.
Asked if there was a performance measure for television shopping -- as for store retailing, where sales of $200 a square foot in department stores and $400 in specialty stores are viewed as above average -- Mr. Speer said: "It's a spanking new industry, and there's no real format to go by. I guess we are judged by the amount of sales we get in a specified time span. We like to get a yield of $1,000 a minute, but I'm afraid it does vary greatly."
Although shopping by television does not offer the range of goods of stores and does not allow its customers to feel the merchandise, Mr. Speer thinks Home Shopping has some strategic advantages.
Using sophisticated technology to process orders, Mr. Speer said, Home Shopping can be sensitive to shifts in customer preferences and to service lapses. He said first-time buyers become members of the Home Shopping Club, which allows the company to track demographics. He said the club had five million members.
And unlike regular retailing, where the current recession has stunted normal sales growth, at-home shopping "does better in recessions than the normal retailers because we are perceived by our customers as bargain-oriented," Mr. Speer said. He even sees rising gasoline prices as a boon.

HEADLINE: Seoul Voices Trade Doubts

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Faced with the threat of an unfair trade complaint from the United States, South Korea said today that it was reviewing its tight controls on imported food but added that a liberalized trade policy was unlikely.
A top South Korean official, in Washington trying to patch up worsening trade relations, said, "Economic reasoning has little persuasive power in the deliberation about agricultural issues; it is mostly dominated by politics."
Cho Soon, a special envoy of President Roe Tae Woo, said, "The Korean Government is under extreme political constraints, so I don't know to what extent can it liberalize agricultural imports."
Mr. Cho said the austerity program was designed to "arrest fast-growing consumption," but he acknowledged that it had the "smack of an anti-import campaign."
The campaign is seen by some United States officials as a backslide on South Korea's pledge to open markets.
The United States has said it is ready to file an unfair trade complaint against South Korea for its closed rice market.
South Korean and United States trade officials are to meet in Seoul in mid-January.

HEADLINE: MAJOR TO BE IN U.S. FOR TOP MEETINGS

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Prime Minister John Major will fly to Washington on Thursday on a mission aimed mostly at establishing his identity in a country where his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, was universally recognized, aides at 10 Downing Street say.
By the time he heads back to London on Saturday morning, the 47-year-old Mr. Major will have appeared on all the Friday network television breakfast programs, met with Vice President Dan Quayle, had lunch with Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill and spent the night conferring with President Bush at Camp David. 
 He will tell them all a lot of things they already know. Britain stands just as squarely behind American-led demands for Iraq to pull all its forces out of Kuwait as Mrs. Thatcher did, he will say, and he thinks both Americans and Europeans will have to compromise in their positions on agricultural subsidies if a new global trade agreement is to be reached next month, as he and other European Community leaders decided in Rome last weekend.
 
Looks to Success
 Mr. Major hopes to have as much success in Washington as he did in Rome, where he convinced most fellow Europeans that after 11 1/2 years of excited debate with Mrs. Thatcher, here was a quiet man they could work with.
On the Persian Gulf, where Mr. Major will be visiting the 34,000 British troops early next month, British officials say that there is not an iota of difference between Britain's position and that of the United States. But they do worry about the opinions of the American public and of Congress.
"It is very important we try to convince them of the need to stand firm, and convince them of our position," one adviser said. In particular, the Prime Minister will align himself with President Bush's view that Iraq should not be let off the hook for a partial withdrawal from Kuwait by the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for a complete pullout, British officials say.
Both in America and here at home, Mr. Major, who was elected Prime Minister by the Conservative Party on Nov. 27, is trying to move out from under his predecessor's shadow.
 
Relationship Stressed
 The Prime Minister comes from a lower-middle-class background and never went to college, takes easily to being called by his first name, and doesn't flinch at the working breakfasts so deeply disliked by members of the upper classes, this adviser said.
"The important thing is to establish relations with the President at the personal level, to establish a presence with the American public, and to make it clear the special relationship will continue," he said.
If the emphasis in America is on the similarities between Mrs. Thatcher and her successor, here at home, where she had become deeply unpopular, it is more on the differences.
Though Mr. Major stands for all the same policies Mrs. Thatcher did, one aide who knows them both said: "Things will be lower key. Life will not be one long crusade."
 
Changing the New Tax
 The most dramatic sign of this willingness to concede error was Mr. Major's decision to review Mrs. Thatcher's unpopular "poll tax," a new per capita charge for local government services. He put Michael Heseltine, whose challenge to Mrs. Thatcher's leadership last month led to Mr. Major's selection as Prime Minister, in charge of coming up with a better system, and ruled nothing out -- not even abolishing the charge and going back to property taxes instead.
Another sign of this less ideological approach to Conservative policy, in the eyes of an influential party figure, was the replacement of Prof. Brian Griffiths by Sarah Hogg, a former journalist, as head of the Prime Minister's policy unit. Professor Griffiths, a devoted admirer of Mrs. Thatcher's policies, was described as "the keeper of the Holy Grail" by one high party official who saw the change as another welcome indication of flexibility.
Mr. Major's low-key performance in Rome last weekend, highlighting not British objections to greater European political and economic union but British suggestions for improving the way the community did things, bolstered his image as quite a different leader.
But, a key policy-making official said, "his whole instinct will be to concentrate on domestic affairs." To hold onto his job in the next election, which has to be held by July 1992, Mr. Major will have to restore the British economy to good health.
 
Economy in Recession
 Now, with inflation at 9.7 percent and basic lending rates at 14 percent to try to get it under control, the economy has slid into recession, with the total value of goods and services generated by the British economy in the third quarter of this year falling by 1.2 percent, according to statistics released today, and unemployment is rising for the first time since the early 1980's.
Mr. Major, a banker, spent most of his Government career under Mrs. Thatcher dealing with financial and economic problems, most recently as her Chancellor of the Exchequer. In that job, he pegged the pound closely to the German mark, at a central exchange rate of 2.95 marks, and aides say he will not contemplate devaluing in future, though Britain's high inflation will create pressures to do so.
In Washington, he will also be concentrating on financial affairs, meeting with Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, and Nicholas Brady, the Secretary of the Treasury, on Friday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances in U.S. After Being Mixed Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished higher in domestic trading yesterday after putting in a mixed performance overseas.
Analysts said the dollar remained particularly resilient in United States dealings in the face of the Federal Reserve's move late Tuesday to trim a key lending rate. The Fed said it would lower the discount rate, the interest charged on loans to member banks, to 6 1/2 percent from 7 percent. 
 Lower rates are usually harmful for the dollar as they erode the value of fixed-income securities. But the dollar gained some support from continuing worries about the Mideast crisis.
"Concerns about the Persian Gulf are discouraging dollar bears from selling," said Marc Chandler, an analyst at IDEA.
The dollar also drew support from rumors that the Bank of Japan was preparing to follow the Fed's lead and lower interest rates. Lower Japanese rates would be helpful to the dollar as well as United States bonds by widening the rate differential between Japan and the United States.
"The yen was very weak," Mr. Chandler said, noting that investors bought the European currencies and sold off their yen.
Activity was very quiet, and traders predict the coming week will continue to be slow unless tensions intensify in the Middle East, said Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.24 yen to close at 133.27 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 134.05 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 134.05 yen, up from 132.72 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound slid to $1.9316, from $1.9350 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.9310 to buy one pound, cheaper than Tuesday's $1.9430.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold and Silver Prices Rise After Rate Cut by the Fed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The decision by the Federal Reserve Board to reduce its discount rate helped lift the price of gold and silver yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
The lowering of the discount rate on Tuesday, which was seen by analysts as an attempt to stimulate the economy, particularly helped silver and platinum futures, which had been in a free fall because of concerns about the economy. 
 "Silver and platinum depend solely on economic conditions," said Peter Cardillo, director of commodities research at Jesup, Josephthal & Company. "If the economy can be lifted, then obviously both metals will do better because of lower interest rates."
 
Renewed Fears of War
 Gold traded higher on renewed fears of war in the Persian Gulf. Those fears were rekindled by Iraqi rhetoric following the European Community's refusal to meet with Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz.
Also contributing to tensions were reports that Iraq is adding to its forces in Kuwait, as well as word of a planned meeting of Saudi Arabian officials with the United States Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, and Gen. Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Gold settled $9.50 to $10.10 higher, with the active contract for delivery in February at $388 an ounce; the near-month December contract settled at $386. Silver was 13.2 to 14.1 cents higher, with December at $4.095 an ounce. Platinum was 50 cents to $7.70 higher, with December at $416.40 an ounce.
Grain and soybean futures were lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as export trade continued to lag behind expectations.
Helping to push prices lower was news that United States and Soviet officials failed on Tuesday to agree on terms of the $500 million to $1 billion export credit offer made by the United States. Moscow reportedly wants the credit offer to include the cost of shipping farm products to the Soviet Union, a condition the United States is reluctant to agree to.
Analysts said that if the cost of shipping was included, it would leave the Soviets with less money to purchase grain.
 
Word of Deal for Soybean Meal
 Soybean futures were under heavy pressure as a result of word of a major purchase of South American soybean meal by the Soviet Union.
"So much attention is being paid the lack of business from the Soviet Union that people are ignoring the fact that sales to our traditional customers -- Taiwan, South Korea and Japan -- are down," said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago, adding that those countries are buying from China, which had a record crop.
"They don't feel the pressure to buy U.S. grains as they have in the past," Mr. Karlin said.
Wheat was 1/4 cent to 4 cents lower, with December at $2.47 3/4 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3 1/2 cents lower, with December at $2.24 a bushel; oats were 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 cents lower, with December at $1.05 1/4 a bushel; soybeans were 5 1/4 to 7 3/4 cents lower, with January at $5.76 1/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Funds' Yields Still Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Market Fund Report were mixed for the fourth consecutive week, ended yesterday.
Money fund managers have already noted some downward activity in short interest rates, following the Federal Reserve Board's lowering of the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent, on Tuesday.
Certain investors, money fund managers said, like to invest in money market funds when interest rates begin falling because fund yields do not change quickly. Thus, they can continue to receive a high return for a longer period of time.
 
Average Period at 56 Days
 In tax-exempt money funds, the average number of days that securities are held in portfolios was increased by one, to 56 days. Assets declined $37.8 million, to $85.6 billion, but analysts at Donoghue's said the change was minimal.
The average seven-day tax-exempt compounded yield, up for the third consecutive week, rose 5 basis points, to 5.55 percent, while the 30-day compounded average yield increased 8 points, to 5.43 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The rise in tax-exempt yields continues to be attributed to the large supply of municipal debt securities as communities increase their borrowing before the end of the year.
The current seven-day tax-exempt yield is equivalent to 7.70 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, and 8.28 percent for investors in the 33 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund produced the best return for the second consecutive week, with a return on investment of 6.62 percent. The fund is managed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc., Milwaukee.
 
Taxable-Fund Assets Up
 Assets on taxable funds rose by $1.37 billion, to $420.3 billion, with institutional funds up $1 billion, to $96.2 billion, and consumer funds up by $370 million, to $324.1 billion. Money continued to flow into United States Treasury and government agency security funds this week to the tune of about $437 million, despite the widening yield spread between non-government and government securities, which has made non-government yields attractive enought to forgo safety.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 6 basis points, to 7.42 percent, while the 30-day fell by a similar amount, to 5.49 percent.

HEADLINE: German Link To U.S. Rates

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
German unification could raise interest rates in the United States by at least a percentage point after 1992, a Congressional study released today said.
The Congressional Joint Economic Committee, which requested the study, said in a statement that "if Germany finances higher Government spending with higher borrowing, real short-term interest rates are estimated to be a full percentage point higher in the 1990's" in the United States.
The study, by the Congressional Budget Office, projected that the rate increase in the United States could be six-tenths of 1 percent next year, nine-tenths of 1 percent by 1992, 1 percent by 1993 and 1.1 percent by 1994.
The committee said that much of the money the United States borrows comes from the savings of German people. That money helps to cover the Federal budget deficit and to pay for imports. If the German Government borrows more of those savings for its own purposes, interest rates could rise in both countries.

HEADLINE: In First Gift to the Neediest, a Foundation Donates $125,000

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
A $125,000 gift to the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund -- money that could send 100 disabled youngsters to summer camp -- was received on Monday from the Willard T. C. Johnson Foundation in Manhattan.
In an uncertain climate for charitable donations, the check put the fund, for the first time, ahead of where it was at the same time last year. Twenty-five days into the campaign, the fund is $73,587.93 ahead of where it was in 1989. 
 This year's campaign started out last month with $222,034.21 less than the 1989 effort did. Gifts and bequests made during the year are counted in the pre-campaign totals, which gave the 1989 count a big head start.
Officials at different charities said that they were nervous and uncertain about their abiility to improve on previous fund-raising drives, and they cited various concerns -- government cutbacks, hard economic times and more homeless people -- that may mean more people in need of assistance and fewer who can pay for it.
Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, sounded a cautious note in assessing his group's fund-raising efforts this year: "We're kind of holding our own, but we're beginning to see signs that people who feel poorer are reaching deeper into their pockets."
 
More People Need Help
 The Children's Aid Society has raised about the same amount as last year, Mr. Coltoff said, but had hoped to improve on last year's performance because more people need help.
Henry Goldstein, president and chief executive of the Oram Group Inc., a national consulting organization for charities like CARE and the Big Brothers/ Big Sisters of New York City, said that most of his clients have not seen a fall-off in contributions.
Similarly, the Neediest Cases has not seen a drop in donations. Many of its traditional donors continue to send in contributions, and new ones, like the gift from the Johnson Foundation, are arriving for the first time.
The foundation had never donated to the Neediest Cases before, and it came as a surprise to officials of the fund, who had not solicited the gift. The donation is the second largest that the fund has received this year -- the first was a gift of $150,000 from the Starr Foundation of Manhattan.
A Johnson Foundation spokesman said that it normally is an "unobtrusive, quiet giver" and that it prefers to avoid public recognition. Established in the 1970's by an heir of a founder of Johnson & Johnson, the foundation has supported a variety of groups involved in cultural and social service activities.
In a statement released yesterday, the Johnson Foundation said: "The officers of the foundation recognized that it is a very difficult year in New York, particularly for the charities. The foundation believes that everyone should respond by giving to people who are less fortunate. The Times Neediest Cases Fund is one of the most effective ways of doing that.
Yesterday, there was also a $35,000 contribution from a donor who wished to remain anonymous.

HEADLINE: 5th Avenue Merchants Want a Ban on Vendors

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Officials of some of New York's most prestigious Fifth Avenue stores -- Tiffany's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman -- told a legislative hearing yesterday that street peddlers had turned the avenue into a flea market of haggling, hustling and counterfeit goods.
The merchants said the problem was especially bad this Christmas, as peddlers compete with stores for bargain-hunting shoppers. They said the peddlers clog pedesterian traffic around their stores, litter and try to engage prospective shoppers in illegal card games. 
 "New York needs the image of a healthy, glamorous Fifth Avenue," said Ira Neimark, chairman of Bergdorf Goodman. He read state legislators a letter from a customer who had complained that the world-famous shopping district had become "a sleazy main drag."
The hearing by the New York State Senate Committee on Investigations, Taxation and Government Operations was about New York City street vendors. In particular, the committee solicited information about the impact of state-licensed peddlers who are disabled veterans. They are exempt from municipal regulations on peddling.
 
Open-Air Markets
 In April, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan upheld an 1894 state law that gives special consideration to peddlers who are disabled veterans. The court ruled that the state law took precedence over a 1979 city ordinance that outlawed street peddlers from 30th Street to 65th Street between Second and Ninth Avenues, except on Sundays.
As the area's economy continues to slump, more vendors are on the streets throughout the city. The peddlers have turned some parts of Canal and 14th Streets into open-air markets, and on 125th Street in Harlem the battle continues betweeen growing numbers of vendors and shopkeepers.
"Conditions right now are the worst they've ever been in midtown," said Lieut. Robert Louttit, head of the Police Department's peddlers task force. Lieutenant Louttit said many of the veteran peddlers were improperly licensed or not really disabled.
The city has 1,150 licensed vendors, 560 of whom are veterans.
 
'Great Retailing Center'
 "No one wants to deprive disabled veterans, many of whom have joined the tragic ranks of the homeless, from a chance to earn a legitimate living," said Senator Roy M. Goodman, the committee chairman. "But while that right is being protected, our society must insure that it is not destroying a great retailing center which provides employment to tens of thousands of New Yorkers and a shopping mecca for millions of customers."
Mr. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican, said that while the peddlers were a problem throughout the city it is a particular problem for the Fifth Avenue stores because of the area's reputation. He said an informal survey by the investigations committee staff showed 166 street vendors on Fifth Avenue between 49th and 59th Streets one Sunday, selling everything from balloons to fake Cartier watches.
Joseph Kaswan, a 72-year-old disabled World War II veteran who sought the ruling on disabled peddlers, said yesterday that they had been been unfairly blamed. He said he had personally appealed to the peddlers not to sell counterfeit goods and to carry proper papers.
"I am very disturbed when I hear people equating the elegance of Fifth Avenue with the blood of the men shed defending this country," Mr. Kaswan said.
Senator Goodman said he hoped to amend the state law to restrict business times and places for the disabled vendors while taking into account their need for jobs. New York City Councilwoman Carol Greitzer, Democrat of Manhattan, has called for the State Legisature to amend the law so that all veterans are subject to regulations.

HEADLINE: Haitian Victor Reported Ready to Soften Stands

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Haiti's President-elect, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has privately told American officials that he is ready to work with the Haitian Army he has long opposed and moderate much of his leftist platform, Administration officials said today.
The officials pledged cautious support for Father Aristide, saying that their main concern now was to help assure that the army and supporters of the old Duvalier dictatorship refrain from disrupting or even preventing his scheduled Feb. 7 inauguration. 
 "Anything can happen in Haiti, but we believe he can take office and then we'll face the next hurdles," a ranking Administration official said. "This guy may not be our cup of tea, but we are going into this relationship with an open mind."
The Administration has concluded that the army's protection of the election and Father Aristide's conciliatory words toward his longtime enemies in the officer corps give Haiti the best chance it has had in years to work out an orderly political system. Officials also said that diminished concerns about Soviet interference in the Caribbean region had eased American fears about political figures like Father Aristide who openly criticize the United States and favor a socialist economic system.
 
'Off to a Good Start'
 Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, said the Administration's relationship with the new Haitian leader "got off to a good start" when he, Ambassador Alvin P. Adams Jr., and other American election observers met with the President-elect on Monday. Mr. Aronson requested the meeting to signal to the army that Washington supported the electoral process even though Father Aristide won.
"It was important to send a signal to the Duvialierists and the army that there was no wink and a nod" for them to undercut Father Aristide, a senior State Department official said.
At the meeting, Father Aristide thanked the United States for its support of the election process, recognized the contribution of the army in guaranteeing the balloting, and said he was willing to cooperate with military officers, private business and opposition political parties to unite the country. He also invited President Bush to attend his inauguration. A White House spokesman said Mr. Bush "welcomes the invitation but hasn't decided whether he can accept or not."
Officials quoted Father Aristide as saying during the meeting that "I want to make it clear to foreign investors that they are welcome in Haiti."
Father Aristide's comments came in sharp contrast to many of his previous public statements, in which he called for a social revolution and attributed much of Haiti's problems to the United States' support for a series of past dictatorships.
 
Further Aid Weighed
 Since Monday's meeting, officials in the State and Defense Departments have begun to study ways to increase aid to Haiti, which now stands at about $50 million a year. After three years of granting virtually no military aid, the Pentagon is considering sending the Haitian military medical supplies and perhaps even beginning a civic action program for road and bridge building.
Robert Pastor, a former National Security Council staff member who accompanied former President Jimmy Carter as an observer of the election, said, "Aristide begins with a mind-set that will inevitably cause some problems with Washington." But he said he and Mr. Carter were left hopeful after discussions with Father Aristide in which he gave the impression that he might appoint Marc L. Bazin, the leading conservative presidential candidate, as his Prime Minister. Mr. Pastor said Mr. Bazin also expressed interest in the idea.
Robert I. Rotberg, president of Lafayette College and an expert in Haitian affairs, said, "I've been a pessimist for many years, but now I am an optimist." He said he based his assessment on the fact that the army "secured the election," something that has won the military the kind of domestic and international praise that it has long desired.
Mr. Rotberg said Father Aristide could face serious problems, however, if he moves swiftly against the cocaine traffickers said to hold senior positions in the military. "Then he may confront a counterattack," he said.

HEADLINE: STUDY DISCOURAGES CASH FOR SOVIETS

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
A report by four Western economic organizations to be made public Friday concludes that the Soviet Union faces more obstacles to economic health than most third-world countries and that its current disarray is such that a large amount of direct aid would be wasted.
Assessing the economy of the Soviet Union in much the same way they have the economies of Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Nigeria and other troubled economies of the third world, the organizations' analysis is "very much in line" with the Administration's thinking, said a senior Bush Administration economic official, who asked not to be identified. 
 The study was commissioned at the economic summit meeting of seven industrial nations in Houston in July and chiefly drafted by the International Monetary Fund, with help from the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is based in Paris, and the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, based in London.
The study recommends an extensive infusion of technical assistance to help carry out a series of economic revisions. Later, to cushion the impact of suggested changes on Soviet citizens, who for example would pay higher rents once subsidies were cut, the Soviet Union could be made a member of the I.M.F. and World Bank and become eligible for loans to build a social security safety net for the poor and jobless.
 
Access to Global Lenders
 Last week President Bush, in what could be the first step toward that process, proposed a "special association" of the Soviet Union with the I.M.F. and the World Bank that would give Moscow access to the technical expertise of the lending organizations, which have assets of nearly $400 billion.
Administration officials had worried that the report would call for large-scale Western aid far beyond the food credits recently granted by the United States and its industrial partners.
"The conclusion comports with the President's position that direct financial help should not be used" before there is a coherent reform process, the Administration official said.
The report, which has gone through several drafts and was still being revised last weekend, is to be submitted to the heads of the seven nations this week. Those who have seen it say it urges that the Soviets lower the growth of the money supply, cut subsidies, curb wages, lift price controls, overhaul taxes, privatize Government enterprises and make the ruble's value more realistic.
 
An Economic Clean Break
 Still, such changes cannot be achieved as easily in the Soviet Union as in many third-world countries. In contrast to much of the third world, Moscow does not have in place an active private sector or the institutions, like a central bank and a commercial banking system, needed to ease market-oriented changes.
Nevertheless, the study calls on Moscow to make a clean break with its seven-decades-old command economy and speed the efforts President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has already started toward a market economy.
Otherwise, according to a draft obtained in Moscow by The Financial Times, the report warns, of "growing macroeconomic imbalances, increasingly severe shortages, and rising black-market prices."
The I.M.F. role proposed by Mr. Bush "appears to be a way for the U.S. Government to acquiesce in a program of real medium- and long-term aid to the Soviet Union without having to legislate in Congress," said Richard F. Kaufman, general counsel to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
 
Freeing the Ruble
 The report urges that as the keystone to economic change, Moscow establish a realistic value of the ruble, similar to what the Poles did with the zloty a year ago. The exchange rate of the ruble, like that of the zloty until it was freed, is governed by strict rules and controlled by the Government.
Warsaw increased interest rates on holdings denominated in zlotys, making the rate more attractive than it was for holdings in dollars.
The zloty has maintained its value. Under the Polish revisions, prices were completely freed while strong restraints remained on wages, which lowered purchasing power of workers.
Today stores in Poland are well stocked, but most people can not afford to buy what is in them. Because the political situation is more explosive in the Soviet Union, the report, while calling for similar currency changes, does not urge the same degree of control over wages.
Creating a currency with credible value would tend to end the hoarding of goods that is widespread in the Soviet Union and draw more scarce food and other goods backto store shelves, experts say.
"One of the reasons the system is not working is that they don't have a viable currency," says Dr. John P. Hardt, associate director of the Library of Congress and a scholar on Soviet affairs.
The report calls for a three-to-five-year program that would phase in the currency revisions and the privatization of industry and housing. It also urges better legal protection for private enterprise and greater security for foreign investment.
Initial reaction in Moscow has been noncommittal. A spokesman for President Gorbachev, Vitaly Ignatenko, told reporters Tuesday that the report was being studied by appropriate Soviet organizations and that certain conclusions would be drawn from it.

HEADLINE: Dow Ends Unchanged in Robust Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
With only eight business days left until the end of the year, investors moved into the market with a frenzy yesterday, pushing trading to a robust 180.4 million shares, the heaviest level in a week and up from 176.5 million the day before.
But after twice bounding 6 points ahead and twice retreating 13, the Dow Jones industrial average ended precisely where it began -- at 2,626.73. 
 The last time the Dow closed unchanged was when it hit its all-time high of 2,999.75 on July 17. By yesterday it was 373 points lower.
Advances narrowly outpaced declines, 854 to 712. But while 40 stocks fell to new 52-week lows, an impressive 30 rose to new highs.
Showing that stocks were treading water in what was still a bear market, the broader S.&P. 500 index, practically unchanged, rose less than a point. Moreover, program trading played only a minor role in price movements. Birinyi Associates said that one buying spurt just before 4 P.M. lifted the Dow 4 points, meaning that if not for the activity yesterday, stocks would have ended lower.
Crude oil weighed only slightly on the market with prices rising just a penny a barrel, to $26.93, near its low for the day.
 
Lack of Movement by Close
 Explaining the lack of movement by the close, traders said that institutional buyers trying to make their holdings look as attractive as possible and sellers eager to take their profits and get out were both active in the market.
After the 33-point rise on Tuesday in response to the Fed cutting the discount rate, Traders returned to worrying about the growing signs of war in the gulf, dividend woes of the big banking companies, fourth-quarter earnings disappointments, the sluggish economy and crude oil prices that seem to rise and fall with every mood change in Washington and the Middle East.
One of Wall Street's widely followed market services, the Bullish Consensus of Pasadena, Calif., reported that its weekly survey of futures traders showed that only 40 percent -- the lowest this year -- were bullish on stocks.
Richard A. Ishida, vice president of research, said that "90 percent of the people who see the number use it as a contrary indicator," but that "a contrary opinion only works at market extremes," that is, when the market is either near a high or low point.
Noting that the market had rallied sharply from its low in October, he said that rather than signaling a market upturn, the number "means that if you own blue-chip stocks, you're getting an early Christmas present and should get out at current price levels."
Even so, traders said, index funds, which mirror market averages like the S.&P. 500, were actively in the market yesterday and are expected to continue buying for the rest of the year. As explained by one trader, if they buy more stocks in the index, the stocks rise and the index rises, making their performance look more favorable.
Banking and other interest-sensitive stocks looked particularly good yesterday after the Fed cut the discount rate. Although Citicorp, the Big Board's most active stock, fell 7/8, to 13 1/4, after slashing the dividend and 4,400 jobs, Manufacturers Hanover, which kept its dividend unchanged, rose 1 5/8, to 22 1/2, and BankAmerica rose 1 5/8, to 26 5/8.
Freddie Mac rose 2, to 51 1/4; Norwest 1, to 20 3/8; First Wachovia 1 5/8, to 42 1/2; NBD Bankcorp 1 3/4, to 32 1/2; National City 1 5/8, to 29 5/8; MBIA 1, to 28 3/4, and AIG 1 5/8, to 78 3/4.
With gold prices up, gold stocks also advanced. American Barrick rose 1, to 20 3/8; Homestake 1 1/8, to 17 1/2; Newmont Mining 2 1/4, to 36 3/8; Newmont Gold 2 3/8, to 37 1/8, and ASA 1 7/8, to 42 1/2.
Penn Central, which plans to buy up to 5 million shares at $21, rose 1 1/4, to 20 1/8.
Disney fell 2 5/8, to 100 3/4, in what appeared to be profit taking.
 
STOCKS RETREAT IN TOKYO
 TOKYO, Thursday, Dec. 20 (Reuters) -- Japanese stocks fell today after two days of gains. The Nikkei index lost 351.84 points, or 1.41 percent, to close at 24,524.94. In the last two days, the Nikkei had risen 788.87, putting it close to the 25,000 mark.

HEADLINE: New York's Shaky Bridges Facing New Cuts

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
At a time when engineers are warning that New York City's bridges are in such deteriorated condition that dozens may be closed for repairs next year, city officials are planning further cuts in bridge maintenance and rebuilding, city engineers disclosed yesterday.
The engineers said city transportation officials notified them this week that the capital budget for bridge reconstruction would be cut by $22 million over the next five years. That would be in addition to $252 million in cuts ordered in November and would reduce spending on bridge projects to $930 million from the original figure of $1.2 billion. 
 The new cuts would mean that scores of deteriorating bridges due for rehabilitation over the next five years would not be repaired until sometime after 1995. Many bridges where repair work is being deferred would suffer major structural damage during the delay and might have to be closed temporarily, the engineers said.
 
Many Decks Corroding
 The decks of many of the bridges are corroding and if left unrepaired will develop large holes that could force engineers to close the bridges. Also, the concrete in many bridges is shearing away from reinforcing steel, which corrodes rapidly when exposed to water and pollution.
The engineers said pains would be taken to make sure the cuts would not affect the busiest city bridges, like the ones over the East River. Instead plans are to slow repair work on scores of smaller bridges, ramps and highway and street overpasses.
The city is also considering cutting $2 million more from the preventive maintenance budget, which already has been cut 38 percent -- to $5.8 million from $9.4 million -- for 1991. The $2 million cut would eliminate a program to remove loose concrete from the underdecks of bridges. The program was started in 1989 after a man was killed on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive when his car was hit by a slab of concrete that fell from the deck above.
The engineers, who spoke on condition that their names not be used, said that deferring maintenance and repairs would eventually cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency repairs and in major reconstruction that would result from the delay in rebuilding the bridges.
Transportation Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio acknowledged yesterday that cuts in bridge repairs would have severe consequences in several years.
 
A Future Crisis Predicted
 "In the short term we are on track, but as we look to the future years, we will be facing a crisis if we are not able to maintain the current level of rebuilding," he said.
A spokesman for the Transportation Department, Joseph DePlasco, said that the agency was still negotiating its capital budget with the city's Office of Management and Budget and that the city would announce the cuts in the capital budget tomorrow.
However, people at the Transportation Department who are familiar with the agency's capital budget confirmed yesterday that the budget figures supplied by the city engineers were correct.
And independent engineers and former transportation officials who have studied New York City's bridges agreed with the city engineers that the cuts would have devastating impact on the bridges.
 
'A Traffic Nightmare' Feared
 "These new cuts mean that the city will be spending far less than is needed to maintain the bridge system," said Ross Sandler, who was Transportation Commissioner under Mayor Edward I. Koch. "The result of this will be bridges in poorer condition, more closings of bridges and dislocation of traffic, and greater cost to eventually repair the bridges."
Louis G. Albano, a licensed engineer who is president of the Civil Service Technical Guild, which represents 7,000 city workers, including engineers and project coordinators for the city's bridge program, said cuts would slow the response to emergencies and result in more bridge closings and billions of dollars in additional future reconstruction costs.
"It will be a traffic nightmare," he said. "Are we forgetting the lessons of the 1970's and 80's, when the city even skimped on rust-proofing paint?"
 
Examples of Work Affected
 One of the bridges that was scheduled for repairs in the current capital program but that will not receive them if the budget cuts are made is the East 189th Street Bridge, at Fordham Plaza in the Bronx. It has large holes in its deck, and concrete is shearing from steel beams and falling onto the Metro-North Railroad tracks below. The bridge was scheduled for $11 million in repairs in 1992, but the work would be delayed until 1993. Engineers said they could be forced to close the bridge and reroute train service underneath.
Also facing delays in repairs is a ramp from North Conduit Boulevard over South Conduit Boulevard, at 84th Street in Queens, which has major corrosion in its deck and abutment and can no longer carry the loads for which it was designed. The ramp, a major thoroughfare, was scheduled to be repaired in 1993 at a cost of $1 million, but the budget cuts will delay the repairs until 1999, the engineers said. The ramp is likely to be closed during this time or to receive costly temporary repairs.
 
Hazardous Conditions Rising
 The city's Bureau of Bridges is scrambling to cope with a sharp increase in hazardous conditions that state inspectors have found in the last two months on city bridges, especially four over the East River. The inspectors have listed 355 hazardous conditions, or so-called red flags, on the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queensboro and Williamsburg Bridges.
The number of red flags is growing so quickly that city engineers say they cannot possibly fix them within the six weeks required by the state. Making matters worse are the growing cuts in the capital and maintenance budgets, the engineers said.
Under the latest cuts in the capital program, repairs will be delayed for at least one year on 85 bridges, the engineers said. About 70 of these bridges will receive no rehabilitation work until sometime after 1995.
Leland T. Jones, a spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, said yesterday that city was still negotiating its capital budget with the various agencies and that "none of these rumored cuts are cast in concrete."
"Everything is on the table now," he said, "but we must keep in mind that we are in a fiscal crisis and we have to scale back. If you devote more money for bridges, it will have to come from education, child abuse, AIDS care or other programs."

HEADLINE: Peru-I.M.F. Loan Accord

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Peru and the International Monetary Fund have agreed on guidelines for economic reforms, clearing the way for new loans, Peru's Finance Minister said today.
"We have reached an understanding on all points" of Peruvian President Alberto Kenyo Fujimori's austerity package, the Finance Minister, Juan Carlos Hurtado Miller, said. 
 The I.M.F., the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank have expressed "broad agreement" with Mr. Fujimori's plans to turn Peru's economy around, Government officials said.
Peru is now hoping that the United States, Japan and some European and Latin American countries will provide about $2.5 billion in low-interest loans and grants next year to cover a gap in its balance of payments and to clear interest that piled up during the administration of President Alan Garcia.
The fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, will be asking a group of countries to provide loans to Peru.
Mr. Fujimori's economic program includes new taxes, the sale of state-owned companies, a cut in the number of Government workers and a reduction in tariffs.

HEADLINE: Oil Price Is Little Changed; Heating Fuels Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Weather, not war fears, had the biggest impact on a generally sluggish oil market yesterday, with unseasonable warmth in the Northeast depressing natural gas even as a chilly forecast lifted heating oil.
Amid lackluster trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil settled at $26.93 a barrel, up a cent, on contracts for delivery in February. 
 Brokers have said the market will probably stay quiet through the holidays, barring major developments in the Persian Gulf.
 
Fears of a Price Plunge
 Although many oil traders have recently decided that war in the gulf region seems more likely than peace, they have not gone on a buying spree. Oil supplies are adequate, and there is a lingering perception that last-minute diplomacy could defuse the crisis, sending prices plunging.
Prices for a barrel of crude oil have, therefore, shown no inclination to move out of the area around the mid-$20's.
"On fundamentals, it would probably go to $20 a barrel or below," said Stephen Smith, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. "If there was war, it would probably go to $40. It's sitting halfway in between, not knowing where to turn."
Without any rumblings of war or peace stirring the market, the weather seemed to take control on some futures contracts.
Home heating oil showed the greatest strength yesterday, rising 2.17 cents, to 77.84 cents a gallon, on contracts for delivery in January.
 
Forecast of Cold
 "There's been a forecast of Arctic temperatures heading our way," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. "It kept prices up."
The fall has been unseasonably warm, keeping demand down for heating oil and natural gas.
Natural gas contracts have plummeted in recent weeks, and the cold weather hitting much of the nation this week was not enough to lift them. Natural gas for February delivery fell 6.4 cents yesterday, to $1.897 for 1,000 cubic feet.
"Inventory for natural gas is simply brimming," Mr. Smith said.
Unleaded gasoline showed little change, rising 0.70 cent, to 67.42 cents a gallon, on contracts for January delivery.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Allies Leave Jordan 'Out of the Loop'

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Jordan's growing isolation is perhaps best reflected in a small notice that appeared today in The Jordan Times: the German airline Lufthansa has announced that it will stop all flights to and from Amman by the end of January.
Lufthansa was the fifth airline to suspend flights to what only a year ago was a major Mideast hub, joining British Airways, Swissair, Alitalia and KLM. Of the major international carriers, only Air France still flies here, but businessmen say it, too, will soon suspend service. 
 Jordan's physical isolation mirrors the country's growing political isolation. Jordanian officials insist that their position on the Persian Gulf crisis -- opposition both to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and to the deployment of American and other foreign forces on Saudi soil -- has not changed.
But recent statements by King Hussein have angered members of the American-led alliance and enhanced the perception outside Jordan that he has sided with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
 
Speeches By King Hussein
 After King Hussein delivered a speech at the opening of Parliament last month implying that Washington's real motive for coming to Saudi Arabia's defense was safeguarding its oil, President Bush canceled a planned meeting with him in Paris. "That speech did not contain a single criticism of Saddam Hussein," an official in Washington noted.
Another speech on Dec. 9 by King Hussein, which he wrote himself, infuriated Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Arab officials noted that the speech never mentioned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, referring instead to the Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait as "the Iraq-Kuwait dispute" and "the disagreement between two sister countries."
The King also endorsed "the principle of compromise" to bring about "an outcome acceptable to both parties." And he linked the need to resolve the gulf crisis with the Palestinian situation, Saddam Hussein's demand, which has been rejected by the United States, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
A senior Arab official said the King's remarks led Saudi Arabia to conclude that since King Hussein had recently returned from Baghdad, the speech reflected not only a more distinct tilt by Jordan toward Iraq, but also Saddam Hussein's conclusion that he should "hang tough" because Washington would ultimately decide against a military confrontation.
 
'Now Out of the Loop'
 The Saudis have sent signals to insure that Iraq understood that Saudi Arabia would not accept King Hussein's proposed "compromise." The Algerian President, Chadli Benjedid, had planned to visit Amman and Riyadh, but the Saudis told the Algerians that there was no point in his visiting Riyadh without an Iraqi commitment in principle to withdraw from Kuwait. The Algerian press agency said Tuesday that Mr. Benjedid would soon visit Saudi Arabia. But the Saudi message rejecting a territorial compromise on Kuwait was clear.
"The King is now out of the loop," one diplomat here said. "He doesn't seem to understand how angry his traditional friends are at him. Only Syria seems willing to receive him." The Jordanian Prime Minister, Mudar Badran, visited Damascus on Tuesday to discuss the region's water crisis and "events in the gulf."
Jordanian officials say they have no new initiatives to resolve the crisis peacefully. But, they add, King Hussein has no intention of abandoning either hope or his stand against the acquisition of territory by force and the presence of foreign forces in Saudi Arabia.
 
Envoy Quietly Returns
 The officials also say Jordan is not as isolated as it may appear. Officials said that Jordan's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Nasir Batayneh, quietly returned to Saudi Arabia this week, and the Saudi envoy is expected back in Amman soon. The ambassadors were recalled several weeks ago as relations deteriorated over the gulf crisis.
Many Jordanian businessmen and intellectuals, however, are increasingly concerned about their country's economic and political plight. "Even if there is no war, Jordan is in trouble," said a longtime friend of the King's. "We have alienated the West, which supported us politically. And we have alienated the east -- Saudi Arabia and the gulf -- which helped sustain us financially. Jordan cannot survive with neither of them."
But most Jordanians, like the King himself, seem defiant. They say they must prepare for the war they hope will not come. At the Al Mahata Civil Defense Center, Brig. Gen. Omar Dandis, a 26-year-veteran of Jordan's civil defense agency, said that by the end of the year some 30,000 Jordanians -- 60 percent of them women -- will have been trained in voluntary civil defense classes that began in mid-August.
"We fear a battle is coming to our area," said Hani Haddadini, 50 years old, a doctor who spent the morning lifting colleagues on stretchers in a first-aid training session. "Our enemy is Israel, first and last," agreed Osama Mreish, 39, a pharmacist and fellow volunteer. "I don't want a war, but we must be ready if it comes."
Like many Jordanians, they are proud of Jordan's stance. And while diplomats in Riyadh and Washington express dismay and bewilderment at King Hussein's policy, diplomats here agree that he has never been been as popular at home.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE TO HEAD U.N. REFUGEE UNIT

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 19

 BODY:
A Japanese professor of international relations and expert on human rights was nominated today to take charge of the world's 15 million refugees, at a time when the relief agency she is to head faces a severe financial crisis.
The United Nations Secretary General named Sadako Ogata, who teaches at Sophia University in Tokyo, to be the next United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, replacing Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway. 
 Mr. Stoltenberg resigned in October after 10 months to become Foreign Minister in the new Norwegian Government of Prime Minister Gro Harlem Bruntland.
Diplomats say Japan had indicated it would try to increase its contribution to the refugee agency if Mrs. Ogata was chosen against rivals from Norway, Italy, Canada and elsewhere.
Although the world's refugees have doubled in number over the last decade, the agency's budget has remained frozen at around $500 million a year after adjustment for inflation. As a result the aid it gives to individual refugees has fallen by half.
Last year Japan was the second largest contributor to the agency, after the United States. The agency is financed entirely by voluntary contributions.
The choice of Mrs. Ogata, who is 63 years old, appears to be popular with the aid-giving countries that finance the agency as well as with the mainly developing countries that are host to most of the world's refugees. The General Assembly is expected to unanimously approve her nomination on Friday.
Mrs. Ogata holds degrees from George Washington University and the University of California at Berkeley. Her selection brings to an end a difficult search that was marred by a quarrel between the United States and the Secretary General over the latter's attempt to give the post to his Indian chief of staff, Virendra Dayal. That ended with Mr. Dayal's withdrawal.
Mrs. Ogata served as a senior member of Japan's delegation to the United Nations from 1976 to 1979. She has also been chairwoman of the United Nations Children's Fund Executive Board and has served as Japan's representative on the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, which this year sent her to investigate human-rights abuses in Myanmar, formerly Burma.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Treasuries Fall, Reversing Tuesday's Gains

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Waves of sell orders swept the market in long-term Treasury debt issues yesterday, more than erasing the gains on Tuesday that were sparked by the Federal Reserve's first cut in its discount rate in four years, to 6.5 percent from 7 percent.
The selling came in spite of the downward revision in the third-quarter gross national product by the Commerce Department, to an annual growth rate of 1.4 percent from a previous estimate of 1.7 percent. 
 Normally, any negative economic news is considered bullish for the fixed-income market because it reduces the likelihood of inflation and higher yields on newer issues.
In yesterday's bearish market, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent bonds maturing in August 2020, were offered late in the session at 106 12/32, down 1 5/32 on the day, for a yield of 8.17 percent. The day before, the long bond rose 1 1/32, for a yield of 8.08 percent.
"It seems that everyone was waiting for an opportunity to bail out of the bond market and put some black ink on the books," said Andrew J. Schnydrig, money market trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer of Zurich. "When the bond market took off Tuesday after the Fed cut its discount rate, that was the opportunity the longs were waiting for to take profits and run."
In Chicago, the spot December futures contract on Treasury bonds expired at 96.26, down 10/32 on the day. The contract's high, 99.24, was set on Dec. 20, 1989, and the low, 79.30, was posted on July 13, 1988.
Meanwhile, the Treasury's long notes, the 8.5 percent notes maturing in November 2000, dropped 26/32, to 103 14/32, to yield 7.98 percent.
Some selling was also prompted when the Tokyo and London markets showed no response to the Fed's discount rate cut.
Several dealers said the overseas markets would have been more impressed if the discount rate cut had been followed by reductions in banks' prime lending rates. But such reductions are considered unlikely in the near future in view of the poor profit outlook at many of the big banks.
 
Holiday Sluggishness
 Later, when the New York Treasury bond market opened on a weak note, there were relatively few buyers aside from some with short positions who were seeking to cover those positions. But this buying was not enough to stanch the flood of selling, Mr. Schnydrig noted.
Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu, attributed the dearth of buyers largely to the holiday season.
"No one wants to hold inventory, especially at current carrying costs, until the end of the year," he said. "With the Fed not expected to do anything until after New Year's Day, if then, most market participants are busy closing their books on 1990."
The Fed did inject $1.5 billion of reserves yesterday, which usually is seen as a signal for a lower Federal funds rate, but it was not a clear statement yesterday, Mr. Fabbri said, because it came at the end of the two-week bank statement period, a time when many banks scramble for funds to meet reserve and other requirements. Thus the Fed's move could have been aimed at helping banks meet their needs.
"But the fact that the funds traded down to 7 percent, from 7 1/16 percent, after the Fed's move led some to briefly conclude that 7 percent is the Fed's new target for the funds," Mr. Fabbri said. However, the funds traded back up to 7 1/16 percent at the close.
The Federal funds rate is considered the bedrock cost of credit because that is what banks charge each other for temporary loans. Last Friday, the funds traded at 7.25 percent, which was then viewed as the Fed's target.
 
Early Auction Scheduled
 The discount rates on Treasury bills, meanwhile, held firm. The 90-day bills, usually the most immediately influenced by changes in the funds rate, dipped a basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point, to 6.60 percent; six-month bills rose a basis point, at 6.60 percent, and the one-year bills rose 3 basis points, to 6.47 percent.
Because trading in Government securities will end at 2 P.M. next Monday, Christmas Eve, the Treasury will hold its next weekly auctions of three- and six-month bills tomorrow.
The Treasury also announced that it would auction a record $12.5 billion of two-year notes on Dec. 26, up from $12.3 billion at the last sale of this maturity a month ago.
On Dec. 27, the Treasury said, it plans to hold its last auction of four-year notes. Starting in January, the Treasury will be regularly offering larger amounts of five-year notes. The final four-year note sale will consist of a record $8.5 billion, up from the $8.25 billion sold at what has been a quarterly auction of this maturity.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Wave of Gloom Over War Peril Covers Baghdad

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 19

 BODY:
A wave of national gloom is settling over the Iraqi capital at the prospect that this nation may be sliding toward a destructive military confrontation with the United States and its allies.
With diplomacy deadlocked, food prices soaring under the pressure of United Nations trade sanctions, medicines in short supply and a whole generation of young men going back into uniform after eight years of brutal combat against Iran, many of those Iraqis who answered a Westerner's questions, in more than a week of interviews, said they were living day to day, hoarding money and searching for mental distraction from the harsh realities of life. 
 Nightly television programming has been taken over by instructional films on evacuation plans, first aid, bomb shelter making and air-raid procedures. The civil defense authorities have announced that they will run an evacuation drill on Friday in Saddam City, the sprawling and impoverished neighborhood northeast of downtown, home to a million Iraqis.
 
Loath to Criticize Policies
 In the police-state atmosphere here, Iraqis are loath to criticize the policies of President Saddam Hussein. But in family discussions and among trusted friends, Mr. Hussein's invasion and annexation of Kuwait have been the subject of intense debate and are widely regarded as unpopular moves, according to dozens of Iraqis, Arabs and Westerners interviewed here in recent days.
Political jokes about Mr. Hussein and his Government, seldom heard outside the home because they could lead to arrest, torture or imprisonment, can now be heard with greater frequency, Western diplomats report. This week, many Baghdad residents have greeted with scorn reports that the Government has distributed gas masks and protective clothing to members of the governing Arab Baath Socialist Party, but not to the population as a whole.
The Government has tried to lessen the burden of the economic sanctions by funneling into the open market tons of luxury items, specialty foods and supplies looted from Kuwait, but there are few buyers. Meat has remained in relatively plentiful supply and prices have gone up only modestly.
New Mercedes buses taken from Kuwait are running the downtown Baghdad routes, but tires for passenger cars are in such short supply that the price has risen from 35 dinars for a pair to nearly 500 dinars.
Iraqis are buying little more than what is needed to survive. "Go to the shops," a young Iraqi professional said. "No one has sold anything in four months."
 
Price Increases of 700%
 One Iraqi businesswoman said, "People will not spend their money when there is this much uncertainty about the future."
Government-subsidized bread and other basic foods remain the staples that feed the nation, but most families must supplement Government rations by buying on the open market, where prices have risen as much as 700 percent.
A 100-pound bag of flour that sold for 3.5 dinars in the summer is selling for 200 dinars this winter. A hundred pounds of rice cost 10 dinars in the summer, but costs 200 dinars today. Sugar has undergone a similar price explosion.
As an Eastern European diplomat noted, the value of the Iraqi dinar has slipped beneath the lowest level it reached during the Iran-Iraq war.
 
Military Registration
 On Thursday morning, all healthy male 33-year-old Iraqis must report to military registration centers, where they will be given a date and time to report to various military bases. The call-up of all men born in 1957 followed a broader call-up on Nov. 23 to muster 250,000 other troops to defend Kuwait and Iraq from attack, according to an announcement by Mr. Hussein. In the first call-up, men born between 1958 and 1960 were ordered to report for duty.
Western diplomats said there were more frequent reports of desertions by young men.
The Iraqi businesswoman said many young men were hiding inside the country, moving from hideaway to hideaway to avoid the military police, who are authorized to execute deserters.
A young Iraqi, Samir, the oldest child in a family of six, got the news of his call-up this week while listening to the radio in his car.
"I served 9 1/2 years in the Army," said the young man, his forehead pressed against the steering wheel. "I have no wife, no profession. I have forgotten my English and accounting and so many things I learned in school because of the army. Where is my life? The best years are gone."
 
Aging Speeded in Captivity
 The young man showed a visitor a photograph of a family reunion at his home recently in which the family welcomed a cousin who had spent eight years in an Iranian prisoner-of-war camp.
The cousin, Samir said, is 35 years old, but his aging was accelerated by life on a half piece of bread a day and two cigarettes a week.
An Iraqi merchant who has tried to employ several returning prisoners of war said they were suffering severe psychological problems.
Another army reservist, who has not yet been called up, lives in dread that he will soon hear a similar radio bulletin. He said most Iraqis would return to the military without question. They will fight to defend Mr. Hussein's adventure in Kuwait because they have no choice, he said.
Under Mr. Hussein, that reservist said, resistance and opposition are snuffed out immediately and brutally.
As a result, the reservist said, "it's a kind of fatalism" that drives Iraqis as they prepare to go back into battle. "People already are dying emotionally and psychologically -- so it is not such a threat for them to die physically," he said.
 
Civil Defense Programs
 That attitude can be found in various forms throughout the country, Western embassies report.
Reacting to the blitz of civil-defense programs on state-controlled television, a Western diplomat said, "I suppose they've got to do it, but it just makes people more and more depressed."
In Saddam City this week, a visitor stopped in a tea house and was invited to play a game of dominoes with a middle-aged man, Qathem Abu Juwad, who said he had lost one son as a pilot in the war against Iran and has a second son serving as an Army captain in the south of Iraq. There is one small son left at home, he said.
Mr. Abu Juwad, in the crowded tea house where many ears were trained on his conversation with a foreign journalist, recited the national rote response when asked whether he was concerned that war was coming.
 
'Practiced in War'
 "We are practiced in war," he said. "We know war and we are not afraid of war."
But as he talked about his youngest son, the one who had not yet seen war, Mr. Abu Juwad amended his comments. "We don't need war because it will destroy everything," he said.
But there is another common expression in Iraq this holiday season, that of hope, which the Iraqi businesswoman said was another common refuge of people who have no control over their lives.
She said many Iraqis become wildly optimistic at the slightest hint of diplomatic progress in broadcasts into Iraq by British and American shortwave radio programs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Adopts New Policy for Hearings On Political Asylum for Some Aliens

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 19

 BODY:
The Government agreed today to stop detaining and deporting most illegal aliens from El Salvador and Guatemala and to adopt new procedures for their applications for political asylum.
The actions, in a settlement of a lawsuit filed five years ago in Federal District Court here, mean new hearings for 150,000 illegal aliens from El Salvador and Guatemala who have been denied political asylum or are awaiting decisions on their applications. 
 Also qualifying for hearings are about 350,000 other illegal aliens who have never sought asylum because the previous system was so weighted against them, said Marc Van Der Hout, a lawyer with the San Francisco chapter of the National Lawyers Guild and the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in the class-action suit,
At the heart of the suit was the assertion that the Government had not decided on the granting of political asylum in a neutral, non-political manner, as required by law.
 
An Embarrassing Choice
 Such applications have long presented the Government with an embarrassing choice. The United States supports the Governments of El Salvador and Guatemala, and at the same time it is asked by asylum applicants to find that they have a "well-founded fear of persecution" if they are returned home. Every approval of an application for political asylum thus amounts to an admission that the United States is aiding governments that violate the civil rights of their own citizens.
Since 1980 the Government has denied 97 percent of applications for political asylum by El Salvadorans and 99 percent of those by Guatemalans. During the same time, applications for political asylum by Eastern Europeans, Nicaraguans and residents of other countries have a high percentage of approval. For example, 76 percent of applications by residents of the Soviet Union were approved, as were 64 percent of those by residents of China.
In pre-trial rulings in the suit, Judge Robert F. Peckham of Federal District Court held that the low percentage of approval of asylum applications from El Salvadorans and Guatemalans made it futile for those aliens to continue to pursue the usual administrative process for legal residence in the United States.
Under the settlement, the Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to no longer defer to the State Department regarding grants of political asylum.
 
Praise for the Agreement
 "We hope that 10 years of bias and hostility are finally over," said Lucas Guttentag, director of the Immigrants' Rights Project of American Civil Liberties Union and a lawyer in the suit. "For the first time, Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees will have a meaningful opportunity to secure political asylum under United States law."
Joseph C. Krovisky, the spokesman for the Justice Department in the matter, said today, "The Government believes it is a fair agreement. At this point we have no further comment."
The settlement means that all cases heard since 1980 will be reheard under regulations for asylum processing that were enacted this fall in conformity with the Refugee Act of 1980. Mr. Van Der Hout said these include the establishment of a corps of asylum officers who will no longer report to local immigration service officials, but will rather work at a Central Office for Refugees, Asylum and Parole in Washington.
In addition, the new asylum officers and immigration judges will receive training in international human rights issues. The churches and alien-rights groups that originally brought the suit will designate representatives to help conduct the training.
 
A Humanitarian Gesture
 The settlement also applies to all El Salvadoran illegal aliens who plan to register next year under a law guaranteeing them 18 months of "temporary protected status." The measure, which President Bush signed into law last month, is meant as a humanitarian gesture to those fleeing war in their homeland; El Salvadorans who are living in the United States illegally and who come forward and register obtain the right to live and work here temporarily.
Under the settlement, Mr. Van Der Hout said, those aliens can apply for political asylum at the end of the 18 months rather than face deportation. All those who have begun the asylum process may legally work in the United States.
The settlement averts a trial on the Government's immigration policies. Judge Peckham had ruled last year that such a trial could proceed on the aliens' claims of discriminatory denial of asylum in violation of their constitutional rights to free speech, equal protection and due process.
The judge has signed the preliminary settlement agreement and scheduled a final hearing for Jan. 31. In anticipation of the settlement, lawyers for the aliens said, the immigration service issued a memorandum last week halting the scheduled deportations of El Salvadorans and Guatemalans. It began taking applications for release from border detention centers today.
"This settlement is a major victory for all Salvadorans and Guatemalans in this country whose claims for political asylum were being summarily denied for purely foreign policy reasons," Mr. Van Der Hout said. "The tragedy, however, is that it took 10 years for the Government to reverse its policy of putting support for the military governments of El Salvador and Guatemala over its human rights oblications to grant asylum to legitimate refugees."
 
Campaign to Find Aliens
 The Government has agreed to allocate $200,000 to work with churches, refugee social service centers and advocacy groups to locate illegal aliens who are affected by the settlement. The campaign will concentrate on the eight cities with the largest numbers of El Salvadoran and Guatemalan aliens: San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, Miami, Houston, Dallas and Chicago.
In response to arguments that the immigration service repeatedly deferred to State Department wishes in ruling on asylum applications, the Government specified that certain factors would no longer be proper for consideration in determining eligibility for political asylum. They are American foreign policy, border control and an applicant's coming from a country supported politically by the United States.
The lawsuit was filed in May 1985, a time when religious leaders and lay workers were offering sanctuary to El Salvadorans and others fleeing fighting in Central America and when the Government was charging sanctuary workers with violations of Federal law by assisting illegal aliens.
The suit originally sought to bar the Justice Department from prosecuting sanctuary workers, who claimed a constitutional right under the First Amendment's clause on free exercise of religion to protect people they viewed as refugees. It also charged discriminatory treatment in asylum and deportation of Central Americans who claimed to be refugees.
 
Redrafting the Lawsuit
 In a series of rulings, Judge Peckham dismissed the sanctuary workers' claims but allowed the suit to go forward on behalf of the illegal aliens. It was redrafted as a class-action case on behalf of all El Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants.
The Rev. Gustav H. Schultz, president of the National Sanctuary Defense Fund, called the settlement announced today "a vindication of the hundreds of people in the sanctuary movement who put life and liberty on the line to assist Central American refugees who were fleeing for their lives."
The Government has consistently argued that illegal aliens from Central America are not political refugees, but are economic refugees who come to the United States looking for jobs.
 
Reason Is 'Obvious'
 But one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Reginaldo Velasquez, who first fled El Salvador in 1980, said in an interview, "It is obvious that the war is what brings us up here. The reason why we come is political."
Mr. Velasquez, 28 years old, said he was a student in Uluazapa when he organized a local chapter of the Green Cross, an organization of relief workers that helps civilians and fighters on both sides of El Salvador's civil war. When several co-workers either disappeared or were killed, he fled to Mexico in 1980. He was caught and deported, but in 1984 he fled again. This time he was arrested in Texas just after crossing the Rio Grande.
Mr. Velasquez applied for asylum, and it was denied. He has been working as a cook in a San Francisco restaurant while waiting for a ruling from the Board of Immigration Appeals.
He said that he would like to return to Uluazapa, but that relatives have told him that soldiers still come to the house looking for him.
"Nothing has changed," Mr. Velasquez said. "The military people are still there, and they know me. Many people have died like this, and it could happen to me."
His hope is to gain political asylum in the United States.
"I always have doubts, but I think it's a very good chance," he said of today's settlement. "Perhaps this time things will be seen with a more human view."

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Rate Is Cut to 1.4% In Revision for 3d Quarter

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
The economy was even weaker than previously feared in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported today. It said the gross national product grew during the period at an anemic 1.4 percent rate, compared with its previous estimate of 1.7 percent.
Today's report was the second and final revision for the G.N.P., the central figure used to determine whether the economy is growing. 
 Many economists say the G.N.P. began to shrink this quarter and will continue to do so through the first quarter of next year, meeting the traditional definition of recession, which is two successive quarters in which growth shows a decline.
 
Focus on Credit Policy
 Alan Levenson, director of financial services at the WEFA Group, said that cheaper credit was needed to prod the economy back to life.
Indeed, the economy's weakness has led the Federal Reserve's policy makers, who had focused their efforts on fighting inflation, to reverse course and fight recession instead, by easing credit.
The central bank pumped money into the banking system today in a move that analysts said was intended to push down the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans. The action followed the Fed's decision late Tuesday to cut the discount rate, which is what it charges on loans to member banks.
The moves send a strong signal to major banks to start cutting their prime lending rates, now at 10 percent. Cheaper credit might encourage borrowing and spending.
Weaker consumer spending accounted for much of the decline in G.N.P.. That component grew by only $18 billion, down from last month's estimate of $20.9 billion, the Commerce Department said. Consumer spending is critical to growth because it accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity.
 
Exports Falter
 Export sales provided no lift. They fell $1.9 billion, a revision from the previous estimate of a drop of $500 million.
"With exports not roaring and the consumer pulling back, that takes out the twin engines of growth that were keeping things moving," said Jean Sundrla of Evans Economics Inc.
Financial markets shrugged off the G.N.P. figures, with stocks little changed.
Robert McGee, economist at Tokai Bank Ltd., termed the data "ancient history," saying, "It is clear from fourth-quarter statistics so far that growth has turned negative."

HEADLINE: Manhattan Man Held In Slaying of Nephew

 BODY:
A 22-year-old Manhattan man was arrested last night and charged with beating his 15-month-old nephew to death to stop the child from crying, the police said.
The suspect, William Vega, of 70 West 115th Street, called 911 just after 9 P.M. on Tuesday for medical help for the child, a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Mary Wrensen, said.
The child, Antoine Grady, was taken to St. Luke's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
The boy's injuries indicated that he had been beaten and kicked, Sergeant Wrensen said. Mr. Vega, who is unemployed, was charged with second-degree murder and endangering the welfare of a minor, she said.
The police said the child's mother, who was not identified, brought him from North Carolina just before Thanksgiving and had recently returned there, leaving the boy in Mr. Vega's care.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Drops Plan to Require Waste Incinerators to Recycle

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Bowing to strong objections from a White House panel, the Environmental Protection Agency reluctantly agreed today to drop a planned requirement that incinerators recycle a quarter of their incoming garbage.
The recycling proposal met stiff resistance earlier in the day at a meeting of the President's Council on Competitiveness. Among those attending the White House meeting was the environmental agency's Administrator, William K. Reilly, who said afterward that the provision would be deleted from a regulation on incinerators that his agency is to adopt on Dec. 31. 
 Mr. Reilly said he decided during the meeting that the regulation was not the "appropriate vehicle for a major mandatory program with significant potential to disrupt local government plans" for incineration programs that could generate electricity and thus reduce the demand for new power plants.
 
Plight of Cities
 The regulation, issued in draft form a year ago, will set stricter air pollution standards for trash burning at a time when an increasing number of communities see incineration as a means of dealing with a growing shortage of landfill space, especially in the East.
Environmentalists had campaigned vigorously to include a recycling provision in the regulation, arguing that the requirement would reduce the amount of wastes burned and, therefore, air pollution.
"This is a major environmental retreat," said David Doniger, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The Administration is retreating on its own commitment for recycling."
The waste disposal industry had opposed the recycling provision. Allen Moore, president of the National Solid Waste Management Association, recently said in a letter to Mr. Reilly: "Waste combustion is now seen as a cost-effective and environmentally sound means of solid waste management for many communities. This could change if burdensome, and perhaps costly, recycling requirements are a condition."
 
Stiff Opposition
 Administration officials knowledgeable about the White House discussions today said that Mr. Reilly had argued in favor of the recycling provision but had found stiff opposition from members of the Council on Competitiveness, a regulatory review panel that is headed by Vice President Dan Quayle.
Among those reported to have argued against the provision were Deputy Energy Secretary Henson W. Moore; Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
 Mr. Reilly could have appealed the matter to President Bush, but he declined to do so.
Critics of the provision maintained that the costs of recycling a quarter of the garbage destined for incineration outweighed the benefits and could hinder development of waste-to-energy programs in some communities. They argued that the issue of recycling should be dealt with separately next year.

HEADLINE: Struggle at White House;
Mishandling of Scholarships for Minorities Reflects Search for a Civil Rights Agenda

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
The White House's tortured handling of scholarships for minorities reflects both the disarray in President Bush's domestic policy management and a fierce struggle for the civil rights agenda in the top levels of the Administration.
 That struggle resumed with a new intensity from the moment Mr. Bush woke up on the morning of Dec. 12 to news reports of the Education Department's decision to prohibit federally subsidized institutions from designating scholarships for specific minority groups. 
 Surprised and reportedly disturbed, the President ordered his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, to find a way to retreat from the ruling, which was not only politically damaging but also challenged Mr. Bush's commitment to minority scholarship programs.
 
Trying to Please Both Sides
 Panicked White House officials clashed over policy and tactics in a series of contentious meetings that concluded, as has happened so often in Mr. Bush's tenure, with the White House trying to please both sides and, in the view of critics and supporters alike, pleasing virtually nobody, including the President himself.
Mr. Bush expressed concern that there would be a court challenge of the new ruling, which allowed use of private money specifically designated for minorities but not money from a college's general operating funds. And some Administration officials worried that the split-the-difference approach would not only undercut the President's position opposing racial quotas, but would also leave the White House grappling for months with an issue that should have been laid to rest.
Under the revised proposal announced Tuesday by Michael L. Williams, the Assistant Secretary of Education for civil rights, there will be a four-year transition period during which "the Administration will not pursue a broad compliance review," thereby giving the Administration some leeway.
 
A Lack of Direction
 "It's the central impulse of the Bush Administration -- why can't everyone be satisfied?" said an adviser to the White House, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Administration officials and Republican strategists said the fact that no senior White House official knew the change in policy was even being contemplated reflected a lack of direction and a lack of an "ideological compass" on domestic issues.
"If it were a different kind of Administration you could argue that someone would have known about the shift or that Bush's policy would have been so clear that Williams wouldn't have done it in the first place," one official said.
He added: "If it were a different kind of Administration, it wouldn't have been so hard to react. People didn't immediately fall into their grooves and say, 'This is what we have to do,' because people don't necessarily know where their grooves are."
 
'Constant Tension and Pressure'
 Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was President Jimmy Carter's domestic policy adviser, said the scholarships issue was part of a much broader problem.
"Bush has had to make common cause on issues from the budget to clean air and civil rights with a majority of Democrats in Congress who are to his left," Mr. Eizenstat said. "He is postured within his own party in the middle, while the interest groups, the outside advocates and the Young Turks on the Hill who are the most vocal are to his right. So you get constant tension and pressure, and the domestic policy of the Administration is Janus-like."
But the uproar over the scholarship issue was a case study more specifically in why it is so difficult for the Bush Administration to deal with civil rights issues as it tries to mollify conservative Republicans, woo Democrats who once voted for Ronald Reagan and mend fences with minority groups.
In part this is a reflection of one of the most fundamental battles in Republican politics, between movement conservatives who oppose all forms of racial quotas and establishment, government-oriented Republicans like Mr. Bush who operate largely according to pragmatism and support affirmative action.
 
Another Political Dimension
 Some officials, like C. Boyden Gray, the counsel to the President, and William Kristol, Vice President Dan Quayle's chief of staff, see the issue of job quotas in the workplace as a strictly legal and ideological issue and as a golden opportunity to appeal to Reagan Democrats. They have been working to capture that issue for the 1992 elections, but have had to proceed slowly to avoid alienating black voters entirely.
Other officials, including Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Roger P. Porter, the White House domestic policy adviser, and his aide, James Pinkerton, have been pressing for the Administration to be more open to minorities and to espouse affirmative action and other carefully modulated civil rights as a way of overcoming the Republicans' problems with minority voters.
"The Education Department thing threw the cat among the pigeons, forcing a confrontation between those two desires," said Stuart Butler, director of domestic policy studies for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative, Washington-based research group. "They were trying to make a case for a civil rights policy that requires moving slowly and methodically, and the last thing you want is something that forces you to take sides."
Mr. Eizenstat said: "Bush and the Republican Party are torn. There are his own predilections to be fair and accomodating, and the political imperative to chip away the last remaining loyal bloc of Democratic voters, minorities. But there is also a need to give the Reagan Democrats red meat at a time when the economy is going into the tank, and they see civil rights and quotas as a wedge issue."
For months, the first group seemed to be winning this battle for Mr. Bush's soul, including an equally highly wrought fight over whether the President should veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990 in October. In that case, Mr. Bush came down on the side of those who argued that the bill would create job quotas, and he vetoed the bill.
 
Ambivalence on Civil Rights
 But the ban on the practice of designating scholarships for minority students thoroughly confused the picture, since it struck at the President's own ambivalence on civil rights.
The pragmatic Republican in Mr. Bush was able to embrace the purist, no-quotas position despite the political hazards of vetoing the civil rights legislation. The scholarship issue touched the noblesse oblige side of Mr. Bush, who has long supported affirmative action and has contributed to causes like the United Negro College Fund.
"It's one thing to tell blue-collar workers you're protecting their jobs against racial quotas," said a Republican strategist. "It's quite another to take a college scholarship away from an 18-year-old black kid."
Some Republicans said they worried that the new position on scholarships would undermine the foundation of Mr. Bush's stand on the civil rights bill -- that special treatment for any minority group, is not acceptable even if it is intended to help an underclass.
"Bush was on the record with that position on the Hill and it was something that Republicans and conservative Democrats could use to explain why they supported Bush's veto," said a Republican strategist. "Now all of a sudden, here comes Bush saying it is O.K. to treat some groups differently."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK PHONE WINS AN INCREASE IN RATES OF 4.8%

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The New York State Public Service Commission yesterday authorized the New York Telephone Company to raise the price of local phone service by about 7 percent for residential customers and 2 percent for business customers.
But the actual increases will be much larger for customers in both categories who make only a few calls within their community, and smaller for those who make many calls to nearby communities, for which they are billed separately. 
 The rate increase, totaling $250 million, for an overall rise of 4.8 percent, was a fraction of the $832 million increase that New York Telephone had sought last spring after the Public Service Commission narrowly rejected a $445 million increase jointly proposed by New York Telephone and the commision's staff.
 
Criticized by Company
 The commission's rejection prompted the phone company to file a formal rate increase petition, which ended in yesterday's decision. The new rates are to take effect on Jan. 1.
New York Telephone officials immediately criticized the $250 million figure as inadequate and said the ruling would leave it with some of the lowest profits per telephone line of any company in the United States.
"We need reasonable earnings if we are to continue to modernize New York's telecommunications network," the company said in a statement.
 
'A Christmas Present'
 Richard M. Kessel, the executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, was also unhappy about the ruling. "The P.S.C. has decided to give New York Telephone a Christmas present with our money," Mr. Kessel said, adding that the board would consider filing a lawsuit seeking to overturn the commission's decision.
The main effect of the commission's ruling will be to raise the basic fee residential users pay for having a phone line and making some local calls. The current rate is $3.75 to $7.55 a month, depending on the number of free calls included in the billing plan, plus a fee for additional calls.
This fee will change to about $7 a month, and there will be no free calls. Each local call will cost from about 4 to 10.2 cents.
For example, a resident who subscribes to New York Telephone's basic budget service and made one daytime call to a nearby friend every day last month was charged about $6.25 for that basic local service. Long-distance calls, Federal taxes and fees, and charges for other services, like call waiting and touch-tone dialing, are additional.
Under the state commission's ruling yesterday, the same customer will owe as much as $9 or $10 for the basic service. The precise amount is unclear because the commission's staff must recalculate many of its rates based on specific instructions from the commissioners.
Both New York Telephone and the Public Service Commission declined to comment about how much specific rates might rise, citing the need for new calculations. For example, the commission ordered the price of touch-tone telephone service to be reduced by a third, instead of by a half as expected.
 
Special Rates for the Poor
 The decision will affect New York Telephone's 6.3 million residential and 2.8 million business phone lines throughout the state, including 2.9 million residential and 1.6 million business lines in New York City. Forty other small phone companies serve a total of nearly a million lines in the state.
Dr. Gail Garfield-Schwartz, an economist who is the commission's deputy chairwoman, said raising the phone bills of residential customers more than those of businesses was appropriate. Businesses have long subsidized residential customers by payingmore to the phone company than the company spends on serving them. Yesterday's decision, which also maintains special low phone rates for the poor, will reduce that subsidy slightly and insure that more people pay for phone service based on how much they value it, Dr. Garfield-Schwartz said.
The commission also ordered its staff to study whether New York Telephone should continue its policy of charging needy customers and disabled veterans $1 a month for local phone service, plus the usual charge for each outgoing call.
For more than a year, the rate case has been overshadowed by accusations that the New York Telephone Company overpaid affiliated but unregulated companies for goods and services, like the hiring of temporary employees and the removal of outdated equipment. The commission's study of New York Telephone's $832 million rate increase petition uncovered evidence last spring that a dozen employees of one of those affiliated companies, the Nynex Materiel Enterprises Company in Manhattan, attended lewd parties in Florida that may have been subsidized by vendors.
 
A Separate Inquiry
 The commission recently began a separate inquiry into those allegations, and did not consider them yesterday. It did set aside $32 million of its $250 million increase, pending the outcome of the inquiry.
New York Telephone and the affiliated companies are all subsidiaries of the Nynex Corporation, one of the seven regional Bell companies created when the American Telephone and Telegraph Company divested itself of its local telephone operations in 1984.
Richard Stannard, the director of the commission's communications division, said that all but $20 million of the $250 million increase will go toward compensating New York Telephone for the cost of outdated equipment. The phone company will keep the remaining $20 million as increased profit.
 
A Major Issue
 New York Telephone earned $497 million last year on sales of $7.45 billion.
A major issue in the rate case was whether New York Telephone is earning enough money to modernize its network quickly enough.
The State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, a strong critic of the company's management, said the $250 million increase was preferable to the $445 million originally sought. But he criticized the commission for not specifically requiring the company to invest part of the increase it received to improve its local telephone network.
The company does not plan to replace its last electromechanical central-office switches with electronic switches until 1998. Electronic switches allow customers to connect to any long-distance carrier without having to dial extra numbers and make possible other services like call forwarding and call waiting. Coincidentally, the regional Bell company for the Southeast, which serves a more rural market, announced yesterday that it had replaced its last electromechanical switch.
The New York Public Service Commission yesterday considered increasing telephone rates by $195 million, and then added an extra $55 million to allow New York Telephone to write off some of its electromechanical switches more quickly.
Mr. Kessel of the Consumer Protection Board pointed out that three of the commission's administrative law judges who reviewed the same material as the commissioners had recommended that the company be awarded a rate increase of only $23 million.

HEADLINE: In Blacks' Homes, the Christmas and Kwanzaa Spirits Meet

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
TWO holidays will be celebrated at Dr. Cheryl Doyle's house in Brooklyn next week: Christmas, for her Christian roots, and Kwanzaa, a nonreligious cultural observance, to pay tribute to her African-American heritage.
Dr. Doyle, a pediatrician, said the Kwanzaa celebration was meant mostly for her and her husband, William Hilton, a psychologist. Christmas, she said is for their 5-year-old son, Glenn, who is not yet prepared to forsake traditions like Santa Claus bringing gifts to good little boys and little girls. 
 For years, black Americans have sought to reconcile what W. E. B. Du Bois called "two thoughts, two unrecognizable strivings, two warring ideals in one dark body." But a growing number of black Americans have found ways to merge the holidays, affirming their identities as Africans and Americans.
Kwanzaa began as an African-American alternative to Christmas observed primarily by black nationalists and it has gradually evolved into a holiday enjoyed in various degrees by about 13 million blacks.
Kwanzaa, Swahili for "first fruits," was initiated in 1966 by a civil-rights leader, Maulana Karenga, who is now a visiting lecturer at the University of California at Riverside. He is also the author of "The African-American Holiday of Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture" ( University of Sankore Press , 1989).
"The idea was for blacks to come together to celebrate their history and their culture and focus on values that would be beneficial in their development," said Subira Kifano, a spokeswoman for Dr. Karenga, who is traveling and unavailable for comment.
"There is no conflict in celebrating both Kwanzaa and Christmas," said Mrs. Kifano, vice chairwoman of the Us organization, which Dr. Karenga began in 1965 to provide cultural and educational services to blacks.
The holiday is a seven-day observance, Dec. 26 through Jan. 1, with feasts and the giving of simple gifts. Each day the celebrants light a red, black or green candle in a holder called the Kinara and interpret one of the Nguzo Saba, Kwanzaa's seven principles.
They include such values as collective work and responsibility (Ujima), creativity (Kuumba), faith (Imani) and unity (Umoja), as well as principles like self-determination (Kujichagulia), purpose (Nia) and cooperative economics (Ujamma), including the support of black-owned businesses.
In Celeste Morris's home in Brooklyn, Kwanzaa has shared a special place alongside Christmas for 12 years. Guests find a Christmas tree next to the Kinara and mantles and doorways adorned with red, black and green -- incorporating the colors of African nationalism and Christmas.
"We definitely had to come to terms with Kwanzaa," said Ms. Morris, the mother of a 21-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter. "It was easier when the kids were younger because they didn't really grasp the full meaning of the holidays. As they got older, they wanted Christmas. Kwanzaa was good food; Christmas was toys."
 For years, many blacks felt that the only way they could be true to the spirit and principles of Kwanzaa was by abandoning all the trappings and traditions of Christmas. Those with children often gave up on the idea of observing Kwanzaa, convinced that it could not compete with Christmas and Santa Claus.
Still other blacks wanted to embrace a more Afrocentric way of life but were bothered by the holiday's militant beginnings and connotation.
"Kwanzaa had what I referred to as a 'culture club' connotation, that if you were not carrying a spear or had a bone through your nose, you weren't down," said Cedric McClester, author of "Kwanzaa: Everything You Always Wanted to Know but Didn't Know Where to Ask" ( Gumbs & Thomas Publishers, 1990). "A lot of blacks didn't want to get involved because they thought we were asking them to give up Christmas to celebrate some pagan African holiday."
Seven years ago, Mr. McClester, the spokesman for the New York Urban Coalition, began what became an annual series of Kwanzaa activities co-sponsored by his nonprofit service organization and the American Museum of Natural History. The observance, at the museum at 81st Street and Central Park West, attracted 85,000 people last December.
This year's program, scheduled for Dec. 27 and 28, includes music, other arts and a lecture exploring the significance of Kwanzaa.
Elsewhere, several urban agencies, schools, churches and community centers in various parts of the nation are holding Kwanzaa services.
The growing acceptance of Kwanzaa by individuals and institutions has made it more palatable to blacks of all ages and backgrounds. Indeed, more blacks are celebrating Kwanzaa at home with family and friends. Among new celebrants this year are G. Douglas Pugh, chairman of the New York State Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, and his wife, Dr. Clementine Pugh, a retired college professor.
"I don't have any kind of confusion or ambivalence about it," Mr. Pugh said. "Our kids are grown and out of the way now. This will be our first Kwanzaa celebration and we're going to do it to death."
Mr. Pugh asked Paul deCroon, a jewelry designer, to make a special wreath, using Afrocentric materials, for the Pughs' Kwanzaa celebration at home in Riverdale, The Bronx.
The broad appeal of Kwanzaa is evident in other ways. Kwanzaa cards are now sold at major stationery stores. Catalogues carry the Kwanzaa symbols, from the Kinara to the Kikombe Cha Umoja, the communal unity cup, which is passed among celebrants to honor ancestors and promote the spirit of oneness. Coloring books, games, buttons and cards marking the holiday are sold at museums' gift shops -- the museum of natural history, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Studio Museum in Harlem.
Instead of reading "A Visit From St. Nicholas," a parent might choose Edward and Harriet Cox Robinson's " 'Twas the Night Before Kwanzaa." The poem, in rap style, was dedicated to the Robinsons' grandchildren. It reads, in part:
 
'Twas the night before Kwanzaa
 And all through the street
 "Happy Kwanzaa" rang out
 When folk chanced to meet
"I'm creating a character that will bridge the gap between Christmas and Kwanzaa," Mr. McClester said. Nia Umoja, his new character, is described as an ancient African storyteller whose spirit appears at harvest time. exhibiting traits similar to those of Santa Claus. He is kind and fond of children, and smiles favorably upon youngsters who adhere to the Kwanzaa principles. Such efforts are attracting more and more children to the celebration.
But with dual celebrations growing in popularity, long-time celebrants of Kwanzaa express concern that merging the holidays distorts the meaning of Kwanzaa.
"In the same way that Christmas can be overcommercialized, I believe Kwanzaa can be commercialized," said Martia Goodson, an instructor at Baruch College who has held a Kwanzaa celebration with her two children for seven seasons.
"Everybody's being black now and doing Kwanzaa," said her daughter, Jaime Goodson, a 15-year-old student at the Horace Mann School. "There will be those who will commercialize it and turn it into a fad. Once something becomes popular, everybody wants to cash in on it."
Jaime recalled a time when she and her brother, Malik, now 13, were "uncomfortable about losing Christmas." They say they are beyond that now. They have shed the ghosts of Christmas past: decorating the tree, hanging the stockings, staying up all night to see their gifts. In their dreams, they said, the spirits of Christmas future show a vision in which not only African-Americans but people of African descent throughout the world celebrate Kwanzaa.

HEADLINE: A Paycheck Gone, A Family in Crisis

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
FOUR in the afternoon to seven in the evening is the roughest part of the day for Bob, the time when he gets lowest during this week before Christmas.
Laid off more than a year ago from his job as a health-care manager in the Boston area, the 48-year-old father, who requested his last name not be used, spends his days caring for his two young girls. His wife, a hospital nurse, is now the sole breadwinner. 
 "I can't control the crying of the 2-year-old," he said. "There's a lot of unraveling, and I do a lot of yelling, and I shake her a lot, but no one has gotten hurt yet. I'm not a macho man, but I'd rather dig ditches with a spoon than watch kids."
At a time when the two-paycheck household has become a mainstay of American life, unemployment or the threat of it is placing enormous financial and emotional stress on families.
"This generation of working men and women doesn't have models to fall back on in times of economic hardship," said Bradley Googins, director of the Center on Work and Family at Boston University. "Today's middle-class families, even with two incomes, may be one or two paychecks away from dire straits if one of those jobs is lost."
Relationships between working spouses, already strained by child care, care of the elderly and other demands on time and money, are now being tested by layoffs, vanishing savings, mounting debt and pessimism about the future. More than three dozen men and women in the New York region and in New England, where the economic downturn has been under way longer, were interviewed recently on the effects of unemployment. Nearly all seemed more dazed than embittered about events that have rapidly drained success from their lives and upended finely balanced family arrangements. "Financial anxiety can produce as much stress as a death in a family," said Dr. Martin V. Cohen, a Manhattan psychotherapist. "You see all the symptoms: sexual problems, depression, substance abuse -- more alcohol this time around than cocaine."
"If you take away the money and the distractions and people have to sit at home on a Saturday night and talk to each other, it might be the end of the marriage," Dr. Cohen said.
Many who find themselves in that position discover they cannot even afford a divorce, Dr. Cohen added, "so they are pushed to make peace, even if they are sexually and emotionally separated."
For professional couples, the loss of one job can undermine a relationship built on unstated terms. Chippa Martin, a psychologist with Aradia Counseling for Women in Boston, tells of a couple in their late 40's whose marriage broke up after the husband lost his job: "The wife, who was very egocentric, became very resentful that she was moving ahead in her career while he was not and practically accused him of sabotaging her life style because he had been making more money than she had."
Unemployment tends to bring out the best or worst in relationships, said Bruce Davidson, a clinical psychologist who administers an employee-assistance program for the Digital Equipment Corporation, a computer company in the high-technology belt north of Boston that has been hit hard by layoffs.
"Those with good coping and communication skills tend to weather a job crisis," he said. "Those without them tend to become dysfunctional."
It has been documented that prolonged unemployment increases physical, sexual and child abuse within affected families.
"Isolation is an important predictor of abuse," said Faye J. Crosby, a psychology professor at Smith College who is the author of "Spouse, Parent, Worker" (Yale University Press, 1990). "He may feel psychologically battered by losing his job and feels like crawling under a rock and staying there. He wishes he was working, and perhaps his wife wishes she didn't have to. Tempers are frayed."
Unemployed women are often surprised to find they do not get the consolation extended to unemployed men. "Women may become depressed when spouses, family and friends tell them they were lucky to be out of work so they could catch up with their housework and children," said Paula Raymond, a professor at Wellesley College's Center for Research on Women. Women, she added, often internalize their depression and develop eating disorders, distorting their sense of self-esteem.
Unemployment among women has not alarmed American society as much as unemployment among men, said Barbara Gutek, a professor at the University of Arizona School of Business who has studied women in the workplace. But, she said, "it's going to be devastating for modern women if they feel they've made many sacrifices to get where they are, only to have the rug pulled out."
The coping skills used to build a successful two-career life in times of plenty are not always enough to buffer families against a financial shock.
"It took us 11 very carefully planned years to put this life style together where we made enough money, lived in the right town, and I could raise our children, and it's all crumbled in a matter of months, and we're not emotionally prepared for it," said Christine Mann, a 34-year-old manager at a computer software firm in Cambridge, Mass.
After Ms. Mann gave birth to her second child last year, she cut her work schedule in half to devote time to raising her two girls. Meanwhile, her husband, a self-employed contractor, saw his business dry up.
 Even those who can fall back on parents for financial help find the experience painful.
"My parents have been so good to me and given me such a good education that it's very distressing that I may have to borrow money from them to fill up my heating oil tank this winter or meet any unexpected big bill," said Kae Koger, 34, an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts with a doctorate in theater.
Her husband, David Pasto, 36, who also has a Ph.D. in theater, has not been able to find a teaching job since 1987, when he left a professorship in Ohio to allow his wife to accept the Massachusetts post. He said hiring freezes had forced him to take part-time jobs far beneath his training.
He said he was considering taking a job at Burger King as a cook, work usually done by teen-agers. "It's depressing to think about what to write down on the application card in the space on education level," he said.
The kitchen of Robin and Robert Sargent of Manchester, Conn., a suburb of Hartford, is a chilly 65 degrees. The Sargents are turning the thermostat down even further at night to put off the hour, any day now, when their 275-gallon heating oil tank hits empty.
Married four years, they are perplexed by how they stumbled into debt. When Mrs. Sargent quit her job as a trainer for an insurance company to give birth to twin girls in 1988, they felt comfortable that his $30,000 income as a service manager for a vending-machine company could support the family and its $1,100 monthly house payments.
But the New England economy turned down dramatically in 1989, and Mr. Sargent's company froze pay increases and overtime. To try to prop up the family budget, she went to real-estate school and was licensed as an agent, but then housing prices began to tumble and sales dried up. She tried to get back her former job, but the insurance industry was also laying off thousands of workers.
Now the family lives from paycheck to paycheck, and their bank balance has dropped as low as $5.
Her father and his parents have been asked to give their grandchildren, Lauren and Kristin, clothing and shoes for Christmas gifts instead of toys. Baby dolls "that do anything" cost at least $25, she noted, and with twins, it is twice the cost.
The couple borrowed from their families to help buy their house and are reluctant to ask for more help, Mrs. Sargent said. The Sargents feel the financial strain tearing away at their marriage.
"I go into a frenzy when I see the pile of bills," said Mr. Sargent, 28.
"It takes a lot of work when you're constantly worried about the future," Mrs. Sargent said, "to maintain the quality of the relationship that brought you together in the first place. It's a constant internal battle."

Glorious, Squalid Broadway's Lore and Lure

 BODY:
On Broadway
A Journey Uptown Over Time
By David W. Dunlap
Illustrated. 327 pages. Rizzoli International Publications. $65. 
 Broadway. Depending on your point of view, it is the best of streets, it is the worst of streets. But on one thing everyone seems to agree: Broadway is the city. And David W. Dunlap, who now reports on real estate for The New York Times, has done a wonderful thing for Broadway, no doubt about it.
In his marvelously illustrated book "On Broadway," Mr. Dunlap has catalogued every building on the street from the southern tip of Manhattan to the Harlem River, telling the salient information about each building that is standing there now, as well as cataloguing important buildings that stood there in earlier incarnations.
This chronicle, which in itself makes "On Broadway" a major contribution to New York's architectural history, is only the skeletal framework of "On Broadway." Fleshing out this framework is a narrative history of the street, with neighborhoods acting as the logical groupings for chapters. Mr. Dunlap describes the ebb and flow of neighborhoods, how economic and social forces might create a neighborhood that is upper middle class one generation, commercial the next, perhaps then becoming a backwater only to rise phoenixlike and metamorphose into something entirely different.
The illustrations in the book, which include historical prints and photographs as well as contemporary photographs by the author, contribute mightily to the understanding of Broadway. Good architectural photographers manage to capture the essence of a building, its very personality, and Mr. Dunlap is a very good architectural photographer indeed. He might purge all the dross to show the classic simplicity of a building, or show how buildings can become ravaged by thoughtless changes to their fabric and how messy the cityscape can become. "The entire disregard of unity" that was observed in 1873 is manifested in Mr. Dunlap's photographs of today's urban scene.
One of the most remarkable historical photographs links 18th-century New York with the 20th-century city. The view shows the Vanden Heuvel mansion, which stood on the west side of Broadway between 78th and 79th Streets from the early 1790's until it was torn down to clear the land for the Apthorp Apartments in 1906. Standing in the foreground of the photograph is the great harbinger of change on the Upper West Side, a kiosk leading to the IRT subway.
A vintage photograph of the Colonnade Building, which occupied the block between 57th and 58th Streets in 1923, has the building looking familiar, as if you saw it only yesterday. And you very well might have. But somehow it's wrong: something is missing, and what is missing is the rest of it. Twenty-three stories were added in 1928, making the former Colonnade Building the plinth for today's 1775 Broadway.
Perhaps the book's most telling series of pictures is the threesome showing the changing faces of the Times Tower. The photographs show the same perspective, first in 1907 when the Times Tower, that apparition of Giotto's Gothic campanile, had been standing two years; second, after the original skin had been stripped off and the tower was clad as the banal Allied Chemical Building in 1979; and then, looking even more forlorn, the same building in 1987.
Broadway, always a catholic street, has happily accommodated saints and sinners. It has been home to some of the city's "best" churches, including Trinity and Grace, and, although never the site for a cathedral, several buildings along Broadway have been nicknamed "The Cathedral" of something. The most famous is the Woolworth Building, which a cleric described as the "Cathedral of Commerce," a sobriquet that has stuck since the consecration-of-the-house dinner. You will also find Toffinetti's, the "Cathedral of All Restaurants," as well as Rector's Restaurant, the "American cathedral of froth and frivolity."
Cathedral laurels were claimed for a plan in 1923 for the Broadway Temple Methodist Church in Washington Heights. The scheme called for a 725-foot-high "cathedral-like apartment house and church topped with a cross visible for 100 miles by aeroplane." Only 2 12-story wings of the complex were built, and they appear unrelated to each other, much less to any grander scheme. But the layout puts them in perfect perspective, putting a photograph of the wings next to a rendering of the grand plan, and the ordinarily disparate parts suddenly fit together like a puzzle.
Perhaps the religious edifice most indicative of Broadway was squirreled away within the American Circle Building, which William Randolph Hearst built where the tower long known as the Gulf and Western Building stands at Columbus Circle. "Within it," relates Mr. Dunlap, "was a mysterious chamber that did not come to light until the building's demolition in 1966: a 'cameo Gothic cathedral,' with vaulted ceilings, pointed arches, delicate stonework and opulent chandeliers. There was speculation that Hearst built it as a private chapel for his mistress, the actress Marian Davies."
There are some cavils concerning editorial and art-directorial judgments. This book is a gold mine, and although there are indices to illustrations and architects et al., there is no general index, so there is no way to extract the precious information. Photographs are often far removed from their primary entries and the captions do not provide addresses, so the buildings cannot easily be tracked down. And then there are the maps that lead off each chapter, which are City Planning maps with tape over the germane swath of Broadway, so the street is completely obliterated. A street atlas would have been informative and helpful.
Beyond all this, there is an unstated moral to the book, and that is the health of the city. New York is not preserved in brick and mortar, much less in aspic; it is a healthy, changing, vibrant place. And that is a message to architects, city planners and developers: No plan is likely to remain pristine for the ages, as seen in a bewildering remembrance of something past, a marble arch that was originally the grand entrance to the Seaman-Drake estate at 215th Street but that is now home to an auto parts business. Seeing desecrations like that often leads to the desire for a benevolent despot in City Hall whose first act would be the appointment of his own Baron Haussmann to bring some order to the streetscape. Of course, if we had an ordered city we would not have a Broadway, where the raffish meets the elegant, and that would be a pity. Nor would we have more books like "On Broadway," which would be more the pity. Once you taste of the fruit, you want more.

Living Together, Divided by Money

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In Stephen Jeffreys's "Valued Friends," four young working-class Londoners renting an unfashionable basement flat suddenly find themselves surrounded by gentrification. By holding fast to their tenancy, they become increasingly wealthy, at least on paper. The play (at the Long Wharf Theater) opens up into a study of the effect of real estate on individuals, of property values on friendship. At the root is a question of colonization: people living together in pursuit of a common goal but divided by self-interest.
The play, which was first presented at the Hampstead Theater in London, is trenchant in its exploration of the group living arrangements, especially in matters of economics. Mr. Jeffreys is somewhat less revealing about the original connection of the characters. One has to accept on faith that these disparate people are such close friends (two are on-again, off-again lovers). 
 Individually the characters are scrutinized with empathy and humor. There is something to be said about each point of view, from the most altruistic to the most egocentric. The latter position is represented by a pert, would-be alternative comedian (Jill Tasker), always in need of cash and lightheaded in all matters of responsibility.
When the first offer for a buy out comes from the landlord, Ms. Tasker is quick to suggest that the quartet take the money. Her flat-mates want to proceed cautiously, knowing that a collaborative hesitation would provoke a higher offer. Finally when three of them agree to buy the flat at an insider's price, they buy Ms. Tasker's share and she flies around the world, a spree that is bound to leave her penniless and in need of lodging.
In various ways the others are each self-sustaining: Liann Pattison as an executive on the rise, Bill Camp as a scholar and John Benjamin Hickey as the play's principal character, a rock critic who gradually finds himself caught up in his new role as homesteader.
Forsaking his work as well as his romance with Ms. Pattison, Mr. Hickey immerses himself in renovation. It becomes his compulsive preoccupation, as he undertakes painting, carpentry and plumbing, and finds that he enjoys it. When Ms. Pattison decides the new kitchen should be built by an outside professional, Mr. Hickey is crestfallen. Such is the credibility of the play and the performances that one feels the weight of his disappointment.
It might be said that the play is of specialized interest. A similar charge might have been raised against Michael Frayn's "Benefactors" or Margaret Drabble's novel "The Ice Age," both related in their concern with urban redevelopment. On the other hand, it should appeal to all those who are either tenants or landlords; in other words, almost everyone trying to live in a city.
Important issues are at stake, such as survival in a sinkable economy and how to get the most for one's money. There is an amusing second-act cameo performed by Ian Trigger as a disk jockey turned construction worker, who pitches in to help Mr. Hickey. Together they do the backbreaking manual labor as well as the architectural planning, because it is Mr. Trigger's conclusion that "the whole building trade is an enormous rip-off."
Although there is not an excess of plot, there is conflict as the tenants ally themselves against Mark Vietor as the increasingly frustrated landlord and as each tries to maximize the return on his investment. The play is more than just a group case history. It becomes a highly informative slice of contemporary life and an object lesson for prospective householders.
"Valued Friends" is firmly situated in London but achieves a more widespread relevance. One could find similar stories in New York. To make its point, the play has to have a localized foundation. Robin Lefevre, who directed the London production of the play, leads an expert American cast (Mr. Trigger is one English exception) into Anglicized waters. Accents, attitudes and characteriztions are exacting.
The authenticity extends to the scenic design. Sue Plummer, the play's original designer, turns the Long Wharf stage into a run-down Victorian flat. Between scenes, the apartment is converted into a stylish lair, a before-and-after transformation that could earn a spread in House and Garden. In fact, the final setting looks as cool and contained as Ms. Pattison's character is supposed to be, as she waits alone to entertain her guests. Enter Ms. Tasker with an aerosol can of reverse intention. With it, she gives the place a natural cooking smell -- to restore life into an environment that is now as antiseptic as it is fashionable.

HEADLINE: Painful but Fair Tuition Hikes

 BODY:
New York's revised budget contains a jolt for students at the state's public universities: a proposed tuition increase of $300 a year. That's burdensome for struggling students. But it's reasonable and long overdue.
For full-time undergraduates, tuition at the State University is $1,350; at City University, it's $1,250. The price has not been raised since 1983, making public higher education in New York a real bargain. By contrast, California and Texas, which have university systems comparable to New York's, have raised their tuition for state residents 24 and 48 percent respectively in the past four years. 
 Last year SUNY and CUNY proposed a $200 annual raise to make up for a $40 million shortfall between what the Legislature allocated and what administrators insisted they needed. The proposed increase was generally accepted by State University students. But some at City University staged demonstrations at several campuses, protesting that the raise was unfair to poor students. Gov. Mario Cuomo, who had long opposed tuition hikes, vetoed the proposed increase.
This year, with the state and city under severe economic strain, Mr. Cuomo, the Legislature and the SUNY and CUNY Boards of Trustees accepted a raise as inevitable.
Hard-pressed students can thank the CUNY board for taking steps that will soften the blow. Even before the Legislature acted, CUNY authorized a $200 annual tuition increase. It did so, however, on the condition that the state ease restrictions on an $11 million program to aid part-time students.
The Legislature went along. As a result, the proposed tuition raise will be covered by state aid for the poorest part-time students, while less affluent full-time students will be covered by the state's Tuition Assistance Program or Federal Pell grants.
New York has long been committed to providing quality public higher education to as many students as possible. The modest tuition increase does not diminish that commitment.

HEADLINE: In Moscow, the Forces for Force

 BODY:
A controlled revolution may be a contradiction in terms. Ask Mikhail Gorbachev. He's caught between radicals anxious to keep reform from stalling and reactionaries who think it is rapidly turning into chaos. Unlike China's leaders, who tried to hold back the tide of change with armed force, the Soviet President now seems determined to restore order so as to impose reform.
While it's easy to sympathize with his plight, he has much to lose, at home and abroad, by cracking down with force. Washington is right to remind him of that, as Secretary of State Baker reportedly did in his meeting with Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in Houston last week. 
 Pressure from below has forced the pace of change in the Soviet Union. Without it, Mr. Gorbachev could not have moved as far as he has against hard-line resistance in the bureaucracy, the party and the regional military leadership. And without initiative from below, neither democracy nor markets can work.
Having ridden the reformist wave to power, he cannot turn on it now. Nor can he afford to alienate or undercut reformers by allying himself with the forces of order.
But pressures to restore order are mounting. Yesterday a wide array of the old guard made its resistance unmistakably public in the Kremlin by circulating an open letter urging Mr. Gorbachev to "put an end to the chaos, to prevent disintegration of the state by all means of power and authority remaining at your disposal." Even dedicated radicals like Mayor Gavriil Popov of Moscow favor a harder line, out of fear that public unrest could unseat Mr. Gorbachev and jeopardize the reforms they want.
The radicals' agenda has given Mr. Gorbachev pause, especially since late summer when reformers from the republics convened at his invitation to work out plans for a 500-day transition to markets. Their draft posed a dilemma for him -- how to decentralize control without eliminating the center. The dilemma endures:
He wants to institute the rule of law, but how can he force elected parliaments to revoke the laws they passed and submit instead to his decrees?
He wants to encourage formation of groups independent of the state, but many of the most powerful groups are ardent nationalists. Can he curb any of them without inflaming the rest?
He wants to devolve power from a rigid central bureaucracy, but some nationalists want to shatter the union altogether. Can he rein them in without reviving the dead hand of bureaucracy?
He wants to shift from a command economy to competitive markets, which means, among other things, stopping black markets and thievery. Yet in many cases today's profiteers are tomorrow's marketeers. Can he arrest them without also strangling markets?
Given his predicament, Mr. Gorbachev may take up the rhetoric of reaction -- without actually attempting to reimpose control by force. Washington is right to raise these troubling questions and quietly urge him to stay his hand.

HEADLINE: The Fed: Room to Move, and It Does

 BODY:
Critics have accused the Federal Reserve Board of rigidly pursuing an anti-inflationary policy even as the economy was sinking into recession. On Tuesday, the Reserve Board signaled a welcome change. It cut the discount rate -- the interest rate banks pay when they borrow money directly from the central bank -- by one-half percentage point, which paves the way for lower interest rates across the board. That will give a desperately needed boost to spending and help revive a sluggish economy.
November figures on output and prices convinced the Fed it was time to shift gears. Unemployment jumped from 5.2 percent to 5.9, and industrial production slumped. And the latest figures on consumer prices show that inflation had dropped to less than 4 percent annually. With inflation in check, the Fed is free to fight slumping production. Lower interest rates will stimulate corporate borrowing and spending, help revive a dormant real estate market and boost consumer spending. 
 What Tuesday's decision does not mean is that the Fed has abandoned its anti-inflation policy. To control inflation, it sets a target range for the growth rate of the money supply. For the past year, and especially during the past six months, it has kept the supply at or below the bottom of this range. That means it can now step up the money supply, thereby driving down interest rates, without overstepping its money-supply targets.
At a time when unemployment is rising and inflation is falling, there is little excuse for keeping interest rates high. The Fed's decision to stimulate spending without accelerating inflation is an unambiguous victory for the economy.

HEADLINE: Peace With Iraq Now Isn't Path to War Later

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Those who advocate attacking and destroying Saddam Hussein now argue that a negotiated settlement would allow him to attack again by 1995, armed with nuclear and chemical weapons, and the means to deliver them. This reason for initiating what could be a bloody and disastrous war is spurious.
Iraq would emerge from a negotiated settlement with a greatly weakened economy because of its mobilization, the United Nations embargo and the loss of thousands of trained foreign workers for its weapons plants. President Saddam Hussein would not be able to complete his plans to produce nuclear and chemical weapons and delivery systems if the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Japan, the Soviet Union and the smaller industrial nations blocked provision of equipment, materials and technicians. Moreover, if the Soviet Union, France and other suppliers of tanks, planes and other conventional weapons refused to resume delivery of replacement parts, as well as new weapons, his military machine would steadily decline.
If a reasonable settlement is possible, we will be able to bring our men and women home with the knowledge that we can then act to insure an erosion -- not an increase -- in Saddam Hussein's military power in future years.

HEADLINE: New Medicare Schedule Will Hurt the Elderly

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Federal Government plan to restructure the pricing of medical services under Medicare has failed to consider critical issues.
Pricing medical services at or below the cost of delivering them (as has been done in New York City and other high-overhead urban centers) will reduce access to and quality of medical care for the Medicare population. Also, complex and severe medical problems, especially in tertiary consultative services, are extremely time consuming to evaluate and to explain fully to the patient and family. The training required to provide such expertise is also lengthy and economically burdensome.
Despite Government lip service to these two issues, the resultant schedule will fix prices far below the current realistic market pricing. Physicians will have to choose between avoiding patients who are covered by Medicare or short-changing them by devoting less time to explaining procedures, evaluating problems and care. Those not in financial need will save some money, but at the cost of greatly reduced access to health care and a reduction in quality of care.
Furthermore, unrealistic reductions in reimbursement under Medicare will disrupt the means by which medical services for the uninsured or underinsured are delivered. Traditionally, this has been achieved by the voluntary, pro-bono gift of physician time. Similarly, the cost of medical education (not only at the medical school level, but also at the residency and fellowship level) has been subsidized by the nonremunerated attending physician's gift of time and effort.
These two systems have, in effect, been subsidized by patient-care dollars from economically sound recipients of medical care. The new unrealistic price schedule for Medicare will force physicians to abandon unpaid, but time-consuming, activities in these two areas and lead to disruptions. Access to and quality of care will be reduced for the seriously ill.
New funds and additional taxes to support medical education and the care of the indigent will be needed. Furthermore, all the costs of medical care, both direct (medical fee increases) and indirect (medical insurance rates), will rise. This burden will fall upon the working population and not upon those members of the 65 and older population who are able, but unwilling to pay any out-of-pocket expenses toward medical care. No consideration of these matters has been factored into the new mandated pricing scheme.
There is no reason for the economically capable not to bear their share of the cost for medical services and for the physician's time and effort that the public has come to expect as its due. An analysis of the consequences of the proposed fee schedule is overdue.

HEADLINE: The World's Farmers Reject Trade Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is far more behind the failure of the Brussels conference on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade than you recognize in "Europeans Sabotage Trade" (editorial, Dec. 8). Your headline refers to the refusal of Germany and France to end all farm price supports affecting 10 million of their farmers.
It is a fair assumption that both governments are aware that if they left the farmers of their countries at the mercy of the world price levels for farm commodities, mass bankruptcy would ensue.
In contrast to what you term "sabotage," the United States Department of Agriculture supports the rapid cutting back of all farm price supports. The rejected GATT proposal would have required our Federal and state governments to cut back supports by 75 percent and eventually to wipe them out entirely. Government-sponsored credit would also be cut by 75 percent, and without credit, most commercial farmers cannot produce.
Even without enactment of the GATT proposal, the Department of Agriculture is announcing cuts. This outlook is being met by vociferous protests from the farm belt.
The North Dakota Farmers Union induced Gov. George Sinner to declare Nov. 12-17 Farm Income and Rural Crisis Awareness Week. That week, the Farmers Union in several cities sold 1 1/2 pound loaves of bread for 5 cents, explaining this was the share wheat growers receive from a $1.50 loaf! The Governor announced that some 6,000 North Dakota farmers had been forced out of business by low prices in recent years.
It would not be surprising if some American farmers sent a letter of thanks to President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Farm opposition to the GATT proposals from northern countries has been supported by the foreign ministers of a series of developing southern countries. These are led by the Group of 15, whose members include Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, India, Mexico and Venezuela. These countries also protest that their raw products bring ruinously low prices on world markets.
Venezuela's Foreign Minister, Reinaldo Figueredo, at a gathering of these foreign ministers at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, termed the GATT proposals the "recolonialization of the third world by economic means." Carlos Andres Perez, the President of Venezuela, added that the Malaysia meeting had served as a launching pad for new approaches to the woes that have faced southern countries for years.
There appears to be emerging a common view from the world's producers of farm products, shared in Senegal, Indonesia, Dakota and Iowa: Holding farm prices far below actual costs of production is a bonanza for agribusiness and ruinous for the producers.

A Credit Expert Who Rates High At Budget Time

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Ten days ago, Mayor David N. Dinkins and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman made a pilgrimage to 25 Broadway. For 90 minutes, over coffee and cookies in a windowless 22d-floor conference room, they pleaded New York's case before Hyman C. Grossman, whose verdicts can cost the city tens of millions of dollars and more.
"When Hy Grossman speaks, we listen," said Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director. 
 "He makes a big difference -- whether we get our bridges fixed and our schools built," said Ms. Holtzman, who paid a courtesy call on Mr. Grossman last year even before she was inaugurated.
Who elected Hy Grossman? Voters in Marlboro, N.J., did a decade ago, as president of their Township Council. He holds no public office in New York but can wield considerable influence as the Standard & Poor's managing director whose committee determines New York's credit rating and consequently its ability to borrow money. That rating can profoundly affect how much interest the city pays.
The rating represents a collective assessment of trends and of an intangible "comfort level" that local officials instill. But Mr. Grossman, who is 55 years old and has been monitoring New York for Standard & Poor's since 1963, has emerged as a mythic figure in municipal finance -- much like a counter part once had at Moody's Investors Service, a rating agency that city officials describe as equally influential.
 In 1975, Standard & Poor's suspended New York City's rating because, Mr. Grossman recalled, city officials seemed incapable of grasping even the dimensions of the fiscal crisis then. Subsequent tax code changes drove commercial banks, widely regarded as heavies who forced city government onto an austerity diet, to invest elsewhere. Rating agencies remained "a franchise virtually created by law, but which is unregulated," as former City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, put it, though one that has grown more vigilant.
Because they work in New York, rating analysts may be susceptible to giving their city government the benefit of any doubts. (City officials wooed Mr. Grossman and others with a helicopter tour of economic-development projects last month). Analysts are also personally exposed, though, to social problems that may shape their prognosis.
"Sure it affects us, but not to the detriment of a collective judgment," Mr. Grossman said. "If a person might be sideswiped by something they see coming into the Port Authority bus terminal, our process doesn't allow that one person to make a ratings judgment. And my answer would be, 'Los Angeles doesn't even have a bus terminal -- does that mean it doesn't have any problems?' "
Standard & Poor's rates New York City general-obligation securities A-, in the third highest of four major investment-grade categories. Two months ago, the Dinkins administration's conflicting fiscal signals prompted Mr. Grossman's committee to impose a temporary "credit watch" for the city.
"We scratched our heads and said, 'Does the city have its act together?' " said Mr. Grossman, who likens his role to that of a theater critic.
"We don't say, 'You better raise revenue or cut expenses,' " said Vickie Tillman, Standard & Poor's executive managing director for municipal finance. "We say: 'You have a fiscal imbalance. How are you going to deal with it?' "
Last week, Mr. Dinkins convincingly argued against reducing the rating. Mr. Grossman, who grew up on the Lower East Side and is fond of informally surveying everyone from sales clerks to city officials, was comforted by the fact that the city has balanced its budgets for 10 years, that safeguards imposed since 1975 remain largely intact and that the mid-1990's hold the promise of an "economic rejuvenation."
A rating reduction would have dealt an enduring psychological and financial blow. As it was, the city sold bonds last week at a premium in a glutted and skittish market disoriented by a government in "transition," as Standard & Poor's annual review described New York after last year's election. The next review, Mr. Grossman said, might be entitled "City Meeting Challenges," if indeed it does so.
"So far, Mayor Dinkins's fiscal policy has met the test," he said. "He's said that fiscal stability is his No. 1 priority. He may just be repeating things someone told him to say, but the lesson of the 70's is clear: without financial stability you can't get anything else done."
Affixed to Mr. Grossman's office door is a small plaque quoting Eleanor Roosevelt: "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent." Conversely, Mr. Grossman says he is willing to give credit where credit is due.

HEADLINE: Murdoch's Time of Reckoning

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Michael Milken is headed for jail. Alan Bond and Robert Campeau no longer run the sprawling businesses they built through daring acquisitions. Donald Trump is living on an allowance from his bankers. Compared with these other entrepreneurs, who also gambled that the robust business climate of the 1980's would endure, Rupert Murdoch is faring well.
Nevertheless, Mr. Murdoch is facing a time of reckoning for his strategy of loading up on short-term debt to finance the astonishing growth of the News Corporation, his global media enterprise. In recent months, even as Mr. Murdoch spent endless hours negotiating to reschedule billions of dollars of debt, he has cut back dramatically on his spending -- most notably by merging Sky Television, his British satellite broadcasting venture, with its major competitor. Bankers in turn have temporarily extended loans that have come due. 
 Both sides have said they hope to agree by Christmas on what Mr. Murdoch will pay the lenders for the backing he needs to prevent the dismemberment of the television, newspaper, publishing and entertainment empire he laboriously assembled. But a number of small banks are refusing to go along, raising fears that a settlement could be weeks or months away.
"No one is being asked to forgive anything," said one banker close to the talks, which involve about 150 banks and insurance companies in the United States, Europe, Australia and the Far East. "They are being asked to extend maturities and would be compensated for it." Like others involved in the continuing negotiations, the banker declined to be named.
In addition to higher interest rates, Mr. Murdoch is likely to face covenants that will restrict his ability to acquire new properties and force him to move more conservatively in investing to upgrade existing ones, according to analysts following the negotiations.
Mr. Murdoch was unavailable for interviews during the last two weeks. But Stanley Shuman, the executive vice president at the investment firm of Allen & Company, who has been a longtime adviser and member of the News Corporation's board of directors, said that Mr. Murdoch would be more comfortable with the covenants than outsiders might assume.
"Anyone who has been as successful as he has would be frustrated by not having a completely free hand, but from a strategic point of view, he has already created a good deal of the mix he wanted, particularly in broadcast," Mr. Shuman said.
The restructuring would cover about $6.5 billion in bank debt due by June 1993, including a number of loans that have recently come due and been extended on the condition that a restructuring be completed in the next few months. Such short-term debts represent most of the $8.1 billion in total debt the News Corporation took on during a period of heavy investment in recent years to upgrade Australian and British newspapers, start up satellite television operations in Britain and develop the Fox television network.
The debts also reflected the costs of acquiring 20th Century Fox; the book publishers Harper & Row and William Collins & Sons; the magazine company that publishes TV Guide, and a string of television stations in the United States.
 
Substantial Fees Expected
 Without a debt restructuring or the sale of some of its major assets, the News Corporation would hit a financial wall by the end of its fiscal year next June 30, when $2.4 billion is due. Another $1.2 billion is due by June 30, 1992, and about $3 billion by June 30, 1993. The lenders negotiating the restructuring own all but $300 million of the debt, which is publicly held.
Senior officials at the News Corporation said that the restructuring proposal would include a $600 million bridge loan, which would be repaid along with $600 million of the current debt in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992. The company would make semi-annual payments totaling $800 million in its next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1993. The rest of the debts would presumably be rolled over into a new long-term package by 1994.
In return, the banks expect substantial fees for the restructuring, a 1 percent increase in interest rates and a commitment from the company to sell a reported $1 billion of assets over the next three years.
Mr. Murdoch has said that he plans no major acquisitions for the time being, but the covenants may not stop him if he changes his mind. Instead of using cash, the News Corporation could make a major deal through a stock swap. But Mr. Murdoch has been determined not to sacrifice his control of the company, which results from the ownership of 45 percent of the voting stock by his family.
 
Threat to Leave Australia
 He will gain more flexibility to make a stock purchase, as well as shore up the company's balance sheet, if he is successful in his current drive to create a nonvoting class of News Corporation shares. Such nonvoting shares are currently forbidden in Australia, where the News Corporation is based. Mr. Murdoch has threatened to move the company to an American or European exchange unless the rules are changed.
Bankers certainly are sympathetic to Mr. Murdoch's determination to keep control. They praise his record for spinning profits out of media companies and are eager to leave him considerable management freedom as long as he reduces his debt load.
Analysts say three major developments undermined Mr. Murdoch's growth strategy. First, cash flow was hurt when advertising revenues quickly collapsed with the sagging economies in Australia -- where the News Corporation owns 9 magazines and more than 100 newspapers -- and in Britain, where it publishes 8 magazines and 5 newspapers, including The Times and The Sun.
The company also experienced heavier-than-expected costs to support Sky Television satellite broadcasting system in its competition with British Satellite Broadcasting.
 
Citibank Organized Talks
 Last, and certainly not least, bankers, under pressure from regulators to improve their own balance sheets, began to view any company with heavy debts as suspect.
The talks, which have been organized by Citibank and Britain's Midland Bank, started with an inner circle of eight banks with the largest loans to the News Corporation, then expanded their focus to another 15 or so middle-tier lenders and have recently included the rest of the banks and institutional lenders.
Mr. Murdoch and his fellow executives have done more than issue soothing explanations. Among his cost-cutting measures was the decision to kill The Melbourne Herald, the evening paper that had been the mainstay of the family's business during the heyday of his father, Sir Keith Murdoch, by merging it into The Daily Telegraph.
But the most striking move was Sky Television's merger last month with British Satellite in a deal that will leave the News Corporation with just 20 percent of future losses but 80 percent of the first 400 million in profits once the venture breaks into the black and 50 percent of profits over the long run.
Analysts say that the satellite venture should become hugely profitable by the mid-1990's. In the meantime, the News Corporation should add more than $200 million to its cash flow this year by limiting its losses.
Investors are still nervous. Since Aug. 1, the News Corporation has sold about 12 million shares of Reuters P.L.C. to satisfy the demands for cash by investors holding bonds backed by its Reuters holdings. On Tuesday Mr. Murdoch resigned as a Reuters director.
But stockholders in the News Corporation seem to believe that the worst is over. American depository receipts representing shares in the company closed at $8.375 in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, down sharply from the year's high of more than $23 in January, but comfortably above the low of $6.625 on Nov. 1.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE KREMLIN;
West European Policy Makers Are Perplexed and Worried by Shevardnadze's Move

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The resignation of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in protest against "dictatorship" in his country threw Western European security policy into confusion today.
For the last year, Western European nations have based their policies on the assumption that support for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would also help insure the success of his plans to turn the Soviet Union into a political democracy with a free-market economy. 
 The implication of Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation seemed to be that Mr. Gorbachev could fail and be replaced by more authoritarian rulers, or that he could himself abandon a commitment to greater democracy and freedom.
Either way, Western European governments would be left without a coherent framework for their post-cold-war security policy, and their shocked and perplexed reactions today reflected their dismay at the prospect.
 
Clinging to Faint Hope
 Some were clinging with faint hope that Mr. Shevardnadze did not really mean it, or that his dramatic speech in the Soviet Parliament today was some kind of political maneuver.
But the overwhelming reaction today was one of worry. "If there is a crackdown in the Soviet Union," a NATO diplomat in Brussels said, "pressure will grow in the United States to react to it with a hardening of policy, and the Germans will want to resist. What will be weakened is the cohesion of the alliance."
The German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who forged a close friendship with Mr. Shevardnadze in the 16 meetings this year in which they hammered out agreement on German unity, said in Berlin today, "We must do whatever we can from our side in Western Europe to support the forces of reform in the Soviet Union."
The French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, also said Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation should not lead the West to suspend plans to send food aid to the Soviet Union.
 
Europeans Pledged Aid
 In Rome last weekend, European Community leaders sent out a strong signal of support for Mr. Gorbachev's policies of economic reform, a process Mr. Shevardnadze said today that he continued to support even as he resigned.
As an indication of their support, they also pledged about $1 billion in emergency food aid and technical support to the Soviet Union, much as the United States had done a few days earlier. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany warned then that "old hard-liners" could do Mr. Gorbachev in if they did not help him, German officials said.
"I hope that this cry of alarm made by Mr. Shevardnadze will be heard," Mr. Dumas said in Paris today, saluting the Soviet Foreign Minister's "very courageous" position of support condemning Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
"He never hid his concern about the rise of dictatorship in the Soviet Union if perestroika did not succeed," Mr. Dumas said. "This is the first time that he has done so publicly."
 
Perplexity in Germany
 The sense of perplexity was greatest in Germany, where the sense of debt to Mr. Shevardnadze was greatest.
"We cannot be thankful enough that we managed to achieve unity in the period of time that lies just behind us," said Rita Sussmuth, Speaker of the newly elected all-German Parliament, which held its first session in Berlin today.
Mr. Genscher, who aides said was astonished at the news of Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation, said it "should prick up the ears of the world."
Chancellor Kohl, looking grim during a break in a session of Parliament, said: "I regret this very much. We cannot really judge from here whether this is grounds for alarm."
About Mr. Gorbachev, he added: "We hope, we must hope, and I do, that he will pull through. We can only hope that the reforms are carried out. They are good for the Soviet Union, and they are good for the relationship between our people and for developments in Europe."
 
A Key to Reunification
 Without Mr. Gorbachev, German unification would not have taken place this summer. In consenting to it, the Soviet leader also agreed to pull his 380,000 troops out of the eastern part of Germany by 1994.
But the Soviet Parliament has not yet ratified the treaty by which the U.S.S.R., along with the United States, Britain and France, returned the rights of sovereignty they reserved for themselves after defeating Nazi Germany in 1945.
Mr. Kohl and Mr. Genscher expressed no concern today that Moscow might change its mind about unification or about its support for the resistance to Iraq's aggression in the Persian Gulf.
But German officials have become increasingly concerned about the possibility that as economic chaos grows worse in the Soviet Union, the Soviet forces in their country could become a source of instability. They also fear that Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia could soon be confronted by millions of economic refugees.
Gerhard Stoltenberg, the German Defense Minister, said in Berlin today that Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation was an "alarm signal" that Mr. Gorbachev might turn to the secret police and the army for support.
"Our main concern is that Gorbachev was much too slow with economic reform, which he could not get out of the cradle, and that his constitutional reform came too late," Mr. Stoltenberg said. "He could have found a resolution to the nationalities problem three years ago, but our fear is that now it may be too late."
 
Quitting Seen as Pressure
 Prof. Heinrich Vogel, an analyst at the Institute of Eastern Economic and International Studies in Cologne, said he thought that Mr. Shevardnadze had resigned in an attempt to make Mr. Gorbachev face down the conservative forces of reaction in the Soviet Union.
"If he accepts the resignation, then he makes himself a prisoner of the military-industrial complex and of the K.G.B.," he said, adding that hard-liners in the Soviet military and intelligence network viewed Mr. Shevardnadze as "the most-hated man in the Gorbachev platoon."
In Brussels, officials of both the European Community and the NATO alliance expressed concern. "I hope that the development toward full democracy, freedom and human rights will not be put at risk by the current events in the Soviet Union," said NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner.
In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said of Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation: "On political grounds, I think we all have to feel some concern at the reasons which he gave, the explanation which he offered for this step. It's too early to draw any definite conclusions. Obviously, we hope that the policies of reform which he supported and which President Gorbachev over the years has introduced, will be continued."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Has the Fed Eased Enough?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve's cut in the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent from 7 percent this week was hailed in the financial markets as a welcome policy shift toward fighting recession rather than inflation. The Fed itself did not explain its move so simply. Rather, it said the discount rate cut was due to "weakness in the economy, constraints on credit, and slow growth in the monetary aggregates." The Fed added that the cut "in part realigns the discount rate with market interest rates," implying that the Fed was following the market, not pushing rates down.
Such an explanation does not require the Fed to concede that it has really changed its policy, but that it is only making a slight midcourse correction, to keep various measures of the money supply growing within the range already set for this year. But outside the walls of the temple -- not only in the marketplace but also at the White House -- critics are saying the Fed is still too hesitant about shifting to a more stimulative policy. 
 The critics insist that despite the effect of the Persian Gulf crisis inflationary pressures have abated. In November, consumer prices increased by only three-tenths of 1 percent. And some economists believe that the real threat is that of deflation, not inflation.
Kurt Richebaecher, a German economic consultant and former chief economist of Dresdner Bank, says the downward pressure on the American economy stems from two sources: "an unsustainable, credit-inflated expansion in consumption" and "a depletion of savings and investments which undermines productivity and income growth." The second influence, he says, "makes a debt and banking crisis a virtual inevitability, as collapsing real-estate collateral values and mushrooming problemloans force the banks to tighten their lending standards."
The banks are struggling to cut costs. This week Citicorp, the nation's largest, announced an increase in layoffs to 8,000 and a sharp dividend cut. The commercial bankers are blaming the regulators for raising capital standards at the wrong time. But the broad fall in bank stock prices is a reflection of how private investors and private rating agencies, not just the Johnny-come-lately public regulators, regard the condition of the banks.
Nevertheless, although capital ratios must be raised, the Fed wants the banks to keep lending, lest a worsening credit squeeze weaken the economy further, and it has cautiously moved toward that goal.
But the Fed faces another problem in sustaining the economy: the slackening flow of foreign capital to the United States, in response to higher real interest rates abroad as well as to stronger economic growth and rising currency values, as the dollar depreciates. Some of the decline in foreign investment here results from developments abroad.
In Japan, for instance, as Kenneth S. Courtis, chief economist of the Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, observed, capital outflow is inhibited by three crucial areas of "unfinished business" at home: the slumping real estate market, the strained financial system and the evaporation of corporate liquidity.
The Japanese banks are under strain not only from falling stock prices and real estate values but also from regulators, who have forced some retrenchment in loans and investments.
Germany, too, has less capital to invest abroad. Reunification with the East will absorb an estimated $50 billion annually for the next several years. The efforts to rebuild Eastern Europe and rescue the Soviet Union from starvation and economic collapse, with all the political dangers that would breed, will further restrict capital flows to the United States.
The United States has carried the heaviest burden of sustaining world economic growth during most of the postwar period, but it will have to rely increasingly on Europe and Japan to hold the world economy together in this post-cold war era, with the Soviet economy collapsing and the United States and the other Anglo-Saxon countries, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, falling into recession.
Indeed, there is danger that the recession may become worldwide. The collapse of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in Brussels was an ominous event that needs to be repaired, to avoid a crackup in the longest period of economic growth the world economy has ever experienced.
The Fed faces difficult problems in trying to sustain the United States economy without driving interest rates and the dollar down so low as to stanch the flow of capital to this country. Yet so serious are the threats of an American and global slump that neither fear of inflation nor of a lower dollar should deter the Fed from aggressively easing money.
The most serious threat to capital investment, whether from foreign or domestic sources, would be a plunge in the American economy.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Drops Plan to Require Waste Incinerators to Recycle

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Bowing to strong objections from a White House panel, the Environmental Protection Agency reluctantly agreed on Wednesday to drop a planned requirement that incinerators recycle a quarter of their incoming garbage.
The recycling proposal had met stiff resistance earlier in the day at a meeting of the President's Council on Competitiveness, a regulatory review panel headed by Vice President Dan Quayle. Among those attending the White House meeting was the E.P.A.'s Administrator, William K. Reilly, who said afterward that the provision would be deleted from a regulation on incinerators that his agency is to adopt on Dec. 31. 
 Mr. Reilly said he decided during the meeting that the regulation was not the "appropriate vehicle for a major mandatory program with significant potential to disrupt local government plans" for incineration programs that could generate electricity and thus reduce the demand for new power plants.
The regulation, issued in draft form a year ago, will set stricter air pollution standards for trash burning at a time when an increasing number of communities see incineration as a means of dealing with a growing shortage of landfill space, especially in the East.
 
Drive for Recycling Provision
 Environmentalists had campaigned vigorously to include a recycling provision in the regulation, arguing that the requirement would reduce the amount of wastes burned and, therefore, air pollution.
"This is a major environmental retreat," David Doniger, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the new development. "The Administration is retreating on its own commitment for recycling."
The waste disposal industry had opposed the recycling provision. Allen Moore, president of the National Solid Waste Management Association, recently said in a letter to Mr. Reilly: "Waste combustion is now seen as a cost-effective and environmentally sound means of solid waste management for many communities. This could change if burdensome, and perhaps costly, recycling requirements are a condition."
 
Stiff Opposition
 Administration officials knowledgeable about the White House discussions said Mr. Reilly had argued in favor of the recycling provision but had found stiff opposition from members of the Council on Competitiveness, whose task is to determine what impact proposed Federal regulations would have on American business and local governments.
 Mr. Reilly could have appealed the matter to President Bush but declined to do so.
Among those reported to have argued against the provision were Deputy Energy Secretary Henson W. Moore; Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

Responding to pressure in Washington, Japan said today that it would increase its share of the cost of maintaining 50,000 United States troops here even though overall Japanese military outlays are being trimmed.
After long negotiations with American officials, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's Government said Japan would raise its subsidy of American troop expenses by about $600 million over the next five years, increasing Japan's contribution for American forces here from 40 percent to 50 percent. 
 American officials said the specific figures still had to be worked out in light of fluctuating exchange rates, but as of last year, Japan was paying about $3 billion out of the $7.6 billion expenses to maintain the troops on its soil.
The Japanese move was praised by American officials, although it fell short of a Congressional demand in a joint resolution this year that Japan pick up 100 percent of the cost of American troops or face the prospect of a gradual withdrawal.
 
Irritation Over Gulf
 The resolution was passed at the height of irritation in Congress over a feeling that Tokyo was stalling in putting up money to help support the military buildup against Iraq. Afterward, Japan announced its package of $4 billion in economic and military aid for the Persian Gulf.
In recent days, a new round of criticism has been heard in Washington that Japan and other nations had not fulfillled their earlier pledges on aid, and Tokyo has responded by saying it is disbursing the money as fast as it receives specific requests from the United States or from Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, which have suffered economic stress because of the gulf crisis.
It was unclear how much the Japanese step would placate Congressional unhappiness with Tokyo. But an American official said the Japanese action announced today was "a very good arrangement" that was unprecedented in basing arrangements with other allies around the world.
"This is a very important step in strengthening our security relationship and the importance that Japan attaches to it," the official said. He added that the demand for a 100 percent subsidy was impractical because that would involve Japanese payments for fuel for planes and ships, as well as salaries for Americans.
 
No 'Inappropriate' Subsidies
 "There are some things it would be inappropriate to have subsidized by another country," the official said. "The United States is a sovereign country, and it should supply its own fuel for its aircraft and ships. Its soldiers cannot be mercenaries or hired guns paid by others."
The agreement announced today by Japan calls for Tokyo to subsidize many of the costs paid in yen at American bases in Japan, including the full costs of water, heat and lighting, as well as the salaries of Japanese employes at the bases. Japan declined to pay for waste disposal and telephone services.
Japan has traditionally paid for part of the salaries of Japanese employes, as well as for improvements at installations, rents of certain property and compensation to local communities.
The Japanese step was seen as significant because it came in the context of an overall cutback in earlier projections of military spending growth. The cuts were described as a response to the diminished security threat posed by the Soviet Union and the post-cold war global environment.
 
Increasing 2.7 Percent a Year
 According to the budget outlines adopted by Mr. Kaifu's Cabinet today, Japan will increase its military outlays by about 2.7 percent a year over the next five years, about half the previous projection of an annual increase of 5.4 percent.
Japan has been increasing its military outlays since the early 1980's in response to requests by the United States that it pick up added responsibility for the security of the region, particularly patrolling and guarding sea lanes extending 1,000 miles outside the Japanese archipelago.
"This is the first time that frontline defenses will be cut back on a contract bases," said Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who discussed the changes after the Cabinet meeting. "I think we have come up with figures that convincingly take recent global changes into consideration."
Government officials said that the military budget was still increasing overall and that there would be room for some upgrading of weapons, including the acquisition of Awacs air reconaissance planes and multiple-launch rocket systems.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Predicts U.S. Downturn in '91

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The United States economy will worsen next year, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development said today, but the group's economists said that thanks to robust growth in Germany and Japan, America's troubles would not drag the world into recession.
Economists for the Paris-based organization predicted the American economy would show no growth in the second half of this year and would decline in the first half of 1991. A month ago, the organization forecast that the American economy would grow by six-tenths of 1 percent in the first half of next year. 
 David Henderson, the O.E.C.D.'s chief economist said he thought the American economy would start to grow again sometime in 1991, with overall growth for the year falling under 1 percent, which would mean two consecutive years of growth under a slim 1 percent.
The organization's economists projected that unemployment in the United States would rise to 6.4 percent next year and 6.7 percent in 1992, from 5.9 percent at present.
The jump in oil prices was said to be an important factor in the slowing of the world economy since early 1989, but the organization added that the United States and many other nations were already slowing before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
The O.E.C.D. consists of 24 wealthy industrial nations. It works to promote economic growth and cooperation. In its semiannual outlook, the O.E.C.D. forecast that the industrial world's economy would grow faster than the American economy, with the industrial nations registering 1.8 percent growth in the second half of 1990, 2.8 percent for all of 1990, and 2 percent next year.
 
No Pneumonia
 "It's popularly supposed that when the United States sneezes the rest of the world catches pneumonia," said Stephen Potter, a senior O.E.C.D economist. "We don't believe that is going on at the moment."
Nonetheless, Britain, Sweden and Finland are expected to join the United States in experiencing recessions, although for different reasons.
Mr. Potter said that continued strength in Germany's and Japan's economy "puts some kind of floor under" the world economy. According to the O.E.C.D., Japan's economy will grow at a robust 3.7 percent next year, after bounding ahead at a 6.1 percent rate this year. The O.E.C.D. said that thanks in part to German reunification, economic growth in western Germany would be 4.2 percent this year, its strongest since 1973, and 3 percent next year.
The organization also said that inflation in Germany and Japan was lower than that in the United States. American inflation was expected to reached 4.2 percent this year and 4.9 percent next year, while Japanese inflation was projected to be 1.5 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year. In Germany, inflation is expected to rise from 3.4 percent this year to 4.3 percent next year.
The report, entitled O.E.C.D. Economic Outlook No. 48, is available from the organization's Washington office.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Shevardnadze Move Bolsters Bills

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Money poured into short-term Treasury bills yesterday after the sudden resignation of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Meanwhile, the year-end cashing in continued in the Treasury bond market, where prices fell and yields rose for the second straight session.
The threat to Soviet political stability from Mr. Shevardnadze's departure rattled European financial markets early in the day, and pushed German, French and British interest rates up sharply. The news also generated a strong rally in the dollar, particularly against the German mark. Analysts said at least some of the money that fled into dollars was invested in Treasury bills. 
 "If you want safety, you buy Treasury bills," said Joseph Liro, senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "The strong performance in the bill sector was related to Shevardnadze and the message he conveyed in announcing his resignation."
By late in the day, three-month Treasury bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.53 percent, down 4 basis points, or hundreths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 5 basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.53 percent.
 
Bond Sell-Off
 Dealers continued to sell Treasury bonds yesterday, though there was no news that prompted the price drop.
"There are a lot of people who have generated a lot of paper profits over the past few weeks," one Government bond trader said. "That makes it very tempting to square positions and realize those gains before the end of the year."
In late trading, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 105 3/4, down 5/8 point, to yield 8.22 percent, compared with a yield of 8.17 percent late Wednesday.
Since Tuesday, when the bond market rallied after the Federal Reserve announced that it had lowered the discount rate, yields on the benchmark 30-year issue have risen by 15 basis points.
Yesterday's decision by the First National Bank of Chicago to lower its prime lending rate by half a percentage point, to 9 1/2 percent, had no impact in the credit markets. First Chicago is the largest bank thus far to cut its prime rate, but analysts expect many others to follow soon.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at a price of 103 3/32, down 13/32, to yield 8.03 percent. And the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/4, down 2/32, to yield 7.23 percent.
Analysts suggested the price movements of the last two days have pushed yields on shorter-term notes to very attractive levels.
"With the two-year yielding more than 7.20 percent and the Federal funds rate at 7 percent and on the way lower, once people come back from the holidays, they will like what they see," Mr. Liro said.
In other developments, participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues dipped by a modest 1/8 point in fairly light trading.
Trading was also light in the tax-exempt municipal bond market. Prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to down about 1/8 point, according to market participants.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Dec. 12. The report had no impact on prices in the fixed-income markets.

HEADLINE: First Chicago Cuts Its Prime Rate to 9 1/2%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The First National Bank of Chicago cut its prime lending rate to 9 1/2 percent yesterday, becoming the largest bank to lower the closely watched rate since the Federal Reserve began pushing other interest rates lower six weeks ago. The First Chicago Corporation, which owns the bank, is the nation's 12th-largest banking company.
Despite the Fed's lead, large banks have been slow to reduce their prime rates. The only other banking companies among the 30 largest in the country that have lowered rates are the First Fidelity Bancorporation of Lawrenceville, N.J., which cut its rate to 9 3/4 percent on Monday and the Norwest Bancorporation, Minneapolis, which adopted a 9 3/4 percent rate on Tuesday. 
 Although large corporations negotiate rates on their bank loans, the prime rate is still a closely watched barometer of interest rates because rates charged to smaller businesses and many consumer loans are pegged to it. Small businesses generally pay interest rates a few percentage points above prime. Many home equity loans and credit card loans carry interest rates that are adjusted according to changes in the prime.
The scattered reductions in the prime rate have come after the Federal Reserve had made credit so available in the banking system that the cost of overnight loans between banks had fallen to about 7 percent, from 8 percent in early November. On Tuesday, the Fed signaled to the financial markets that additional rate declines were likely, reducing the discount rate it charges on loans to banks and other financial institutions to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent.
"The Fed has been aggressive in pushing rates down, but the cost of our funds declined more slowly," said James E. Annable, senior vice president at First Chicago. He said that First Chicago lowered its rate as soon as the move was justified by a decline in the interest rates it pays for deposits and that it was not influenced by other large banks' lack of action.
"A videotape of our meeting this morning would show that we think banks have an important role in helping the economy recover and a responsibility to lower rates when it is justified," Mr. Annable said. "Nobody will benefit from a deep recession, certainly not the banks."
He noted that investors in large certificates of deposit -- $1 million and more -- had become nervous enough about large banks' financial strength to demand higher-than-normal interest rates on new certificates.
Also in recent weeks, he noted, efforts by Japanese and other banks to borrow all the money they need before the last days of the year had put upward pressure on short-term rates in the Eurodollar market.
First Chicago's share price was unchanged yesterday, at $18.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Lower Rates Slow to Spread
 Lower rates have been slow to spread to various kinds of consumer accounts offered by banks. According to The Bank Rate Monitor in North Palm Beach, Fla., the national average for bank money market accounts was 5.95 percent in the week ended Wednesday, down only sightly from 6.02 percent in the week ended Nov. 7. The national average for three-month certificates of deposit fell to 7.32 percent from 7.48 percent in the same period.
Kurt T. Peters, editor of Credit Card News, a Chicago publication, said that credit cards with interest rates pegged to the prime "are a fairly common offering, but as a percent of all credit card loans they probably account for no more than 15 percent of the business."
One of the most prominent companies offering such credit cards is the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which entered the business in March and has issued about six million cards. The rate on A.T.&T.'s cards is adjusted every three months, at 8.9 percentage points above the prime rate.
 
Benefits to the Economy
 When consumers and businesses pay lower interest rates on loans, there are many kinds of benefits to the economy. There is more money available for other kinds of spending, and there is less chance that businesses will default on loan payments.
The other side of the coin, as President Bush told bankers attending a meeting of the Association of Bank Holding Companies earlier this month, is that banking companies must earn profits if they are to remain strong enough to make the loans necessary for a healthy economy. And Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, was quoted by Reuters yesterday as having said, "These things take time -- they have to work through the system."
But bankers have felt growing pressure from their customers for lower rates.
James R. Campbell, president of the Norwest Bank Minnesota, the largest bank subsidiary of the Norwest Corporation, which cut its prime to 9 3/4 percent from 10 percent, said, "We had a lot of customers asking when rates would move down, and I just came from a lunch with some customers where I could tell the bank benefited from moving."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE KREMLIN;
Conference by Baker On News From Soviets

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference today by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief statement on the resignation of Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, and then I'll be glad to respond to your questions.
Minister Shevardnadze's resignation and warning I think has to be taken seriously. In my experience, Minister Shevardnadze has always worked as a professional who served his country's interests. He was in the forefront of the new thinking in foreign policy and democratization at home, and I think that he has earned the respect of leaders all around the world.
We are pleased that President Gorbachev has said that there will be no change in Soviet foreign policy. Since the United States-Soviet partnership serves the interest of peace internationally, and the process of reform domestically, we of course expect that to be the case, and we will be watching events closely in the weeks ahead.
As the President has often stated, our new relationship with the Soviet Union depends upon its continuing commitment to democratization and to reform. On a personal note, let me say that I've known Eduard Shevardnadze to be a man of his word, a man of courage, conviction, and principle.
I am convinced that he is committed to peaceful reform, political and economic, in the Soviet Union. And I'm also convinced that the dramatic moves toward democratization and freedom in Central and Eastern Europe, and the new thinking in Soviet foreign policy, would never have happened without his and President Gorbachev's courageous leadership.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
 
Soviet Foreign Policy
 Q. You and he appear to have quite a close personal rapport. With the disappearance of that personal relationship, do you think there will be any impact on the progress of arms control negotiations?
A. Well, we hope not, and we frankly do not think so. President Gorbachev has said there will be no change as a consequence of this resignation in Soviet foreign policy, and if there is no change, then we would expect that the agreement with respect to Start would move forward to the end that President Gorbachev and President Bush could sign it at their February summit.
Q. Could I just follow that up? Do you think the difficulties that he mentioned this morning in his resignation speech may explain some of the hiccups and false starts in the recent negotiations?
A. I just don't know, Jim. That's not something I really can speculate on.
 
U.S. Policy on Gulf
 Q. Mr. Secretary, various Sovietologists have already speculated that this is not good news for U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, particularly is someone more inclined toward the gulf view comes in to take that job over. Do you foresee any problem, any change there?
A. No, I don't, and the reason I don't is, again, that President Gorbachev has said that Soviet foreign policy will not change. President Gorbachev himself has assured President Bush on several occasions that the Soviets do not intend to diverge from the United Nations position on this issue.
 
Ties With Eastern Europe
 Q. Mr. Secretary, is there a possibility that this will open a window of opportunity to those forces within the Soviet Union that are not precisely enthusiastic about what has been happening in Eastern Europe, and the rapprochement with the West?
A. Well, we don't know, and we certainly hope not. As I said Monday in Brussels, we have seen some worrying signs for a period of time now, and, as I said in my statement, we would obviously be foolish, I think, not to take the warning in Minister Shevardnadze's resignation statement seriously.
But following up on that, we have made it very clear over the 23 months that we have been dealing with the Soviet Union and its efforts at reform that legitimacy depends on further democratization, and not on a return to authoritarian rule, and I said, as recently as two or three days ago that we certainly hope that there's nothing done to snuff out these rudimentary markets that are beginning to develop in the Soviet Union on the economic side.
 
Soviet Unraveling
 Q. Does this indicate that the ball of string is now beginning to unravel in the Soviet Union? Is this seen by the Bush Administration, when you look at the level of the turmoil now within Gorbachev's administration, that really profound difficulties now lie ahead beyond the scope that you were ----
A. I don't think that we would put it that way, John. We have said, for some time, that there are significant difficulties that they are facing, political -- in their efforts to reform politically and economically. Certainly this, I think, points up that there are differences of view and differences of opinion. It's not something that we haven't seen before in public debate coming out of the Supreme Soviet. It's not something we haven't seen before, and something we haven't spoken to before.
 
Military Resurgence
 Q. Isn't it obvious that Soviet foreign policy has changed and is changing here beyond this resignation, and that the military is sort of resurgent in Soviet foreign policy?
A. No, I think it's obvious that there has been for some time an internal debate within the Soviet Union, but this is not surprising and it is something that we have spoken to, as I said before, on a number of occasions.
I think that debate continues. We have no reason whatsoever to doubt President Gorbachev's statement that Soviet foreign policy will not change.
 
A Personal Relationship
 Q. I wondered if you'd talk about -- what difference do you feel that that personal relationship made?
A. Well, I made a -- I spoke, in my opening remarks, to the fact that he was a professional who I think was totally focused on representing his country and its interests as he saw them. I certainly think that's what's motivated me in my relationship with the Soviet Union. Having said that, however, I am proud to call this man a friend. I think that we achieved some significant things during the 23 months that we were able to work together, and it's -- on a purely personal note, I would have to tell you that I'm going to miss him.
 
A Mutual Approach
 Q. Mr. Secretary, what if anything more should the United States do to keep this policy that Minister Shevardnadze exemplified going?
A. I think we should continue to make the case to our interlocutors in the Soviet Union that our policy approach of searching for mutual advantage is a good approach. It is one that has paid off in the manner that I've just outlined to you externally, for both the Soviet Union and the United States. I think it has the potential of paying off in terms of internal reform -- democratization and economic reform within the Soviet Union. And it's a policy approach that we should both continue. And that's why we are heartened when we hear President Gorbachev say there will be no change in foreign policy.
 
A Soviet Crackdown
 Q. You spoke to the foreign minister in Houston about the possibility of a step back toward a possible repression. We are told you again stated very strongly the U.S. position on this. Did he give you any indication that there might be a move in this direction or some kind of crackdown? And what is your own assessment of the prospects for moving away from democratization in the Soviet Union?
A. Well, I just said, Owen, a minute ago that we certainly hope that that will not be the case. We really are not in a position today, I don't think, to stand up here and absolutely guarantee that it won't be the case, just as we haven't been in a position to do that over the course of the past 23 months, and just as we were not in a position to guarantee that force would not be used to hold Central and Eastern Europe.
Again, I think it's important that we understand -- that we all understand what we mean when we start using terms like "crackdown" and we must I think appreciate the desire to employ measured force to protect citizens against interethnic violence, armed militias, and things like that, versus using that force to suppress or stifle peaceful dissent or peaceful expression of opinion.
Q. Can you tell us what his assessment was when you raised it with him recently?
A. I simply said that we were concerned about reports that there would be some resort to force that might be legitimate in the first instance but would get out of hand. We were concerned that it might spill over and get out of hand. And they have -- I think it's fair to say that they are committed to reform, "they" being the president and the foreign minister, and they would not want to see that happen either. That's what he indicated.
Q. Do you agree with Mr. Shevardnadze's comment that a dictatorship is coming in the Soviet Union?
A. Well, we hope it isn't. That's what I mean, though, when I said I think that the warning that is embodied in this resignation needs to be taken seriously.

HEADLINE: 3 Big Banks Reporting Loan Woes

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
With falling real estate prices and uncollectible loans chipping away at their stability, two more leading banks said yesterday that they had been forced to write off tens of millions of dollars in bad loans in the fourth quarter. A third bank cut the dividend it pays on its stock.
Such hardship announcements are becoming ever more frequent and appear to be part of a process that is spreading, creating the worst banking crisis since the mid-1970's recession, economists say. Two large banks -- the Franklin National Bank on Long Island and the Herstadt Bank in West Germany -- failed during that crisis.
 
Obstacle to New Lending
 No major bank has failed in the current crisis, but hundreds are writing off bad real estate loans, and each write-off, in effect, becomes an obstacle to new lending -- adding to the crisis. A real estate developer, for example, who is deeply in debt cannot get a fresh loan to carry him through hard times. So he, too, defaults, and another loan has to be written off, further hurting bank profits and increasing the possibility of failures. 
 "There is a contradiction here that is weakening the economy," said Albert Wojnilower, a senior adviser at the First Boston Corporation. "Bank managers, to raise capital, to keep their jobs, to comply with Federal regulations, are engaging in behavior that is destructive to their banks and destructive for the system."
 
Most Blame on Real Estate
 The three big banks that made announcements yesterday attributed their problems mainly to real estate. So did Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, which announced on Monday that it was cutting its stock dividend, with the money saved to be used to offset loan losses.
The NCNB Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., which operates banks in the Southeast and in Texas, said yesterday that 1990 profits would shrink because the bank had set aside $55 million to $65 million for bad loans in the fourth quarter. Most of those loans are not paying interest or are uncollectible. Bad loans will reduce net income this year to about $360 million from $447 million last year, the company said.
The Bank of Boston said it would report a substantial loss in the fourth quarter, although not as big a loss as the $255 million deficit in the third quarter. The bank lost $209 million in the first nine months of the year.
"The prolonged deterioration in the commercial real estate market and the ongoing downturn in the regional economy continue to adversely affect our operating results," said Ira Stepanian, chairman and chief executive. Beginning-of-the-year salary increases for 5,000 bank officers will also be deferred, he said.
The UJB Financial Corporation, which has headquarters in Princeton, N.J. and has bank offices throughout the state and in eastern Pennsylvania, said it would cut its quarterly dividend to 15 cents from 29 cents, effective Feb. 1. Again the announcement referred to the "weak real estate market and the economic slowdown." Because of them, UJB Financial will "break even or report a modest loss for all of 1990," the company said.
 
A Need to Save Cash
 Similarly on Wednesday, the Midlantic Corporation of Edison, N.J., said it was eliminating stock dividends to conserve cash. And the C&S/ Sovran Corporation, a banking company based in Atlanta, said the fourth quarter would be profitless because more than $225 million was being set aside to cover future loan losses.
The problem spreading through the banking industry stems mostly from the real estate boom of the 1980's, particularly along the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts. By mid-1990 bank loans for commercial real estate alone -- mostly office buildings -- totaled $285 billion, or 13.7 percent of the $2.08 trillion in total outstanding bank loans. Defaults on loans to corporations for leveraged buyouts are also creating difficulties, but this lending from the banking system totaled only $80 billion as of last June.
Across the country, the prices of the best commercial real estate are down 5 to 10 percent and still falling, says David Shulman, a managing director at Salomon Brothers and an expert on commercial real estate. With prices falling and 20 percent of all office space vacant today, according to the F. W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill, building owners have found themselves unable to keep up payments or sell their buildings for large enough amounts to repay their loans.
 
Tightening Standards
 As a result there has been a rising number of loan losses -- in effect, depositors' money has been lent out and now will not be repaid. To cover these losses, the banks have drawn funds from their capital, just when Federal regulators are tightening standards. Most important, they are requiring banks to increase their capital as a percent of loans and other assets outstanding.
With capital shrinking, the banks are meeting the requirements by not making new loans and even selling off or calling in loans already on the books. As the cutback in lending spreads from real estate to other industries, many companies are having difficulty financing their operations, and they are cutting back, deepening the recession that most economists say is now under way.
"Real estate has become the key to understanding this recession," said John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Shevardnadze Resignation Cited as the Dollar Rises

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished broadly higher yesterday as traders apparently sought a safe haven in the wake of the uncertainties created by the resignation of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
Gold prices rose in Europe but retreated slightly in United States trading. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $385.90 a troy ounce, off 10 cents from Wednesday. Later, the Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $383.35 an ounce, down 55 cents. 
 The dollar gained ground in European trading and continued its climb when dealings shifted to domestic markets. In New York trading, it jumped more than 3 pfennigs against the German mark and, against the Japanese currency, it rose nearly 2 yen.
Although traders were buying dollars, much of the day's activity centered on selling the German mark on the theory that Germany is more widely exposed to the economic and political climate in the Soviet Union than other nations.
"Germany has large loans outstanding" to the Soviet Union, said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago. "And because of German monetary union, there was great expectation that they would find a huge export market within the Soviet Union."
John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York, characterized trading as "a flight out of Germany rather than a flight to quality." He predicted that "we will have to see more disintegration in the Soviet Union before there is any real permanent effect" on dollar trading.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose in New York to 1.5125 marks, up from 1.4783.
Still, Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation was dramatic enough to distract attention from the weakening United States economy and declining interest rates. Lower interest rates generally hurt the dollar because they erode the value of fixed-income securities.
The move "brings the market focus to the economic fundamentals of Europe and takes some of the focus off the economic concerns in the U.S.," Mr. Malpede said.
Trading was active but typically thin ahead of the Christmas holiday, which accentuated the dollar's advance.
In New York, the dollar rose to 135.85 Japanese yen, up from 134.05 yen on Wednesday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 134.58 yen, up from 133.27 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it rose further to 134.75 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9080, from $1.9316 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.8930 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.9310.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates included: 1.2995 Swiss francs, up from 1.2675; 5.1425 French francs, up from 5.0425; 1,139.20 Italian lire, up from 1,117.75, and 1.1593 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1588.

HEADLINE: Donations to the Neediest Giving the Homeless a Fresh Start

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
When George Horton, director of New York's Catholic Charities programs for the homeless and the hungry, interrupted a meeting among four of his homeless clients and a visitor on Tuesday night, he was politely but firmly told to return in five minutes.
For Mr. Horton, the rebuff, while annoying, was a symbolic victory. 
 "They're much more assertive and confident now," he said. "They wouldn't have done that in September."
The four people -- two men and two women -- had just completed 12 weeks in the Education Outreach Program, jointly sponsored by the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York and the Interfaith Assembly on Homelessness and Housing. The program is a mix of leadership training, finishing school and group therapy for people who are trying to battle back after losing their homes.
Supplies for the program were bought with money provided by the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The fund began its 79th annual appeal last month, and the proceeds will be distributed to the New York Catholic Charities and six other charities. The New York Times pays for the overhead of the campaign, so all donations are used to assist the sick and poor of New York.
 
Graduates' Progress
 Of the 30 people who have completed the Education Outreach Program, more than half have found work, several others are in school and at least six have moved out of shelters into their own apartments. Some have become advocates for the homeless, visiting churches and synagogues to talk about the problems that they and others in similar situations have faced.
But Sister Ann Murray, the program's coordinator, said those accomplishments were secondary to another objective, more difficult to measure precisely. "We help people develop the groundwork -- the self-esteem -- that's needed to live independently," she said. "They don't necessarily have it when they finish, but they're a lot closer."
On Tuesday evening, the four participants said that they now felt comfortable going out into the community, while before it was difficult to look people in the eye and to follow a daily routine. They were dressed like young professionals -- the women wore makeup and jewelry, the men, slacks and new button-down shirts. And they said they saw it as their mission to dispel popular conceptions that the homeless are misfits who panhandle on street corners and wear tattered clothes.
"There are a million and one reasons for being homeless, and it could happen to anyone," said Cheryl Ann DeMoss, 34. And while the four people in the room shared a common experience, each had come to be homeless for different reasons.
 
Array of Problems
 Russell L. Bland, who spent many years in and out of jail, said that for him homelessness occurred in the early 1970's, after his mother and brother died, and he stopped caring about his own life.
One word -- crack -- summed up the cause of Phillip T. Clayton's unemployment and lost apartment.
For Patricia A. Ward, homelessness -- along with battering and sexual abuse -- had plagued her since childhood.
Ms. DeMoss said that her homelessness followed a severe depression, an overdose of pills and a stay in the hospital that left her with no place to go.
Now Mr. Bland and Ms. Ward are working, Ms. DeMoss is in the job market and Mr. Clayton is about to start nursing school.
The program did not work miracles, its staff members said. Participants are carefully screened and already on the road to recovery. They have completed drug rehabilitation programs and found transitional housing arrangements that offer support services.
But Ms. DeMoss said the program had helped her and the others begin to plan their lives. In meetings every Tuesday and Wednesday, they are forced to improve communication skills by talking to each other.

HEADLINE: Making Bad Risks Good Business

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
Recently, an executive at State Farm said he could not make money selling auto insurance to speeders, hit-and-run drivers, drunken drivers and other menaces.
"We love attitudes like that," said Bruce Marlow, chief operating officer of the Progressive Corporation. "Prejudices like that allow us to succeed." 
 Progressive, the nation's 38th-largest property and casualty insurer, has earned an enviable living by committing what seems to be heresy: It specializes in covering drivers whose coverage has been rejected or canceled by other insurers.
These pariahs not only include drivers with blemished records but also people rejected as too old or too young, because they own a fast car like a Maserati or Lamborghini or because they do not speak English. In the process, Progressive has become not only one of the largest issuers of "nonstandard" auto policies in the United States but also one of the most profitable auto insurers of any type.
Indeed, most insurers no longer hope to make money on auto insurance. They look to other lines of insurance or to investment income for profit. But since 1980, Progressive has consistently made money from its offbeat auto insurance business, producing an average annual return on investment of 23.6 percent companywide.
Under the 25-year stewardship of Peter B. Lewis, Progressive's 57-year-old president and chief executive, the company has grown to $1.3 billion in revenues and 6,000 employees from $6 million in revenues and 100 employees.
"Progressive pretty much provides an example of how to run a successful insurance company," said Richard Haverland, executive vice president of the Great American Holding Corporation, a Cincinnati-based insurance group.
More than that, Progressive's success is a standing reproach to the conventional wisdom of the insurance business, which is under attack on many fronts.
Most broadly, Progressive's strong financial performance validates the view that even bad risks can be insured profitably, provided the premiums are high enough.
An unmarried man in his 30's in Chicago who drives a late-model midsized American car and who has one drunken driving conviction would pay more than $2,500 a year for complete coverage through Progressive. A comparable motorist with a clean driving record could pay about half that amount or less through another company.
Further, the fact that Progressive will issue an auto policy to just about anyone tends to rebut the view that soon no insurers will take on motorists with blemished driving records. Allstate, State Farm and other giant auto-policy writers have increasingly moved toward insuring only drivers with nearly perfect records. The only drivers Progressive rejects are recidivist drunken drivers, motorists who have lied on insurance applications and people who have staged accidents to collect claims.
 
A Model System
 Perhaps most importantly, Progressive may provide a model for how successful auto insurance companies will operate in the future. Progressive can insure high-risk drivers profitably because of its talent for measuring risks and setting premiums.
Progressive still applies the basic insurance principle of grouping drivers into large broad-brush categories, but it has many more categories than the typical insurer, and, correspondingly, many more premium levels. At the heart of its success is a data base that includes statistics on accident rates and driving histories of various kinds of drivers and repair costs of various cars -- a data base that is unusually large and detailed for a company its size.
Using this data, Progressive separates drivers into far more risk categories than do competitors and sets a wide variety of prices. That enables Progressive to be profitable on more customers than is an insurer that averages risk to come up with a smaller number of catch-all prices.
 
Motorcycle Coverage
 For instance, many insurers consider all motorcyclists to be big risks and charge them similar prices because of the serious injuries they suffer in accidents. Progressive studied the history of motorcycle accidents and found that big-engine touring motorcycles were not all that risky if they were driven by an older, married driver. So, beginning in 1980, Progressive began charging older, married motorcyclists lower premiums than younger cyclists. Today, Progressive claims to have the largest market share among companies that sell motorcycle insurance through independent agents.
Similarly, many insurers divide drivers into only two age groups -- below and above age 25. Progressive concluded that a 45-year-old driver was, on average, safer than a 35-year-old driver, who in turn was a better bet than a 25-year-old. Progressive has 11 age categories.
Traffic tickets provide another example of how Progressive segments the market. Many insurers consider all tickets to be black marks, regardless of when they were received. Progressive considers the age of a ticket, giving breaks to policyholders whose citations were issued a while ago.
"The thing that is astonishing about all this is that it is such common sense yet hardly anyone else does it," said Joyce Culbert, vice president of the Firemark Group, an insurance-research firm in Parsippany, N.J.
Insurance experts add that at a time when profit margins throughout the auto insurance business are thin and are expected to shrink further because of tighter rate regulation, Progressive's knack for accurately pricing risks may provide a model.
 
700,000 Customers
 About 15 percent of American drivers do not qualify for regular automobile insurance. Among companies that specialize in issuing such policies, Progressive is by far the biggest, with 9 percent of the market. Its 700,000 policyholders drive 1.4 million cars. While many of Progressive's policyholders are genuinely bad drivers who could not obtain insurance elsewhere, many of the policyholders have no marks on their records.
For example, many insurers prefer not to insure drivers older than 65, drivers who do not speak English, and young, first-time drivers with no insurance history. Like the motorists with bad records, these drivers come to Progressive because no other companies will insure them. They prefer Progressive over state-run assigned-risk insurance pools because its rates -- while well above standard rates -- are 5 percent to 10 percent below premiums at the state-run insurance systems..
To be sure, Progressive's record has not been unblemished. A number of years ago, the company began selling extended-warranty programs for new cars. Claims ran so high that Progressive quickly found itself having to abandon the business.
A few years later, Progressive began issuing collision and liability policies to truckers but again suffered big losses because of unexpectedly large claims and low premium levels. Progressive has since made the business profitable by raising prices and not renewing the coverage of trucking companies whose policies proved particularly costly.
If Progressive's foray into truck insurance was handled hastily, part of the blame must go to Mr. Lewis. A son of a founder of the company, Mr. Lewis is known as a unusually demanding manager who prefers to make quick decisions to enter and leave a business. He delights in saying that Progressive has "fired more Harvard Business School graduates than most other insurance companies have hired." Indeed, in the last decade, no fewer than 15 top officers of Progressive have left the company after locking horns with Mr. Lewis.
"I get off on helping people be all they can be, and I do get frustrated when people decline to risk, stretch, learn and grow," Mr. Lewis said in a recent interview at his office in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, near Cleveland.
But there is no denying that Mr. Lewis has produced enviable results. Over the last 10 years, Progressive's premium revenue has grown 23.7 percent annually on a compound basis, compared with 8.6 percent for the industry. And while profits fell last year because of to a special provision for auto-insurance rate rollbacks in California, the overall trend has been positive. From 1980 to 1988, Progressive's net income increased to $108.1 million from $22.6 million.
Over the last year, Progressive's stock has traded at of low of $32.975 a share in April and at a high of $56.375 in September. Yesterday, the stock closed unchanged at $49.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Growth Is Predicted
 With the nonstandard auto insurance market growing because of the increasing insistence of the giant auto insurers to cover only above-average drivers, Progressive's nonstandard business will grow, analysts say. It has been growing at nearly double-digit rates, and many analysts say that pace could continue.
Auto insurers that have chosen to steer clear of bad risks contend that no company can make money over the long run by insuring bad drivers. But if comments by business scholars are any guide, Progressive may continue to fare well.
"Progressive does unconventional things in ways that make perfect intellectual sense," said George G. C. Parker, who teaches a course in financial institutions at the Stanford Business School. "Their behavior is consistent with an economist's view of how markets can operate when left to work."

HEADLINE: HEALTH SPENDING IS FOUND TO SOAR

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Consumers, private insurers and state and Federal programs spent more than $604 billion on health care last year, the Government said today.
The total amounted to roughly $2,400 for everyone in the country, and, as in every other year since 1986, the rate of growth in health-care spending accelerated. 
 "The ability of society to meet other needs is affected by the growing share of economic resources claimed by health expenditures," Gail R. Wilensky, chief of the Health Care Financing Administration, said in issuing the data.
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, called the growth in health costs alarming, saying that it cut some people off from medical care and put a heavy financial burden on many of those who are able to get care.
Dr. Sullivan is leading a review that the Domestic Policy Council has undertaken on the nation's health care system; he is to present his recommendations next year. Dr. Sullivan has already rejected Government-financed national health insurance as a solution, saying he favors continuation of a public-private system.
The latest data showed that health spending last year accounted for 11.6 percent of the gross national product, the total of all goods and services produced, and that it was 11.1 percent higher than in 1988. The gross national product rose 6.7 percent over the same period.
The total spent as well as the share of the gross national product that it represented set records, the Government said.
Federal spending on health programs in 1989 amounted to 14.7 percent of the total Federal budget of about $1.1 trillion; this was up from 14.1 percent the previous year.
Of the total spent on health care last year, 33 percent was paid by private insurance, 21 percent by consumers, 17 percent by Medicare and 10 percent by Federal and state Medicaid programs. Other government programs were said to contribute 15 percent and other private sources, 4 percent.
The Federal agency also said that 39 cents of every dollar went to hospitals, 19 cents to doctors and 8 cents to nursing homes. It said that 22 cents was spent on dental and other professional services, home health care and drugs and vision products, and that the remaining 12 cents paid for administration, research and construction.
Nearly $50 billion was reported spent on nursing home care. Of that, 44 percent was paid directly by patients. Most of it, 41 percent of the total, came out of Social Security income. Medicaid and Medicare paid 51 percent of the bill, and private insurance paid 1 percent.

HEADLINE: New York Area Being Hit Hard By Loss of Jobs

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

DATELINE: NEW YORK, NY

 BODY:
Enduring its bleakest year in more than a decade, the New York metropolitan region lost an estimated 100,000 jobs in private industry in 1990, according to a Federal report released yesterday.
New York City accounted for half the jobs lost. But the weakness that began on Wall Street three years ago with the stock market's plunge has spread to northeastern New Jersey, which the report showed has lost 22,000 jobs this year; the northern New York suburbs, which lost 10,000 jobs, and Long Island, which lost 14,000 jobs, its biggest drop in nearly 40 years of Government record-keeping. 
 In a gloomy briefing that seemed reminiscent of the 1970's, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, used more than 40 charts and tables to illustrate how a part of the country that was booming only a few years ago had stalled, reversed course and was now suffering a steepening decline.
 
The Latest Is the Worst
 "The most recent months have been the worst," Mr. Ehrenhalt said at the briefing at the bureau's Manhattan office on the report's projected figures for the year.
Asked what that meant for the coming year, he said, "I don't think it's run its course."
A few hours after Mr. Ehrenhalt's briefing, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman told the City Council that New York City lost 45,000 jobs -- about 1.5 percent of its total employment -- in the 12 months beginning in October 1989. She also projected a loss of 90,000 public and private sector jobs for 1991.
"That represents an acceleration of job losses that we expect to continue through the beginning of 1991, and then maybe moderate a bit," said Stephen Kagann, her chief economist.
Sylvia Ashrafiuon, director of New York services for the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting service in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said Mr. Ehrenhalt's figures might prove "pretty conservative," especially for New York City, "when the year is finished and all the bodies are counted."
 
Final Projection
 The final projection of a loss of 100,000 jobs brought the region's private-sector employment to 6.8 million, a level it last reached in 1987.
The loss was the first significant one suffered by New York City since 1982, when it lost 12,000 jobs. The decline brought the city's private-sector employment to about 3 million.
From 1970 to 1978, a time when the city's economy collapsed and its municipal government narrowly escaped bankruptcy, the city lost an average of 77,000 jobs a year.
In his report, Mr. Ehrenhalt found that some sectors of the economy that were among the strongest during the region's boom were now deteriorating the most rapidly.
 
A Loss for Construction
 Construction, for example, which added an average of 16,200 jobs a year from 1979 to 1987, lost 36,000 jobs this year, he said. The commercial and retail sales sector, which had been gaining 32,500 jobs a year, has lost 41,000 jobs. And the finance, insurance and real-estate industries, which added 27,800 jobs annually through most of the 1980's, had a loss of 23,600 jobs, many with high salaries.
Services are still growing, though more slowly. And more of the new jobs are relatively low-paying positions in health and social services; the gain in more lucrative fields like law and accounting has dropped from an annual average of 43,600 jobs during the boom to 19,500 this year.
The long decline in manufacturing accelerated sharply this year, Mr. Ehrenhalt reported. The region, which lost just over 30,000 factory jobs annually from 1979 to 1989, has lost 49,000 such jobs this year, he said.
Ms. Ashrafiuon attributed the decline in Nassau and Suffolk Counties to the weakness of defense-related and high-tech manufacturing.
 
Municipal Cutbacks
 Government employment grew by 16,700, but that trend seems certain to slacken or even be reversed in 1991 as New York City contemplates reducing its work force by thousands of positions through attrition and layoffs to close a widening budget gap.
Mr. Ehrenhalt estimated that the city would lose about 15,000 more jobs than the city itself projected when it modified its budget just last month. In a telephone interview after the briefing yesterday, a spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, Leland T. Jones, said, "As we move through time, the data change and our projections change."
The unemployment rate in the region, which comprises 23 counties in New York and northeastern New Jersey, is still lower than the national average, 5.3 percent against 5.4 percent.
Eight counties in the region averaged jobless rates below 4 percent during the year: Hunterdon, Somerset, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Nassau, Morris and Bergen. Seven areas averaged rates higher than 7 percent: Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Hudson, Passaic and Essex Counties.
 
'Significant Silver Lining'
 Mr. Ehrenhalt called the unemployment rate a "small but significant silver lining." But he said it was largely the result of slow work-force growth due partly to discouraged job hunters and partly to lower birth rates beginning in the 1960's, which have reduced the number of young workers.
Employment, rather than unemployment, is considered the most important measure of the health of a local economy. Mr. Ehrenhalt based his analysis on seasonally adjusted data from joint Federal and state surveys from January through October. He used that data to estimate job loses for November and December, then adjusted upward the final figures -- including a loss of 92,000 jobs in the region -- to account for a pending revision of the numbers.
"It kind of accelerated during the course of the year," he said of the employment losses. "There was a clear deterioration."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Visions of a Tax Cut From Republican Right

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
A con servative organiz er-around-town says he knows how to beat George Bush in the 1992 New Hampshire primary: "We'll run his 1988 New Hampshire ads against him."
Those were the ads in which Mr. Bush stopped Senator Bob Dole dead in his political tracks by accusing him of flip-flopping on taxes. 
 Now it is Mr. Bush who has a tax problem. "No new taxes" was not a sound bite to right-wing Republicans. It was a governing philosophy, and one that Mr. Bush, in their view, shed like so much bunting and ribbon after he moved into the White House.
The President has tried to soothe the the rage on the right with the explanation that the tax increase he agreed to this fall was a one-time ransom to get Democrats to agree to a budget deal vital to the economy. Now, says the White House, when the President says no more new taxes, he means it.
The conservatives, to put it politely, are skeptical -- a mood heightened by Mr. Bush's comment this week that a cut in the capital gains tax seems politically out of reach. Some are talking about challenging Mr. Bush in the primaries. A group in New Hampshire thinks Gordon J. Humphrey, who is retiring from the Senate this year, might run in his home state primary to make the point. And the columnist Patrick J. Buchanan is thinking about a campaign, too.
The organizer-around-town, with those visions of New Hampshire ads dancing in his head, has another horse. He is Pete S. du Pont, the former Governor of Delaware, who was one of Mr. Bush's opponents for the Republican nomination in 1988.
It happens that Mr. du Pont is organizing a new political committee with a simple avowed goal: to fight tax increases and press for tax cuts. "Mr. Darman, Mr. Brady and the President have taken the Republican economic philosophy and thrown it over the side and adopted the Democratic philosophy," he said. "I hope we can persuade them to come back to the girl they brought to the dance."
Mr. du Pont believes this would be good politics and good economics. With the fall of communism, he said, a commitment to low taxes is the single most important issue differentiating Republicans from Democrats, and the way out of recession is to cut taxes and spur growth.
This may strike some historical- minded people as the simple wisdom that led to the current massive deficits. But Mr. du Pont, his blue-blood pedigree notwithstanding, has a blue-collar suggestion: cut Social Security taxes. This aligns him with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, and that is not the first time Mr. du Pont has shared the dias with an iconoclastic Democrat. (He and Bruce Babbitt were strange bedfellows more than once in 1988.)
Mr. du Pont insists his new group is not a Presidential exploratory committee. His proof is that he has recruited a fairly wide range of Republicans with differing Presidential loyalities, including another 1988 candidate, the Rev. Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster. Mr. du Pont says his purpose is not to challenge Mr. Bush but to help him.
"I kind of hope that if we can give him a little of this kind of help he would make a speech that said: 'You know, we made a terrible mistake. We put through a bill that raised spending, that raised taxes, that hasn't helped with the deficit. Here's an economic growth package that will do a much better job,' and put that before Congress. That would unite the Republican Party again."
 But what if Mr. Bush never gives that speech? Some Republicans loyal to Mr. Bush suggest that Mr. Du Pont is trying to carve out a political base on the right to turn to in 1996.
Everywhere Mr. du Pont has gone in recent weeks he has left conservatives with the impression that he might run if the President has not patched up his relations with the right. The conservative-around-town thinks Mr. du Pont could, at the least, win a few states in 1992.
Mr. du Pont says that talk of a challenge, by anyone, rests on the notion that Mr. Bush will ignore the cries from within his own party.
"I fervently hope it's all going to come back together again," he said. "You don't challenge sitting Presidents very often, and never successfully. Hardly ever successfully."

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Et Tu, Eduard

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation recalls us to our sense of proportion in world affairs. It makes us realize that while we have been preoccupied with the Persian Gulf, life and politics in the Soviet Union have been deteriorating to what is now a point of menace.
Mr. Shevardnadze was Mikhail Gorbachev's closest ally in the opening up of Soviet society. According to Mr. Gorbachev, the whole idea of glasnost and perestroika -- opening and restructuring -- arose from a conversation between the two men as they walked on a Black Sea beach. 
 The resignation was a thunderclap not only because of who he was but because of how he went. Mr. Shevardnadze gave as his reason that the Soviet Union was moving in the direction of "dictatorship."
It was as if James Baker had told a Congressional committee that he was resigning as his friend George Bush's Secretary of State because the American political system was headed for disaster.
Why did Mr. Shevardnadze resign? An immediate cause was that he was tired of being hounded by conservative critics. In recent months he has been savagely attacked for allowing the reunification of Germany on Western terms and "begging" for American food aid.
That criticism reflected a division in Russian thought going back a century and more, between those who favor Westernization and Slavophiles who want the country to look inward to a mystic Slavic tradition. Mr. Shevardnadze is a Westernizer through and through.
The anti-Western tradition is joined now by Communist Party bureaucrats opposed to the loss of their privileges. And lately a third powerful element has joined the resistance to change: those who call for a forceful restoration of order in the Soviet Union as the answer to economic and political strains.
The day before Mr. Shevardnadze's announcement, a coalition of military, religious and literary figures called for direct rule by the Kremlin in turbulent areas of the country. The 53 signers of an open letter included the Chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev.
The letter called on President Gorbachev to "put an end to the chaos" and suggested "instituting a state of emergency and presidential rule in zones of major conflicts."
Mr. Gorbachev said he was ready to do that where there was "a serious threat to the state."
Against the background of such talk, Mr. Shevardnadze's warning of dictatorship looks extremely serious. Is it possible that Mikhail Gorbachev, the man who so courageously moved the Soviet Union out of its paralyzing fear, is now prepared to go backward? It is certainly true that he is relying increasingly on the military and the K.G.B. in internal affairs.
A leading Soviet expert here, Prof. Marshall Goldman of Wellesley College and Harvard, said the Soviet President had been asking for more and more legal powers.
"With what he has he finds he can do nothing," Professor Goldman said. "So maybe he thinks, 'If I get just this one more, I can make it work.' It's really backwards. When he gets another power and can do nothing, he loses more credibility. But he's driven -- he can't think of anything else to do.
"This was a golden era. But maybe it's over."
For us in the West to write off Mikhail Gorbachev would be both unfair and foolish. He has done more than anyone would have thought possible to introduce democracy. If he is faltering now, it may not be for lack of desire to continue on the reform path but simply because the difficulties are so great.
But whatever we wish, the fact is that Mr. Gorbachev has lost credibility with his people -- the legitimacy that enables leaders to govern democratically. And that has worrying consequences.
How is the new world order that President Bush wants to build through the United Nations going to work with a Soviet leadership under internal nationalist pressure? Can Mr. Bush continue to count on Soviet support in the Persian Gulf crisis? Will the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty go forward without Mr. Shevardnadze?
The other day Mr. Gorbachev was surrounded by reporters in the lobby of the Congress of People's Deputies. He said:
"Unfortunately our society is not ready for the procedures of a law-based state. We don't have that level of political culture, those traditions. All that will come in the future, but the important thing in the meantime is not to smash each other's bones."

HEADLINE: How Do We Know Port Authority Isn't Being Mismanaged?;
Look at Oakland

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your rationale for the Port Authority's proposed $1 increase for four bridges and two tunnels in "For Whom the Tolls Toll" (Topics of The Times, Dec. 4) eludes me. From relatives in the San Francisco Bay area we have heard about the destruction and rebuilding of the Oakland Bay Bridge Tunnel. The toll before last year's earthquake was $1; it remains at $1. What is California doing that New Jersey and New York can't do?
Most of us commuters would love to work close to home rather than brave the George Washington Bridge every day. It is up to the Port Authority, with the legislatures of New Jersey and New York to come up with a more equitable and appropriate solution -- especially since the costs to operate the PATH are included. The task is politically and economically difficult, but bridge and tunnel commuters cannot be asked to shoulder everyone's burden.

HEADLINE: Texan Convicted of S.& L. Fraud

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Don R. Dixon, who had been one of the most audacious savings and loan operators in Texas, was convicted by a Federal jury today on 23 counts of fraud involving his mishandling of $41 million in loans for his personal benefit and other violations.
The verdict raised the prospect of a long prison term, as well as fines that could total more than $500,000, for Mr. Dixon for his conduct as the owner of the Vernon Savings and Loan Association in Dallas from 1982 to 1987. 
 Once a sleepy institution specializing in home loans, Vernon was transformed by Mr. Dixon into a high-risk lender on land and speculative properties. Mr. Dixon was ousted by Federal regulators in 1987 and Vernon was seized by the Government a few months later, with 96 percent of its loans nonperforming.

 The institution's giant losses are expected to cost taxpayers an estimated $1.3 billion.
Mr. Dixon is the 71st person convicted of fraud under investigations completed by the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force, an agency created by the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Government savings regulators to pursue financial fraud in Texas. The task force has brought indictments against 93 people since it was organized in 1987.
Most of the other convictions, however, have been of owners, executives or borrowers of institutions whose losses have paled against those of Vernon.
"This is obviously the first major owner of an S.& L. here in Texas that has been convicted," said Robert Hauberg, the lead United States attorney, who argued the case against Mr. Dixon.
Mr. Dixon attended a bail hearing after his conviction and was taken from there in handcuffs to the Dallas County Jail, where he is being held until his sentencing. Judge A. Joe Fish of the Federal Distict Court in North Texas said he would sentence Mr. Dixon at a hearing on Feb. 19.
In completing 10 days of deliberation following a 6-week trial, the jury found that Mr. Dixon diverted $577,000 in Vernon loans made to a borrower to cover rental payments on a lavish beach house north of San Diego, in Solana Beach, Calif. The borrower obtained the money by falsifying statements, the jury said.
Mr. Dixon, who is 51 years old, also was convicted of using Vernon's money to pay women who accompanied senior Vernon officers and directors to a party in California in 1985. The jury said he also used Vernon's aircraft and money to promote interstate prostitution in taking the female companions from Dallas to California.
The jury concluded, however, that Mr. Dixon was not guilty on 15 counts of improper attempts to influence political candidates and to defraud the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. Mr. Dixon was also found not guilty of making payments to women who accompanied him and a former Texas savings commissioner on a trip to San Francisco in 1985 and to Kansas in 1986.
 
Ties to Politicians
 The Federal indictment, issued last June, had accused Mr. Dixon of contributing more than $3,000 to 13 political candidates and political committees. The candidates were unaware that the payments might have been illegal, the Government has said. The candidates included Jim Wright, the former House Speaker; Tony Coelho, the former House majority leader, and Senators Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, and Alan D. Cranston, the California Democrat.
Mr. Dixon was part of a group of savings executives in North Texas who enlisted House Speaker Wright's support in 1986 to oppose an effort by Federal regulators to seize insolvent Texas savings institutions and oust the owners and directors.
Analysts and economists have said the cost of the savings-industry bailout was increased by billions of dollars because Mr. Wright and members of Congress were successful in blocking regulators from closing dozens of troubled institutions.
 
Undecided on an Appeal
 Mr. Dixon told reporters after the verdict was announced today that he had not decided if he would appeal. He faces a maximum prison term of 120 years and fines of $560,000.
In addition to the criminal action against Mr. Dixon, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has been seeking $530 million from him and other former Vernon officers under a civil lawsuit it filed against the group in March 1987. But it is unlikely that much of the money will be recovered. Mr. Dixon, for one, filed for personal bankruptcy in 1987.
In a statement, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the guilty verdicts against Mr. Dixon vindicated the Government's strategy in several Vernon cases. That strategy involved seeking convictions among lower-ranking officials as Government investigators and lawyers sought to build strong cases against senior officials and Mr. Dixon.
"His excessive life style and illegal management practices stood as a symbol of the wrongdoing in our national thrift industry," Mr. Thornburgh said.
Seven former high-ranking Vernon officers have been convicted in the last two years. Vernon's former chairman and chief executive, Woody F. Lemons, is serving the first year of a 30-year prison term that he received from a Federal judge in April. Former Vernon employees and executives testified against Mr. Dixon during his trial.

HEADLINE: In Haiti, a Political Cockfight

BYLINE: By Amy Wilentz; Amy Wilentz is author of "The Rainy Season: Haiti Since Duvalier."

 BODY:
As anyone knows who has ever seen one, a Caribbean cockfight is an iffy thing. The beautiful birds claw and peck at each other's eyeballs, and the overheated crowd throws money at the caller and shouts encouragement. In the middle of the fight, the bird you thought was winning can suddenly sink like a stone, and all that you've invested in him -- the hope and excitement, as well as the money -- sinks with him. Haitian politics is like that, too.
In last weekend's elections, the ballot symbol for Haiti's new president, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was a fighting cock -- in Haitian creole, kok kalite. And even before the polls closed Sunday night, the supporters of Father Aristide were crowing in the streets of Port-au-Prince, the capital, celebrating his unofficial victory. They were rejoicing in a virtually violence-free election (the first in recent memory) and, more important, the triumph of a man who will stand up for the average Haitian. 
 But the fight is just starting, and if he is not himself to sink like a stone, Father Aristide will need a lot of help. In Haiti, as in most other third world countries with traditions of corruption and exploitation, the arrival of a freely elected government is just as likely to signal the start of chaos and unrest as it is a final victory for democracy.
Between now and his inauguration on Feb. 7 (the anniversary of the 1986 downfall of the dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier), Father Aristide will face two major hurdles. First, he will have to insure that the army and the Tontons Macoute, the violent, paramilitary supporters of the Duvalier family, do not conspire to steal his presidency. These forces were held at bay during the election by U.S. pressure, which must be sustained.
Recently, for example, Roger Lafontant, a former leader of the Tontons Macoute, vowed before the foreign press that he would never allow Father Aristide to become president. Mr. Lafontant was not talking about his political clout; outside his headquarters after the election, scores of his supporters brandished automatic weapons.
Although a warrant for Mr. Lafontant's arrest was issued this summer, the military has neglected to act upon it. If the Duvalierists continue to behave as outlaws, Father Aristide -- who has escaped at least three assassination attempts since 1986 -- cannot consider himself safe.
Second, Father Aristide will have to forge a consensus government that can surmount enormous obstacles to change. Since his coalition, the National Front for Democracy and Change, did not field enough legislative candidates to gain a majority in the parliament, he will be forced to choose a prime minister from the opposition. A rivalry between the president and prime minister could lead to stalemate, instability and, eventually, a military takeover.
One of the first orders of business for Father Aristide -- and one that will set his administration off from its corrupt predecessors -- will be dealing with the public clamor for punishment of abusive officials of past regimes. Since 1986, less than a handful of criminals from the Duvalier era have been tried, although thousands of Haitians have lost relatives and friends to the Tontons Macoute.
As a priest, Father Aristide constantly called for such prosecutions. To initiate them, however, he must have the cooperation of the army -- the same men who have refused so far to arrest Mr. Lafontant.
Faced with Father Aristide's enormous popular mandate -- and following its own uncharacteristically good behavior in the elections -- the army may well stand by and allow the new president to take over the government. Whether the generals will tolerate the investigations and trials merited by the crimes of the old regime -- which would implicate many in the army -- is an open question.
To accomplish all of this, Father Aristide will need U.S. economic aid and political support. Yet, in the past, his liberation theology and occasional anti-Yankee rhetoric did not endear him to Washington.
Lately, however, he seems to have realized who will be buttering his presidential bread in days to come. He has said he wants a relationship with the U.S. that is based on "dignity," a decent enough goal and one designed not to raise hackles on either side.
For his part, Ambassador Alvin Adams, a Bush appointee, maintained an exemplary neutral stance on Father Aristide's candidacy. He has promised to work with the man the Haitian people elected -- no matter their past ideological differences.
"Ti pay pa ti pay," runs a famous Haitian proverb encouraging caution and determination, "zwazo fe nich-li." Straw by straw, the bird makes his nest. During his campaign, the formerly impetuous Father Aristide seemed to adhere to that wise maxim. Now, given the time and support, he may change things in Haiti -- little by little, for real.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Silver Prices Fall Sharply; Gold and Platinum Also Off

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver futures prices fell sharply yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York in a wave of profit taking that erased most of this week's earlier gains. Gold and platinum futures also retreated.
Silver futures ended 17.4 cents to 19 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in December down 17.4 cents at $4.025 an ounce. 
 On the Commodity Exchange, gold for December delivery settled at $382.50 an ounce, down $3.40. Platinum was $11.50 to $11.70 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with January at $407.20 an ounce.
Traders who bought metals contracts earlier in the week took profits in a market made thin and volatile by the absence of many people who were getting an early start on Christmas, said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
Spot silver prices had soared nearly 24 cents in the two previous trading sessions after the Federal Reserve Board moved to lower interest rates on Wednesday. Silver has many industrial applications, and its price surged amid hopes that lower rates would stimulate the economy.
But "it moved up too fast, it was overbought," Ms. Raptopoulos said. When a few traders started selling into yesterday's thin market, others followed suit and prices plunged, she said.
The New York commodities markets will not reopen until Wednesday. In Chicago, the Board of Trade and the Mercantile Exchange will hold abbreviated trading sessions Monday.
Soybean futures plunged on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting frustration over the slack pace of export sales and fears that a political shake-up is brewing in the Soviet Union that could bring a halt to American sales of soybean meal to the Soviets.
Wheat futures settled 1/4 cent to 1 1/2 cents higher, with March at $2.615 a bushel; corn was 1/2 cent lower to 1/4 cent higher, with March at $2.34 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 3/4 cent lower, with March at $1.1125 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 8 1/2 cents lower, with January at $5.6275 a bushel.
Orange juice futures for January delivery fell sharply amid profit taking on the New York Cotton Exchange. The drop came after several days of strong gains tied to what weather forecasters had said was a slim chance of freezing weather in Florida during the Christmas weekend.
Orange juice contracts for other months, which are limited to daily moves of 5 cents a pound, rose moderately to catch up with January. There is no price limit now on the January contract, and it had jumped a total of 16 cents in the three previous sessions.
Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.6 cents lower to 1.85 cents higher yesterday, with January at $1.164 a pound.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports Rise, to $604 Billion, In Health Care Spending in 1989

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Consumers, private insurers and state and Federal programs spent a record total of more than $604 billion on health care last year, the Government reported Thursday.
The total amounted to roughly $2,400 for each person in the country, and, as in every other year since 1986, the rate of growth in health-care spending accelerated. 
 "The ability of society to meet other needs is affected by the growing share of economic resources claimed by health expenditures," Gail R. Wilensky, chief of the Health Care Financing Administration, said in issuing the data.
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, called the growth in health costs alarming, saying that it cut some people off from medical care and put a heavy financial burden on many of those who were able to get care.
Dr. Sullivan is leading a review that the Domestic Policy Council has undertaken on the nation's health care system. He is to present his recommendations next year, but he has already rejected Government-financed national health insurance as a solution, saying he favors continuation of a public-private system.
The latest data showed that health spending last year equaled 11.6 percent of the gross national product, the total of all goods and services produced, and that it was 11.1 percent higher than in 1988. The gross national product rose 6.7 percent over the same period.
Federal spending on health programs amounted to 14.7 percent of the total Federal budget of about $1.1 trillion; this was up from 14.1 percent the previous year.
Of the total spent on health care last year, 33 percent was paid by private insurance, 21 percent by consumers, 17 percent by Medicare and 10 percent by Medicaid. Other government programs contributed 15 percent, and other private sources 4 percent.
The data also show that 39 cents of every health-care dollar went to hospitals, 19 cents to doctors and 8 cents to nursing homes. Twenty-two was spent on dental and other professional services, home health care and drugs and vision products, and the remaining 12 cents paid for administration, research and construction.

HEADLINE: New England Bank Offered Swap for Debt

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Bondholders of the Bank of New England Corporation proposed a debt-for-equity swap yesterday that could provide the troubled bank with needed cash. The bank also settled accusations of fraudulent accounting practices with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The proposed swap, which is subject to approval by the bank's directors, would give bondholders 92 percent of the company's common stock in exchange for $705 million in debentures. The deal is intended to reduce the bank's interest payments and provide financial flexibilty. It is currently considered to be insolvent. 
 "This is clearly a positive sign that gives the bank more life," said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day in Portland, Me. "But it is not the key issue that will permit the bank to survive. Management is performing a heroic effort in attempting to turn the bank around. But the deck is stacked against it with the New England environment."
 
 Like Cod Liver Oil
 Mr. Cassidy added that the bondholders' arrangement was "not a slam-dunk done deal." He said that approval was also needed from all bondholders and existing common shareholders. "It's in the best interest of everyone to approve it, but it's like cod liver oil," he added. "It doesn't taste good when it goes down, but the bank is sick and it needs it."
Under the plan, existing shareholders would find their stake severely diluted as 92 percent of the bank's ownership would be almost evenly divided between holders of the $181 million senior debt and $525 million in subordinated debt. Bondholders would also receive an additional $100 million in newly issued debt that would not pay interest, but would be redeemable in five years.
James Dorsey, a spokesman for the bank, declined to comment on the bondholders' proposal. "We will review it carefully and discuss it with the board of directors," he said.
In the S.E.C. settlement, the bank neither admitted nor denied that it had falsified its 1989 third-quarter earnings. But it agreed to restate those earnings and to allow independent accountants to continue a review of its internal accounting procedures, as well as its quarterly financial statements for two years.
"We're pleased to have been able to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the S.E.C. to put this matter behind us," Mr. Dorsey said. "This settlement has no effect on our current operations and will not interfere in any way with our ongoing affairs."
 
 Plight of Former Officers
 The S.E.C. settlement, however, could have a significant impact on the bank's former officers, many of whom are being sued by disgruntled shareholders. With the agreement to restate the earnings, "the former officers of the company are going to have a tough time proving their innocence," Mr. Cassidy said. "The S.E.C. is essentially saying that the management did not tell the truth," he added.
The swap would not only eliminate $60 million a year in interest payments, but it would also raise the bank's capital from a 1.1 percent of total assets to the mandated 3 percent.
Still, this does not secure the bank's future, even if approved. Mr. Cassidy noted that over 6 to 12 months, the bank would have to reduce its $2.8 billion nonperforming loan portfolio, as well as begin to grow out of its problems with new loans. Yet this effort could be thwarted by the depressed New England economy, particularly the real estate sector. Most of the bank's troubled loans are commercial real estate loans.
Any strategy to improve the bank's fortunes is "directly correlated to the health of the New England economy, which has been in a downslide since spring of 1989 and is continuing that downslide," Mr. Cassidy said.

HEADLINE: Minutes From Fed Meeting Show Backdrop of Rate Cuts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve set the stage for its recent interest rate reductions at a mid-November meeting of its monetary policy committee, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
The central bank has permitted four reductions of its Federal funds rate since October and on Wednesday it dropped the discount rate from 7 percent to 6 1/2 percent, the first decline in four years. 
 The decline in the Federal funds rate on Oct. 29, to 7 3/4 percent, from 8 percent, was in response to the Federal budget-cutting agreement between the Bush Administration and Congress.
But the Federal Open Market Committee noted weakening economic activity at its Nov. 13 meeting and agreed to another "slight reduction."
The move, the minutes said, was intended to "provide some insurance against a deep and prolonged recession without incurring a substantial risk in current circumstances of fostering intensified inflationary pressures."
And, the minutes said, the committee agreed to give weight "to potential developments that might require some slight further easing" until the next meeting. That meeting was held Tuesday and was followed by the cut in the discount rate. The Federal funds rate is also closer now to 7 percent.
Between the meetings, the Federal funds rate fell to 7 1/2 percent on Nov. 16 and to 7 1/4 percent on Dec. 7. The rate is the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans. The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans to banks and other financial institutions.
The minutes show that the committee members were concerned about "the growing signs of a softening economy, the related vulnerability of many business and financial firms to added financial strains and the increased reluctance of institutional lenders to accommodate less-than-prime business borrowers."

HEADLINE: In Hard Times, More Gifts For the Neediest Cases Fund

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
As strange as it might sound, the worsening economy may actually be spurring donations to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Businesses, law firms and medical practices that have contributed to the fund in years past have continued to give to the Neediest Cases, often increasing their donations. And they have been joined by many others who never donated before but were moved to give this year by the growing poverty that surrounds them. 
 The 79th annual appeal for the Neediest Cases began last month, and already $2,197,153.23 has been collected. The proceeds are given to seven charities to be used to aid the sick and the poor. The New York Times pays all the overhead costs of the campaign.
More than 4,500 people and organizations have sent money to this year's drive, and many write that they consider it an annual tradition.
 
In Honor of Friends
 For the third straight year, the law firm of Breed, Abbott & Morgan sent $15,000. Another donor, the financial public relations agency Kekst and Company, gave $2,500 in honor of friends and clients -- their fifth consecutive annual donation.
One business, which wished to remain anonymous and has contributed to the Neediest Cases for years, increased its gift by several thousand dollars to $25,000. Asked about their largesse, an executive responded yesterday, "You only have to walk about the streets of New York to see why."
Along with these companies that have given in previous years are new donors.
Noel Hecht and Steve Wettan, who share an oral surgery practice in Brooklyn and Queens, have abandoned the ritual of sending baskets of fruit or bottles of liquor to the dentists that refer patients to them.
 
No More Presents for Clients
 "They're more fortunate than most, and they can afford their own gifts," Dr. Hecht said in a recent telephone interview. Instead, the two men notified their colleagues that they were giving money to charities, including $100 to the Neediest Cases.
Like the two oral surgeons, the Weave Corporation in Hackensack, N.J., a manufacturer of upholstery, apparel and drapery fabrics, also decided to stop sending umbrellas, coffee mugs and desk sets to their clients this year. Instead, for the first time, they donated $5,000 to the Neediest Cases.
While the gifts were an effective way to keep the company's name in front of its customers, the executives felt "increasingly uneasy" about spending money on such items, wrote Roger L. Berkley, the company's president. "It became increasingly clear," he wrote, "that at this point in the history of both our company and our society, it was more important to put our name on a check that will help people who can't fend for themselves."
Mitelman & Associates Ltd., an advertising agency in Tarrytown, N.Y. was another first-time donor to the Neediest this year.
Bonnie Mitelman, the company's vice president, wrote that they were concerned about the "$400 million budget gap that the area will be facing" and that in lieu of gifts to their clients, the company was sending $200 to the Neediest Cases.
Ms. Mitelman wrote: "We would use that money to do what we could to make the metropolitan area a better place for all of us. We're giving the money to your fund to give to people who can really use it."

HEADLINE: Energy Policy Options Are Submitted to Bush

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Senior Bush Administration officials gave the President a list of options today from which to fashion a comprehensive national energy strategy.
The 60-plus options, which involve everything from car mileage standards to hydroelectric dams, are the product of nearly 18 months of interagency work coordinated by the Energy Department and supervised by the President's Economic Policy Council. They options also represent perhaps the most ambitious energy study ever conducted by the Government. 
 But critics say the decision to offer the President a menu of options rather than overall strategy recommendations constitutes a significant retreat from the goal Mr. Bush seemed to have in July 1989, when he ordered the study.
 
Framework for Legislation
 Mr. Bush declared then that the United States could not and would not wait for another energy crisis to find a solution to the nation's growing dependence on foreign oil. The study was supposed to provide a framework for energy legislation that the President would submit to Congress in early 1991.
While that is still the idea, energy experts on Capitol Hill fear that unless clear objectives and coordinated solutions quickly appear, it will be difficult to build Congressional support.
The decision to take a more piecemeal approach apparently came at the insistence of the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, an engineer and a candidate for Energy Secretary 10 years ago, who did not like the path the early thinking was taking and decided the White House would put together its own strategy.
 
 Little Urgency Seen
 But by all accounts, including drafts of the study that have circulated throughout the energy and environmental community, President Bush heard little that is new in the ideas for promoting energy supplies and reducing demand. And he does not seem to have injected the project with much urgency, even though nearly 400,000 American troops are deployed in the Persian Gulf, which holds about two-thirds of the world's oil reserves.
Some of the most bitter feuding within the Administration has occurred over efforts by the Office of Management and Budget to pre-empt decisions in matters like subsidies for rural electrification and rates charged by Federal power agencies, by putting economic considerations ahead of energy concerns. Mr. Sununu and Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, are also said to be at odds with senior officials in the Energy Department, including Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.
In an interview this week, the Deputy Energy Secretary, W. Henson Moore, acknowledged the friction, calling it a useful part of the process. "It's healthy that you have a debate like that," he said.
 
 Options Aren't Ranked
 In fact, Mr. Moore added, the 60-odd options were not ranked for the President but were grouped according to the degree of endorsement.
One group of options consists of those approved in all quarters; it is believed to include a recommendation that regulatory impediments be removed to the use of more natural gas. A second group consists of options supported by some Bush operatives and opposed by others; this is thought to include the idea of opening up various offshore and wilderness areas to oil and gas drilling.
A final set of options will be presented as those recommended by none of the officials taking part, Mr. Moore said. Among these, no doubt, is a 50-cent-a-gallon tax on motor fuels mentioned in at least one draft.
 
 Environmentalists Disturbed
 In recent weeks, critics and skeptics have assailed the priorities that seem to be emerging from the process, with environmentalists and those who favor greater reliance on alternative fuels voicing the strongest concern.
Public Citizen, an advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader, this week called the options "a politically expedient response to the Persian Gulf crisis that lacks any long-term vision and will result in continued energy waste and environmental destruction." The group said it deplored any options that would seek to revive nuclear power and further entrench fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal.
Whatever Mr. Bush decides to order from the options is not expected to become known for several weeks. A decision may emerge either piecemeal or full blown in budget proposals and the State of the Union Message in late January.
At the moment, however, many fear that while the Administration has briefed Congress on the list, it has done little else to smooth the way for passage of an energy bill.

HEADLINE: Crisis in the Kremlin;
Reading Tea Leaves of Soviet Fate: U.S. Experts Look Ahead

BYLINE: By James H. Billington; Librarian of Congress; expert on Russian history.

 BODY:
Gorbachev classically tries to balance the right and the left in exercising domestic control within the U.S.S.R. But there are times when one must choose a path for the future. His indecision and his drift for most of this year into alliance with reactionary forces are very disquieting and may move him on the path toward becoming a Russian Jaruzelski. Jaruzelski thought of himself as a patriot restoring order and avoiding bloodshed. But objectively speaking, what he did was to repress the grass-roots reformist element represented in the Solidarity movement and to set democratization back a decade.
One would have expected that Gorbachev, as a pragmatic politician who unleashed glasnost and the reform impulse, would have found opportunities to work more boldly with reform-minded officials who received popular electoral mandates in the past year -- or at least to adopt the economic measures his own economists have been recommending. The reform movements in the dominant Russian republic have been generally nonviolent and have shown tremendous vitality this year and opened up a real possibility for relegitimizing civil authority from the bottom up. 
 However, there is a very real risk that unless Gorbachev changes now at the 11th hour, he would set back a reform movement that he made possible. That's a paradox. It's a further paradox that the man who refused to use weapons against peaceful change in Eastern Europe may abet the process whereby weapons come to be used against his own people.
There has been a strong tendency, from a variety of powerful officials, the police and the military, in favor of a crackdown and restoration of social discipline within the Soviet Union. Equally important is the proven reluctance of Gorbachev to embrace a whole series of possibilities for collaboration with the elements seeking to provide long-term stability by overhauling and relegitimizing political authority.

HEADLINE: Loan Company Is Sued Over Check in the Mail

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Dec. 21

 BODY:
New York State officials today sued Beneficial New York, a financing company, accusing it of misleading consumers into accepting loans.
The suit stems from checks of up to $1,500 Beneficial mailed to people across the state. An accompanying letter urged them to cash the checks immediately. 
 While the company noted that cashing the check amounted to agreeing to repay the loan, Attorney General Robert Abrams said that Beneficial misled consumers by calling the monthly repayments "low."
Mr. Abrams said the interest rate on the loans were 25 percent, which is the maximum permitted by New York law and about double most conventional bank loans. The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court, says that Beneficial's letter promoting the loan informs the potential borrower of the size of each monthly payment but it does not disclose the number of payments and the total amount to be repaid.
Officials at Beneficial, based in Peapack, N.J., denied any wrongdoing. "We're sure we're within New York guidelines," said a Beneficial spokesman, Robert Wade.
The lawsuit asks the court to suspend repayment of those loans and force Beneficial to drop its marketing campaign. The suit also asks that the company be forced to notify everybody who received the checks to destroy them.

HEADLINE: Democrats to Hold Off on Surtax on High Incomes

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
House Democratic leaders no longer plan to propose a surtax on incomes above $1 million a year as the first order of business when Congress convenes next month, although the proposal may resurface later, aides to the leadership said today.
Instead, the Democrats are focusing on piecing together a larger package aimed at promoting "economic growth and tax fairness," as an aide to a top Democratic Congressman put it. They hope to have the legislation ready by the time President Bush presents his State of the Union address on Jan. 29, the aide said. 
 "Don't focus too much on whether it's H.R. 1 or not," said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
That is the designation given the first bill introduced in the House at the beginning of a session of Congress. The 102d Congress convenes Jan. 3, when lawmakers are likely to introduce their first bills.
The aide said Democratic leaders had still not decided what would be in the economic growth package, but he would not rule out a surtax on incomes above $1 million.
Until now, Democratic leaders had spoken of making the session's first bill a tax increase on the rich. The issue was a big political winner for Democrats during this year's budget battle with the White House. They used the proposal and Republican opposition to it to characterize the Republicans as the party of the wealthy. The proposal was ultimately defeated.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told Mr. Bush this week that he would not immediately pursue the surtax, an aide to Mr. Rostenkowski said today.
That move came after Mr. Bush told Mr. Rostenkowski on Tuesday that the President would not include in the budget for the 1992 fiscal year his plan to cut capital gains tax rates. The budget will go to Congress on Feb. 4.
Democrats argue that a reduction in the capital gains tax would mainly help the rich and would reduce Government revenue.

HEADLINE: Crisis in the Kremlin;
Soviet Economic Output Off Sharply

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Output of the Soviet economy fell 4 percent this year and is likely to drop 5 percent more in 1991, increasing unemployment and adding new urgency to the task of revamping the country's economy, four leading Western economic institutions said today.
Their long-awaited report, the closest and most comprehensive look yet by any Western agencies at the Soviet economy, was made public today. In line with predictions of its contents, the report calls for a speedier transformation to market operations than presently contemplated by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
 "The imperative is to make sufficient progress at the beginning so that reform is seen as an irreversible break with the past and the process gains unstoppable momentum," the study concluded.
It was conducted by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, both based in Washington; the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, based in London, a new institution seeking to encourage reconstruction of both the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
 
Declines in Output Severe
 Commissioned last July by the leaders of seven industrial countries meeting in Houston, the report used words like "breakdown," "collapse" and "unraveling" to describe current conditions. It said that few goods are found in state stores, barter is becoming more common, and black markets and the use of dollars instead of rubles to pay for goods are spreading rapidly.
Declines in output of the magnitudes seen in the study are unprecedented for any major nations in the postwar period but are akin to the experience of many countries during the Great Depression of the 1930's.
In postwar recessions in the United States and Western Europe, it has been unusual for output to fall by 1 to 2 percent. In the deepest postwar American recession, 1981-82, output dropped 2.5 percent.
Output of the economy, as measured in the report, is the sum total of production of goods; the figure does not include services.
 
Employment Declining
 For the first time in postwar history, the report found overall employment declining. Although unemployment is not yet an officially accepted Soviet concept, the report placed current joblessness at 1.5 percent of the work force, which by next year could increase to 4 percent, or 6 million workers.
The report, which was prepared by teams of about 80 economists from the four organizations with the cooperation of the Soviet authorities, cautioned that the West should hold back financial aid, other than credits for food, until a comprehensive reform program is in place.
"Without such a reform, additional financial resources would be of little or no lasting value," it stressed.
Bush Administration officials said the conclusions are "fully consistent" with their thinking. The European Community came to similar findings in a study published today in Brussels.
The Washington report is expected to serve as the basis for talks between Moscow and the I.M.F., which was the major contributor to the study.
 
A Boost for Reformers
 It also could strengthen the hand of economic policy reformers in Moscow, who are struggling with forces basically distrustful of the market and who want to push the economy back to old ways of central planning.
The Soviet Government has already indicated that it wants to join the I.M.F. Membership could open up important new financial support, which would cushion some of the more painful adjustments to market operations, like restrictions on consumer subsidies for food and housing. But to get the money, Moscow would have to follow the I.M.F.'s policy advice.
The fund's endorsement is the seal of approval required by the World Bank and other international lenders. Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and scores of other developing countries have tapped extensive lines of credit over the years once that approval was won.
Acknowledging that the Soviet Union does not now qualify for fund membership, President Bush last week proposed a special associate status under which Moscow would get technical advice to help anchor its reforms and prepare the ground for full membership.
 
New Data on Economy
 The report provides extensive new data on the Soviet economy. Overall indebtedness was placed at $54 billion at the end of 1989, which as a percentage of exports of goods and services is less than the percentage in Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland.
Because many banks have been increasingly unwilling to grant loans to the Soviet Union, indebtedness at the end of this year was projected at $52 billion, while the country's hard currency reserves were placed at $5 billion, which is equivalent to less than two months of hard currency imports.
The Soviet Government helps balance its accounts by selling gold in Zurich and London. Gold sales were projected to reach $4 billion this year and about $3.5 billion next year.
Although the Soviet authorities generally cooperated in providing data, they refused to disclose total gold reserves, a long-held Soviet secret.
 
Gold Seen as Strategic Resource
 Soviet specialists explained that gold mines have long been considered a strategic resource in the Soviet Union and are operated by the Defense Ministry. If the Soviets eventually join the I.M.F., they would have to provide such gold reserve data.
Although the Soviet budget for 1990 shows miltary spending equivalent to 7 percent of domestic output, the report notes that if spending on internal security and all budgeted research and development are added to military expenditures, the figure would rise to 9 percent.
But since prices of many military goods are kept low under the command economy, the report suggested that the total military burden might be twice as high, approaching 20 percent. In the United States military spending is about 5 percent of the gross national product.
The report suggested possible remedies for the distribution bottlenecks that are behind food and other shortages.

HEADLINE: When Will Slump End? Pick a Year, Pick an Economist

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Relying on sophisticated computer models, an understanding of the vagaries of New York and experience in charting its ups and downs, economists believe they know when the city should hit bottom and start to turn around: 1991. Or 1992. Or 1993. Or maybe 1994? Or even 1995.
Forecasting has proven perilous in New York, which 10 years ago was beginning one of its most prosperous decades just when everyone was expecting its demise. But businesses and government, which must at least to try to anticipate economic trends, have no choice but to rely on such predictions. And whatever their accuracy, forecasts can reveal much about the forces atwork in, and on, the city. 
 In any case, in a year in which New York City has lost an estimated 50,000 jobs -- and its region, 100,000 -- talk of a turnaround, no matter how far off, is reassuring.
Among the gloomier forecasts is one from Rae D. Rosen, senior economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, who said she believed it could be three to five years before growth resumes. In the meantime, she expects more pain.
 
'I Don't See Any Relief'
 "We look for another, possibly 30,000-job, loss in 1991," she said. "Every single sector with the exception of services is likely to show a decline."
The construction industry, she said, is stillfinishing projects begun in better times and will lay off workers when they are done. Telecommunications will be flat at best. Several major retailers are floundering and shoppers are hardly feeling flush. The finance sector appears close to an end of layoffs, but banks are overstaffed. Manufacturing will continue to lose jobs. And local government, which added 10,000 positions so far this year, will shed at least 7,000.
And in 1992, Ms. Rosen said, "The best we can hope for is some sort of stagnation."
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission and a professor at Columbia Business School, said he, too, believed a recovery would not begin until 1993 or later. But, he added, "there are some people who think we are in a Detroit situation. Idon't believe that at all. The decline will be a little sharper and longer than a lot of people think, but of greater certainty is that there will be a strong recovery, beginning in the mid-1990's."
By then, the city will most likely have benefited from a stronger national economy as well as a wringing out of its own notoriously high costs, especially for rent and labor. Stores that once could not afford leases in the city will be able to open. Companies that have reduced payrolls may begin to expand.
Elinor B. Bachrach, the Deputy State Comptroller for New York City, agreed with this reasoning, but predicted an earlier re bound, in the second quarter of 1992. In 1991, though, she expects a loss of 40,000 more jobs. "We really think next year is going to be quite bleak," she said.
After the stock market's fall three years ago, Matthew P. Drennan, an economics professor at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, was a pessimist, predicting that 60,000 jobs would be lost by the end of 1988. It took longer to reach that figure than he thought.
 
Hard to Duplicate
 Now, he has turned into an optimist, at least compared to some colleagues. He believes the city will hit bottom in late 1991 or early 1992, and that the demand for its abundance of lawyers, accountants, engineers, advertising and media executives will be a major factor in its rebound.
"If New York unraveled," he said, "it would have to be invented somewhere else, which would be very expensive."
Sylvia Ashrafiuon, director of New York services for the WEFA Group, a forecasting service in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., looks for the decline to continue into the first half of 1991, to be followed by stabilization and, finally, a change of direction at the end of 1991 or the beginning of 1992.
"What is going to get us out of this is the consumer," she said. "Income growth picks up again, because of the national economy. The oil price shock is over. There will be some kind of recovery in construction. And the end of employment losses. Hopefully, some of that consumer confidence will come back."
 
Waiting for a Reason
 Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was even more optimistic. She said she believed a recovery could come "anytime after the middle of next year."
"But," she added, "there has to be a reason for it."
Ms. Scanlon said the region had been basically holding its own until the national economy weakened at mid-year, credit tightened and Iraq invaded Kuwait, which pushed up energy prices and further worried already anxious consumers. Should calm prevail in the Mideast, energy prices would recede and interest rates could fall, stimulating both the national and local economies. Increased trade with Europe could provide New York with another boost.
One economist who avoids forecasting is Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. He said New York City is too complicated, pieces of data are missing and that right now important sectors are being restructured, with uncertain results.
"There are a lot of variables," he said, "and that makes things difficult."
To make his point, at a briefing earlier in the year, Mr. Ehrenhalt handed out a copy of a newspaper article with the headline, "Economic 'Seer' Predicts Loss of 97,000 Jobs in City."
The article was from 1980, written as the city's economic boom was already unfolding.

HEADLINE: Arts Endowment Takes and Then Gives Away

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
A final determination of how the National Endowment for the Arts will cut $12 million from its direct grants to artists and arts organizations and add the same amount to its contributions to state arts councils was approved yesterday by John E. Frohnmayer, chairman of the endowment, a spokesman for the agency said.
The decision immediately drew expressions of praise and concern from arts administrators around the country. 
 Randolph McAusland, deputy chairman for programs of the arts endowment, said the agency's $125.8 million budget for programs would be reduced by an average of about 10 percent in each of 16 areas, ranging from $1.9 million subtracted from music programs to $465,000 from design programs.
"We will likely trim the dollar amount of grants in order to avoid cutting the number of grantees," Mr. McAusland said, "and we want to retain the flexibility to recognize new artists and organizations. Several whole grant subcategories are being suspended, and we will be forced to eliminate some grantees in each discipline."
 
'New Purchase Plan'
 Among the subcategories to be suspended are the "new purchase plan," which assists museums in acquiring works of art, and the "special artistic initiative plan," which helps museums in a variety of ways.
Direct support to states will increase to $37.7 million from $26.1 million.
"Coming at a time when the economic climate is causing a pulling back of state, corporate and individual contributions," said Richard Oldenburg, director of the Museum of Modern Art, "we're very worried about cuts at the Federal level."
Bennett Tarleton, executive director of the Tennessee Arts Commission, took a contrasting view. "The general impact will be to spread and deepen and widen support for the arts," he said.
The arts endowment's shift in support from direct grants to increased contributions to states was required under the Federal legislation that extended the life of the agency this fall. A provision in the law requires an increase of about $12 million in the amount of money the endowment contributes to the states in the present fiscal year.
By 1993, assuming that the arts endowment's overall budget remains constant, states would receive nearly $45 million out of the $125.8 million program budget.
 
Complicated Formula
 The states are awarded block grants according to a complicated formula. California, the largest recipient, gets about $650,000, and a small state like Delaware gets about $340,000. In fiscal 1991 each state will receive at least an additional $90,000.
There is no pattern in the way state arts councils plan to use the new money. New York expects to spend it to avoid laying off employees in folk arts programs and to replace state cuts in the agency's travel budget; Tennessee says it will use the extra money to increase the size of grants for general operating expenses to medium and large cultural institutions; Nebraska plans to use it for local government challenge grants, artists' fellowships and touring programs; Mississippi expects to use it for training programs to help local arts groups be better able to compete for Federal and corporate grants; and Idaho plans to direct the money chiefly to the 45 local arts councils throughout the state, which will use it for presenting local and national arts groups.
Representative E. Thomas Coleman, the Missouri Republican who was one of the chief sponsors of the provision to increase Federal support of state arts councils, said he was pleased to hear that there has been a variety of reactions from the states.
"That diversity was the driving reason behind the legislation," he said. "We thought the different states would know how to use these funds in ways best suited to their individual needs."
 
Smaller Companies May Benefit

 <>
Spokesmen for many state arts councils expressed enthusiasm for their increased appropriations. "This change will support local arts groups in a way that the National Endowment for the Arts never could," said Margot Knight, executive director of the Idaho Commission on the Arts. "The N.E.A. never had the travel money to come out here and see what we were doing. Consequently, their money goes to well-established organizations rather than to an excellent local group like the Idaho Theater for Youth, a children's theater. Smaller companies like that stand to benefit."
Mr. Tarleton, executive director of the Tennessee Arts Commission, said: "We make several hundred grants every year, whereas in a good year the National Endowment for the Arts makes only a dozen grants in Tennessee. Most of the groups we support -- like the Carpetbag Theater, a minority-owned and -operated theater in Knoxville -- have never received a Federal grant. Now, through us, they will have a chance to get some Federal dollars."
"The economic impact will be mixed," said Holly Sidford, executive director of the New England Foundation for the Arts. "In a state like Connecticut, which gets about $2.5 million and is about to be cut approximately 10 percent, the loss of $250,000 won't be compensated for by a grant of $90,000. On the other hand, a northern state that's getting only $500,000 and is cut 10 percent gets a big boost from that $90,000 increase."
Jonathan Katz, executive director of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, said that a very important provision of the new legislation is one that requires setting aside 5 percent of the Federal agency's program budget to give to states for the purpose of assisting rural, inner-city and other communities that are "underserved artistically."
"The state arts councils," Mr. Katz said, "are uniquely able to nurture these kinds of groups, and to help them foster excellence."
 
Not 'a Real Boon'
 One concern about the shift of endowment support voiced at a recent meeting of the National Council on the Arts, the Presidentially appointed body that advises the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, is that state legislatures around the country will cut contributions to their state arts councils with the expectation that these councils are about to benefit from a windfall from the Federal Government.
"I doubt that state legislators will look at a $90,000 increase as a real boon," Mr. Tarleton said. "If it were $900,000, that might be something, but nobody here is going to say we got rich all of a sudden because we got an extra $90,000. That's only enough for maybe three of our medium-sized grants."
Ms. Knight of Idaho agreed. "If the states cut their arts budgets," she said, "they will do so in response to internal pressures, not because they think their arts councils can get a free ride on the Federal Government."
Mary Hays, executive director of the New York State Council on the Arts, said: "There are economic and political forces -- such as that the state is facing a $4 billion problem -- that make the arts endowment's action almost irrelevant."
 
'Maintenance of Effort'
 Representative Colemen took the matter more seriously. "The original legislation included what we called a 'maintenance of effort' provision to prohibit states from decreasing their funding," he said, "but that was not included in the compromise measure that passed. However, if we see states reneging, we will certainly consider bringing up the 'maintenance of effort' provision again."
Mr. Tarleton said: "To some extent, we're taking money from Peter to pay Paul. I wish there were enough money so we could help both the states and the arts endowment's program budget. Maybe we'll see that happen in a better economic climate."
The cuts in program budgets to be made by the National Endowment for the Arts are as follows:
 
Dance -- 10.5 percent ($1,005,000)
 Design -- 11.2 percent ($465,000)
 Inner-city, rural and tribal arts -- 9 percent ($585,000)
 Folk arts -- 15.2 percent ($500,000)
 Interdisciplinary arts -- 13 percent ($580,000)
 Literature -- 11.3 percent ($565,000)
 Media arts -- 12.8 percent ($1,730,000)
 Museums -- 13.7 percent ($1,764,000)
 Music -- 12 percent ($1,938,000)

HEADLINE: Coping/With an Ailing Old Car

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
That old car made it through the fall, but with winter here, it clearly needs an expensive overhaul. Is it worth it?
Facing major repairs, motorists commonly weigh the cost against the car's market value -- what it would fetch if it was sold or traded for a car of similar age. Plausible as that may seem, various specialists call this approach a big mistake. 
 At a time of economic and household retrenchment, minimizing transportation costs -- equal to food as a percentage of the typical American budget -- has particular appeal.
A Maryland man's 1982 Toyota Celica GT needed a new engine, a job that he reliably determined would cost about $2,500. He knew that after investing this sum he would have a car worth little more than $2,500. But newspaper ads offered '82 Celicas at $2,200 to $3,000. He quite naturally hesitated. "That's more than the thing is worth," he said, expressing the concern of those who face heavy repair bills for cars of a certain age.
In fact, the Toyota unrepaired appeared worth nothing. That calculation was so dismaying that it inspired further investigation.
The Marylander decided not only to invest the $2,500 in his eight-year-old Toyota, but within six months he spent another $350 on a new clutch for his 1981 Mercury station wagon. Even before it broke down, he had believed the Mercury worth no more than $500. He came to realize that the main question he had been considering was the wrong one.
 "It has nothing to do with the market value of the car," said James F. Smith, a professor of finance at the University of North Carolina. "The relevant questions are how much you like it and whether the money you spend to fix it up will significantly extend its life."
Of course some people insist on driving only the latest models and will pay heavily for them. New cars can lose about 25 percent of their value as they are driven from the showroom and will lose 40 percent by the time they are three years old.
Many consumers fail to get the most for their money because they underestimate the advantages of repair. If a car, particularly the body, is in decent shape, "the majority of the time you're going to be better off fixing" it, said C. Michael Johnson, president of the Wealth Planning Corporation, Cincinnati financial planners. Too often, he said, people panic: "A car needs $300 worth of work and they trade it in."
Louis Stanasolovich, a financial adviser in Pittsburgh, said that while fixing a car frequently might be a bother, "most of the time you'll find an older used car will probably be cheapest in terms of cost per mile to drive."
Mechanics are fond of advising the dubious to consider a bill for repairing an older car an investment in thrifty transportation, not an expenditure. In most cases, the the expenditure is a month's installment on a new-car loan.
There are advantages to repairing an old car beyond immediate dollars and cents. Probably the most important one is that the consumer knows what he has. The Maryland man knows, for example, not just that his Toyota has a new engine. but also -- in contrast to what he might face if he replaced it with a used car -- that he has not abused his transmission or bought third-quality tires, and the battery may last another two years.
Such information provides some of the peace of mind sought by many who buy only new cars.
There are some things the zealous motorist must do. One is to maintain the car so that it does not leave the owner stranded in bad weather or in a high-crime area or at the mercy of unknown mechanics.
Another is to make sure the garage is not enticing you with a low estimate that will be wildly exceeded. Many dealers subscribe to a Eastern Seaboard service offered by the Hayes-Ligon Corporation, based in the Washington area: It allows dealers, by referring to customized manuals for cars up to 10 years old, to quote a price virtually to the penny.
An ardent repair fan, not surprisingly, is Donald A. Randall, a Washington lawyer who represents the Automotive Service Association, the industry's biggest trade group.
"As the economy tightens," he said, "we see a lot of people debating this issue," of whether to repair or trade a car in. He said there had been an increase in the number of motorists who chose to fix their old cars.
Mr. Randall has become quite attached to his own "nice and heavy" 1985 Ford LTD. He is about to spend $4,600 for a premium repair, or "restoration." He figures that he will drive his dream machine, which has already traveled 87,000 miles, for at least another four years.

Seeing Green in Draft

 BODY:
If Dan McGwire is chosen as the No. 1 player in the National Football League draft next spring, the price tag on the 6-foot-8-inch quarterback will exceed $15 million, his agent, Leigh Steinberg, said yesterday.
"Dan has the opportunity to be the first player drafted," said Steinberg, who was announced yesterday as McGwire's agent at a news conference at San Diego State University. "Even if he was not, and he was simply a first-round quarterback, those economics are very strong. Jeff George was worth $15 million for six years, with a $3.5 million signing bonus. Those are the parameters: Jeff George plus inflation."
McGwire finished his college career at San Diego State with 528 completions and 7,484 yards gained, and set a National Collegiate Athletic Association season mark with a 1.56 percent interception rate (7 in 449 pass attempts).

HEADLINE: Panama: A Poor Report Card

 BODY:
A year ago, the United States invaded Panama. The immediate justification was Gen. Manuel Noriega's provocations against U.S. military personnel. President Bush also said he was acting to defend the Panama Canal treaties, combat drug trafficking and defend democracy.
Panama's drug trafficking is now less brazen and General Noriega sits in a U.S. jail. The treaties are still in force. But Panama remains a shattered country, its war damage unrepaired and its sovereignty not yet reclaimed. It is no longer a lawless dictatorship. But neither has it become the democracy Mr. Bush claimed to defend. 
 Guillermo Endara was the apparent winner of a May 1989 election abruptly halted by General Noriega. That made Mr. Endara the obvious choice to head a provisional regime, and he was sworn in at a U.S. military base. But by declining to seek a democratic renewal of his mandate, Mr. Endara has left his own legitimacy tainted.
As Panamanian disillusionment over unresolved problems has grown, his popularity has tumbled. Public order remains shaky. Sanctions, invasion damage and looting shrank Panama's economy by 30 percent. Even now, unemployment exceeds 25 percent. A recent coup attempt was suppressed only with U.S. help. American troops still patrol Panama's streets, exceeding their treaty role of protecting the canal.
After the invasion, President Bush pledged a billion-dollar aid package. "You've got to do what's right," he declared. "You have to try to help repair the wounds, repair the damage." Nearly half the package consisted of restored trade privileges and credits, not really new money. Congress cut the other half by 15 percent and red tape has held up all but $120 million. Neither damage nor wounds has been decently repaired.
Mr. Bush's decision to use force in Panama was justifiable because of the apparent danger to U.S. troops lawfully stationed there. The President had properly explored, and exhausted, less drastic policy instruments without result. Sanctions and diplomacy had not resolved official collaboration with drug syndicates. An internationally monitored election and subsequent efforts by the Organization of American States failed to win respect for basic rights.
Justifiable. But has the invasion of Panama been justified by its results to date? This year's disappointments provide an object lesson in the messiness of war as a solution to political problems.

HEADLINE: Nothing Gained in Tibbett Gardens

 BODY:
The sad tale of Tibbett Gardens demonstrates again how adept New Yorkers have become at stopping anything that offends anyone. Tibbett Gardens was to have been a badly needed complex of middle-income housing, part of a creative experiment some leading developers proposed five years ago. They agreed to waive profits. The Koch administration agreed to help. And a plan to transform eight weed-choked acres into 1,000 condominium apartments was on its way.
Except it really wasn't. Even as city officials approved the plan, critics with two sharply different perspectives rose up to kill it. On one side were people who lived near the site, an abandoned lot in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. They contended that Tibbett Gardens would overcrowd the community. But that claim masked a less admirable fear -- that the complex would attract blacks and Hispanics. 
 On the other side were purists who believed that all city-aided housing should go to the poor, not the middle class -- which the Government defines as households with incomes of $33,000 to $53,000. Over the last four and a half years, the city has rehabilitated thousands of apartments for the poor. Tibbett Gardens was deliberately aimed at providing housing for the middle class, which has also suffered from the housing crunch.
Neighborhood opponents filed a lawsuit that delayed the project for almost two years. Then the economy started to slide, the real estate market softened, costs rose and the banks became skittish. The 1,000 apartments became 750, then 400. Finally, this week, the Dinkins administration reluctantly killed the project.
What a curious victory for the critics. The money meant for Tibbett will not go into low-income housing, because that money no longer exists. The desolate lot in Kingsbridge remains a desolate lot. And the people who so badly needed those apartments have to do without. Once again, narrow fears and cramped dogma prevailed.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Should Sit Down With the Unions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For many years, organized labor has supported Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his agenda for New York State. We've worked side by side with the Governor on many projects and programs, and our help has been critical to many of his successes.
It is, therefore, with great sadness that I feel compelled to speak out against the Governor's actions on the state budget in the last few weeks. By refusing to negotiate with our affiliate the New York Public Employee Federation and other state employee unions, he has undermined collective bargaining for all workers.
By attempting to go around the unions and to take his message of fear and loathing directly to the members, he has shown great disrespect for many fine union leaders and thousands of public employees. And by attempting unilaterally to implement proposals abrogating union contracts, he's given aid and comfort to the enemies of organized labor.
We acknowledge that New York is in economic distress. A rational approach, built on consensus and negotiations with the unions and other constituent groups, could have achieved decent, mutually acceptable, rational solutions to deficit reduction.
As a native New Yorker, I've seen what labor-management cooperation like that can do toward solving huge problems. On behalf of the 250,000 Service Employees Union members in New York State and the nearly one million members across the country, I call on Governor Cuomo to sit down now with the state employee unions and solve his problems in the New York State tradition of collective bargaining.
The thousands of members of public employee unions who insure that ours is a civilized and morally responsible state surely deserve no less.

HEADLINE: Investor in Chrysler: Seldom Passive Before

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Executives of the Chrysler Corporation are preaching calm in the face of Kirk Kerkorian's unsolicited and unwanted 9.8 percent investment in the auto maker. But their actions suggest concern, and analysts say Chrysler may have cause for worry, judging from Mr. Kerkorian's record.
The Los Angeles financier has a 20-year history of making life miserable for the managements of companies in which he invests, including the now-defunct Western Airlines and Columbia Pictures, both of which ultimately paid him a high premium to go away. Mr. Kerkorian contends that his investment is passive, but analysts and some Chrysler executives say there are reasons to believe that his new investment could eventually follow the pattern he has set in the past.
 
 Different From Buffett
 "This is a lot different than if Warren Buffett comes to you and says he wants to buy your stock as a long-term investment," said one Chrysler executive who refused to be identified, referring to the Omaha investor who is known for his long-term investment strategy. 
 Last week, after public disclosure of Mr. Kerkorian's stake, Chrysler took the precaution of strengthening its "poison pill" protection against hostile investors.
Mr. Kerkorian, now Chrysler's largest single shareholder, is publicity-shy and rarely talks to the press. But Terry Christensen, his lawyer, said the change in Chrysler's poison pill was an "overreaction" to Mr. Kerkorian's refusal to refrain from further stock purchases. He is required to notify the Federal Trade Commission if he plans to increase his stake to more than 10 percent.
Until it becomes clear whether he will hold his stake to less than 10 percent, Mr. Kerkorian holds an investment that could provide a nice return, even without a rebound in the economy or the sluggish automobile business. The dividends on his stock represent a pretax return of roughly 10 percent; since the shares were bought through the Tracinda Corporation, which he owns, 70 percent of the dividends would be sheltered from tax. Dividends received by corporations are partly tax-exempt.
But because of Chrysler's weak financial condition, many analysts think the company will be forced to cut its dividend next year -- a move that Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, has vowed not to take, "short of nuclear war." Analysts say Mr. Kerkorian would likely object to such a cut or suggest an alternative, which could test his relations with Chrysler management.
For now, Chrysler executives are publicly using conciliatory rhetoric to prevent a public dispute. As Robert Lutz, the president of Chrysler, said at a holiday gathering for the press at the Detroit Press Club on Tuesday night: "I believe that he's totally sincere that he wants to be a passive investor. He's a 73-year-old entrepreneur who really respects Lee Iacocca, and he looks at Chrysler's stock and he looks at what we're doing, and he's got a lot of faith in Lee."
At least Chrysler need not worry that its new investor will interfere in the car business. In the past, Mr. Kerkorian has avoided day-to-day management. Also, he has no experience in the automobile industry.
 
 A Dizzying Pace
 But he does like to buy, sell and rearrange assets, sometimes at a dizzying pace. Few people in the entertainment industry can recall the number of times during the 1980's that he bought and sold various pieces of the MGM/UA Communications Corporation, which he controlled through the 1970's and 1980's before finally selling what was left this year to Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications Corporation for $1.3 billion.
Mr. Kerkorian's earlier investments in Western Airlines and Columbia Pictures, in which he owned minority stakes, are more analagous to his current minority position. Those investments provoked much rancor and litigation, and Mr. Kerkorian walked away from his stakes after the companies elected to buy back his shares at a premium over market value rather than fight with him.
While selling stock back to management at a premium price, known as "greenmail," has become a practice of some corporate raiders, Mr. Kerkorian's friends and associates say that is not his way of operating. One friend, who insisted on anonymity, said: "He isn't a greenmailer. He hates greenmail."
Mr. Kerkorian is secretive about his investment strategy. His investments usually stem from intuition rather than hard research, his lawyer and other associates say. His investment bankers and friends say he keeps his own counsel and rarely asks for their investment advice or orders research on a company in which he is interested.
The nation's No. 3 auto maker is clearly in a poor position for tussling with unwanted investors. For the last two years Chrysler has been selling assets and cutting costs to amass enough money to develop new vehicles and weather the soft United States automotive market.
Unlike the General Motors Corporation, which spent $700 million in 1986 to buy back the stake held by H. Ross Perot, the billionaire founder of Electronic Data Systems -- ending what had become an enormous corporate distraction -- Chrysler has a thin financial cushion and little management depth. Chrysler has lost several leading executives in the last year and Mr. Iacocca has been saying he is eager to get the company in shape so he can retire.
To beleaguered Chrysler stockholders, who have watched the price of their shares plummet to a bit more than $9 earlier this year, from a peak of $48 in 1987, Mr. Kerkorian's arrival must seem welcome. The stock has since climbed more than 40 percent, closing at $13.25 today, down 50 cents for the day.
Automotive analysts have often expressed concern about Chrysler's short-term prospects, given the weakening economy and competition from stronger rivals like G.M., the Ford Motor Company, the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company.
 
 Too Big to Fall
 But for the long term, Wall Street regards Chrysler as an important manufacturing giant, which one way or another will rebound and reward investors like Mr. Kerkorian who have bought its stock at recent prices. In their view, Chrysler, like Continental Illinois and other companies that have received Federal bailouts, is still considered too big to fail.
If Chrysler does make a comeback, it would not be the first time Mr. Kerkorian has demonstrated shrewd investment sense. The son of Armenian immigrants, Mr. Kerkorian got his start in aviation, buying and selling cargo planes and running a charter service. He sold his Trans International Airlines in 1962 to Studebaker, bought it back, took it public, then sold it again in 1968, this time to the Transamerica Corporation in a stock transaction.
He used his Transamerica stock as financial backing for a tender offer for a sizable stake in Western Airlines in 1968.
Western's management publicly opposed his investment, but failed to deter him. Eight years later, after a period in which the airline prospered, Mr. Kerkorian was able to sell his stake back to Western at a premium over the market price because airline managers feared he would sell the shares to a competitor, threatening the company's independence and spoiling Western's applications for new air routes.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerkorian had begun investing in Las Vegas casinos and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., which was making fewer movies but was building the MGM Grand Hotel. In 1978 he made a cash tender offer for 20 percent of Columbia Pictures, creating tension with Columbia's executives and other big shareholders. Columbia executives finally agreed not to oppose him on condition that he not interfere in the business or increase his stake.
The agreement proved short-lived. By 1980, Mr. Kerkorian and Columbia were suing each other in several courts over whether he could raise his stake. Fay Vincent, who was then Columbia's president and is now the baseball commissioner, called his attempt to buy more shares "an outrageous assault."
A year later, in February 1981, as legal bills grew and executive attention increasingly was occupied by litigation, Columbia agreed to buy back Mr. Kerkorian's stock at a sizable premium over the market value. Once again, he had tangled with management and walked away a wealthier man.

HEADLINE: Real Underground Fiction

BYLINE: By Roy Hoffman; Roy Hoffman is an essayist and author of the novel "Almost Family."

 BODY:
Twenty minutes to nine, Tuesday morning. The F train grinds to a halt at the Smith-Bergen stop. I squeeze into the packed car, my shoulder against a youth's leather jacket, my face inches from a lady's orange-scented swirl of hair. Twisting about, I manage to reach in to my satchel and pull out my sanctuary.
Instantly, I am standing on Willa Cather's Nebraska plain, the sky immense, the talk engaging. I glance up only once to see a young woman across from me steeped in Russian snows, another in Southern magnolias. The subway grinds around a curve, takes on more passengers at Boro Hall. I eagerly turn the page, delighted to have five stops ahead -- enough to get me to the next chapter. 
 There seems to be a great deal of serious reading going on in New York subways these days. Emile Zola, William Faulkner, Gabriel Garcia Marquez -- over the last few months I have seen their books lovingly clasped by riders otherwise annoyed at being packed together beneath the Dial-900 and foot consultation ads.
In some quirky footnote to literary history, it may be that the atmosphere of the F train is especially bookish. Sweeping as it does from far-off Brooklyn, through Greenwich Village and on toward the West Side before bending back to Queens, it picks up a wide range of readers: Hasidic Jews intent over their religious commentaries, students working their way through Dickens, mid-town managers trying to keep up with the bestseller list.
This morning alone, I have noted the serious (Robert Graves's "Claudius the God,"), the popular (Carrie Fisher's "Postcards from the Edge,") and the avant-garde (Jim Carroll's "Basketball Diaries"). While clinging to poles and leaning against railings, riders pore over these books with edgy intensity.
In its noise and crush, a train inspires a fierceness of concentration. The subway car is a reading room turned inside out, the pure inversion of a library. Whereas whispers distract in a library's hallowed quiet, neither bawling babes nor howling singers can disturb the subway reader. The car gives us every excuse to wrap ourselves in good prose and drift far away.
Not that reading on the subway is escapist. The tight quarters of a car push uncomfortably near all the ambitions and letdowns known to man: the idle gaze of a person traveling to the unemployment line set against the briskness of a company manager anxious to hurry the train along. A novelist, in his pages, could dream to capture so much.
Should other riders be allowed to preach the gospel, beg money, play lousy guitar or hawk newspapers? Why not? For those who love to read on the subways, freedom of speech -- the eloquence of which is in the books at hand -- gets us through our morning ride. Besides, the more racket the better; I have been meaning to read "War and Peace."

THE DEMOCRATIC WISH
Popular Participation and
the Limits of American Government.
By James A. Morone.
402 pp. New York: Basic Books. $22.95. 
 IF the conventional wisdom in Washington is finally right about something, the United States is in for a wave of populist reform generated by public anger over everything from the savings and loan debacle to Japanese purchases of American companies, cabinet officers and trade negotiators. If James A. Morone, an associate professor of political science at Brown University, is correct in his new interpretive study of American politics, "The Democratic Wish," this reform wave will produce exactly the opposite of what was intended: additional layers of ineffective, unresponsive government. Even more depressing, Mr. Morone suggests that reform efforts are doomed because, after more than 200 years of self-government, Americans still lack a sensible, coherent view of what government can and should be expected to do.
At first glance, this argument may seem absurd. Americans, after all, have given the world some of its greatest political thinkers and ideas, and arguably the most brilliant constitution ever written. But Mr. Mo rone covers so much ground so skillfully that none can simply dismiss his principal conclusion: we Americans will never solve our collective problems as long as we instinctively fear any meaningful exercise of public power as a threat to liberty.
According to Mr. Morone, American politics went wrong almost from the beginning, its dread of European-style state power producing fragmented governments practically impossible to mobilize for public purposes (except, perhaps, in periods of national emergency such as the Great Depression and World War II). Public purposes, however, plainly have to be served. Just as plainly, the United States Government has grown dramatically in size and authority.
Yet Mr. Morone argues that this growth has always been guided in the worst way possible -- by a desire to restore power to the people. Mesmerized by the myth of a citizenry that was not only virtuous but fully in accord on "the common good" and capable of coherent action, American reformers have time and again responded to crises and turmoil with a dodge. Instead of authorizing the state to attack these problems directly, they have sought to sidestep it altogether and rely on new institutions designed to promote direct democracy.
From the popular assemblies of the 1770's to the community action agencies of Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Mr. Morone argues, the determination to cure the ailments of democracy with more democracy (as John Dewey advised) has only produced new bureaucracies that take on lives of their own. In the process, they wind up reinforcing the status quo. Momentous confrontations over equality or race or class turn into sterile dickering over representation. Even radical forces accept the belief that, say, enough seats on the community school board will solve the dropout problem. Losing sight of the substantive forest for the procedural trees, newly legitimized groups themselves become roadblocks to more sweeping changes.
Further, Mr. Morone says, such disappointments are inevitable. For the root assumptions of the democratic wish -- that overwhelming popular consensus exists on key issues and that problems can be solved simply through the unfettered clash of private interests -- were problematic enough in a country of yeoman farmers and small towns. Today they are completely groundless. Indeed, in today's more complicated political environment, the uncoordinated American way of government is a guarantee of paralysis.
Finding faults in big-idea books like this is always easy -- in fact, too easy. For example, Mr. Morone seems to neglect one major strand of the American political heritage entirely comfortable with using state power: the tradition that has flowed out of the ideas of Alexander Hamilton. Since the Federalist period, this tradition has spearheaded the construction of roads, bridges, dams and the like, while nurturing the development of new technologies from the telegraph to the integrated circuit. At the same time, as Mr. Morone shows, these ideas clearly have not been extended from the economic sphere to cover social and political questions.
Some inconsistencies pop up as well. For example, like many contemporary observers, Mr. Morone finds touching but pathetic the faith of the early 20th-century Progressives in ideal, nonpolitical solutions devised by disinterested technocrats for complex social ills. Yet he seems attached to some himself, suggesting, in one instance, that "massive job creation, a crash program designed to end illiteracy [and] a substantial redistribution of income" could have been enough to alleviate black poverty in the 1960's.
More important, Mr. Morone seems to overlook some rather understandable reasons for our political obsession with form over substance. It is only natural that the citizens of a democracy balk at giving their bureaucrats or even elected leaders a blank check to take steps with potentially far-reaching consequences -- even if we can always vote them out of office. In addition, we as a nation simply are not yet convinced that state power is the key to curing our ills in many areas, and in many cases skepticism may be justified.
As Mr. Morone concludes, the trick is to figure out how Americans can marry "democratic wishes to contemporary institutions." He suggests that by jettisoning "the checks and balances of multiple, competing authority," the nation can construct a state that is not only more competent but more accountable. He hasn't the faintest idea how to do this. But "The Democratic Wish" merits the highest compliments one can accord a public policy book. It spotlights a problem that can no longer be evaded. And it makes you think.

AMERICAN NARROW GAUGE RAILROADS
By George W. Hilton.
Illustrated. 580 pp. Stanford, Calif.:
Stanford University Press. $49.95; $60 after Dec. 31. 
 ANYONE who has ever wondered how it came to be that the rails on almost all American railroads are 4 feet 8 1/2 inches apart will want this account of the nonconforming railroads that flourished for a while, mostly for a couple of decades in the 19th century, running on gauges as narrow as two feet. Intended by George W. Hilton, a professor of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, as both a state-by-state catalogue and an economic history of one of the dead ends in the story of American rails, "American Narrow Gauge Railroads" is also a treat to browse through, with 382 historic black-and-white photos and drawings and 56 maps. An authoritative documentation of a long-gone era, the book brings back to life ancient steam locomotives, railroads and rolling stock that have mostly disappeared without trace.
A few operating relics of the narrow-gauge movement survive as tourist attractions. The best known and most popular (and heavily booked) is the three-foot-gauge former Denver & Rio Grande Railway branch in Colorado that now operates as the Durango & Silverton. The Edaville Railroad in South Carver, Mass., still hauls tourists in the summer and cranberries in the fall on two-foot-gauge equipment that came mostly from the old Sandy River & Rangeley Lakes Railroad, which went out of business in Maine in 1935.
But these are curiosities begging the questions Mr. Hilton seeks to answer: why narrow-gauge roads were built in the first place, and why most of them failed. The 4-foot-8 1/2-inch gauge standard in Britain, where railroads had been born, quickly became standard in the United States and nearly everywhere else as well.
But given the American tendency to think short-term and build cheap, it's a wonder there weren't more narrow-gauge lines. For the biggest argument in favor of narrow gauge in its boom years, the 1870's and early 80's, was that it cost less to build and run a narrow-gauge line than a standard-gauge one. The locomotives and cars weighed less, so the bridges didn't have to be as sturdy; the trains could go around sharper curves, reducing the need for expensive cuts and fills; and they could run on lighter rails. Narrow-gauge locomotives also burned less fuel, and the ratio of payload to dead weight was higher than was possible with 4-foot-8 1/2-inch lines, the backers argued.
Isolated communities far from the main lines listened, seeing in narrow-gauge short lines the quickest way to make freight connections -- not necessarily with other railroads but with the nearest canal, river or seaport (everybody assumed in those days that canals and sea lanes would forever be the most economical means of long-distance bulk transportation).
And so miles and miles of narrow gauge were built -- 2,627 miles in 1882 alone -- until the peak in 1885, when there were 11,699 miles in all, according to an illuminating table in Mr. Hilton's book that also shows the precipitous decline that followed almost immediately. In 1887 alone, 1,345 miles of narrow gauge were converted to standard gauge, and by 1903 there were only 5,761 miles of narrow-gauge track left in the whole country. Today there are fewer than 50 miles. So the exhaustive state-by-state listing of narrow-gauge roads in the second half of this book, covering Alaska and Hawaii as well as the continental United States, is a historical archive, not a contemporary catalog.
In the early 1870's there were plans for a transcontinental three-foot-gauge line from Washington to Denver, but it was never built, as people began discovering the downside of building small and cheap. Lilliputian narrow-gauge locomotives and cars could not run on standard-gauge track, except piggyback on flatcars. When narrow-gauge lines tried hauling standard-gauge cars mounted on wheels to fit their track, the heavier, wider equipment became unstable and derailed on the poorly ballasted track. So they converted to the wider gauge, though not without cost: flimsily built narrow-gauge lines made for inefficient, twisting, expensive-to-maintain standard-gauge ones, as the Nickel Plate Road, the Norfolk & Western and others quickly found out.
So, except for a few historical dinosaurs surviving here and there, we ended up with the familiar 4 feet 8 1/2 inches, from the IRT subway in New York and Amtrak's Northeast corridor to the Santa Fe. So did most European countries -- except notably Spain, Russia, and Finland, which, like most of the American South in the 1860's, had opted for a still wider gauge instead. Unlike the South, these countries kept it.
The magic 4 feet 8 1/2 inches, as Mr. Hilton explains it, was about the width of cart tracks in Roman times and represented the most efficient width of a loaded vehicle that could be pulled by a horse. It suited the iron horse best, as well.

THE BLACK CHURCH IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE
By C. Eric Lincoln and
Lawrence H. Mamiya.
519 pp. Durham, N.C.:
Duke University Press.
Cloth, $47.50. Paper, $18.95. 
 When I was a child in North Carolina, I used to travel with my father as he made the circuit of several small churches he served. I can remember passing large, beautiful churches where the white people worshiped. I used to wonder what those churches looked like on the inside, what kind of music they sang. I wondered what the pastors preached about: did they talk about how to get along with black people, or did they tell their children not to play with us? And I wondered whether they were curious about what went on in our churches, and whether they were all that different.
In their important study, "The Black Church in the African-American Experience," C. Eric Lincoln and Lawrence H. Mamiya provide a long-needed look at what was once called "the invisible institution." The black church still is invisible to many whites; no matter what other changes may have taken place, most whites and blacks in this country still pray separately. But black churches are more than places to pray; they are the hub of traditional black life. For more than two centuries, the black church has been our most important agency for the development of citizens and the training of leaders; it has fostered our solidarity as a community and fueled our drive toward political empowerment.
Blacks were exposed to Christianity in the early days of slavery by plantation owners who hoped to create obedient and docile workers. But enslaved black people transformed this sponsored religious activity into an experience that supported their eventual liberation. The gospel of Jesus Christ, with its themes of suffering and redemption, spoke to the slaves in a far more powerful voice than slaveowners had intended. By the mid-1700's, compelled by genuine faith, blacks on small plantations (George Liele, founder of the Silver Bluff Baptist Church in South Carolina, is regarded as one of the first) began to meet for private, independent worship, since the idea of authentic worship with whites was impossible.
By the late 18th century, according to Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Mamiya, black churches had embarked on what would become their dual missions of spiritual and political revival. In 1787, for example, Richard Allen, Absalom Jones and other former slaves withdrew in protest from St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia after being pulled from their knees during prayer in a gallery closed to blacks. "All went out of the church in a body, and they were no more plagued with [us] in that church," Allen wrote. He and some of his colleagues became founders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the seven historically black denominations discussed in this book. The continued existence of the black church indicates that no matter how compelling the ideal of one church for all people, the notion of unity without equality remains for black people an unacceptable and spiritually empty alternative.
The public's knowledge about the black church is typically limited to the familiar movie image of black worshipers overcome by emotion, given to outbreaks of shouting and estatic praise, their funeral-parlor fans fluttering frantically to prevent exhaustion. In fact, no single image could ever do justice to the richness of the African-American religious tradition. In "The Black Church in the African American Experience," the authors have given us a portrait of black churches that reflects their complexity and variety. This excellent book documents much of the religious experience of the African-American people through the use of social science techniques, translating general impressions into solid data; it lifts these institutions into the mainstream of scholarly reflection and analysis.
Mr. Lincoln, who is a professor of religion and culture at Duke University, and Mr. Mamiya, an associate professor of religion and African studies at Vassar College, challenge what they say is "the uncritical assumption that the black experience in religion is but the replication of the white experience." Because 80 percent of all black Christians are members of seven major black denominations, the authors decided to use these Baptist, Methodist and Pentecostal communities as the subjects for a series of field interviews. More than 1,800 black clergy participated in this 10-year study -- both male and female, formally trained and self-taught; those interviewed served congregations in both urban and rural areas.
The book does more than clarify and articulate an appropriate methodology for studying the black church. Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Mamiya have compiled an enormous store of information. Most helpful are the historical overviews of the three streams of traditionally black demominations; members of these groups will find themselves revising some of their own assumptions as they regard their churches in the light of these new data. Smaller religious communities not included in the study will sharpen their focus on their own denominational objectives, problems and possibilities.
Some of the information expands on widely held beliefs about black church communities. For example, the quality of preaching is clearly central to successful leadership in black congregations. Yet the authors found that the role of music in the services ran a close second in importance. The kinds of music used in services were split along urban-rural lines, with urban churches more willing to experiment with the inclusion of secular music such as blues and jazz. Rural churches were more conservative, relying on the traditional, rhythmically accentuated gospel songs. Most of the churches studied had at least two choirs, and music is especially important to younger members.
The role of women within the black church community is contradictory, the authors found: "Both historical and contemporary evidence underscore the fact that black churches could scarcely have survived without the active support of black women, but in spite of their importance in the life of the church, the offices of preacher and pastor . . . remain a male preserve." (Only 3.7 percent of those ministers studied were women, and the authors estimate the total proportion of female ministers in the black church at about 5 percent.)
The Church of God in Christ is perhaps the most resistant of all historically black denominations to the notion of women in the pulpit, though some signs of breakthrough are beginning to appear. Even among those denominations where women are accepted as missionaries and evangelists, the pulpits of the larger or more prestigious churches may not be open to women. This state of affairs mirrors many of the same contradictions to be found in white denominations. Yet the authors also discuss "the mothers of the church," the oldest female members of a congregation or the wife of the founding pastor. These women hold extraordinary, if unofficial, power within a congregation and are often consulted before major church decisions are implemented. "The phenomenon of the 'church mother' has no parallel in white churches," the authors write. "It is derived from the kinship network found within black churches and black communities."
One surprise can be found in the numbers of black clergy who must work full time at other jobs to support themselves and their families: nearly half, according to Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Mamiya. This is a cruel paradox in light of the important economic role black churches have always played in the lives of African-Americans. In the early 20th century, black banks and credit unions, insurance companies and building and loan companies -- many of which still exist -- all had their roots in black church communities. And at the time of the study, the authors found that black churches received more than 75 percent of all charitable donations made by black people and benefited from 35 percent of blacks' volunteer time. The authors suggest that the black church is only beginning to comprehend its collective economic power, a power that might be put to significant use in helping the black community move toward full equality.
Another surprise was found in the research on black churches and the civil rights movement. The movement would have been impossible without the central role played by black churches. Yet in spite of overwhelming general support for political activism, the authors found considerable ambivalence, particularly within more evangelical strains of the black church. Some churches are reluctant to embrace the concept of black empowerment; a church with a strong emphasis on love and a commitment to reconciliation, for example, might be reluctant to take a confrontational stand.
Perhaps the most promising of all the information contained in this study is the evidence of a growing interest among black church leaders in ecumenical options that can empower the black church to pursue its mission in ways that would be impossible for individual churches. The Congress of National Black Churches -- a confederation of the leadership of the seven major denominations, founded in 1978 -- has embarked on several efforts in this regard, including economic development projects, national training programs for pastors, antidrug efforts and family support programs.

THE authors end their book with an examination of the challenges that face the black church in a changing African-American culture. The rise of Pentecostal sects within the black church offers what many feel is a deeper sense of spirituality than more mainstream black denominations provide. The growth of Islamic religion, particularly among young black males, is sure to bring changes in the black church's influence. And the growing numbers of middle-class blacks in church communities raises questions of whether black churches will split along class lines and abandon their longstanding commitment to the poor.
"The Black Church in the African American Experience" has been published at an opportune moment. The strength of the black church has always been as a vehicle for social, political and spiritual transformation. At a time when America seeks ways to restore its national identity, to rehabilitate the spirits of alienated masses, to open the doors of opportunity for millions who feel locked out, black churches stand out as institutions with a proven record in such transformation. They have demonstrated their capability for empowerment, emancipating black people from the ravages of generations of slavery and equipping them to recover a sense of identity, to forge ties of communal loyalty, to help themselves and others and to create cultural expressions that embody their hopes and aspirations.
Thanks to the patient work of Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Mamiya, the whole nation now has at its disposal much information that black communities have always taken for granted. Theological seminaries and universities may discover or reaffirm the value of researching the black church; liberation and womanist (black feminist) theologians may enter a second phase of engagement and dialogue. The private and public sectors may explore ways to make optimal use of the black church network, its varied facilities and the deployment of volunteers from its congregations in the service of the wider community; new leaders will be identified, both sacred and secular. Together with leaders of other churches and social agencies, America may discover at last that the black church is not a sideshow for the down and out, but a hidden treasure to be shared by all who pray for the health of our nation.

MODERNITY ON ENDLESS TRIAL
By Leszek Kolakowski.
261 pp. Chicago:
The University of Chicago Press. $24.95. 
 Toward the end of the last century, and at a particularly dark moment in his life, Paul Gauguin painted what many regard as his masterpiece, in which he inscribed what were doubtless intended as eternal questions but which in truth exemplified to perfection the fin de siecle spirit the painting itself expresses: "Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?" Hegel supposed that the shape and meaning of an era become visible only when it is over with, but our century ends with the same set of questions as to the meaning of our history and where we stand and what we have to look forward to. Leszek Kolakowski's collection of essays is in this sense very much a fin de siecle book. Few people can be better equipped through philosophical discipline, personal experience, moral sensibility, historical learning and a lifetime spent confronting the events and ideas of his times to provide a degree of orientation in the historical present. If Mr. Kolakowski has no answers to Gauguin's questions, neither, one feels, can anyone have.
But the cumulative tone of the 23 essays (not counting the epilogue) is that, even more than in the last fin de siecle, historical change is out of control, and beliefs and practices, the institutional armatures of social and moral life, are cracking under the strain of innovation, revision and disillusionment. Mr. Kolakowski's is a vision of people clawing at truths that give way under their fingers. In the title essay he writes: "Whatever area of life we reflect upon, our natural instinct is to ask, What is wrong with it? And indeed we keep asking, What is wrong with God? With democracy? With socialism? With art? With sex? With the family? With economic growth? It seems as though we live with the feeling of an all-encompassing crisis without being able, however, to identify its causes clearly, unless we escape into easy, one-word pseudosolutions."
In fact, the pseudosolutions have just been enumerated: God, democracy, socialism, art, sex, the family, economic growth. The solutions, in fact, are the problems. Whatever answer we give to Gauguin's first question, it will do us no great good, since the answer to the third question is that the world is already so different from what it only recently was that there are no useful lessons to be drawn from the past -- except that lesson. It is as though fin de siecle has become a permanent condition of being. "Modernity on Endless Trial" is a very pessimistic book, the burden of which is perhaps that we have to learn to live without solutions and make do instead with a few human values and some tentative norms.
Mr. Kolakowski is a research fellow at All Souls College, Oxford, and a member of the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. In 1968 he was expelled for political reasons from Poland, where he had been chairman of the department of the history of philosophy at the University of Warsaw. His exile, and in some measure the respect and admiration he has received in the West, are acknowledgments of his personal integrity in a world that demanded orthodoxy, and of his subtle and courageous criticisms of Marxism as a philosophy and an ideology. The abrupt irrelevance of these criticisms in a world in which Marxism has become marginal as a political force, and largely antiquated as an intellectual agenda, must reinforce the resigned irony with which Mr. Kolakowski perceives the world.
Although he is the author of some 30 books in several languages, one feels it is the essay that best expresses his complex intellectual personality, since it gives opportunity for nuance and reservation, qualified assertion, personal aside, the balanced consideration of opposing views, the guarded conclusion -- as if the form were the man himself. As a form it is opposed to manifestoes and proclamations just as Mr. Kolakowski, as a person, would be opposed to those whose natural expression these forms would be. Small wonder he was perceived as a danger in a dogmatic culture, where insisting upon the gray-in-gray of philosophical fastidiousness was a form of heroism.
But the essay is as well the form par excellence for addressing a reality that resists simple, clear answers to Gauguin-style questions. An essay is a trial effort, a tentative exploration, a feeling round the contours of shapes that may never become wholly visible, a report of qualified findings. It is perhaps the literary counterpart to a form of life in which we are obliged to live tentatively and cautiously.
To those for whom the solutions have not as yet become problems, who live under clear moral skies, who are fortunate enough not to live in their own times, the essay in its essential incertitude can have little point. But for those who have confronted or been confronted by the issues with which these essays deal -- moral relativism, cultural difference, Eurocentrism, the role of the intellectual, the value of the intellectual life, the grounding of human rights and humane values, the crisis of Christianity, the price and promise of revolution, the appeal and limits of conservatism or liberalism or socialism, and the conflicting claims of religion, science, reason and philosophy -- Mr. Kolakowski's essays are exemplary. They represent perhaps the best we can come up with if we are as scrupulous as their author in resisting the easy solution that we know in advance will shortly become its own problem. The essays, in effect, embody the condition they address.
Some of them aspire to a certain playfulness that does not, I think, come naturally to this thinker. His essays on the Devil lack the lightness of touch the Devil demands in those who invoke his name, and "The General Theory of Not-Gardening" and "Emperor Kennedy Legend: A New Anthropological Debate" are heavy gambols in scholarly jocularity. Far closer to Mr. Kolakowski's temper are utterances like these: "There never have been and never will be improvements that are not paid for with deteriorations and evils." "There is no happy ending in human history." "We would do well to expect the worst." For Mr. Kolakowski, the greatest danger of modernism is "the disappearance of taboos": "It is perhaps better to believe in the validity of even apparently silly taboos than to let them all vanish." But he also knows that we cannot preserve them by an act of social will. And in any case, the idea that by erasing taboos or changing the institutional framework of human life we can build hope for a better life is "a reliable blueprint for despotism." This is the voice, bitter at times and at best sardonic, of someone who has witnessed the horrendous human costs of enacting an idealism with insufficient sensitivity to the value of what was being sacrificed in its cause.
Mr. Kolakowski retains a sort of faith in a basis of values that does not depend upon us, and indeed, he feels that our civilization will vanish if this faith is not shared. Yet he is painfully aware that there are a great many who share his belief that "the distinction between good and evil, between the prohibited and the mandatory, does not depend on our respective decisions," but whose contempt for the things he cherishes, like human rights and political freedom, is flagrant. Grounding good and evil in an external moral authority has not always, in fact has rarely, contributed to the enhancement of freedom and a respect for human dignity. Mr. Kolakowski is also aware that his faith will not especially help in making political decisions. There are always moral costs. So we must, in effect, make moral decisions the way we write essays -- we must live essayistically and diffidently.
SOME of these essays end disappointingly if we do not recall the spirit in which they were composed. "Politics and the Devil" concludes with what the author admits is, after all, a trivial truth -- we are not passive observers but participants in the struggle between God and the Devil -- even if this is mitigated by his claim that it is, "as many trivial truths, worth repeating." "Irrationality in Politics" recognizes that it has but offered "three meager and philosophically less than stimulating conclusions." "The Idolatry of Politics" concludes with the concession, "An objection might be raised that what I have said could well borrow its title from the famous treatise of Abelard: Sic et non [Yes and no]." Well, yes, he says, but "Sic et non is a suitable title for most of the stuff our minds are made of."
It is certainly the stuff of which most of these essays are made, and I think it should be celebrated. Somewhere in Mr. Kolakowski's soul is the sic of a knight of faith, but his intellect is filled with nons of qualification, extenuation and exception. The feeling of the book is that of a tension between a simple sic and a thousand inhibiting nons. That is what I call civilization, and probably the best by way of an answer civilized people can live with in an age that shrieks for the security of orthodoxy.

 CURRENTLY there is a schism in American letters between the presence of humor in poetry and the failure of reviewers to comment on that presence. It is hard to think of a poet today who does not sample in some way the widely varying comic tones, from subtle to raucous, that are first heard in the poems of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson and then echoed by writers as different as William Carlos Williams, Marianne Moore and Allen Ginsberg. Yet, while reviewers argue theme and technique in great detail, when it comes to humor they seem to have a collective tin ear. If humor is noticed at all, it is often dismissed as simply slick or clever.
Lately, this schism seems all the more remarkable, given the eagerness of a new generation of reviewers, fresh from graduate seminars, to buttress their arguments with references to Jacques Derrida, Mikhail Bakhtin and other formidable European intellects. Has none of them remarked the witty mischief in Derrida's deconstructive strategies or Bakhtin's assertion, in his book on Rabelais, that laughter has "a deep philosophical meaning"?
Three splendid books illustrate some of the ways in which humor functions not as a mere stylistic quality but as a mode of perception. Typically, a Charles Simic poem starts with a sentence fragment, an ungainly image crash-landing at the feet of a speaker who was expecting something else entirely. Thus the characters in his poems are often like the protagonists of fairy tales -- farmers or fishermen who in the course of their labors come across a talking fox or a lamp with a genie inside. These characters begin as rather ordinary types and end as heroes, their bemusement turning to amusement as they regain control over their interrupted lives.
Mr. Simic was born in Yugoslavia in 1938, and his family moved to Chicago in 1954; perhaps there is a Central European sensibility at work in his poems. His colors are fairy-tale colors: where his world is not sooty, it is splashed with reds and whites. And in many of his poems, a simple, lighthearted fellow succeeds against a harsh world. It is as though Thumbling found himself on State Street rather than his father's farm.
Fairy tales tell us that things will work out, that little people like ourselves are capable of great heroism. In "The Book of Gods and Devils" the speaker of "Windy Evening," in which this cheap stage set of an earth seems to be falling to pieces, can say, with confidence: "Better grab hold of that tree, Lucille. . . . / I'll hold the barn." In Mr. Simic's world, action is everything.
Besides, thinking is too hard -- "I get sad when I think," confides the speaker of "A Letter." Thought is sad because it simply leads to more thought, whereas action is the royal road to life's goofy splendors. In "Evening Talk," the speaker tells a friend he shouldn't have wasted his time worrying about someone who didn't show up. Instead,
 
 You should have crossed the street
 And followed that obviously demented woman
 With the long streak of blood-red hair
 Which the sky took up like a distant cry.
 Fortunately, most of Mr. Simic's hero-next-door types are more resolute. They speak to every fox, rub every magic lamp. And they are the ones who are invited, as it says in "Heights of Folly,"

 To breakfast on slices of watermelon
 In the company of naked gods and goddesses
 On a patch of last night's snow.
In Stephen Dobyns's poem "Careers," a young poet who is fascinated with Ulysses and other purposeful fellows thinks, "How simple it seemed / to pick a life and have that life make sense." But when he goes to a hospital to visit a friend, he sees a group of senile nuns caressing and singing to dolls they mistake for their own children. That's when he realizes his life might end up crazy or just dull, like that of the man in "Toting It Up" who discovers his has been merely a "twelve car life," a "two wife life," a "four kids life" and so on.
For Mr. Dobyns's characters, like Mr. Simic's, thought is rare; not because action is better, however, but because life is too crowded and busy for thought. In "The Body's Journey," the first poem in "Body Traffic," our earthly tumult is described in terms positively Dantesque:

 one woman dragging herself up by the long
 black tresses of another, an old man slamming
 his cudgel against another old man's
 bald spot, thousands scrambling to the top.
In his way, Mr. Dobyns is as fascinated with the body as St. Augustine. Unlike the church fathers, though, Mr. Dobyns adores the body and enumerates its separate parts, devoting individual poems to the nose, the nails, the feet. The laughter in his poetry derives in part from the writer's sense of the silly body heading for its next inevitable pratfall, but also from a sunny awareness of the body's unflappable optimism: at the moment of death, as he observes in "The Body's Strength," the body keeps plodding dumbly ahead, ignoring the exhausted mind's pleas to give in. And in his paean called simply "Feet," the feet are depicted as cheerful cowards ready to whisk us away when death calls. (That's why the feet love to dance, incidentally -- it's how they stay in shape for that ultimate getaway.)
Life can be pretty grisly in Mr. Dobyns's poems. But life isn't a tragedy in which we are fatally mired. Instead, it is a farce we view from a certain remove -- not much of one, but it is as though we were watching life on a movie screen. As Mr. Dobyns says, "We are lackluster virgins which the mustachioed world / ties to the train tracks of tomorrow's locomotive." Because of that slight distance between our real selves and the ones on the tracks, there is still time to do something, even if it's just to let out a rueful guffaw. After all, the train isn't here yet.
There is a ceaseless current of laughter in Amy Clampitt's poetry, a chuckling appreciation of the incongruity inherent in everything -- an incongruity, the poet seems to suggest, that she just might be able to overcome. Her poems are brightly lighted and joyous; often there is a rising delirium to them, as in a saint's description of her ecstasies. One can't help wondering if this is how Emily Dickinson might have written had she had more encouragement -- if someone had just said, "Come on, Emily, you can do it."
Ms. Clampitt's speakers don't seem to be able to contain themselves; as a consequence, one thing always leads to another. If the humor in Mr. Simic's and Mr. Dobyns's work often derives from people who think too little, in Ms. Clampitt's it stems from those who can't stop thinking. In "The Field Pansy," one of the poems in "Westward," a violet recalls asters, then Johnny-jump-ups, then, in a parody of academic description, "the bi- or tri-colored native field pansy of Europe" that is the true subject of the poem, a subject as much avoided as it is approached. One is reminded of Jim Blaine's story of his grandfather's old ram in Mark Twain's "Roughing It," a story that never gets told because each character reminds the teller of another until he himself falls asleep, so that, as Twain says, "the mention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had ever heard him get."
Ms. Clampitt creates another level of humor in "The Field Pansy" by means of a teasing commentary on this tendency to ramble:

 I know I'm leaving something out
 when I write of this omnipresence of something like eagerness,
 
 this gushing insouciance that appears at the same time capable
 of an all but infinite particularity: sedulous, patient, though
 in the end (so far as anyone can see) without consequence.
 What is consequence?

And unlike Jim Blaine's story, "The Field Pansy" does end -- not with anything like a ram or even a flower but with the understanding that "consequence" lies in our ability to connect with ourselves and others.
Characteristically, Ms. Clampitt's speakers introduce a rather ordinary subject, forget it, recall it and mix it in memory with a second subject, often a tragic one. Thus in "The Beach Pea," a plant is associated with a dying neighbor. The speaker, traveling in England, sees another plant, laburnum, which is "kin of broom and gorse, of / the acacia, the beach pea . . . / The beach pea!" And she remembers the dying woman. With remarkable economy, Ms. Clampitt has her speaker simultaneously lamenting a death and chuckling at her own supercharged powers of association, which somehow manage to combine the charm of absent-mindedness with the fury of total recall. Sooner or later, everything gets connected in Ms. Clampitt's poems, so that, at the heart of each of them, there is a well-earned smile of proud wonder.
If one were to judge from reviews alone, contemporary American poetry would seem a rather dour undertaking. But these poets, three of our best, say otherwise.

HEADLINE: Five Babes in Toyland

BYLINE: By Joe Queenan; Joe Queenan writes about business and is the father of two children, one of whom falls in the Quints target market.

 BODY:
Not long ago, a relatively small toy company called Playmates stormed into stores with a quartet of radioactive mutant turtles fighting for truth and justice throughout Manhattan's sewer system. The toys have made millions. Hoping that five cuddly baby dolls can enjoy some similar measure of success, Tyco Toys this year introduced a set of tiny, reasonably priced, not-at-all-mutant quintuplet dolls called the Quints. Apparently, the theory is that there is safety in numbers, and so far the numbers -- a projected $20 million in wholesale revenues this year alone -- are very encouraging. Tyco claims it has a hit, and is now making every effort to turn that hit into an institution.
Every year, between 5,000 and 6,000 toys are introduced in the $13.4 billion United States toy business, and every year about 95 percent of the new products vanish without a trace. The Quints won't be one -- or five -- of them. The new line of quintuplet baby dolls is a very hot item, and if Tyco projections are correct, the Quints could be good news in what many expect to be a down year for the toy industry. The industry has been hurt by the recession as well as by deep discounting of toys in pre-Christmas sales, partly stemming from the desperate financial straits of Child World (the No. 2 retailer after Toys "R" Us), which suspended payments to its suppliers early this month. 
 The $20 million in Quints sales is relatively impressive, considering that the sets of five two-inch plastic dolls with innumerable matching accessories will have been on the market only 10 months. Tyco expects sales to reach $35 million in 1991, when the Quints line is significantly expanded from the three sets of five now available to a total of 11 varieties of Quints. Industry observers like Sean McGowan, a toy-industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company, a New York securities brokerage firm, agree that this is a reasonable expectation. But McGowan also notes that Hasbro's My Little Pony, by comparison, jumped from $20 million its first year to $65 million in its second.
Next year's Quints will include the Sunny Time Quints with red hair and magic freckles, Rainy Day Quints with magic rosy cheeks, Drink and Wet Quints and Playful Quints, which shake their heads, wave their arms and suck their thumbs. In 1992, Tyco plans to add relatives -- twin brothers, triplet cousins, quadruplet aunts?
Whatever they might represent to children, the Quints are a housekeeping nightmare. Each set of Quints consists of the dolls -- three girls, two boys -- dressed in numbered diapers and ensconced in a strip of quilted bunting that sleeps five. The set, which costs $10, also includes five numbered baby bottles attached in a row on a long plastic strip, suggesting an oar for infant galley slaves. The color-coded numbers also appear on the dolls' accessories, all of which come in multiples of five, usually bonded to each other. These cost between $8 and $30 and include everything from a rocking horse for five to a five-room house.
Introduced last spring to by-no-means-overwhelming praise from buyers in the toy trade, the Quints rapidly took over second place in the small-doll segment of the doll market, behind My Little Pony. The four-inch Classic Pony, which cantered into toy stores in 1983, costs just under $5 and did $90 million of business in 1985, its peak year. The catalogue for this year offers some 60 Classic Ponies, with different-colored bodies, tails and manes and names like Rainbow Curl and Glittery Sweetheart Sister. (Later pony lines include the Petite and Dream Beauties.) Their distinguishing characteristics, largely imperceptible to the adult eye, are so fraught with delicate nuance that some little girls demand dozens of specimens from their parents. "A serious collector has 80 or 90 ponies," reports Mike Hirtle, vice president of research and development at Tyco Toys.
"The appeal is in the ownership," says Maurene Souza, Tyco's vice president of marketing for girls' toys and activities, who built her reputation through her work with My Little Pony before joining Tyco in December 1989. "It's important to say you have a lot of them." And, indeed, Wayne Charness, a Hasbro spokesman, says that one little girl somewhere in America owns 364.
With the $10 Quints, Tyco is basically operating on the razor-blade principle: sell the original product cheap and make the real money off the refills or, in this case, the accessories. These include, or will soon include, the rocking chair for five, the vanity table for five, the crib, highchair, carriage, rocking horse, wagon, wading pool and the Special-for-Five-Playground. Within this diminutive pentagonal universe there are further subsets of five; the playground, for example, includes a slide for five, a sandbox for five, a seesaw for five, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.
Right now, according to Jim Alley, Tyco's senior vice president of marketing, most people buy around $30 worth of Quintiana; buying one starter set of Quints and the entire line of accessories would cost $120, a number that could soon double. Or triple. Or even, one day, quintuple.
The priciest item in Quintdom is the Special-for-Five-House, which has a playroom, bathroom, kitchen, nursery and a patio. Unfortunately for the consumer, it comes unfurnished, though available accessories include sinks for five, potties for five, watering cans for five, changing tables for five and playpens for five. Presumably, should the Quints ever take a sinister turn, there will be holding tanks for five, balls and chains for five and perhaps even a five-person legal defense team. But that's down the road. For the time being, Tyco will content itself with churning out a steady new supply of Quints each year, with new facial expressions, new hair styles, new ethnic groups and new furniture.
"We give them different reasons why they want more Quints," Souza says of the targeted consumers, 4- to 8-year-old girls. Tyco hopes those reasons may soon include a Saturday morning television show, the toy industry's principal instrument of coercion in dealing with children.

IT WAS BERNARD Loomis, something of a legend in the toy business, who brought the Quints concept to Tyco, in March 1989. Loomis is the president of Bernard Loomis Inc., which also employs his daughter Merry. Before that, he held top executive positions at Mattel Toys, Kenner Products Company -- where he was president and chief executive officer between 1971 and 1978 -- and General Mills Toy Group. At Mattel, he was involved with the Barbie line, but he won his stripes by bringing the tremendously successful Hot Wheels action cars to market. At Kenner, he cooked up the idea of selling consumers what amounted to "toy futures" -- the right to buy not-yet-available Star Wars toys as soon as they rolled off the assembly line. While at General Mills, he was responsible for both Strawberry Shortcake and Care Bears, maddeningly cuddly toys that, under his direction, quickly transmogrified into maddeningly inane television shows and feature films. These programs are for all intents and purposes nonstop commercials; the characters in the shows are all available as toys. Loomis, whose marketing exploits were immortalized in the title essay of David Owen's 1988 book "The Man Who Invented Saturday Morning" has long been a force in Toyland, so when he came to Tyco with the Quints, months of in-house development of a new toy line called Pussy Willow People got put on the back burner. (Which, Alley says, is no big deal in the business.)
Alley estimates that at Tyco 70 percent of new toy ideas come from independent idea people like Loomis. "Toy design people tend to be undisciplined," Alley says. "They need to be in an undisciplined environment." Tyco quickly saw the potential: "Our team totally embraced the concept."
As with many great inventions -- handwriting, the microcomputer, season-ticket plans that force hockey fans to attend three preseason games at full price -- it is sometimes difficult to assign credit to the right person. When queried about the precise circumstances surrounding the birth of the Quints, the folks at Tyco are fuzzy. They know Loomis brought up the idea in the spring of 1989, but can't recall exactly where he got it. Loomis himself initially reported that it came from either his daughter or Christina Ericson, whose own design company, Advanced Concepts, works hand in hand with Loomis's.
Merry Loomis unhesitatingly gives the credit to Ericson. "It was the classic 'What if?,' " says Ericson, a cheerful but slightly less bouncy sort than the highly animated Loomises. "I always thought a little girl would rather have five pennies than a nickel. Well, we were having a blue-sky session one day early in 1989 and. . . ."
"It exploded right here," says Merry Loomis, who is sitting in the East Side apartment her father uses as an office on his visits to New York from his home in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
Bernie Loomis, wresting himself free from the grasp of a grandson who has careened into the room, now becomes turbo-charged. "As soon as I heard the idea, I knew we could come up with some interesting economics. When you design for five, you're not doing five separate products. Making five dolls is not five times as expensive as making one. The accessories are what brought it to life. I am only interested in things that have longevity and multiplicity."
Convinced that the Quints had the capacity to be big, perhaps super-big, and at the very least bigger than Inhumanoids and Stage II -- less successful Loomis inventions of recent years -- the group spent a few months developing models of the Quints and some basic accessories, including the rocking horse. In March, Loomis took them to Tyco, with whom he has a creative-development arrangement. "Tyco has no right of first refusal," Loomis says, "but Dick Grey is my best friend in the toy business."
Richard E. Grey is president and chief executive officer of Tyco.
Loomis wanted Tyco to reach a decision quickly, and agreed to one -- and only one -- child-testing session. The toys were tested on 30 girls between the ages of 4 and 8 in a research center in Teaneck, N.J. "The response was very enthusiastic," he recalls. "The kids immediately identified the central concept; they focused on the fiveness as a continuous dramatic theme."
Although Tyco officials always shared Loomis's enthusiasm for the project, they had one concern: price. Ten dollars was twice what Hasbro was getting for My Little Pony, and it was My Little Pony that the Quints would be competing against. Part of the appeal of both the Quints and My Little Pony is that the toys constitute what Sean McGowan calls "a negotiation." In other words, the toy is cheap enough that a parent can escape from the toy store relatively unscathed. A toy like Tyco's My Pretty Ballerina can set a parent back $40.
Still, $10 was a stretch. "So we all said, 'How about triplets?' " Alley says.
And?
"Triplets didn't seem that unusual," Alley says. As for quads, well, frankly, "Quads sounds like an automobile term."
Marketing director Nancy Feinberg, herself a twin, says, "One of the reasons we decided to do quints was that it would pre-empt any knockoff products, because triplets aren't as good as quints, and quads aren't as good as quints." Thus far, the Quints have inspired at least one knockoff, a set of triplets that sells for $14.99, but nobody at Tyco seems concerned.
Heather McComb, Tyco's director of product development, felt that the dolls had to be an odd number for the sake of visual intrigue. "Quads aren't as cute," she says before launching into a gentle critique of such humdrum, predictable, four-sided objects as rectangles and squares. "Five is a nicer balance. When you're arranging flowers, you would never put four in a vase, you'd put five."
How similar to the Quints on the store shelves today are the models that Loomis brought in? "It's extremely close to the original concept," Grey says, although, as McComb points out, "the body, which way it moved, the hair, the sculpt, that was all redeveloped here."
"Tyco's ability to adhere to the designer's wishes, and to do so quickly, had a lot to do with getting the product out to market," says Grey.
The research-and-development department had to move quickly because the folks upstairs wanted to take the product to Hong Kong right away to see if they could get a realistic vendor price -- toyese for the cost to the manufacturer to produce the toy. Tyco headquarters in Mount Laurel, N.J., occupy a scant three floors; most of the manufacturing is done in the Orient. Once the company was confident it could deliver a quality product for a $10 retail price, the official designing of the toy began. Heads. Hair. Clothes. Package. Bunting.
Should the Quints be all girls, or four girls, or three girls? Should their major accessories be a single, bonded unit or five separate items? At no point did the company feel that the sheer novelty of multiplicity was going to make the Quints a success. They also had to be cute. "If the little girl can't fall in love with the face on one of them, she's not going to fall in love with the face on five of them," says Alley.
Nancy Feinberg says the key moment for Quints occurred when Tyco tested the rocking horse with the 30 little girls. At the time, the horse for five was five separate horses, meaning that a child could play with each mounted Quint individually. The girls found this idea unbelievably foolish, recoiling at any suggestion that the Quints should be paired off into smaller, more manageable units. "Right then and there, we knew we should go gangbusters with the idea of fiveness," says Feinberg.
In the fall of 1989, Tyco showed the Quints, along with its other products, to major retailers like Toys "R" Us, Child World, and K Mart.
"The reaction was, 'O.K., we'll stock it, but no big deal.' " Feinberg says.
Still, Tyco felt it had a potential hit, based on its child testing. "You have to market it to the ultimate consumer, not to the trade," Souza says. "The industry is kid-driven."
At that initial showing, the accessories were packaged in a closed cardboard box. The retailers suggested Tyco open up the packaging, putting in a see-through blister window. This change added about 80 cents to the manufacturing cost of each item, but Tyco decided not to pass the increase on to the consumer.
The reaction to the Quints' official unveiling, at the toy industry's American International Toy Fair in February, was mildly enthusiastic. But buyers' attention was directed at big-ticket items, like Tyco's Baby Shivers and My Pretty Ballerina and Hasbro's Baby Uh-Oh and Go-Go, My Walking Pup.
Still, Alley, dead certain that the kids knew more than the trade, wanted to move quickly. In order to get the Quints into the stores by Easter 1990, he had the dolls flown in, rather than shipped, from Hong Kong, at the same time launching an advertising blitz on television. "We brought in enough to get a little bit of product everywhere in the country," Alley says. "It cost more to bring it in than the profit we made on the product. But sales kept climbing after Easter" -- a time when they ordinarily drop -- "and I knew we had a winner." The toys were stocked in big retail and discount outlets across the country. They sold well in all.
Confident that the Quints were a hit, Tyco went to work on line extensions, again with Loomis's intimate involvement. The research-and-development department fooled around with punk Quints and rocker Quints, and even made prototypes, though Tyco claims it wasn't serious. But most of the ideas were standard stuff. For the 1991 line, Tyco made 300 Quint prototypes (from which eight final sets were developed) with 600 different pairs of eyes. All of them crying out for affection, Tyco hopes.
"It's the ultimate nurturing toy," Souza says. For a girl's toy to be successful, "it has to have some sort of vulnerability. With Oopsie Daisy, the doll falls and they scoop it up. With Baby Shivers, when they take her gown off, the baby shivers. In their world, these are the only things that are weaker than they are." (Souza, Alley, Grey and Loomis were all asked if feminist groups might not take exception to such sexual typecasting. None of them seemed concerned. "We haven't had a single comment," Grey says.)
Vulnerability may not be enough. Tyco would like to think of the Quints as a hermetically sealed universe. But this reporter's own extremely limited research found that children seem to find the Quints a somewhat static toy and quickly bring other dolls, such as Barbie, into the play environment to act as mothers or baby sitters.

WHY DOES A TOY like Quints lend itself so readily to endless expansion, licensing, television shows, etc., while other creatures, including popular characters on successful TV shows, do not?
"A lot of these characters aren't really toyetic," Alley answers.
Along with the 11 sets of Quints that will be available in 1991 will come quintuple sets of bunnies, pacifiers, rain ponchos, sun dresses and bonnets. Not to mention the supplementary outfits for five -- visors, toothbrushes, sand shovels, party clothes, earmuffs. And that's just the beginning.
"The Quints can go up in age," Alley points out. "They can have cars and airplanes, anything they like. . . ."
Loomis, who is already thinking about 1993's product mix, refuses to be pinned down on how the line will be extended, but he hints that efforts have been taken to "protect every kind of multiple possible."
Though Loomis has income from royalties on other toys and highly lucrative consulting arrangements all over the place, the Quints make for a big payday. For Loomis and his group, the Quints figure to be worth $1 million this year alone.
In the coming months, there will be more revenues, from the licensing of lunch boxes, children's clothing, sheets, the works. Ericson now spends about 40 percent of her time on the Quints, much of it handling the burgeoning licensing business.
"We are also talking entertainment," says Loomis. Speaking of the possibility of a Quints television program or special, he rhapsodizes: "We might have a TV special where the kids speak a language that adults wouldn't understand. It's not that different from the 'Look Who's Talking' concept, where Bruce Willis plays a baby boy."
Couldn't the Quints simply fade away overnight? Loomis says this rarely happens in the toy business. (But Sean McGowan, the toy-industry analyst, recommends caution in projecting Quints sales as far ahead as 1993.) "If you ask anyone in the business about My Little Pony right now, people would says it's dead," says Loomis. "Yet My Little Pony is still No. 1 among small dolls."
Then, discussing Mattel's absolute refusal to ever pull the plug on Barbie, Loomis declares: "For a product like this, you need a commitment on the part of the company to the idea that the death of the Quints is just not acceptable."
Even if they could be driven to a mausoleum-for-five in a hearse-for-five with five sets of color-coded funeral accessories?

HEADLINE: DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

BYLINE: By James Traub; James Traub, the author of "Too Good to Be True: The Outlandish Story of Wedtech," has been a Giants fan for 30 years.

 BODY:
There came a moment, midway through the second quarter of the New York Giants' game with the San Francisco 49ers earlier this month, that illuminated the extraordinary character of the Giants' defense this year. The score stood at Giants 3, 49ers 0. The 49ers had the ball in their own territory, on second down with 10 yards to go. Quarterback Joe Montana dropped back to pass, and began to retreat almost immediately under pressure from the linebacker Lawrence Taylor and from the blitzing safety Greg Jackson.
Montana, who is famous for his ability to take in the whole of a field like some bird of prey, looked and looked -- and found nothing. The Giants' zone defense had blanketed his receivers, as it would all day. Montana backpedaled, his protection collapsing, and at last, in a gesture of despair, tossed the ball 15 yards from the nearest receiver. It was the third time that Montana had thrown into dead space. He looked rattled. He would stay rattled all game. 
It was not a particularly noticeable play. Lawrence Taylor didn't tear Montana's head off. It was just an incomplete pass. But it was an incomplete pass produced by perfect defense. The Giants finally lost the game, 7-3; but in the course of losing, the defense proved that it was a mechanism every bit as powerful, as precise and as coordinated as the 49ers' offense -- the standard by which offensive squads have been measured for much of the last decade. The Giants' defense may not have the sheer destructive power that it had in the 1986 season, when Taylor and the gang bullied their way to the Super Bowl. This is a different team; but it may be just as good. Through the Giants' victory against Minnesota two Sundays ago that clinched the division title, the defense had given up fewer yards and fewer points than any other team in the National Football League.
"There are a lot of teams that are physical," says John Madden, the CBS television analyst and former head coach, "but the difference with the Giants is that their efficiency level is so high. They play the zone so well, they guard the run so well. I don't think there's any weakness." In regard to teamwork, says Madden, "They're better at it than anyone else I've ever seen."

FOOTBALL THEORY DICTATES THAT TEAMS located in cold, windy regions, where Arctic blasts make the forward pass perilous, concentrate on the ground game and defense. The Giants have honored this principle for so many years that it has the status of a sacred tradition and a spiritual principle. From 1931 to 1960, the team had but two coaches, Steve Owen and Jim Lee Howell, and both compiled tremendous records by playing fundamental football. Owen, in fact, is credited by some football scholars with inventing the 4-3 defense in 1950. (The 4-3 alignment -- with four linemen crouched in a three-point stance, and three linebackers behind them -- then became the standard N.F.L. defense for nearly three decades.) Only, in fact, when the Giants tried to play flashy football, starting in the 1960's, did the team lose its way and wander in the wilderness for 15 years of humiliating incompetence.
After the 1978 season, Wellington and Tim Mara, the club's owners, hired George Young as the general manager. Young had imbibed his football wisdom from a potent source: Don Shula, a certified football genius with whom Young worked first with the Baltimore Colts in the late 60's and early 70's, and then with the Miami Dolphins in the 70's. It was Shula, still the Dolphins' head coach, who more or less invented the 3-4 defense, designed to combat offenses built around the passing game.
In the years prior to Young's arrival, the Giants had lavished first-round draft picks on such football forgettables as Rocky Thompson, Eldridge Small and Francis Peay. Young's first three top selections were Phil Simms, still the Giant quarterback; Mark Haynes, a cornerback who played six seasons for the Giants and became an All-Pro, and Lawrence Taylor, the linebacker generally cited as the most dominating defensive player the game has ever seen. In 1984, Young was criticized for devoting his top pick to another linebacker, Carl Banks, when that was one of the few positions where the team already had gifted players. Banks became an All-Pro, and a prototype of the new breed of outside linebacker necessary to the 3-4 defense -- powerful enough to dominate blockers on running plays, fast enough to stay with pass receivers.
Young, a man of ample girth and owlish mien, is at pains to explain that he has assembled the Giants along sound theoretical lines. One of the core Young principles is, "More Spartanlike teams tend to win championships." Another of his military dictums is, "Mercenaries don't necessarily make the best soldiers." And so it's not by accident that, no matter what their record, the Giants have emphasized defense, toughness, team play and continuity.
Perhaps the most important choice Young made was to hire Bill Parcells as his defensive coordinator in 1981 and to promote him to head coach two years later. Parcells, like Young, is a man of substantial proportions, as well as a tough-minded pragmatist. One of his favorite sayings, often used as a riposte to inquiries from the press, is, "Guys, this is not a complicated game." Actually, it is a complicated game, but Parcells's intensity of focus tends to make everything seem elemental. He does not care to appear complicated, or creative, or even pleasant. "I'll tell you what Bill Parcells is," says Joe Theismann, the former Washington Redskins quarterback. "He's a guy. He's a regular kind of guy. And all he wants to do is win football games."
Parcells is a violent enemy of complacency. A few days before the team was due to play the far weaker Detroit Lions, Parcells was ripping into his defense after a shoddy practice. Didn't they know that the Lions' great running back, Barry Sanders, could score from anywhere on the field? Didn't they recall, he said, reaching for an obscure, if ominous, statistic, that in last year's game the Lions had gained 18 yards for every minute their offense had held the ball? Thus forewarned, the Giants went out and beat the Lions, 20-0.
Parcells's indifference to public opinion sometimes shades into outright hostility, particularly to the press, whose function, as he sees it, is to destroy the sense of team spirit he so carefully nurtures. This can make him difficult to talk to. He did, however, show up one morning in the red-white-and-blue cinder-block bunker that serves as the press room in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., to talk to me about the Giants' defense. "I don't think it's all that good," he said. "The team's fairly mature. Most of them know what they have to do to win. But I'm not convinced of anything." He was, he conceded, pleased at the way the inside linebacker Pepper Johnson had been playing. But he said that he was looking for "more dominance, more consistency, more turnovers."
Trying to dislodge Parcells from his rapt focus on the next game is generally a vain pursuit. "My job," he said, "is to give the players good designs, and try to get 'em to play. That's my job. It's the only job I have. Their job is to pay attention, and to condition themselves to play on Sunday. That's their job."
Parcells, in short, is a Spartan. He believes that defense is more important than offense because -- well, he just believes it. Indeed, the Giants' head coach has defense in his bones. A former linebacker himself at Wichita State University, he spent 15 years bouncing around the college ranks as a defensive coach. In the two years he spent as the Giants' defensive co-ordinator, Parcells was virtually a member of the defensive squad, hanging out with the players in the off-season. "It was like we had a close-knit, impenetrable clan," recalls George Martin, the longtime defensive end who retired in 1988.
"There are times when we're in a tight game," says Carl Banks, "and Bill will come in at halftime and he'll turn to the offense and say: 'Offense, we've got to move the ball. Offense, we've got to execute a little better.' And then he starts with the defense, and it's almost like a change of personality. 'Defense, we need two turnovers. We need one for a touchdown. We need to get a sack. We got to make them punt into the wind.' And then he'll send us out there. I don't know if a lot of players on other teams would keep in mind what he says. But he has us in such a trance that when we walk out on the field, we'll get one turnover and come over to the sidelines and say, 'O.K., the next one's got to be for a touchdown.' "

If, on the level of character and culture, the Giants' defense has its Spartan spirit, on the level of strategy and deployment, it has a proficiency that comes with slow, patient growth. Young, Parcells and Bill Belichick, the current defensive coordinator, have now had a full decade together -- an amazing span, in football terms -- to adapt the personnel and the system to one another. "The whole thing has to be integrated from top to bottom or it's a mess." says Belichick. "If you get guys who can't play your system, then you can either play the system even though they're not very good at it, or you change the system to fit the players." In either case you've got a mess.
The Giants like to say that they play "plain vanilla" defense, as opposed to what the linebacker coach, Al Groh, calls "the tricks and gimmicks philosophy." But that's just the way Spartans talk. The defense isn't simple; it's rational.
Begin with the linebackers. The 3-4 alignment, now played by the majority of N.F.L. teams, places the linebackers at the fulcrum of the defense, and the Giants' current starters -- Taylor and Banks, Pepper Johnson and either Gary Reasons or Steve DeOssie -- are arguably the finest corps in the game. Linebackers on the Giants have to be big enough to take on the block of an offensive guard but also fast enough, at least if they play on the outside, to stay with a receiver. The Giants will not recruit a small, swift outside linebacker, though they have made a place for Steve DeOssie on the inside. DeOssie, a former Dallas Cowboy, was considered too slow to play middle linebacker in the Cowboys' 4-3 alignment, but in the Giants' 3-4 he plays against the run; on passing downs, he goes out in favor of the more agile Reasons. DeOssie is a perfect instance of the Giants' flair for filling round holes with round pegs.
Taylor, as a linebacker, has virtually mutuated into a stand-up defensive end, a role now played by the most versatile linebackers on all teams that employ a 3-4 defense. With his combination of speed, strength and ferocity, he is able to overwhelm pass blockers; from his standing position he also reads the development of a play and pursues it as no down lineman can. Last year, the Giants found that Pepper Johnson had some of the same talents; Johnson now sometimes rushes the passer from the weak side (away from the opponents' tight end) while Taylor charges from the strong side, an instance of the scheme of adapting to a player.
The Giants' down linemen, like the linebackers, are purpose-built. George Martin, who played defensive end at about 240 pounds, would no longer fit on the defensive line. In the Giants' "two gap" defense, in which the three down linemen are positioned nose to nose with the offensive center and two tackles, with responsibility for the gaps on either side, the linemen are expected to stand up their opponents on running plays -- clogging up the running lanes and occupying blockers so that the linebackers are free to make tackles. It is a job that requires size on an alpine scale. The starting linemen -- Eric Dorsey, Erik Howard and John Washington -- average 6 feet 4 inches, 275 pounds, and their mighty exertions have held opposing teams to an average of 85 yards a game on the ground. The pass rush has produced relatively few quarterback sacks, but wise heads in the N.F.L. insist that hurrying the passer matters almost as much as sacking him. In three notable cases -- against Dan Marino of the Dolphins, Jim Everett of the Rams and Joe Montana -- the line hurried a gifted quarterback into a gamelong state of near futility.
The Giants' pass rush may be a trifle less ferocious than it was in 1986, when, as the defensive end Leonard Marshall (who replaces John Washington in passing situations) says with a contented smile, "We put quite a few quarterbacks out," but the secondary has made up the difference. Last year, Myron Guyton, then the rookie strong safety, led the team in tackles. This year, Guyton says he has finally mastered the Giants' zone coverage, and he and the second-year safety Greg Jackson have gained an intuitive sense of one another's whereabouts.
During the off-season, the Giants acquired Dave Duerson, an experienced safety formerly with the Chicago Bears, and Everson Walls, a veteran cornerback. Walls is another round peg. Released by the Cowboys, he was, at 30, thought to be growing a bit old and slow for man-to-man coverage. In the zone, however, where a player covers a certain area of the field rather than a player, sheer speed matters less than the ability to sense a play's unfolding. Walls, who intercepted 44 passes with the Cowboys, clearly has this gift. When I asked him how he knows where a pass pattern is heading, Walls said, "You just sort of float into the play." (As the linebacker coach Al Groh points out, players with "football intelligence" are often better at perceiving than explaining.) Walls now leads the Giants in interceptions.
Like the Chicago Bears and the Philadelphia Eagles, the Giants are known as a hard-hitting team with a hard-hitting secondary, but unlike those teams they don't often use the straight man-to-man pass coverage that is associated with in-your-face football. The Giants play a zone, which for all the talk about plain vanilla, is a complex piece of clockwork. Sometimes the Giants will play a zone deep and man-to-man underneath, or a zone on one half of the field and man-to-man on the other. In these variations, the defensive backs often line up as if they were playing a basic zone -- with two safeties deep and the cornerbacks underneath -- thus misleading the opposing quarterback. Carl Banks says he delights in the fact that he learns a few new wrinkles every year, as the coaches conclude that the players' abilities have grown.
As a whole, this is a defense that makes so few mistakes that the miscues can be counted. Until Game 11, when the Philadelphia Eagles made the defense look mortal for the first time in a 31-13 trouncing, the Giants had yielded no gain longer than 34 yards. On two separate occasions, the Eagles' quarterback, Randall Cunningham, found Keith Byars, a receiver, all by himself along the sidelines; Byars gained 54 yards the first time, and 20 the next. Cunningham also completed a 49-yard touchdown pass. But when I spoke to Bill Belichick several days after the game, he was clearly more upset about the open man than the long pass, which he viewed simply as the law of averages catching up with his club.
Belichick is an intensely studious man with a degree in economics; still, asked what went wrong, he took the hallowed route of inarticulateness. "We had a breakdown," he mumbled.
Belichick's own fascination with football diagnostics, however, got the better of him, and by and by he was scribbling hieroglyphics in my notebook. His point, so far as I could grasp it, was that on both plays the Giants had gone to man-to-man coverage. Even in man-to-man, Belichick explained, two defenders will take either of two receivers depending on the routes the receivers run. In each case, someone had made the wrong choice about which receiver to follow, though Belichick declined to point the finger at the guilty party.
Belichick also wished me to understand that just because the machine had coughed, it didn't mean it was broken. Whatever changes would be made for the 49ers' game would have to do with the 49ers, not the Eagles.
The Giants lost to the 49ers, of course, but the defense won the battle. The inside linebackers and Erik Howard, the nose tackle, bottled up the middle against the run. The secondary took away the long and even intermediate pass, and almost shut out the great receiver Jerry Rice, who caught only one pass for 13 yards. Joe Montana managed one perfect pass, to a sliding receiver, John Taylor, inches beyond the reach of a diving cornerback, Mark Collins, and that was the touchdown that won the game.

ON THE WEDNESDAY before the Sunday game against the Detroit Lions, I found Bill Belichick pedaling away furiously on an exercycle in a darkened room. I asked Belichick, a trim, lantern-jawed, weathered-looking veteran of 38, if he always performed his regimen under cover of night. "No," he said, "I was watching films of last year's game." After I promised the coach that I would not reveal troop movements prior to battle, he slapped the cassette back in the recorder.
The Lions play a formation called the run-and-shoot, a wide-open offensive strategy that has gained a certain vogue in the N.F.L. On virtually every play they use four wide receivers, no tight end and only one running back. It's a little bit like playground football -- the spiritual opposite of how the Giants play -- but the Lions have run up points and yards, if not victories. In the game Belichick was watching on film, Detroit had gained more than 400 yards while losing to the Giants, 24-14. The Giants hadn't seen a run-and-shoot team during the regular season since then, and during practice that day the offense had had trouble simulating the alignment, and the defense had had trouble guarding against it.
On the screen Belichick ran a series of plays in which the four Lions' wide receivers outraced the Giants' linebackers to make receptions in front of the secondary. The receivers, said Belichick, had been faster than the Giants had anticipated. The logical response would be to insert a fifth defensive back in place of a linebacker, known as a nickel formation, or even a sixth, which the Giants call a dime. But the danger of overloading the defense to protect against the pass is that the Lions will then hand the ball off to Barry Sanders.
Underneath these tactical matters was a psychological consideration that the Giants take very seriously. "You might want to say, 'Look, here's our base defense, we can play it against anything. You're not going to chase us out of something we've been practicing since the first day of the season,' " Belichick says. On the other hand, he continues, you can't be stubborn. "It's going to depend on how the game is going. We've got to be prepared to go both ways."
Giving good designs, as Bill Parcells calls it, is a large part of pro football. So much time falls between games that coaches and players can prepare for every eventuality. What is an opponent likely to do in this formation? With this player in motion? On this down, on this part of the field? By Sunday a player must be ready to react instinctively. The coaches must decide what alignment they want to open with and what adjustments they must be ready to make. They have to decide, as Belichick said, how much they are willing to let the opponent dictate their strategy. Last year the Giants had come out in their base defense, the 3-4, and then had shifted to the nickel package after getting burned on short passes. This time around, Belichick decided to prepare the defense to play the 3-4, the nickel and the dime. (Box, page 24.)

GAME DAY, NOV. 18, WAS Giants' weather -- 41 degrees, wind at 22 miles per hour. I recalled another George Young maxim: Teams that play in domed stadiums, like Detroit, have trouble playing outside. I also recalled one of Bill Parcells's rare aphorisms: "Defense travels." Translation: Offense suffers from weather, crowd noise, and other contingencies; defense does not.
By the time the Lions got their hands on the ball, the Giants had driven 76 yards for a touchdown, lending support to a contention heard around the league: The Giants' defense has gotten better because the offense is putting the other guy behind the eight ball. The Giants came out in their nickel defense. Erik Howard, a nose tackle, and Leonard Marshall, a pass-rush specialist, were joined on the line by Taylor and Lawrence McGrew, who was filling in for the injured Banks. Parcells and Belichick had decided, in effect, to go with their third-down defense on first down. After making a first down, the Lions went to third-and-5. At this point the Giants shifted to the dime, sending Duerson in for McGrew. Bob Gagliano, the quarterback, completed a pass, but Duerson made the tackle short of a first down.
The pattern stayed the same. By the time the Lions saw the ball again it was four minutes into the second quarter, and the Giants were winning, 10-0. Gagliano threw to his wide receivers, completing four in a row, though none of them for long yardage. After the fourth pass, on third-and-1, Belichick, expecting the run, brought in the 3-4 for the first time. In came the defensive ends Eric Dorsey and John Washington, the inside linebackers Steve DeOssie and Johnie Cooks. Sanders ran left, and Dorsey threw him for a one-yard loss.
On the Lions next possession, the Giants came out in the dime, with Duerson in place of McGrew, Belichick having concluded that the Lions would have to pass, and for much of the rest of the game he would stay with this 2-3-6 alignment. On the first play of the drive, Sanders ran up the middle for 15 yards, a perfect instance of what the run-and-shoot can do if the defense overcompensates. But when the Lions tried the same play again, the Giants plugged up the middle and Sanders was dropped for a loss. Two plays later, the Lions punted, and two plays after that Phil Simms found the wide receiver Mark Ingram for a 57-yard touchdown. The game was effectively over after three possessions. When the gun sounded, the Giants had their first shutout of the season.
After the game the Giants were not exactly jubilant; they were very pleased. The players stood in front of their lockers -- dressed, by the way -- and savored a professional performance. Pepper Johnson, a very sunny young wrecking ball, said the coach had apologized to the defensive players for abusing them earlier in the week.
"We studied well," said Everson Walls, when someone asked him why the Giants won so handily.
Several times I wandered over to Gary Reasons's locker. The aptly named Reasons is one of the Giants' most reflective players, and when I first walked over he was talking about how the Giants hadn't had "enough history" on the Lions last year to know how to react; this time around, he said, there had been no indecision. The zone had been tight because they secondary had matched up with the receivers at the line of scrimmage rather than waiting for a route to cross their zone. It had been interesting, he said. "When you play against an offense like this that's very different, it lightens the atmosphere, so to speak; it's a challenge," he said.
Later on, as the locker room was emptying of both players and the press, I paid another visit to Reasons, who was still sitting and expounding. What did Parcells say at half time? I asked.
" 'We got 30 more minutes! Anything can happen! This team is explosive!' " Reason mimicked in a near falsetto. "Really," added Reasons, "he just said: 'Stay focused. You know what to do.' "
The defense, I said, had looked flawless. Reasons pondered the compliment for a moment.
"I wouldn't say that," he replied. "There's always something that can be improved."
 
 
 
WHAT THE DEFENSE SEES
 The Giants' basic defense, the 3-4 (Diagram A), is an alignment that employs three "down" linemen - John Washington, Erik Howard and Eric Dorsey - stationed opposite the offensive center and the offensive tackles; two inside linebackers - Steve DeOssie or Gary Reasons and Pepper Johnson - who fill the gaps between linemen on running plays and play zone coverage against the short pass; two outside linebackers - Lawrence Taylor and Carl Banks - who not only play the run and the pass, but also blitz the quarterback; and a secondary comprising two cornerbacks - Everson Walls and Mark Collins - and two safeties - Myron Guyton and Greg Jackson - whose prime responsibility is pass coverage, though they must also be able to "read" and stop a running play.
Of course, defenses are now so flexible that a team on the field may look very different from the way it does on the blackboard. In the Giants' case, Taylor, and occasionally Johnson, may station themselves on the line of scrimmage, giving them the option to rush the passer.
The secondary is lined up in a "two deep" formation, which the Giants use more than any other team. The advantage of going with two, rather than three, players in the deep zone is that it frees one cornerback to fill the area that is vacated when a linebacker rushes the passer. The two-deep zone, in effect, provides insurance for Taylor's ferocious blitzes. It also means, however, that the Giants must often do with single coverage on long pass routes.
Diagram B shows the offense in a run-and-shoot formation, with four wide receivers, and the Giants in a "nickel" defense, with a fifth defensive back. In obvious pass situations like this, the Giants often replace Washington with Leonard Marshall, a better pass rusher; they also sometimes remove the other defensive end, Dorsey, and place two outside linebackers - Taylor and Johnson - on the line of scrimmage. This makes the defense more vulnerable to a power running attack, but more effective against a deceptive maneuver like the screen pass; a linebacker is not only faster than a lineman, but playing in a stand-up position gives him a better chance of seeing the blocking pattern for the screen develop than a lineman.
The nickel defense is designed to put more speed on the field to cover the passing zones. A linebacker steps into the position normally occupied by a defensive end, and a fifth defensive back, generally the cornerback Perry Williams, occupies the linebacker's spot. (In the "dime," an inside linebacker is replaced by a sixth defensive back, normally Dave Duerson.) In both of the "sub" defenses and the basic 3-4, the Giants may resort to a three-deep secondary. -- JAMES TRAUB

Out of Africa

BYLINE: BY ERIC V. COPAGE; Eric V. Copage is an editor of this magazine.

 BODY:
I was never a holiday kind of guy. Perhaps it was because I grew up in the seasonless sprawl of Los Angeles, or because my family was not particularly religious. Perhaps it was that we observed few holiday rituals. Although we put up a Christmas tree every year (an aluminum one for several seasons, I'm embarrassed to say), there was no ceremony to it -- no drinking of eggnog or listening to Christmas carols while hanging the ornaments. To me the tree seemed more or less like another piece of furniture. Over the past two years, however, the holiday season has taken on a new meaning as my family sits at the dinner table the week following Christmas to celebrate Kwanzaa.
Kwanzaa, created 24 years ago by Maulana (Ron) Karenga, chairman of black studies at California State University in Long Beach, is a cultural observance for black Americans and others of African descent. The name means "first fruits of the harvest" in Swahili. There is no festival of that name in any African society, but, to emphasize that black Americans come from many parts of Africa, Karenga synthesized elements from many African harvest festivals to create a unique, American celebration. 
 When I first told my wife I was thinking about observing the holiday, she barricaded the closet door and said she'd never chuck our Christmas tree lights and antique ornaments. I told her that wouldn't be necessary. Kwanzaa, which runs from Dec. 26 to New Year's Day, does not replace Christmas and is not a religious holiday. It is a time to focus on Africa and African-inspired culture.
I came to Kwanzaa by accident. Late December a few years back, I was visiting the American Museum of Natural History when I heard the sibilant sound of African rattles. It came from a dance performance that was part of the Kwanzaa celebration that has been held at the museum since 1978. The holiday didn't make much of an impression on me then, but I turned to it after the birth of my son, Evan, three and a half years ago. I wanted him to have a joyous, nonoppressive sense of his black heritage; I wanted him to have a celebratory African-American holiday with memories he'd be able to savor as an adult.
When my family lights the black, red and green Kwanzaa candles this week, we will do so with more than five million black Americans around the nation who celebrate Kwanzaa to varying degrees. Some adhere strictly to the program as Karenga conceived it. Their observances incorporate the seven Kwanzaa symbols. Fruits and vegetables, for instance, stand for the product of unified effort, a straw place mat for reverence for tradition and an ear of corn symbolizes each child in the family. The other symbols are simple gifts; a communal cup for the libation (I like to look at this latter bit as a kind of homage to past, present and future black Americans); a seven-branched candleholder and the seven candles.
Each candle symbolizes the seven principles black Americans should live by. A family member lights a candle on each day of Kwanzaa, then discusses one of those seven principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith. The idea is that during Kwanzaa, families share simple dinners and exchange gifts with a black theme -- an album of South African music, for example, or a book by Toni Morrison. The last day of the holiday is marked by a lavish feast, which, in keeping with the theme of black unity, may draw on the cuisines of the Caribbean, Africa, South America . . . wherever Africans were taken.
My family, along with many others, takes an a la carte approach to the holiday. I paraphrase excerpts from biographies of black men and women or black folk tales, myths and historical events that illustrate the seven principles. We omit the communal cup and the candleholder on the dinner table, preferring to use free-standing candles instead.
And then there is the dinner. Since my wife does the heavy Christmas cooking, the challenge of orchestrating the Kwanzaa meal is in my hands.
This is not easy stuff. When I was growing up, meals in our household tended to be haphazard affairs, and the holiday season was no exception. We'd either improvise meals for ourselves -- baked chicken or a steak would be as likely as anything -- or leapfrog to the homes of friends and relatives for more traditional turkey and cranberry sauce. My father, brother and I would politely compliment our host, but the real reason for the visit was the bonhomie, independent of the food.
In adapting Kwanzaa into our life, I decided we'd have one Kwanzaa meal in the middle of the weeklong holiday. The first meal comprised dishes that brought forth sweet memories of my youth. I remembered helping my grandmother make collard greens, especially the arduous task of washing dirt from the leaves (and getting bawled out if someone got a gritty mouthful during dinner), and I remembered sorting and discarding the bad black-eyed peas for the Hoppin' John she cooked. I remembered visiting West Africa when I was 18 years old and tasting the spicy tingle of peanut soup for the first time. And, of course, there was a lifetime of cornbread.
This year, I decided to ask for help. Dee Watts-Jones, a clinical psychologist, has cooked groundnut stew for the 16 years she has celebrated Kwanzaa. The stew, made with chicken, peanut butter and tomato paste, inspired me to search for a new recipe for the dish's first cousin, peanut soup. The latter was my initiation to African food, and was so highly spiced in that first encounter that when I tried it I broke into a sweat.
Since then, I have tried several peanut soup recipes, one of which includes ribs as well as the usual chicken, and another from a 1953 cookbook that calls for "a cigarette tin" of roasted peanuts. The recipe I have included here doesn't employ such arcane measuring devices, and is just spicy enough without searing the palate.
A Brazilian dish of red snapper, green peppers and onions came to me from Avis Johnson-Piper, owner of Army & Lou's Restaurant in Chicago. "I picked up this recipe when I was traveling in Bahia, the most African part of Brazil," Johnson-Piper says. Callie Crossley, a producer at the television news program "20/20," gave me the holiday punch recipe of her mother, Mattie. And Norma Jean and Carole Darden, caterers and the authors of "Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine," offered what I ultimately decided would be the main dish for this year's Kwanzaa meal. They call it Babatunde's African Stew, after a Nigerian friend who gave them the recipe, which makes a delicious, subtly spicy stew of chicken, onions, carrots, spinach and green pepper. I had eaten a similar dish years ago in Liberia, the difference being that in the remote village where I was staying, I had to catch my own chicken.
Anyway, after deciding on the stew as a main dish, I decided to give it a preholiday trial run one Saturday last month. By six that evening, my house was fragrant with the scent of the meal. As I put the stew before Evan, I was full not only of cultural pride, but also of the feeling of accomplishment of having cooked the dish without having burned it. However, before even taking a bite, Evan poured a puddle of ketchup on his plate, pulled the chicken from the spinach and immersed the bird in the puddle. So much for fundamentalist Afro-centrism. I guess he's not yet ready for the hard-core, traditional fare. Maybe next year.
 
AVIS JOHNSON-PIPER'S RED FISH
 
 6 yams, unpeeled and quartered
 2 to 3 tablespoons brown sugar
 7 large carrots, peeled and sliced
 1 tablespoon peanut oil
 1 medium onion, sliced thin
 2 large green peppers, seeded, deveined and sliced into 1/4-inch strips
 1 1/2 to 2 pounds red snapper filets (see note)
 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill
 1/2 cup thinly sliced white onion
 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
 1 clove garlic, minced
 1 1/2 teaspoons hot paprika
 4 large Boston lettuce leaves, washed and patted dry
 4 tomatoes, quartered.
 1. Using a steamer and a large saucepan, steam the yams over simmering water for 15 to 20 minutes, or until just soft. Remove and sprinkle with brown sugar. Set aside in a warm place. Meanwhile, steam the carrots in another saucepan for about 12 minutes or until just soft. Remove and set aside in a warm place.
2. In a large skillet, heat the peanut oil. Saute the onion and sliced green pepper for 2 to 3 minutes, until the onion is just soft and the pepper is bright green but still crisp. Set aside in a warm place.
3. Meanwhile, rinse the fish under cold running water and gently pat dry. Fill a large pan with water to a depth of 1 inch. Place the fish on a steaming rack, place in the pan and sprinkle with the fresh dill. Strew the 1/2 cup sliced onion around the fish, and sprinkle with theground pepper, garlic and paprika. Steam the fish over simmering water for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and cooked through.
4. Line a serving platter with the lettuce leaves. When the snapper is done, remove to the serving platter. Surround with the cooked vegetables and garnish with the tomatoes.
Yield: Four to six servings.
Note: Avis Johnson-Piper's recipe calls for a whole red snapper, which has definite visual appeal. However, I've substituted red snapper filets, which I find easier to eat.

Brut Force

BYLINE: BY FRANK J. PRIAL

 BODY:
JACK AND JAMIE Davies run Schramsberg Vineyards in the Napa Valley. They may make the best sparkling wine in California; they may be the prototypical let's-kick-this-affluent-but-empty-L. A.-life couple, and they may have their own little niche in history thanks to Zhou Enlai. But let James Conaway describe them in his book "Napa":
"He of the quizzical smile, she of the pale green, catlike eyes." And again: "Jamie, 30, wore her blond hair short. The breadth of her smile left people with the impression that they were talking to a taller person." 
 Conaway fell in love with the Davieses. They provide the opening leitmotif for his book because they were among the first of a new breed of wine makers in America. They were not farmers. Jack was a businessman educated at Harvard and Stanford; Jamie was a painter who'd grown up in affluent Pasadena. It was 1965, and the Davieses had embarked on the quintessential American 1960's quest for relevance, for challenge, for commitment. They found what they sought in a battered old winery. It came with a house (even more battered), some tired old vineyards and a few imposing caves that had once been used to keep aging wine cool. Backed by a group of partners, the Davieses crossed their fingers and bought the place.
The property had once been owned by a barber from San Francisco, named Jacob Schramm, who gave up his scissors to become a vintner. He built the old house and hired Chinese laborers to dig his caves. He called the place Schramsberg and, in the correct German style, called the wine Schramsberger. (Once he entertained Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote admiringly about the place and the wine.)
But Jack Davies didn't want to make ordinary wine; he wanted to make Champagne. Sparkling wine was not new in Napa Valley, but sparkling wine made using the traditional painstaking techniques of the Champagne district in France was. And that's what the Davieses proposed to do.
Using the methode champenoise would mean handling each bottle individually -- adding sugar and yeast to still wine to induce a second fermentation, aging it, then removing the dead yeast cells before laying the bottles away for further aging. It would be all handwork at first, expensive and time-consuming, and some older hands in the valley advised against it. But Robert Mondavi, then still with his family at the Charles Krug Winery, was encouraging. He even sold Jack 500 gallons of chardonnay to make the first run of Schramsberg sparkling wine, the 1965 Blanc de Blancs.
The wine was good from the start, and soon had a solid, if limited, reputation. That changed in 1972, when Richard Nixon brought 13 cases of Schramsberg with him on his epochal journey to China and used it to toast Prime Minister Zhou Enlai. There must be 75 wineries producing methode champenoise sparkling wine in California now, but none, even the huge subsidiaries of the French Champagne houses, has ever dimmed Schramsberg's reputation.
Shramsberg makes five sparkling wines, all but one finished as brut. Brut is actually a technical term meaning extremely dry -- in other words, no sweetness at all. The four are Blanc de Blancs, made almost entirely from chardonnay grapes with a touch of pinot blanc; Blanc de Noirs, made mostly from pinot noir with some chardonnay; Reserve, which is also mostly pinot noir and is aged four years in the bottle, and Cuvee de Pinot, which is a rose made from pinot noir with a touch of gamay. The fifth wine is Cremant, a slightly sweeter, gentler wine with about half the natural effervescence of the others. It is made from the Flora grape, a variety developed at the University of California at Davis from, of all things, gewurztraminer and semillon grapes.
California wine makers thrive on challenge. Once, they were told they would never produce a good chardonnay. They did it. They were told they could never make a first-rate pinot noir. They did it. And they were told they could never match Champagne. Most producers still do not and probably never will, but a handful regularly do, and Schramsberg is one of them.
Stylistically, Schramsberg wines are fuller and richer than some of its serious competitors, inviting comparison with Champagne makers like Bollinger and Krug in France. For Bob Thompson, a wine writer, "Schramsberg is the wine for winter, when the fireplace is lighted and a hearty meal is coming, and the weather invites sober reflection on what might be in the glass to warm one's soul."
Slowly but surely, California wine makers have weaned themselves from the old European names. They no longer feel obliged to call a jug wine made from grenache and carignane "burgundy." In the same vein, most top sparkling wine producers avoid the use of the name Champagne -- but not the Davieses. They interpret Champagne as a generic term, and they use it freely on all their bottles.
Well, not quite all. They are actively seeking customers in Europe now, and European Economic Community rules say Champagne, upper case "C," is a wine that can be made only in Champagne. If it's not, then it's champagne, lower case "c."
Does it really matter? Probably not. As Bob Thompson once put it, "Can only a Cuban make a Cuban heel?"

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
Operating in the Gap Between Art and Not Art

BYLINE: By Roberta Smith

 BODY:
The art world has no shortage of heated debates these days, and one whose temperature is rising concerns the definition of American art.
 Last summer's "Decade" exhibition, organized by three New York City museums, broadened the vision of American art of the 1980's to include high percentages of art by women, Hispanic and black artists. 
 From another direction there is an effort to bring folk art, long one of the most vital strains of American visual culture, more concretely into the mainstream. An exhibition planned for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1992, with the working title "Parallel Visions: Modern Artists and Outsider Art" will tackle this subject by examining the way 20th-century artists in both America and Europe have been affected by the work of untrained artists.
 At the moment, the National Museum of American Art, in Washington, is jumping feet first into this debate with its exhibition "Made With Passion: The Hemphill Collection in the National Museum of American Art" (through Jan. 21). The exhibition, organized by Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, an associate curator at the museum, fills the enormous third-floor gallery with a cacophonous, pulsating melange of form, material and artistic expression -- folk art in every possible medium and at every level of refinement, from every period and every region.
 The show's 199 objects start with early 19th-century portraits and mourning pictures and sweep through American culture, right into the present. They cut across all ethnic and economic lines, and include work by American Indians and Eskimos, Hispanics, Southern blacks and whites, Midwestern eccentrics, residents of mental institutions. Included in its broad reach are paintings and drawings, shop signs and handmade gates, carved canes and painted furniture, larger-than-life tin figures and an unusually impressive pair of carved wood cigar-store Indians. Twenty-one of the artists represented are still alive.
The objects on view are among the 427 works that the National Museum has acquired, partly as a gift, partly as a purchase, from Herbert Wade Hemphill Jr. Mr. Hemp hill, 61, has been collecting for more than 30 years, and is perhaps the most influential postwar collector of American folk art.
 The National Museum is no stranger to folk art; it owns some 200 pre-Hemphill-Collection objects, including James Hampton's aluminum-foil, chapel-sized altar, "Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly," acquired nearly 20 years ago and on permanent display near the main entrance. Nor does the addition of the Hemphill Collection make much of a numerical dent in the museum's larger total of 35,000 objects.
 But the Hemphill addition symbolizes an important change of direction that should not be underestimated and that few other museums of American art have yet been willing to make. (The one exception is the Milwaukee Art Museum, which last spring acquired the 273-piece collection of Mr. and Mrs. Michael Hall, close friends of Mr. Hemphill's, which it will exhibit sometime in 1993.)
Simply comparing the catalogue for the Hemphill show with the 1985 catalogue of selections from the museum's permanent collection vividly illustrates the difference between American art as it has traditionally been defined and as it may come to be defined. The 1985 catalogue is dominated by skillfully rendered landscapes and portraits by such names as Cole, Catlin and Bierstadt. The Hemphill catalogue is full of energetic, awkwardly made work, mostly by artists whose names are unknown.
 Elizabeth Broun, director of the National Museum, thinks it is time for general-purpose museums, not only specialized museums of folk art, to "take into account the huge number of people who have had the urge toward visual expression and more or less made up the way they did it." She sees the Hemphill show and collection as the beginning of a concerted program to give the history of American art a completely new outline by treating the work of indigenous, untrained artists just as seriously as the work of artists trained according to largely European standards, in terms of acquisition, display, research and education programs.
 "Made with passion" may describe the show's best objects, but the phrase also sums up the formation of the collection itself. Possessed of an ecumenical and rather daring taste, Mr. Hemphill has collected folk art with something like a vengeance since 1956. The collector's Manhattan brownstone, crammed wall to wall and floor to ceiling with objects, has for years been a major mecca for folk art aficionados. Mr. Hemphill is often regarded as a visionary collector of visionary art, a man whom a friend described as having a "360-degree eye."
 His unusual accumulation, which still numbers more than 2,000 objects and continues to grow, has been praised for broadening the definition of folk art, moving beyond the tendency to see it primarily as a proto-modern phenomenon that presaged or influenced "regular" artists or, even more purely, to limit folk art to objects made mostly in New England before 1900. But the Hemphill Collection has also been criticized for its unwieldy, almost senseless breadth and unevenness of quality. Walking into this exhibition, it is entirely possible to understand both points of view.
 The historical revision that this exhibition marks is hardly seamlessly smooth or wholly successful, nor is it even easy to look at. In its sheer overcrowding the installation communicates some of the urgency that often motivates folk art. It also captures the tone of the teeming interiors and exteriors that many folk artists create for themselves. But it doesn't necessarily foster the best viewing conditions, or make the best case for folk art's historical importance.
 The boundlessness of Mr. Hemp hill's vision, his disregard for any kind of definition or hierarchy is everywhere apparent and at times a little bewildering. The show includes many traditional folk art items, like the stiffly dignified portrait of a woman named Huldy Martin painted in 1826 by a New England limner named Frederick Mayhew, and examples of mourning pictures (the small idyllic graveside images made to commemorate the death of a loved one), along with quilts and decoys. These objects, often tenderly made, can spring out at the visitor like familiar anchors in a storm.
 And, indeed, the eye is often buffeted from one unexpected and unsettling thing to another. Among the most garish items are several related to the circus, including a waxworks-like head of an Indian in a box and a carnival banner featuring a tattooed lady who looks like Jane Russell. Many of the most recent works, dating from the 1970's and 80's, do not always convince the viewer that folk art can extend infinitely into the future. In addition, Mr. Hemphill's eye for three-dimensional objects -- especially toys, whirligigs and other carved or constructed figures -- seems noticeably stronger than his eye for painting.
 Not everything on view deserves to be in a museum; at times the show has the feeling of an anthropological display or what museum professionals call a study collection, rather than a carefully culled group of works of the best possible quality. As Ms. Broun willingly acknowledges, the show raises many more questions than it answers.
 "We have a long way to go before we really understand the basis on which we make distinctions between fine and folk art," she says. "I think there may be a distinction, but it's not clear to us yet how we are separating the two." But within the show's extraordinary range are some powerful objects, and their interactions pinpoint many timely issues.
 In a sense this exhibition is an esthetic battlefield in which the various qualities attributed to folk art and, by extension, all art are vociferously argued. High art versus low art, or kitsch, or craft? Major versus minor? Skillful finish or mastery of form versus intuitively slapped-together crudeness? Every point of view finds a voice here.
 On the issue of refinement, for example, consider several intricately carved canes that are among the show's high points, especially one covered with figures and animals and on which each little stub, instead of being whittled smooth, has been carved into an animal's head.
For so-called crudeness at its best, turn to "Man on a Hog," part of a mechanical tableau built by a Connecticut farmer named Clark Coe for his grandchildren in the 1890's. Carved and carpentered from several pieces of wood and dabbed with paint, it is one of several figures in the exhibition whose initial awkwardness gradually yields rewarding subtleties of both form and spirit.
A similar change occurs with Harold Garrison's "Water Gate or Government Machine No. 3" from 1974. Perhaps best described as a tableau on a stick, this amalgam of carved figures and written commentary recount the details of the Watergate saga.
 Some paintings and sculptures speak of autonomous, fully developed visions that seem original or major by any standards -- for example, the drifting, floating Madonna with a Statue of Liberty crown made in the late 1950's by Martin Ramirez, an uneducated Mexican laborer who spent most of his life in a California state mental hospital. While Ramirez left a large body of work -- some 200 drawings were preserved by one of his doctors and discovered in Sacramento in 1970 by the Chicago Imagist painter Jim Nutt -- many artists are less fortunate.
 The only known surviving work by Alice Eugenia Ligon is a muslin hospital gown densely embroidered with images and messages, made as a Christmas present for her children while she was a patient at a Missouri mental institution. It is one of several works on view that vigorously transcend the line between art and craft.
 It is no wonder that a 1978 portrait of Herbert Wade Hemphill by the Rev. Howard Finster identifies him as the "man who preserves the lone and forgotten." To walk through this exhibition is to grasp with full force both the resilience of the human impulse to create, however eccentrically or sporadically, and the frailty of these creations -- how easily they can be lost, passed over by time, and erased. Finally, in its astounding and sometimes confusing diversity, the Hemphill Collection challenges its visitors to embrace a freedom similar to that taken by the artists themselves, and that is the independent, unrestricted exercise of their individual tastes and preferences.

HEADLINE: FILM VIEW;
You Can't Make Book On Movies

BYLINE: By Janet Maslin

 BODY:
We have the good luck now to be inundated with films adapted from serious works of fiction (a big improvement over those that originate as two-sentence story ideas very late at night). However, this luck has its limits. Not every lean, minor noir novel becomes a diamond-hard classic on the order of "The Grifters." Not every tragedy of manners takes on the verve and delicacy of "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge." Some books, most notably Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities," can fall prey to the directorial equivalent of hit-and-run driving.
Brian De Palma's enthusiastic mauling of Mr. Wolfe's keenly observed book is only the latest reminder, although quite a pungent one, of how far afield a film adaptation can go. With a screenplay by Michael Cristofer, who blithely gutted and rearranged John Updike's "Witches of Eastwick" with similar abandon, this "Bonfire of the Vanities" unabashedly jettisons much of Mr. Wolfe's story and just about all of his style. "You are cheap and rotten and a liar, and you are dripping on my Aubusson carpet!" cries the irate wife of Mr. Wolfe's hero, thus offering some measure of the film's flair for social satire. 
 Indeed, by the standards of anyone who imagines that a film adaptation owes at least some small debt to it source material, this "Bonfire of the Vanities" could serve as a dictionary definition of "author's nightmare." (Mr. Wolfe has somehow managed to remain mum about this. But if he ever feels inclined to look at movie making with the same sharp eye he cast upon Sherman McCoy, this novel's Park Avenue paragon, he will doubtless have a lot to work with.) Mr. De Palma's film is as coarse, broad and casually irreverent as its narrator, the drunken tabloid journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis), who grabs and throws a handful of salmon in his opening scene.
When a book is as freely mangled as this one has been, even the elements that are left unchanged take on different import. Mr. Wolfe's abundant thoughts on the social, cultural and racial differences separating New York City's many strata have necessarily been narrowed down, but so has everything else about this story; as a result, the slurs and ster eotypes are much more glaring here than they were on the page. Scatological gags, of which Mr. De Palma seems especially fond, also leap out with disproportionate emphasis.
And the cynicism of this story, in which a wealthy white bond trader (surprisingly well played by Tom Hanks, though he seemed from afar to have been grievously miscast) strays into the South Bronx in his Mercedes and becomes involved in a hit-and-run accident that injures a young black man, has been made to seem much greater. In part, this is a result of the film makers' own sloppiness. No pious speech about decency and racial harmony, like the regrettable one foisted upon Morgan Freeman (playing a judge) in the film's closing courtroom scene, can make up for the film's carelessness. It never quite remembers to tell its audience whether the accident victim lives or dies.
If these sound like fatal flaws, they may well be for anyone expecting to see Mr. Wolfe's book gracefully transferred to the screen. However, Mr. De Palma's brazenly comedic approach does deserve a little credit. As with the equally hair-raising "Witches of Eastwick," this is a literary adaptation tailored to the tastes of a sub-literate audience, a version that aims low but does sometimes hit its mark. At least, in reducing a novel of nearly 700 pages, the film makers have distilled something that vaguely coheres on its own obnoxious terms, and that isn't hopelessly fragmented or dull. Many a loftier literary adaptation has failed to achieve the crude, lively impact of this one.
In fact, in its way this "Bonfire of the Vanities" makes a shade more sense than "The Russia House," directed edgily by Fred Schepisi and based on the novel by John le Carre. No original screenplay, no matter how quick-witted or abbreviated, would ever attempt to compress as much minor data as Tom Stoppard crams so confusingly into his adaptation. Nor would an original screenwriter concentrate so heavily on aphorisms and clever rejoinders at the expense of simple background information or transitional material, too much of which Mr. Stoppard has pared away.
Mr. le Carre's many readers are apt to find this economy gratifying at times. But it will be possible for viewers unfamiliar with his novel to watch the entire film without being sure what its title means, or where certain scenes are taking place or even precisely what is at stake. This adaptation's excessive density violates the most basic precept of bringing works of fiction to the screen: they must be freestanding. No audience should have to do its homework in order to watch a work of popular entertainment.
As the James Ivory-Ismail Merchant-Ivory-Ruth Prawer Jhabvala "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" makes clear, a film can greatly abbreviate or alter the work upon which it is based without truly losing ground. This exceptionally skillful adaptation blends Evan S. Connell's two novels, softens their viewpoint and even changes a crucial aspect of its story's ending without violating the spirit of its material. Mr. Connell is at times more openly critical of his characters' small-mindedness, but the film prefers to make its point more gently. Helped tremendously by the sad and humanizing performances of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward in the title roles, the film adopts a rueful, lulling tone and makes it work.
If "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" remains slightly superior to its characters, and if its decorous good looks are at times overwhelming, these attitudes at least have a purpose in relation to the material. They never leap out to announce the literariness or detachment of the endeavor, as does the presence of Paul Bowles in Bernardo Bertolucci's mesmerizing version of Mr. Bowles's "Sheltering Sky." Seated watchfully in a North African cafe, asking a cosmic question of his story's heroine, Mr. Bowles serves as a reminder of the film's origins -- and quite an extraneous reminder, given the film's unmistakably literary voice.
For all its visual beauty and its skill in expressing emotion in visual terms, "The Sheltering Sky" could never be confused with a work imagined solely for the screen. Too much is missing; too much is ineffable; too much sends a viewer back to the page. Only Mr. Bowles's writing supplies the real essence of his characters' anomie; what Mr. Bertolucci dwells on instead is the world-weary glamour that accompanies such a hauntingly desolate spirit.
 In the universe of the novel, no detail is trivial; even the smoking of a cigarette can become a metaphor for the human condition. ("The first few puffs it tastes wonderful, and you don't even think of its ever being used up," says the book's nihilistic hero. "Then you begin taking it for granted. Suddenly you realize it's nearly burned down to the end. And then's when you're conscious of the bitter taste.") There is, of course, a visual equivalent to such brooding scrutiny, but the film is often too arch and scenic to achieve it.
By comparison, Stephen Frears's "Grifters" grasps and distills its characters' attitudes so sharply that it seems a bigger work than Mr. Bertolucci's eye-filling epic. Although "The Grifters" has been faithfully adapted by Donald Westlake, the toughness of Jim Thompson's brief, hard-boiled novel is given a much greater complexity on the screen. The smallest strokes here, particularly in the ways that the three principal roles are acted, can make great differences in how these characters are ultimately perceived.
This film's stunningly cruel ending, with Anjelica Huston at the crest of an unforgettable performance, is hugely enhanced by one tiny adjustment in Mr. Thompson's dialogue. It's a change that turns an inhuman monster into a pitiablyreal one. And it's a change that underscores how far beyond the written word a genuinely inspired screen adaptation can go.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Coalition Sees Unfair Edge by Nonprofit Groups

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
A COALITION of businesses, hurt by the recession, is battling to prohibit nonprofit organizations from selling travel, among other things, in competition with the private sector.
The coalition argument, which is being directed at state legislators nationwide, is that nonprofit organizations have a built-in competitive advantage over tour operators and travel agents because they receive tax exemptions, use volunteer labor and pay less postage. 
 In addition, the coalition cites a "halo effect" that allows nonprofit organizations like churches, universities and museums to trade on "public assumption of a lofty purpose." Examples might be a church-sponsored tour of the Holy Land or a museum-led tour of art in Italy.
Theresa Stanion, the director of the group, the Business Coalition for Fair Competition, in Washington, said in an interview, "The truth is that many of our members, small businesses, have been put out of business by nonprofits' competition."
Thomas R. Frenkel, vice president of Presley Tours in Makanda, Ill., said, "A church in my town operates tours that look like my tours." He added that the tours can be offered for 20 percent less because of the church's nonprofit advantage. Mr. Frenkel is the new president of the National Tour Association, a founder and moving force in the coalition, made up of three dozen trade associations ranging from the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Society of Travel Agents to the National Association of Retail Druggists and the American Association of Nurserymen.
At the high end of the price spectrum, tours offered by large museums and universities, which may have special features, can cost a lot more than the same tour sold by a travel agent or tour company.
For example, the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi is offering a seven-night cruise in April on the Delta Queen, going from Memphis to New Orleans. The historians Alex Haley and Shelby Foote and the jazz musicians Mose Allison and B. B. King will be on board to speak and perform. Land tours are included as is a stay at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis the first night. The charge for one person in a two-person cabin on D Deck is $2,850. The regular seven-night trip in such a cabin is $1,790, including meals and entertainment but not shore excursions or celebrity speakers, according to Patti Young of the Delta Queen management. P.V.A. Travel Planning and Management, the commercial organization that put together the sold-out trip, said the cruise would yield a little over $11,000 for the cultural center, which also has overhead.
Model Bill Drafted
The Business Coalition for Fair Competition moved its campaign to the states after it failed to persuade Congress and the Treasury Department to take action. Neither Ms. Stanion nor Mr. Frenkel could offer a dollar estimate of how much business their members were losing to nonprofit agencies. Everyone agrees that the offering of tours by nonprofit groups has been on the rise, sharply so in the last five years.
The coalition is now offering a model bill for the states. The bill's stated intent is "to provide additional economic opportunities to private industry and to regulate competition by government agencies and public institutions of higher education."
It would do so by requiring that "if government agencies and public institutions of higher education engage in sales of goods or services at retail, such sales shall not be for less than the costs that would be borne by persons making similar sales in the private sector."
If passed by the states, consumers would find a reduction in tour choices or price increases in nonprofit agencies' tours.
The coalition's hopes were high for Michigan to adopt the measure, but earlier this month the state Attorney General ruled that the bill might violate the state constitution's provision for independence of state universities. The coalition, now waiting for legislatures to reconvene, said that a bill had been prefiled in Wyoming.
The likelihood of passage in any state is difficult to assess. The coalition is optimistic. In a recent mailing to members, it said, "Well-organized plans exist in at least a dozen states," including Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Ohio, New York, Texas and Washington.
A Question of Equal Footing
Spokesmen for the tour association, with 600 bus tour operators and travel agency members, say they seek a level playing field with nonprofit organizations. In addition to legislative action, one way they want the field leveled is through firmer application of a Federal tax that parallels the corporate income tax. This tax, the Unrelated-Business Income Tax, applies to nonprofit groups' gains from selling goods or services unrelated to the group's primary mission.
In this category, the coalition cites sales of computers by universities, sales of hearing aids by hospitals or operation of health clubs by Y organizations. They also point to trips sold by alumni groups and museums.
The former president of the National Tour Association, George Guenther, who is president of Talmage Tours of Philadelphia, said that the campaign was spurring collection of taxes from the nonprofits. "In 1985," he said, "before we started beating the drums on this, 2,500 companies filed the Unrelated-Business Income Tax form, and they paid a tax of $30 million. In 1987, 7,000 companies reported unrelated-business income and they paid $137 million."
The question of whether the travel is tied to the mission of the nonprofit group is crucial. A big tour operator that puts together packages for such clients as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Harvard alumni, the Yale alumni and the Art Institute of Chicago says the organizations' travel programs always tie into their overall mission. "We never go to the beach," said Miki Adams, assistant director of marketing for the agency Academic Travel Abroad in Washington. "We would go to Leningrad and study art and architecture there or a topic directly related to the mission of the organization."
Ms. Adams said alumni tours were accompanied by a faculty member who would give lectures. William Ferris, director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture, said that the Delta Queen cruise was another step in his group's effort to take education outside academic walls and made the study of Southern culture accessible.
In its statement of purpose, the business coalition says, "Unfair competition results when a tax-exempt organization -- a nonprofit group or government-subsidized agency -- sells goods and services, on a frequent and ongoing basis, using its special privileges. The organization does not use for-profit intermediaries to market its goods and services; rather it sells similar products to compete directly with private, for-profit businesses."
Elaborating on this, John Hawkes, a spokesman for the tour association, said that the target was not groups like the National Trust that use for-profit tour packagers. "If they can expand the total field of tourism, we have no problem with them," he said. Rather, he said, it is small-town senior citizen groups, youth agencies, churches and the like that put together tours themselves and offer them to the public -- not just their members.
But Mr. Guenther, the former president of the tour operators, is not so easily placated because he is concerned not just with the process of assembling the tour, but with its selling. In this, he says, the nonprofit groups compete with retail travel agents; 60 percent of the tour group's members are also travel agents. He referred to the tours offered by the 92d Street Y, which BatiaPlotch of the Y said were run by profit-making tour operators. "She is an unfair competitor as a travel agent," Mr. Guenther said.
Several representatives of big nonprofit groups said that they doubted that their use of commercial tour operators would deflect an attack by the coalition. One officer who preferred not to be named said that it was probably easier politically to set up a big, visible target like the Smithsonian than to say the target was the local senior citizens center.
Bryan DeLeo, director of study tours for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit agency that offers tours, said, "It is ironic that members of the coalition would prefer to criticize institutions that offer high-quality educational travel programs rather than endeavor to provide tours of comparable quality themselves."

HEADLINE: Two Classic Resorts Face the Future

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD; ROBERT REINHOLD is head of the Los Angeles bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
ON the Mexican Riviera, this is a season of transition and renewal, a winter of uncertainty in paradise. In Puerto Vallarta, the once sleepy fishing village that first gained fame and Hollywood stars when Tennessee Williams's tale of decadence, "Night of the Iguana," was filmed nearby nearly 30 years ago, the talk among the American expatriates is whether the time-share industry will be the ruin of their tropical hideaway. A favorite hangout, the bar at the old Oceano Hotel, is gone now, turned into apartments and shops. Elizabeth Taylor has finally sold her dilapidated house in Gringo Gulch. It is to be converted into a bed-and-breakfast. Three weeks ago, Ava Gardner's aged beachboy lover, who played a skin diver in the movie, died.
Four hundred miles to the southeast, frenetic Acapulco, the now-faded grande dame of Mexican beach resorts, finally realized it was driving away tourists and responded by banishing peddlers and time-share salespeople from the beaches and streets. It has been cleaning up its polluted waters and filthy beaches and streets and sending out a squad of earnest young bilingual helpers to protect visitors against dishonest taxi drivers and restaurateurs. A mammoth new resort area is under construction on Diamond Point, just east of Acapulco Bay, and already the most fashionable restaurants and discotheques are moving toward it. And soon a new superhighway from Mexico City will open, bringing a much needed boost from affluent Mexican visitors. 
 These are difficult times for Acapulco, and even for Puerto Vallarta, the two classic winter resorts that pioneered the concept of the fleshy tropical beach getaway a generation ago. Now they find themselves hard-pressed to compete in a world of planned mega-resorts like Cancun and Ixtapa, not to mention Hawaii and the Caribbean. Both have suffered drastic drops in the number of visitors in the last few years, shocking local authorities and hoteliers into action to repair the effects of years of excessive unplanned growth and urban neglect.
It may be that time has irrevocably passed them by as vacationers seek the next new destination. But their bayside settings are as magnificent as ever, the climate nearly perfect, and unlike sterile remote Cancun, Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta -- each in its own very different way -- offer a close-up look at the reality of Mexican life and its warm-hearted people. Not least in this day of $250 hotel rooms, both are bargains. It is possible to find a pleasant room on or near the beach for $75 or even less, for two people to eat well for $35, including a bottle of excellent Mexican wine, and to taxi from one end of town to the other for $3.
 Acapulco's crescent-shaped bay lined with fine sand beaches first began to attract the rich and famous after World War II when European travel was difficult. It later became a premier jet-set winter resort, with its huge throbbing discos, all-night dancing, beautiful people, hustlers and fashionable boutiques. Some locals say the jet-set crowd still comes to Acapulco, but they mostly stay to themselves now in rented villas in the Las Brisas area on the hill just east of town. The old Acapulco along the Costera Miguel Aleman, the strip, has been largely turned over to the package tour vistors, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Big Boy. The shrinking number of visitors is still 70 percent American, along with budget travelers from Canada, Germany, France and, increasingly, Japan.
The decline was a paradoxical product of Acapulco's success. With little agriculture or industry, the Mexican state of Guerrero depends on tourism for 70 percent of its income, mainly from Acapulco. So a huge unplanned and chaotic city of 2 million has grown up behind the hotel zones to service, and sometimes prey on, the visitors. "We became a city instead of only a resort," said Eduardo F. Saenz Viesca, the Minister of Tourism Development for the State of Guerrero. "A big city with all the problems of a big city."
Uncontrolled development overwhelmed water-treatment facilities and hotels began dumping their raw sewage directly into the bay. Every heavy rain brought a cascade of trash and dead rats from the mountains above the beaches into the waters. Beggars and peddlers selling everything from serapes to fraudulent time-share deals descended on the beach daily in such numbers that it was impossible to nap without being woken up every five minutes. Many tourists retreated to the safety of hotel pools.
But this year, a $300 million government program to rejuvenate Acapulco has begun to take effect. New sewage collection and treatment systems have reduced contamination of the bay and, according to Mr. Saenz, the waters are "absolutely safe" for swimming, and this recent visitor swam in the sea without apparent ill effect.
 But many a resident and tourist remains skeptical, and with good reason, according to Jorge Gonzalez Torres, president of the Ecological Alliance in Mexico City. "The sea is still very polluted," he said. "The whole shoreline of Acapulco Bay is polluted. Yes, they've built a sewage treatment center and collectors, but 50 percent of the time they're not working. They just aren't capable of doing the job. There is still drainage from hotels and buildings directly into the ocean and many small rivers that discharge into the bay, bringing filthy water and sewage down from the mountains where the poor people live. I would recommend that no one enter the water anywhere in Acapulco. There are many cases of skin and ear infections."
Nearly all 2,500 peddlers have been removed from the Costera and the beaches under a new law and either relocated to one of three government-constructed flea markets or given jobs or job-training. For now, at least, visitors can walk or sun on the beaches almost unharassed.
A private consortium of hotel, restaurant and disco owners has bought hundreds of yellow-painted dumpsters, as well as street sweepers, trucks and vacuums; a squad of nearly 60 sanitation workers patrols the hotel zone. Traps have been placed over drainage ditches to keep trash off the beach. Once ugly concrete walls along the Costera have been painted in striped pastels, and new walkways providing access to beaches, have been opened, along with public showers and toilets. A government agency has taken over the rental of all the chairs and umbrellas on the beaches and plans this winter to illuminate all the beaches at night.
In addition, the state Government's tourist assistance bureau has been beefed up. Bilingual assistants patrol the hotel zone, beaches and other tourist spots, and they are authorized to intervene on behalf of visitors in case of disputes with taxi drivers, merchants or restaurateurs.
 For all these improvements, Acapulco is literally fleeing itself, moving east. The new resort area called Punta Diamante, or Diamond Point, now being built occupies a 30-square-mile peninsula just southeast of old Acapulco. It is meant to be Acapulco's answer to Cancun, a lavish masterplanned community. In all, there will be about 5,200 hotel rooms and 1,000 condominium apartments, plus golf courses, tennis courts and other amenities, the first opening early next year. The idea is to create a so-called destination resort like the splendid 1,000-room Acapulco Princess Hotel nearby on Revolcadero Beach.
 More adventurous visitors who walk from the Costera hotel zone through the serene Papagayo Park, with its ponds and aviary, arrive downtown and plunge into the wonders and horrors of everyday Mexican life, lived mostly on the chaotic streets. Trucks and buses roar by as Indian women sell every type of nut and fruit; two cheerful street urchins with a bathroom scale offer your weight for 17 cents; an American woman shrieks as a thief on the trot snaps off her necklace and darts down an alley.
 In the main square, the zocalo, where local people socialize under shade trees, stands the city's main church, Nuestra Senora de la Soledad, an imposing whitewashed building with colorful bulbous spires. In nearby side streets, the small restaurants serve such local specialties as iguana soup. There are many fine old buildings and there is some talk in government circles of creating an artists' enclave here with studios and exhibitions. "Regardless of what humans have done to it," said Jose Ruiz, a Mexico City civil engineer who advises the Guerrero state government, "there are great values associated with Old Acapulco."
In Puerto Vallarta, where a sprawling town has grown around the old fishing village, the perennial question on the Bahia de Banderas, with its cobblestoned streets and whitewashed buildings, is this: "Is Puerto Vallarta becoming another Acapulco?" The short answer is no, but it is trying hard. The number of hotel rooms has tripled to 13,000 since 1975. On the road north of town, toward the airport, there is now a Domino's Pizza and a Pizza Hut; in the big new shopping mall at the nearby marina, a Denny's, Woolworth's and a McDonald's.
Despite all that, Puerto Vallarta retains much of the charm and color that have drawn thousands of expatriates over the years, including such Hollywood celebrities as John Huston, Richard Burton and Ms. Taylor and Ms. Gardner. Most of the new resort and hotel development has occurred either north or south of town, or just across the Nayarit state line in Nuevo Vallarta, leaving the old village itself, which hugs jungle-clad mountains, with less of Acapulco's gross commercial excesses.
 Puerto Vallarta is much smaller and quieter, and less assertive. While vendors are still permitted on the beach, they are neither very numerous nor overly aggressive. Taxi drivers rarely try to cheat their clients, and a tourist can walk virtually unnoticed along the malecon (seawall) and through the town's narrow streets, except for the time-share salesmen. They operate from tiny booths carved out of building facades, usually pretending to offer free tourist advice or jeep rentals at an impossibly low $5 a day.
Long-time residents like Maria Alexander, a Texan, and Bill Chappell, an advertising art director from Los Angeles, recall Puerto Vallarta in 1962 when it was little more than a village of 6,000 with two taxis, open sewers, no phones and no access by road. In less than three decades it has grown into a bustling town of 150,000, swollen by 30,000 visitors on any given day during the high season. The movie stars still come, ensconcing themselves in lavish rented villas in the fashionable Conchas Chinas residential area just south of town. But Puerto Vallarta today is a destination for holidaymakers with varied budgets. They seem to come principally from California, the West and Midwest, but there are growing contingents of Europeans and Japanese. A new superhighway under construction from Guadalajara will make it more accessible to Mexicans who, hoteliers say, are already beginning to replace some of the lost American visitors. For the most part, visitors seem to seek a quieter, more romantic and Mexican experience than those who go to Acapulco, though Puerto Vallarta offers plenty of opportunity to dance till dawn.
 Puerto Vallarta has begun to ask if it is being spoiled, as Acapulco was. High rise hotels and condominiums with a vaguely Moroccan look have sprung up along the beaches downtown, far outpacing sewer capacity, and contamination of the bay has become an urgent concern.
The local director of the Jalisco and Federal tourist office, Gabriel Igartua Sanchez, maintained that the pollution problem has now been "controlled" by the opening of a new sewage treatment plant; two more are to open by next March. He added that the bay, unlike Acapulco Bay, is very large and therefore "flushes itself." Tourists "can be very confident the water is good to swim in," Mr. Igartua said, issuing a verdict not entirely accepted by visitors or local people.
 Mr. Gonzalez of the Ecological Alliance advised caution. "They still have a serious problem with pollution but it's not as bad as Acapulco," he said. "I'd say the water in the Puerto Vallarta bay is contaminated 30 to 40 percent of the time. The treatment plants are not big enough and are also broken down half the time. Hotels still have drainage into the bay. I'd say there are places in Puerto Vallarta where you could go swimming with little risk, maybe up around Nuevo Vallarta."
 But certainly the larger threat to Puerto Vallarta is the scourge of the time share. Forbidden to solicit prospects on the street, operators of these buildings are now willing to pay $500 a month rent to post their salespeople in cubicles facing the busy tourist streets, from which they shout to passers-by. The rents have driven out restaurants and shops , and already the cubicles have obliterated much of President Diaz Ordaz Street.
"We have to do something to guarantee people the right to walk the streets freely," Mr. Igartua said, adding that the authorities were considering imposing heavy fines for harassing visitors. Time- share operators have also taken to providing attractive young "hostesses" to restaurants for free. After she seats you and befriends you with cheerful banter comes the pitch. One restaurant has a sign out front: "Open -- No Time Share." The assistance bureau on the ground floor of City Hall gets more complaints about time-share deceptions than anything else.
Still, Puerto Vallarta remains an attractive destination, with its narrow cobbled streets, lined with interesting and off-beat shops, and bars and restaurants from which to watch a rich red sun set over the Pacific Ocean.
 
WHAT IT COSTS TO LODGE AND DINE IN TWO RESORTS
 
Acapulco
All prices are in United States dollars, but with the slow devaluation (80 centavos a day) of the Mexican peso and inflation they could fluctuate a bit. Hotel rates are for high season, generally Dec. 20 through April 20; after that they drop by about 30 percent.
While some hotels have toll-free 800 numbers in the United States, it is often worth calling direct to get a better rate.
HOTELS. Las Brisas, on a hill overlooking the bay, boasts 250 swimming pools. Each of the bungalows has a small one. Room with shared pool is $200, plus $20 service charge in lieu of tips; with private pool, $285. 5255 Carretera Escenica; telephone (748) 415-80 or (800) 228-3000 in the United States.
The Villa Vera provides seclusion in the hills hectic Acapulco, with 80 villas and rooms, swim- up bar surrounded by palm trees and a jacuzzi that holds 40 people. The daily room rate is $120. 35 Lomas del Mar; (748) 4-03-33 or (800) 223-6510.
The Acapulco Plaza, with more than 1,000 mostly cramped rooms right on the Costera, is convenient to all the shops and action if a bit noisy; $155 until Jan. 3, then $125 until March 31. 123 Costera Miguel Aleman; (748) 5-9050 or (800) 465-4329.
The Copacabana in the Pink Zone, a high rise, is $100 until Jan. 1, then $75 through March 30. 2 Tabachines; (748) 4-31-55 or (800) 562-0197.
La Palapa, rising 30 stories on the beach, is $86. 210 Fragata Yucatan; (748) 4-53-63.
RESTAURANTS. The Kookaburra is the newest local favorite, with an immaculate whitewashed terrace high on a hill and views of the bay and city. It offers steaks and seafood, like filet of sole in nuts and pecan cream sauce. Dinner for two, including wine and a tip for flawless service, was $62.35. Carretera Escenica near Las Brisas Hotel; (748) 4-44-18, dinner only.
Madeiras, an old standby nearby, is warmly lit and spread out over terraces overlooking the crescent-shaped bay. The four-course, fixed price menu is $24.40 a person. Bill for two including a fine cabernet sauvignon from Baja California came to $76 with tip. Carretera Escenica; (748) 4-4378, dinner only.
El Zorrito is the place for a more authentically Mexican dining experience favored by local people and Mexican vacationers. It is a big casual open-air cafe on the Costera. Recommended are a bowl of pozole, a traditional soupy stew of hominy with chicken and vegetables ($2.45), or the usual enchiladas and fish dishes. The check for two, including service and wine, was $16. Costera Miguel Aleman near the Acapulco Dorado bus stop.
El Amigo Miguel is another favorite of local people. There are two branches on either side of Calle Benito Juarez two blocks west of the zocalo. A lunch of broiled red snapper and broiled shrimp in garlic sauce came to $21.30, including Negra Modelo dark beer and a Yoli soft drink.
Or drive about 20 miles south along the coast to the village of Barra Vieja, where about half a dozen beachside restaurants serve food that belies the crude surroundings of picnic tables in the sand under palapas. The specialty here is huachinango a la talla, or grilled red snapper marinated in a red chile sauce. No menus, so establish the price in advance. We let down our guard and paid too much.
ASSISTANCE. It's worth beginning your visit to Acapulco by stopping by the Tourist Assistance Bureau, which operates from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. daily from an office on the Costera in front of the Convention Center (telephone 44416 or 44583). The staff dispenses cheerful advice on local customs to protect visitors from being cheated.
 
 Puerto Vallarta
HOTELS. Garza Blanca, 4.5 miles south of town, is a pleasant elegant retreat on a hillside by the beach. Beachfront suites are $225, less for other locations. Carretera a Barra de Navidad; (322) 2-10-23 or (800) 331-0908.
Buganvilias Sheraton is a spacious well-run resort complex within walking distance of downtown, and it has two large pools; $135. 999 Carretera Aeropuerto; (322) 2-30-00 or (800) 325-3535.
The Quinta Maria Cortez may suit those looking for the offbeat. This is a guesthouse on the beach with just six large suites designed by the Texan host, Maria Alexander, Silver to friends, and eclectically decorated. Rates are $65 to $130 plus service. Playa Conchas Chinas; (322) 2-11-84 or 2-1317.
The Buenaventura is a bargain on the beach at the edge of downtown. There are 210 rooms and 4 suites. Rates are $68, including tax. 1302 Avenida Mexico; (322) 2-37-37 or (800) 878-4484 or (800) 223-6764.
Hotel Molino de Agua, in the heart of downtown, is a shaded compound of bungalows in a coconut grove beside the Rio Cuale, at $40. Corner of Ignacio Vallarta and Aquiles Serdan Streets; (322) 2-19-57 or (800) 826-9408.
Hotel Playa Conchas Chinas is 1.5 miles south of town, with 40 suites facing the ocean. Rates are $63, tax included. Carretera a Barra de Navidad; (322) 2-01056.
RESTAURANTS. Le Bistro is probably the most beautiful restaurant in Puerto Vallarta, with tables under banana trees and palms on a deck over the gurgling Rio Cuale, but the setting is better than the food. A forgettable meal for two came to $66.75 with tip and wine. 16A Isla Rio Cuale; (322) 2-02-83.
Santos is a new restaurant near Los Muertos Beach where the owner, Santos Atzin, presides over four tables under coconut palms on the street and a pleasant white dining room inside. A fish filet Veracruzana was $7.50. Total tab for two with drinks and tip was $32.60. 136 Francisca Rodriguez; no phone, dinner only.
Archie's Wok, next door, is where John Huston's former chef serves passable Asian food, like Thai coconut fish at $8.55 and barbecue ribs at $7.15. 130 Francisca Rodriguez; (322) 204-11.
The Chef Roger restaurant has a Swiss chef who attempts innovations with fresh Mexican ingredients in a pleasant courtyard setting. A salad with warm shrimp was $8.55 at lunch. 267 Agustin Rodriguez; (322) 2-06-04.
Franzi Cafe, a nice place for breakfast, has a pleasant outdoor setting on the river, where scrambled eggs with ground beef, spinach, mushrooms, cheeses and spices was $4.50. On the Isla Rio Cuale, at bottom of steps at new bridge; no phone.
DISTRACTIONS. The two hottest discos these days are Christine (2-69-90), in the Krystal Vallarta Hotel, and Cactus (2-60-77), at 399 Ignacio Vallarta Street.
The resort has developed a healthy art scene, with galleries selling both contemporary Mexican artists like Alejandro Colunga and Sergio Bustamante and indigenous masks and other objects by the Nahua and Huichol Indians. For contemporary art, the leading galleries are Fitzpatrick de Gooyer (2-19-82) at 589 Morelos, Galeria Pacifico (2-67-68), 519 Juarez, and Galeria Sergio Bustamante (2-11-29), 275 Juarez. Best shops for indigenous art are across the river. -- R. R.

Alpine Resorts Revel in Snow, For a Change
The snowstorms that brought havoc to Europe's highways this month have had at least one happy side effect: after four consecutive warm winters, the storms have dumped heaps of snow on ski slopes in the Alps. Early in December, almost simultaneously with reports of 100-car pile-ups on superhighways because of ice and fog, heavy snow blanketed the mountains of Germany, Austria and Italy. Then France and Switzerland also reported enough snow to open the season early and to insure a good Christmas for skiers. After a series of indifferent winters, Alpine resorts are looking forward to a busy one.
The Suddeutscher Zeitung, published in Munich, reported in mid-December that almost all the Alpine ski areas had snow depths of 25 inches or more on slopes a mile high and between 15 and 25 inches on runs down into the valleys. Ski towns and hotels said that reservations were pouring in and many places were quickly sold out for Christmas. But a survey of some resorts turned up available rooms through the month of January and good chances of finding space in February and March.
Responding to inquiries, a skiing instructor in Lech, Austria, said, "12 to 38 inches and snowing heavily." In Corvara in Badia, Italy: "We have enough to last until Easter" (12 to 48 inches), and in Zermatt, Switzerland: "30 inches on top and more snow predicted today."
In the French Alps -- where many ski resorts were obliged to offer tennis, bicycling, hiking and other summer activities to winter vacationers last season -- snow started coming down in November and held to the slopes. Then came heavy snowfalls the second week of December that forced the temporary closure of some passes leading to resort areas and of the Mont Blanc Tunnel to Italy. High-altitude resorts like Val d'Isere and Tignes opened their slopes in November, earlier than scheduled, and places lower down, like Les Contamines, opened on weekends. Chamonix, at medium elevation, reported 45 inches of snow on its slopes. Most French resorts open officially this weekend.
 
Rome Gallery In First Show
An art gallery that opened this month in Rome's Palazzo Ruspoli, once a bank, is presenting an exhibition entitled "Expressionism: Masterpieces from the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection from van Gogh to Klee." The exhibition, organized by the Memmo Foundation, part owner of the palace, contains 47 paintings representative of early 20th-century movements preceding Expressionism and associated with van Gogh, Chagall, Kirchner, Kandinsky and Schiele. It is the first of three exhibitions planned within a year at the Palazzo Ruspoli Art Gallery, which includes a conference room, cafeteria and gift shop.
The palace, about 100 yards from the Spanish Steps, is an attraction in itself. Built in the 16th century for the Florentine merchant and patron of the arts Orazio Rucellai, it houses frescoes by Jacopo Zucchi, a pupil of the Renaissance master Vasari.
The address is 418 Via del Corso (telephone, 6832177 or 6832179). The exhibition continues through the end of February; hours are 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. every day (until 11 P.M. on Saturdays). Admission is about $9.
 
Brussels Copes With Growth
As the European Community moves toward integration as a single domestic market in 1992, work has begun on expansion projects designed to more than double the capacity of the Brussels National Airport
 
Hotel Discounts In Three Cities
New York hotels and bargains may sound contradictory, but a discount service called Express Hotel Reservations says that on average it obtains rooms at 20 to 25 percent off regular rates at certain hotels in Manhattan as well as in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It says its leverage comes from volume and that its clients include many business travelers whose companies don't get corporate rates. Travelers are not charged for the service, and they do not have to join a club.
Express Hotel Reservations says it books about 50,000 rooms a year. Among the hotels are, in Manhattan, the Doral Court (39th Street and Lexington Avenue), the Warwick (54th Street and Avenue of the Americas) and New York Penta (32d Street and Seventh Avenue). In Los Angeles, they include the Midtown Hilton, the Ma Maison Sofitel and the Mondrian; in San Francisco, the Diva, Kensington Park and Parc Fifty-Five. The agency can be reached at (800) 356-1123 Monday to Friday from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Eastern standard time.
Travelers bound for Disney World and other attractions in Florida at busy periods -- and that can be any time other than May and September to November -- can ask the Central Reservation Service to find them rooms. The service, a member of Orlando-Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau, operates around the clock and does not charge a fee. "Orlando fills up every holiday," said Carlos Giraldo, the manager. "Demand outpaces supply, and travelers go through an ordeal trying to find a room. We can help." The phone number is (800) 950-0232.
 
Economy Class Gets New Name
 Starting Jan. 15, British Airways won't have an economy class anymore. Instead, the section will have a new name -- two in fact. Economy will be called world traveler on long-haul routes, including trans-Atlantic, and Euro traveler on short-haul routes in Europe.
The change, the airline said, is the result of three years of market research resulting in improved catering, more comfortable seats, free newspapers and improved in-flight movies for the 13 million passengers who travel economy with British Airways every year.
In the cabin, world travelers will be greeted by a new blue and white decoration, designed to give a feeling of greater space, but the width and pitch of the seats will remain the same. Euro travelers will have improved service with free beverages.
 
Tours: Horses, Wildlife, Food
A crossing of the Andes on horseback is offered by Southern Cross Expeditions. The trip is scheduled to begin from Mendoza, Argentina, on Feb. 9. Participants will ride across the Andes into Chile and back, making a 13-day loop amid glaciers, forests and Aconcagua, the highest peak of the Western Hemisphere. The price of $2,440 a person covers horses, tents, meals, guides and a two-night hotel stay in Buenos Aires but no air fares. (Southern Cross Expeditions, Post Office Box 1228, Bowling Green Station, New York, N.Y. 10274-1228; [800] 359-0193.)
Changes in wildlife and plant and marine life that may have occurred in the Galapagos Islands as a result of the "greenhouse" global warning and the unusually strong El Nino current of 1983 will be studied on a 19-day trip next summer. In 1983, the El Nino current deluged the Galapagos with 103 inches of rain instead of the usual 3 inches. The tour will be led by Richard Hilton, an instructor in natural sciences at Sierra College, Rocklin, Calif. Participants will travel aboard a motor yacht with private cabins. The trip, scheduled for June 22 to July 10, costs $2,990, including accommodations and all meals on the yacht, lectures and a three-night hotel stay in Quito. Air fares to Ecuador and the islands are extra. (Nature Expeditions International, Post Office Box 11496, Eugene, Ore. 97440; [800] 869-0639 or [503] 484-6529.)
The cookbook author Eileen Yin-Fei Lo will escort a tour to Hong Kong for the colony's Food Festival. The eight-day tour starting March 11 costs $2,750 a person, including round-trip air fare from the West Coast ($200 more from the East Coast), rooms at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and most meals. Another tour leaving the same day offers one cooking class and provides rooms at the Kowloon Shangri-La Hotel. It is $2,495. (Orient Flexi-Pax Tours, 630 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; [212] 692-9550 or [800] 545-5540 outside New York State.)
 
VIEWING AREA IN HAWAII
 The observation point at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, Hawaii's most popular tourist attraction, has reopened following a two-year renovation. The area, which offers a panoramic view of Honolulu, was redesigned to reduce traffic congestion and to provide a more tranquil setting.
Nearly 36,000 members of the military who died in World War II and the wars in Korea and Vietnam are buried in the cemetery.
The $2 million renovation, organized by the Veterans Administration, which maintains the cemetery, includes new parking areas for buses and cars, restrooms and enlarged viewing areas.
Memorial plaques donated by veterans groups will be placed along what was called Observation Drive but has been renamed Memorial Walk, now closed to traffic. The changes mean that passengers on buses have to walk up Memorial Walk from a new parking area, adding about 15 minutes to their visit.
In the year before the renovation began, more than 5.6 million people visited the cemetery. But even after the renovation, the area is still congested with traffic, especially tour buses. About 85 to 100 buses arrive each day along with stretch limousines and cars.
Officials of the cemetery and representatives of tour companies are engaged in discussions on easing congestion.
The cemetery is in the crater -- known as the Punchbowl -- of an extinct volcano.

HEADLINE: BETTING THE PLANET

 BODY:
The market price of food, fresh water, minerals, metals and fuel has never been related to the finite quantity of those resources. Rather, it has has been determined by current micro- and macroeconomics, which, in turn, are affected by hourly wage rates, subsidies, politics, current supply and demand.
To date, the market pricing of natural resources has not included the other direct and indirect costs resulting from overpopulation and the consumption of these resources: the costs of pollution, waste disposal, climatic changes, ecological deterioration, species destruction.
Ehrlich's bet with Simon is meaningless. Instead of obfuscating the real problems, these gentlemen should be working on methods to adjust the market pricing of resources to reflect their real costs -- which involves a lot more than their current degree of "scarcity." The problem is urgent and complicated.

THE weakened co-op market throughout the city is putting the feet of many board members to the fire as more shareholders who need to move seek permission to take tenants rather than accept an unfavorable price in a sale.
The subletting issue, some board members say, has forced them into a balancing act, trying to extend relief to apartment owners facing financial hardship, but at the same time addressing the concerns of other shareholders about rental occupancies. For some of them, subletting is opening a door to trouble. 
 "It is an issue that is very important now," said Steven Vamos, president of a co-op at 222 East 80th Street between Second and Third Avenues, "and I can tell you that it can be very emotional, even bloody. Dealing with subletting problems is taking more and more of our time."
Arguments against subletting range from its potential for compromise in a building's security to the difficulty of removing a tenant who turns out to be noisy or disruptive. Some shareholders argue that too many tenants -- even if they are neighborly and helpful -- can give a building an unwanted transient characteristic.
"Every board has heard the horror stories," said Lee Miller, a lawyer whose firm, Miller Friedman & Eisenman, represents co-ops on the Upper East and West Sides of Manhattan. "Tenants who have all-night parties or who sneak in roommates or don't pay their rents. Subletting can be an enormous burden to a building if it is not monitored."
Owners of co-op apartments hold shares in a corporation rather than real property and hold proprietary leases that give them the right to occupy their space under the terms of their lease. When they rent out their apartments the new occupants are sublessees.
In condominiums, in which owners hold real property as opposed to corporation shares, owners normally have an easier task when they seek out renters. Condominium managements cannot deny permission to rent, although they may review the owner's tenant choice and charge fees to the owner for rental occupancies.
The rental option for the condominium owner who wants to move but not sell has in fact been one of the selling points in condominium promotions in recent years, as condominiums have become the prevalent form in newly built multifamily residences in New York City. But in the face of falling prices, some co-op boards have eased their policies on subleasing.
"It's no longer a matter of limiting the profits of the seller, as it used to be when the market was stronger," said Jesse Morris, vice president of the directors at 375 Riverside Drive at 110th Street. "It is now how much of a loss the owner might have to take if a sublet is not approved."
Mr. Morris said that until last year the board approved subletting only for shareholders who left the city temporarily for professional reasons and who returned to their apartments. But in the last several months it has heard the pleas of shareholders being dragged down by falling co-op prices.
"The subletting requests were not coming from people who were taking sabbaticals or temporary out-of-town assignments," he said. "In an increasing number of cases people wanted to leave the city for good or needed to move to a larger apartment. And in these cases they had tried to sell but could not even recover their original investment." Not all co-ops have bowed to pressure to relax subletting policies.
Lester Lazarus, president of the board at 36 Sutton Place South, said that after years of virtually no discussions on the matter, in recent months the board has heard the pleas of three shareholders who could not sell and wanted to rent their apartments. One bought two units with plans to sell one. When he could not, he asked the board to let him sublet.
Another, who said he had to move to Florida for his health, asked permission to sublease because he could not find a buyer.
A third shareholder told the board that a bankrupt business had made it hard for him to meet financial obligations on his apartment.
All were turned down, Mr. Lazarus said.
"Unfortunately," he said, "we have not been lenient when it comes to sublets. I can see how the board's position in these cases could make us seem rather heartless. I am personally troubled by these situations. But I must say that I believe that we were responding to the feelings of the majority of shareholders, who still do not like the idea of subletting."
A particularly nettlesome aspect of subletting discussions, Mr. Lazarus said, is that of setting a precedent that would make it difficult for the board to turn down requests.
"We don't want to be put in the position of being a judge on the degree of hardship people are experiencing," he said. "If you give permission to one, how can you justify turning down the next person or the next, each of whom might have legitimate reasons for wanting to rent?"
Despite the continued resistance to subletting in a few co-ops, real estate lawyers and managers and board members themselves say that many boards have liberalized their polices in the last six months or so.
"I don't think we have any buildings in the portfolio of co-op properties that we manage that have absolutely refused to even consider some hardship cases," said Kenneth Cohn, executive vice president of Century Operating Corporation, which manages buildings throughout Manhattan, including co-ops and condominiums on the Upper East Side. "The boards don't want the apartments to be enterprises and they are looking to us for guidance in making policy that can allow them to be humane without letting down their guard."
In buildings where boards will allow subletting, the privilege usually carries restrictions designed to keep tenancy to a minimum, give the co-op control over who their nonshareholding neighbors will be and defray the costs of such arrangements.
Many boards limit subletting to one or two years. Some boards allow shareholders to sublet only once during their ownership. Others put a ceiling on the total number of sublets allowed at one time and still others insist that owners show that an effort has been made to sell an apartment before a sublet is discussed.
Nearly all boards reserve the right to approve any tenants and charge subletting fees, which can be high. Mr. Vamos, for example, said his co-op charges each shareholder a $750 fee for subletting, no matter what the size of the apartment. In addition, a monthly surcharge ranging from $50 for studios to $200 for two-bedroom apartments is added to the maintenance bills of shareholders who sublet.
Mr. Morris said that when he and his fellow board members are reviewing a potential subtenant they look at references and personal finances and demand that the shareholder put two months' maintenance payments in escrow. "We have the full right to evict," he said, "and we hold the shareholder responsible for the conduct of the subtenant."
About 5 percent of the building's 100 apartments are being sublet by their owners.
LAWYERS and property managers reject the notion that co-ops that are holdouts against subletting are the long-established co-ops in buildings on Park and Fifth Avenue and on Sutton Place in Manhattan.
"Cooperatives have personalities," said Frank Karelsen, a partner in Kurzman, Karelsen & Frank, a law firm that represents co-ops. "Some are conservative, some liberal. So, often whether residents do or do not want to allow tenants has less to do with a building's location or whether or not the owners are wealthy than it does with how owners want their home to be."
No one knows that better than Nancy Frey. After failing to sell her apartment in Howard Beach, Queens, she approached the board of directors for permission to sublet. Since August, when she inherited the apartment after her father's death, she has been turned down twice in bids to sublet.
"This is not a fancy apartment building," said Ms. Frey. "But the people who live here are a very close group, most of them from the neighborhood."
Ms. Frey, who has never lived in the two-bedroom apartment she inherited, said she would have moved into it except that she already owns a vacation home and the Stuyvesant Town, where she rents an apartment in Manhattan, does not allow subletting either.
"My father did not leave me with the resources to make the payments," she said. "So for the time being the maintenance is coming out of my own pocket. At $517 a month it has become a burden."
Ms. Frey said that she does not believe the board's inflexibility is tied to her never having been a resident of the building.
"My father had a lot of friends in the building," she said. "The board members I have dealt with knew my father and were sympathetic to my situation. I just think that the shareholders there just don't want anyone who is not an owner to live in the building."
After the second rejection, Ms. Frey investigated the possibility of taking legal action against the co-op. But she, like other frustrated co-op owners who have met rejection in their bid to take tenants, found that the law sides with the board. New York State Business Corporation law gives co-op corporations the absolute right to forbid subletting or formulate subletting policy any way they see fit. Most proprietary leases say the bona fide tenant is the shareholder and members of the immediate family.
Court cases have strengthened those rights.
Shareholders who sublet without permission from their boards risk losing their own right to occupy the apartment. A board can terminate proprietary leases. The only recourse is a recall of the co-op board members or a change in the corporation's bylaws, which in most co-ops requires approval by two-thirds of the shareholders.
Ms. Frey was preparing to go back to the board a third time when she recently accepted a bid of $65,000 on the apartment. She says that is $25,000 less than the selling price for a similar apartment in the building.
Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said that complete inflexibility on subletting can come back to haunt a co-op.
"Some shareholders," she said, "are beginning to see that when their neighbors can't sublet and must sell at a substantial loss, it affects the value of other apartments in the building."
Mrs. Rothman also said it is possible that if the economic climate worsens some shareholders could stop paying maintenance or, in extreme situations, be forced to default.
"There comes a point at which a co-op must decide if it is smarter to allow subletting with restrictions," she said, "or maintain rules against it and run the risk of losing the maintenance of shareholders who can not meet their financial obligations."
Inflexibility on subletting is emerging as a negative for buyers, too.
"BUYERS are starting to ask about subletting rights," said Rose Edwards, a principal in Walscott Real Estate, a brokerage company in Manhattan. "I have not lost a sale because the buyer didn't want to go into a co-op where subletting was hard, but it is something that buyers are more aware of than they used to be. The down market has made them think about their vulnerability and flexibility in the future."
A lenient subletting policy, some board members say, is no protection against subletting headaches.
Mr. Vamos, president of the board at 222 East 80th Street, said that the board is currently chasing five shareholders who it believes have illegal subletting arrangements.
"They are trying to get out of paying the fee," he said "or they want to take in people who they are afraid would not be acceptable to us."
When it comes to justifying their offenses, Mr. Vamos said, the creativity of shareholders is remarkable. One shareholder, Mr. Vamos said, said that the man who would be staying in his apartment was not a tenant but a workman who would be there so he could paint the apartment.
"But when this guy tried to move in," said Mr. Vamos, "he showed up with a truckload of furniture instead of the stuff you'd think a painter would need."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Christmas Decor;
Scrooge Banished as Businesses Get Into the Spirit

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
AS TOUGH as things are, you would need a caliper, a yardstick and a good memory to discern much difference in the holiday ornamentations undertaken by New York City's commercial interests this year.
There have been some cutbacks, to be sure. The West Side Chamber of Commerce reduced the number of its trees along upper Broadway. And the Park Avenue Malls Holiday Lighting Project and Avenue Association, faced with a drop in contributions, invested in smaller trees, although they did not lessen the scope of the effort -- nearly 140 trees, from 54th to 96th Street. 
 As a rule, it seems, businesses have maintained seasonal decor. Fifteen-foot nutracker soldiers are still arrayed smartly at the Paine Webber Building on the Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52d Streets. Seven giant "candy canes" made of boxwood -- 17 feet high and 700 pounds each -- still hang from the parapet at 9 West 57th Street. More than 200 fir trees from Nova Scotia still fill the pools at the Seagram Building on Park Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets. Cartier, at Fifth Avenue and 52d Street, is still wrapped in a vast red ribbon.
And an enormous snowflake still hangs at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, although community antagonism, on esthetic grounds, has prompted a redesign for next year.
By that time, private concerns will be expected to play even more of a role in decorating. Absent any outside help, for example, the city may have to cut out holiday trees altogether. In 1986, the Parks Department bought 44 trees for installation around New York; this year, the city bought only 14. "Next year," said Parks Commissioner Betsy Gotbaum, "the trees will have to be funded with private money."
The Parks Department had to depend on corporate largesse to maintain the tradition of filling the Pulitzer Fountain at Manhattan's Grand Army Plaza with 100 trees. In years past, the city picked up half the $20,000 cost, but this year could afford nothing.
The shortfall was made up by a group of donors led by Richard R. Wilhelm, vice president and general manager of the Plaza Hotel, that included the Pierre and Sherry Netherland Hotels. Real-estate interests that chipped in included Corporate Property Investors, managers and soon-to-be owners of the General Motors Building, across from the Plaza; LaSalle Partners, managers of 745 Fifth Avenue, next door, and the Solow Building Company, owner of 9 West 57th Street.
Although landlords would rather talk of their seasonal efforts in terms of giving a gift to the city or fulfilling corporate responsibility, it is also true that decorations draw attention to their properties and add a certain luster that carries over to the rent rolls.
PERHAPS no other owner does so much as the Rockefeller Group. This year, in fact, the tree-lighting ceremony at Rockefeller Center was held once and then restaged four days later. It turned out that the children from the Northside Center for Child Development in Harlem, who came down to push the button that lights the tree, had inadvertently been kept off stage the first time around.
Rockefeller Center officials will not discuss the cost of installing the 75-foot Norway spruce and its 20,000 lights, nor how much has been spent over the years on the sculptured wire angels that fill the Channel Gardens, the 16-foot garlands that ornament the Fifth Avenue facades and the 13 1/2-foot fiberglass cadets that surround the Lower Plaza.
But they are sure it is money well spent. "From the business sense, it's what distinguishes Rockefeller Center from its competition," said James V. Reed, the director of marketing communications. "From the selling of space and the marketing standpoint, being distinguished from the competition is something that's important to us and we do a lot of things to see to it that that happens."
The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, based in Manhattan, spends something like $100,000 to ornament the plaza of the Seagram Building, placing 224 fir trees (with 50,000 lights) in the pools that flank Mies van der Rohe's landmark.
"It recognizes the community element of that property," said Philip R. DiGennaro, managing director of the insurance company. "That's part of the allure, part of the quality of the building. Independent of that, I think we would recognize the holiday season with prudent, cost-effective, decorative displays that reflect our pride in the product. Maybe it's a bit of preening on the part of the owners, but keeping marble polished isn't a wasteful expenditure. It goes to the quality of the product."
"I like to think of it as a continuity of investment through good and bad cycles," he said. "It's fun to do, it enhances the building and adds to the enjoyment of the tenancy."
Tenant enjoyment was also a consideration for Equitable Real Estate, a subsidiary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. It functions as the landlord at the Paine Webber Building, which was formerly Equitable's headquarters. In 1988, Drew Masters, the vice president of asset management, was looking for a way to distinguish the tower during the holidays. "We wanted something significant and prominent for the property, yet sophisticated," he said. He found a nutcracker at a gift shop in Wilton, Conn., and that was reproduced on an enormous scale by Arnold Migliaccio & Sons of the Bronx.
"It's a nice gift to the people in the building, as well as people in the city," said Jerry I. Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, managers of the Paine Webber Building.
More oversized soldiers can be found at Cartier, which may be the most ornamented commercial property, inch for inch. "We've heard about this so-called recession," said Ralph Destino, the chairman of Cartier, "but have chosen not to participate."
"EVEN with aspects of gloom and doom lurking around us," he went on, "I think the spirit of Christmas -- and all that it implies -- happily remains unbowed and undaunted. I haven't seen any evidence of people saying, 'Let's save money and cut out Christmas trees.' The hardest of hard-nosed financial guys would recognize that this is not the place to cut back."
That may be true on Fifth Avenue, but the West Side Chamber of Commerce has sponsored only one holiday tree, at Broadway and 72d Street, instead of the usual four, saving some $12,000. "People are having difficulties," said Andrew Albert, the chamber's executive director, "and it's tough to get those contributions."
Across town, Margaret Ternes, executive director of the Park Avenue malls project, said: "As far as funding is concerned, it is down. All the real-estate people on the avenue have donated as always. They're very, very supportive. But some of the off-Park Avenue owners have not contributed this year. I see that as a way of saying, 'Business is down, rentals are down and it's something we don't really have to do. We'd like to, but this may not be the year to do it.' "
This is apparently the last year for the illuminated snowflake at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street that was created by the Douglas Leigh Organization and unveiled in 1984. Its appeal tends to diminish the closer one gets, when its wires and structural elements stand out and its massiveness becomes apparent.
"It's intrusive and it's not esthetically pleasing and it's not fun," said Bobbie Handman, vice president of People for the American Way and a member of Community Board 5. "It hangs, almost like a sword, over what I consider to be one of the most jovial corners of New York at Christmastime."
In October, the board unanimously approved the reinstallation of the snowflake this year but noted in an amendment from Ms. Handman that it "anticipated a new design with the next application."
"I'm redesigning it as we speak," said Dennis Dady, vice president of the Leigh Organization. "I'm making it more appealing for the up-close public."

HEADLINE: Disputes Threaten Plan to Control Flooding

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: MAMARONECK

 BODY:
RESIDENTS in the village of Mamaroneck say they often feel caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, especially when the two rivers that flow through this coastal community, the Mamaroneck and the Sheldrake, overflow their banks.
The village is at the lowest geographical point of the Mamaroneck-Sheldrake watershed, which drains areas of Westchester as far inland as Harrison. The two rivers converge in Columbus Park in the village, sometimes with such force that parts of the adjacent railroad station parking lot have been turned into an inland sea. 
 The last serious flood in the village occurred more than a decade ago, but it nearly paralyzed the downtown business district and caused damage estimated in the millions of dollars. While flood-control experts said there was no way to predict when the next serious flooding would occur, they said it was inevitable and that as new development upstream increased the runoff, the flooding was certain to become more devastating.
 
U.S. Reviews a Proposal
 The Federal Government has agreed with those experts, and a $72 million flood-control plan is receiving its final review in Washington. This comes 12 years after the Army Corps of Engineers began investigating the problem, proposed corrective steps and completed a $3.1 million design for a solution, which includes widening the Marmaroneck River to accommodate additional water volume.
The project had been on hold for eight years, when Congress passed the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. This allowed projects nationwide to proceed, but at an additional cost because of inflation during the delay.
Final Federal approval of the project could come early next year, but two long-dormant local conflicts now threaten to delay the plan again.
 
A Town-Village Dispute
 Village officials are locked in a dispute with town officials over the responsibility for five stone bridges over the Marmaroneck River that would have to be widened to accommodate an enlarged river channel.
At the same time, the state and the village cannot agree on how to share responsibility for the $18 million part of the project's cost that will not be picked up by the Federal Government. Federal law stipulates that 25 percent of such projects must be paid for locally, but the state has not established a formula to govern how local costs are to be divided in such projects.
Widening the bridges will cost an additional $12 million, Federal and state engineers estimate, a financial burden that village and town officials hesitate to shoulder. Although the town concedes that it owns the bridges, officials there insist that village money must be used to expand or replace them because the village has maintained them for 50 years.
Village maintenance crews have repaved the surfaces of the bridges, posted weight limits and even closed a bridge, town officials said. The village of Mamaroneck does not dispute that. But Mayor Paul J. Noto said: "We are not in the bridge business. The law is very clear: bridges and cemeteries are the exclusive responsibility of towns, not villages."
 
The Mayor Draws an Analogy
 Although the village has conducted some "minor patchwork" on the bridges, Mr. Noto said, "that action by no means constitutes a change in ownership."
"If we plow Route 1, that doesn't mean we own Route 1," he said, referring to the state-owned thoroughfare through the village. So far, a rule of convenience has operated to say who does what chore.
Each municipality has appointed a committee to negotiate with the other, a move that Stephen V. Altieri, the town administrator, said had led to some progress. The biggest question, he said, is determining the interests of town taxpayers, many of whom do not live in the village's flood zone.
Part of the village of Mamaroneck is in the town of Mamaroneck, which also includes all of the village of Larchmont and part of the village of Rye Brook. The rest of the village of Mamaroneck is in Rye. Town officials provide all municipal services to the unincorporated areas of the town, but only limited services, like recreation programs and certain election services, to the villages.
 
But What Role for the State?
 Even if village and town leaders can resolve their financial responsibility for the bridges, the state's financial role must be addressed for the flood-control project to proceed. "Our portion could be considerable," Mayor Noto said. "We are extremely concerned, and we are asking ourselves if we can afford to participate at all."
Village residents complain that without a set formula, a local government like the village of Mamaroneck could be responsible for most of the $18 million local share.
"It's a very difficult situation," said Richard L. Kensella, chief of flood-control projects for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation. "The village wants to know why the state isn't helping more. Until a formula is specified in law, how can we?"
During the last two sessions in Albany, legislation has been introduced to set up a formula, but the measure has been bottled up in the Assembly. A similar bill will be introduced at the next legislative session, said a spokesman for Ronald C. Tocci, the Assemblyman who represent the village. Mr. Tocci's bill would divide local costs equally between the state and the county, a proposition that county lobbyists in the state have opposed.
 
A Local Alternative Is Rejected
 Mayor Noto and the Village Engineer, Les Zakarin, have considered a locally designed and financed alternative, but Mr. Noto said any flood program the village could afford would not be comprehensive enough to solve the problem. In addition, a local program could jeapordize continuing involvement by the Federal Government, he said.
"It isn't just the people whose homes and businesses are wiped out by flooding who are hurt," said Mr. Kensella of the D.E.C. "The entire region and its whole transportation network will be disrupted."
He warned that "the da'nger gets greater and greater" as development continues in the upbasin above the village. "But although the problem is getting worse," he said, "it's getting less close to a solution."

HEADLINE: Campus Life: San Francisco State;
An Unusual Class Puts Students On the Street

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Passing Beverly Ovrebo's course on homelessness takes fortitude, compassion and a warm jacket, say many of her students at San Francisco State University.
For one of her class projects, the associate professor of health education asks students to empty their pockets of money and to become homeless for a day. Considering the subject matter, she says, the streets are just as appropriate a place to study as her classroom. 
 Professor Ovrebo began teaching what she says is the nation's first undergraduate seminar on homelessness three years ago. She said that separating the homeless from their condition brings them "a step closer" to getting them off the streets.
"Experiencing homelessness," she said, "is necessary to getting a handle on that situation."
 
 'It's Really Degrading'
 Linda Kocher, a 20-year-old sophomore from Santa Cruz, Calif., majoring in social sciences and Spanish, chose a warm November to fulfill the class requirement. She said she slept in her clothes "to get a feel for what it was like to be homeless."
"It's really degrading," she said. "You're ignored by everyone. I learned that homeless people are human, too. Now, when I see them, I talk to them, and if I have money, I give them some."
When Grace Olshansky became a street person for a day in October, she said her tattered jeans and old sweatshirt drew some "real looks" from residents as she wandered down the streets and alleyways of the city's tenderloin district.
"I was surprised at how easy it was to identify with the homeless people," said the 26-year-old junior from San Francisco, majoring in pre-med. "I think there was some real camaradarie that developed after being there for only a few hours."
 
Sleeping on a Park Bench
 Another student, 24-year-old Stephen Williams, a junior from Eugene, Ore., majoring in English literature, said he forgot his coat when he spent an evening outdoors for the class. "I realized how vulnerable I was," he said.
Not all of Professor Ovrebo's students spend the night outside. Some choose to be homeless during the day, while others spend an afternoon or evening outdoors. A few have slept on a park bench or under a bridge at night.
In the three years she has taught about homelessness, none of her students have been robbed or hurt. To protect her students, Professor Ovrebo encourages them to take a friend. "I tell them not to put themselves in any jeopardy," she said.
She has helped to begin two classes on homelessness since 1988: a one-semester course examining homelessness and public policy and a five-week seminar called "Outta Control," which introduces students to issues and attitudes about homelessness.
 
Seminars on Homelessness
 In both classes, students participate in a series of exercises, including asking a passer-by for a quarter, keeping a journal of their experiences and applying for unemployment benefits.
Professor Ovrebo also helped organize the Bay Area Homelessness Program, a coalition linking 10 colleges with social service and government agencies. The group tackles issues of the homeless in quarterly seminars.
Homelessness is increasing in the San Francisco Bay area, officials say. In a market so expensive that only 10 percent of San Franciscans can afford to buy a home, 230,000 people are homeless, Professor Ovrebo said.
"There are still a lot of misconceptions -- that people choose to be homeless or that they are the undeserving poor," said Professor Ovrebo. Those misconceptions "can be turned around."

THE ECONOMY
 
The Federal Reserve, at Long Last, Steps Forward
 
First the economists worried about a recession. Then the retailers and industry executives. Then the President. Finally, the only one besides Saddam Hussein who can actually do something to stimulate the economy acted. For the first time since he became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1987, Alan Greenspan agreed on Tuesday to cut the discount rate, by half a point to 6.5 percent. The Government has few other anti-recessionary medicines in its cabinet. President Bush and Congress are trying to reduce the yawning deficit by cutting spending and raising taxes, a Hooveresque combination. Economists doubt the Fed's new course will immediately cause businesses and consumers to spend, borrow and rejoice. Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover, called last week's action "the first in a series of steps the Fed has to take to curb a recession." The next cut, he said, could come as soon as next month.
 
Consumer Prices Rise Modestly
 
The Fed's rate cut followed the comforting news that consumer prices rose only three-tenths of 1 percent in November. The core rate, without food and energy, rose by the same percentage. Economists pointed to stabilizing energy prices and an economy too weak to allow producers to pass along their own higher costs, up five-tenths of 1 percent the same month. Lower corporate profits are likely to result.
 
Trade Deficit Widens
 
Foreign trade, one of the few recent sources of economic strength, is turning against the United States. The nation's trade deficit widened to $11.6 billion in October, the worst monthly showing in two and a half years. A weak dollar raised exports to a record. But higher car imports and expensive oil raised total imports a great deal more.
 
Should Weak Banks Pay More?
 
L. William Seidman's hospital for sick banks may turn out to be more like a hospice. Mr. Seidman has proposed that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which he heads, charge higher premiums to weaker banks. The new scale would discourage risk-taking and speculation, analysts say, but also force many banks to combine. He also suggested to Congress last week that his agency's dwindling insurance fund -- likely to lose $5 billion and approach insolvency next year, he said -- could be bolstered by increasing premiums across the board and charging a one-time assessment of $25 billion, or $1 for every $100 in deposits. Some analysts said that such a heavy charge -- about equal to the entire industry's peak annual profits, in 1988 -- would be easier to impose over about five years.
 
K.K.R.'s Patient Money
 
Nothing like an economic downturn and a sour "junk-bond" market to turn Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company into a patient investor. The firm said last week that it plans to ask holders of $752 million in RJR Nabisco Inc. junk bonds to accept cash and stock, valued at $5 a share, in return. In effect, Kohlberg, Kravis is letting the public invest in its RJR leveraged buyout, the largest ever, at the same price the firm paid for stock in 1988, and $1.25 less than it paid for shares earlier this year. One Kohlberg, Kravis partner said his firm might need five to seven years to take its profits from the deal, more than twice the time it took a few years ago.
 
America's Edge on Digital TV
 
American companies have taken the lead in developing digital, high-definition television systems that can broadcast over ordinary, local channels. Japanese and European systems have to transmit by satellites instead. Last week, Zenith Electronics and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company became the third American group to announce plans for developing digital television.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Soviet Ship Off Course
 
It was during a quiet vacation stroll on the beach in the Crimea, during the dangerous Brezhnev years, that Eduard A. Schevardnadze broached to Mikhail S. Gorbachev the need for thorough economic reform. Last Thursday, Mr. Schevardnadze angrily quit as Foreign Minister, warning of a national march toward dictatorship. "He was one of the good guys," said Ed A. Hewett of the Brookings Institution. "It sends a signal that one of the most prominent founders of perestroika had decided that the whole ship is off course." As party secretary in Georgia, Mr. Schevardnadze took opinion polls, allowed plants to elect managers, uprooted the party's corrupt minions and introduced profit-sharing. As Foreign Minister, he became a sort of Soviet James Baker -- a confidante on matters far beyond his portfolio. Mr. Hewett said that Mr. Gorbachev might be able to bring Mr. Schevardnadze back into his Government, but only after "four or five months of enormous chaos."
 
China's Little Board
 
In China, they might call it "the little board." A new securities exchange opened in Shanghai on Wednesday with prices displayed on a small electronic screen. Most trading will be in bonds, primarily Governments, because many officials put more faith in the state.
 
 
 
COMPANIES


Citicorp's Quarter of Discontent
 
The examiners examined, and Citicorp executives executed a sharp dividend cut and a moderate increase in reserves for bad loans. The biggest United States banking company plans to lay off 4,400 more workers, cut its quarterly payout from 44.5 cents to 25 cents a share and take a fourth-quarter loss of $300 million to $400 million. Analysts had feared that the bank examiners, who finished their annual look at Citicorp last week, would demand much higher reserves, resulting in deeper losses. Now many analysts say that Citicorp has not set aside nearly enough. But Frank R. DeSantis Jr., an analyst at PaineWebber, said the company faces no crisis. "Citicorp is more right than analysts give them credit for, and more wrong than they think they are," he said. "It will be a muddle-through strategy rather than capitulation."
 
More Banks With Losses
 
Other banks buffeted by problem loans: The NCNB Corporation said earnings will fall from $447 million to $360 million this year, with an especially weak fourth quarter. The Bank of Boston, having lost $255 million in the third quarter, expects another, though smaller, loss in the fourth, and the C&S/Sovran Corporation expects to at best break even in the quarter. And bondholders asked the Bank of New England to swap 92 percent of the company's common stock for a $605 million reduction in debt.
 
Problems With Going Public
 
Alex. Brown & Sons, the venerable Baltimore brokerage, has had a strong record of taking fledgling technology companies public. Then it tried financing other industries, becoming Wall Street's leading underwriter of initial public offerings, raising more than $2 billion this year. But several issues, especially in retailing, have flopped. Silk Greenhouse Inc. sells artificial flowers, and Alex. Brown sold its stock last year at 17 1/4 a share. The retailer has since filed for bankruptcy protection and its stock has wilted to a few cents a share. Last week, the executive who made the brokerage a leading underwriter stepped down. Donald B. Hebb Jr. resigned as president of Alex. Brown Inc., the parent company, for reasons that a spokesman called "totally unrelated" to issues like Silk Greenhouse. The company lost $3.1 million in the third quarter, though it expects a profit for the year.
 
Pan Am Accepts T.W.A.'s Offer
 
Pan Am World Airways conditionally agreed on Friday to combine with Trans World Airlines, its historical rival in travel overseas. But Pan Am, nearly broke, asked the T.W.A. chairman, Carl C. Icahn, for a loan to keep it flying until regulators and shareholders approve the deal. Mr. Icahn offered $375 million for Pan Am earlier in the week. He said he first wants Pan Am to file for bankruptcy protection, guaranteeing him priority repayment for any subsequent loan. Mr. Icahn hopes to weld two weak airlines into one strong one. T.W.A. and Pan Am both lack the domestic networks to feed their international flights. Both airlines have agreed to sell their prized London routes, Pan Am to United Airlines last month, and T.W.A. to American Airlines last week. American would pay $445 million to T.W.A., which Mr. Icahn needs both to buy Pan Am and to pay down his airline's debts. "It was a great deal," said Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Brothers. "The routes are far more valuable to American than to T.W.A." British authorities are less enthusiastic, saying they will allow American and United to use London's Heathrow Airport only in return for major United States concessions.
 
Savings and Loan Chiefs Guilty
 
Final exam, Accounting 201: As the owner of the Vernon Savings and Loan Association of Dallas, you want to impress board members and clients. But where on your operating statements can you safely list payments for the California beach house and the prostitutes? Don R. Dixon, Vernon's owner, is likely to have many years behind bars to figure out the answers after his conviction Thursday on 23 counts of fraud. For benefiting from his own mishandling of loans worth $41 million, he faces as much as 120 years in prison and fines of $560,000. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials thumped their chests and issued the usual statements about the vindication of their strategies. But the Government is unlikely to recover more than a sliver of the estimated $1.3 billion that Vernon's failure will cost the taxpayers.
 
Another Dallas savings and loan executive agreed to plead guilty on Friday in a failure that was even more costly. Edwin T. McBirney 3d, the former owner of the Sunbelt Savings Association, faces a maximum prison term of 15 years and fines of $8.5 million on charges including fraud and tax evasion. The Government is spending an estimated $3 billion to cover Sunbelt's losses.

HEADLINE: Drinking Salt in the Dawn

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
If there has been a theme to Seiji Tsutsumi's remarkably varied career, it has been finding opportunity in alienation.
As an angry young student at prestigious Tokyo University, Mr. Tsutsumi rebelled against his autocratic father, a top conservative politician, by joining the Communist Party. But instead of suffering permanent social ostracism for this affront, he used the experience as the basis for a popular autobiographical novel, one of whose climactic moments has the protagonist shouting during an anti-Korean War rally: "Get your hands off, Imperialists! We will never be Truman's mercenaries!" 
 Later, when the department store his father ordered him to open in Los Angeles flopped, his response to the humiliation was also characteristic: "I wrote a poem," recalled the impish, 63-year-old Mr. Tsutsumi, an unassuming man in a three-piece blue suit and his trademark shy smile. "I called the city the farthest spot on earth from civilization." And he eventually won a top literary honor for doing so.
But his greatest feat of alchemy was in the pioneering business empire he created from his bitter inheritance. Left with just a third-rate department store -- the rest of his father's railroad, hotel and real estate holdings went to a half-brother, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, the son of one of the old man's many mistresses -- Mr. Tsutsumi slowly built it into one of Japan's most innovative retailers, Seibu Department Stores.
With a combination of marketing gumption and avant-garde advertising -- one television ad for Parco, a retailer Mr. Tsutsumi created, simply showed Faye Dunaway eating a hard-boiled egg -- the stores have succeeded by peddling a product rare in Japan: individuality. But Mr. Tsutsumi did not stop there. Seibu is now just the core of what is called the Saison Group, a sprawling and largely private retail, travel, financial and property development conglomerate.
 
'Season of Wandering'
 In the process, Mr. Tsutsumi (pronounced tsoo-TSOO-mee) has put together a billion-dollar fortune and an impressive body of writing, under the pen name Takashi Tsujii, with titles that aptly express the sense of alienation he has come to represent, like "In the Season of Wandering," "The Circumference of Unrest" and "Poetry, Poison, Roaming." He is probably the only person in Japan, or any other country, taken so seriously as a writer and a business magnate.
The tale of a great fortune built partly out of the ruined estates of former Japanese nobility, intra-family rivalries, trysts with geisha and forlorn poets seems like the stuff of a racy novel. In fact, this real-life drama speaks volumes about Japan's quiet but powerful transformation over the past decade into a services-based economy, and the new personalities bubbling to the surface in the ferment of this consumer boom.
The boom is in large part a product of a five-year-old Government policy to turn domestic consumption, rather than exports, into the engine of economic growth. Encouraging people to enjoy more leisure activities by reducing the work week to five days is among the initiatives taken to get workers to save less and consume more.
In the services realm, where the sizzle is often more important than the substance of what is sold, vivid characters like Mr. Tsutsumi are transforming themselves into effective marketing symbols.
"The fact that we have behaved differently from others has been the main force behind the Saison Group to date," Mr. Tsutsumi commented, sitting amid the contemporary art in his spacious and sparsely decorated white-on-white office, 48 floors above the northern Tokyo neighborhood of Ikebukuro, where his original store is located.
That formula and the group's spectacularly rapid growth have also bred an almost un-Japanese level of confidence. Many of the group's executives clearly feel they have far exceeded their one-time mentor -- Sears, Roebuck & Company. Executives from Mr. Tsutsumi's retailing companies used to go to Sears's headquarters in Chicago for training. And Mr. Tsutsumi said he was spurred to undertake his frantic diversification by Sears's moves nearly a decade ago into securities and real estate. But, said one of Saison's executives, "We surpassed the teacher in many ways."
 
A Mountain of Debt
 Even so, it is becoming apparent that Mr. Tsutsumi has been better at creating than managing. His expansionary zeal has been aided by a genius for intuiting fads and a willingness to use his own artistic image as a marketing tool. But it has also been marked by a hard-driving style that sometimes leaves his executives terrified and by a virtual mania for delving into new businesses. And that has left him with a mountain of debt. With interest rates having doubled in the past 18 months, the pressure is on.
"This is a very fast plane flying very low to the ground on very little fuel," said Mike Allen, the retailing analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, stockbrokers.
The Saison Group, with 124,000 employees, had net sales in the fiscal year that ended last March 31 of $31.8 billion. It declines to release earnings numbers, nor will it disclose its total debt. But a look at some of the major components gives an indication of the debt's magnitude. Seiyu, the group's supermarket chain, had consolidated bank borrowings of $6.9 billion as of February, nearly 10 times its shareholders' equity of $725 million. Figures were recently leaked to a magazine here showing that the private Seibu chain, Japan's largest department store operator, had another $2.5 billion in debt, which was supported by operating profits of just $28.8 million in the last fiscal year.
Because of these pressures -- and the fact that Mr. Tsutsumi has said he is slowly withdrawing from active management -- the Saison Group is now at a crossroads. It can no longer afford to simply add to the unusual conglomerate that Mr. Tsutsumi created, analysts say. Instead, it must focus on making the parts work together.
Indeed, behind the torrid growth rate and its attendant risks is Mr. Tsutsumi's still unproven belief that the more than 100 businesses he controls will naturally weld themselves into a complex "information network" that will enhance the value of the whole. Information garnered through the group's credit card and retailing operations, for instance, is supposed to help determine a customer's travel and housing needs.
That was the theory behind Mr. Tsutsumi's boldest acquisition, the purchase of Inter-Continental Hotels two years ago for $2.2 billion, much of which had to be borrowed.
"It was typical of Seiji that he was willing to throw the company into something new, even though the price was more than we could really justify by the returns alone," said Yuji Tsutsumi, Seiji's younger half-brother, who left Yoshiaki's Prince Hotel chain after a dispute and became chairman of Seiji's Inter-Continental operation. "We didn't just get assets; we bought into a business network. Without taking advantage of all the synergies, this is not a good deal."
 The Saison Group also has a number of joint ventures, ranging from Sears, in insurance, to Thomas Cook, the British travel company, and France's Club Mediterranee. Last April, Saison and Hermes, the French fashion house, formed a venture which controls Jean-Louis Scherrer, another French couture house.
One key problem facing Saison is Mr. Tsutsumi's habit of forging loose links between group members; some companies are less than 25 percent owned by Mr. Tsutsumi or his entities. The ties involve strategic coordination and the pull of his personality.
"It's true that the existence of the group owes a lot to the personality of Mr. Tsutsumi," said Seiichi Mizuno, the recently named president of Seibu. "But gradually, it is hoped that the members of the group will function more individually and with cohesion as an organic entity, even without Mr. Tsutsumi. This is not a conglomerate, but an organic entity, like a living thing."
The 44-year-old Mr. Mizuno, a thoughtful man with a salt-and-pepper mop of hair, is rumored to be heir apparent.
He proved his mettle helping launch Seed and Loft, two new stores that, with hip graphics and trendy merchandise, deepened the group's image as being in touch with fashion-conscious Japanese youth. And Mr. Mizuno also happens to be Mr. Tsutsumi's brother-in-law. Even that tale is unusual.
More than a decade ago, Mr. Tsutsumi sought to marry a former geisha, now Asako Tsutsumi, after divorcing his first wife, Motoko. The union would have been socially unacceptable, so he corrected the problem in a time-honored fashion, arranging for a prominent friend to adopt her. That gave her the legitimacy needed for the marriage.
The maneuver was a throwback to an era of delicate samurai etiquette. The friend was Shigeo Mizuno, also a former Communist, who put in place the pieces of what later came to be called Fujisankei, a major media group. Mr. Mizuno is Seiichi's father.
 
Dizzying Array
 Part of the Saison Group's current difficulty is that it takes something of a poet's mind to fathom the links between the dizzying array of companies Mr. Tsutsumi has assembled. They make tofu, steel and fertilizer, build and run resorts, operate supermarkets, build homes, run one of the country's largest credit card operations, import Chryslers and Head sporting gear, trade oil products and run restaurants.
"If you examine them closely, you can see that he really runs a big venture capital business," explained Takayuki Suzuki, who was an executive at the group for 20 years and now is a retailing analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. "They use their assets to borrow money and then use that to finance a broad range of new businesses."
One effect of the current transition is that more members of the group are likely to go public to boost their finances. One candidate: Inter-Continental Hotels.
"That would be an exciting opportunity that we would consider seriously," said Yuji Tsutsumi. Saison has already sold a 40 percent interest in the hotel operation to Scandinavian Air Systems for $500 million, but is still trying to ease the debt burden. "For the time being, more help is needed in financing what it has to do," Yuji conceded.
In the meantime, the hotel operation is undergoing a rethinking in which it will expand in Eastern Europe through its Forum chain, and move some of its other hotels slightly down-market to appeal to a younger Japanese clientele, Yuji explained. It is also spending heavily to refurbish some of the older hotels.
"I don't know if you can manage a group like that, in the end," said Barclays's Mr. Allen of a strategy that would make some parts of the business public and others not. Added Merrill Lynch's Mr. Suzuki, "What they really need to do is make the parts work together finally."
If Saison can pull that off, say some observers, the payoff would be enormous. "They are now getting to a point where they can begin harvesting the seeds they have sown," said Segio Sugioka, a noted retailing expert who said he had long been a skeptic about the group because of its weak bottom line, low wages and haste in expanding.
"In the short term," he added, "the group will probably be in the red because of their debt, but over time, the accumulation of capital will be gigantic. These are mostly high cash-flow businesses, and they are in areas where the Japanese economy is growing fastest."
That area is consumer services. The service sector now accounts for more than 60 percent of gross national product, nearly equal to the level in the United States.
Saison, in fact, has helped define a new generation of restless consumers searching, with their wallets full of yen, for the image of soulfulness and individuality that Mr. Tsutsumi has projected onto his companies.
"The largest benefit for us in being part of the group is what happened to our corporate image, which came from just being associated with the name," said Masato Suzuki, president of I&S, an advertising agency that joined the group a few years ago when Mr. Tsutsumi acquired a large minority stake.
That is a sign of the times here. Young consumers have emerged from Japan's headlong rush toward economic dominance with a growing appetite for the one thing most Japanese companies are ill-equipped to provide -- meaning. Mr. Tsutsumi has made an art of satisfying their urge to feel they are more than cogs in Japan Inc.
 
Spicy Tidbits
 It does not hurt, of course, that tales of his longstanding rivalry with his brother Yoshiaki -- one of the wealthiest people in the world, with a fortune estimated at $7 billion -- fill the press here, including spicy tidbits about the notorious womanizing of their father, Yasujiro, who was known as Pistol for his willfulness and quick temper.
Pistol Tsutsumi built his fortune in railroads and property before World War II, then expanded it significantly afterward, in part by snapping up the holdings of financially ruined members of the nobility. His Tokyo Prince Hotel rests atop what had been the cemetery of the Tokugawas, the family that ruled Japan for 270 years as military dictators, or shoguns.
Seiji Tsutsumi's soft-edged public image is set off by Yoshiaki's reputation as a dictatorial manager. While Yoshiaki is often seen counseling leaders of the conservative ruling political party, Seiji's advertising company, I&S, produced an innovative and amusing campaign for the opposition Socialist Party in the last election, despite his professed distance from politics now.
Mr. Tsutsumi admitted in an interview that some reports of the brothers' feuding are slightly exaggerated, but serve the purpose of keeping them in the news. "When it comes to magazines, peace doesn't make articles," he said.
Some who work for Mr. Tsutsumi say his benevolent public image does not quite square with reality either. "He is a very cynical person and can be brutal in his criticism," said one long-time executive. "The image he projects to the outside and the image he projects to the inside are quite different."
A widespread complaint is that he sometimes resides in his own world and can be difficult to understand. "Even being his brother, it's sometimes hard to know what he's getting at," said Yuji Tsutsumi, who nonetheless credited Seiji with having a keen sense for marketing.
All the same, he has been a remarkable phenomenon. His presence at Saison will be hard to replicate for a new generation grappling with an uncertain future.
"We all see the centrifugal forces at work, so we need a center," said Mr. Mizuno. "Up to now, we have been able to maintain the group because of Mr. Tsutsumi's character. His strong presence acts as the centripetal force holding it all together. You might get the impression that he's a kind of czar, but that's not the case. Rather than holding it together with power, he holds it together by allowing people freedom to give play to their individual abilities. I think that's a very important part of the group that we must preserve somehow."
 
 
A FEW WORDS ON LOS ANGELES
 Seiji Tsutsumi has spent his life building a literary career as well as a business empire. Under the pen name Takashi Tsujii, he published the following poem, "Letter From America," in 1964, shortly after returning from several months in Los Angeles, where he failed in trying to establish a Seibu department store. The poem, which first appeared in a book called "Letter With No Address," was translated by Hisao Kanaseki and Timothy Harris.
 
Steel sheets flow out in long belts
 Keeping a quiet rhythm.
 The evening glow paints the sky a flaming red.
 People line up who have forgotten they were once created by people
 and flow like magnetic sands on a magnet.
 There, on the continent that was proclaimed to be new,
 love is no more than a crudely fashioned machine.
 I, like you, am alone
 and drink salt in the dawn.
 
 People seek solace in far fields,
 leaving the cities at a hundred miles an hour.
 They eat exactly the same food,
 importing chopsticks from the Orient,
 cooked raspberries from Alaska,
 creating fads which denounce fads,
 only faintly remembering that they,
 as embryos,
 looked like fish, turtles, bulls.
 Tropical rhythms beat out
 from speakers built into walls, coating the glittering steel.
 I am alone.
 You are alone.
 In the conference room
 the gavel shrieks of everlasting prosperity.

GOING AFTER THE NATION'S YOUTH
 A GOOD place to see the Saison Group's heady stew of marketing, retailing and property development in action is Tsukashin, a shopping center it developed in Osaka.
With studied care, the outdoor shopping center groups numerous stores in a casual pattern to create the organic feeling of a village, with a large Seibu department store acting as an anchor. But the most important element is a church.
That is an odd sight in this Buddhist and Shinto country. And no matter that it is used mostly for weddings. Seibu's planners recognized that in the popular mind, a church conjures up an appealing image of quaint American or English towns. It lends an unthreatening foreign touch that Japanese consumers generally find irresistible.
Seibu's transformation of Shibuya, a central Tokyo neighborhood, is another example of the group's style.
Several decades ago, the area was well known for its massage parlors, peep shows and dark bars. Seibu first built a large department store there, and then added several of its newer retailing offshoots: Parco, which houses a jumble of fashion boutiques in a single building; Loft, which sells housewares, sporting goods and gifts; Seed, a fashion shop laid out in a trendy "dramatic space," and Wave, a pulsating music store.
Over time, the combination of stores transformed the area into a magnet for younger Japanese. Marked by the Seibu chain's avant-garde buildings and bright graphics, all in Roman letters, Shibuya has become a major shopping district.
Shibuya now provides a type of controlled chaos that allows young Japanese to feel they are expressing themselves, but in a tame way that weds their restlessness with the habit of consuming.
"Nowadays, youth would like to rebel against their fathers, or any fatherly figure," said Seiji Tsutsumi, Seibu's chairman. "They want to say, 'I'm different,' but not fight or overcome or pull their fathers down, as in the days when fathers were real barbarians, real dictators."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Old St. Alan's Gift: A 30-Minute Trading Spree

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
It was almost Christmas, and so the time was right for a present from the Federal Reserve. Even more nicely, it came with a little candy cane for traders who could act quickly.
The Fed's decision last week to cut the discount rate, at which it lends to banks, was announced half an hour before the markets closed. That gave quick traders time to buy before the slower ones could react, and thus to make a little money. The Fed used to made such announcements when markets were closed, but this time it evidently wanted to stimulate a quick reaction. 
 It succeeded. Prices of stocks and bonds zoomed within minutes, but by the next day it was back to dull markets, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended the week up 39.85, to 2,633.66, a four-month high but not far above the level reached minutes after the Fed acted.
One explanation for the short-lived nature of the rally was that President Bush took time out from the minority scholarship mess to proclaim that he would not soon fight for lower capital gains taxes. Who'd have thought it? The President plays Scrooge, while the Fed chairman puts on the Santa Claus suit.
There is not, to put it mildly, a lot of holiday cheer in the financial district. The banks and the brokers, who used to be eager to invade each other's turf, now seem to be competing to see who can lay off more workers, and there is a widespread belief that a lot of pink slips are being delayed until after the holidays.
It was that glum atmosphere that the Fed set out to cheer, and it was appropriate that it threw in a little something extra for the traders. For this was a year in which almost everything went down.
The important question, of course, is what impact the Fed's easing will have on the economy. The banks should be helped, as lower interest rates are passed on more rapidly to depositors than to borrowers. And maybe lower rates will help some borrowers to survive.
But those lower rates for depositors will also mean falling incomes for a lot of Americans, notably retirees. And it is unlikely that borrowing will soon pick up, A.T.& T.'s $6 billion line of credit notwithstanding. "The banks have nobody to lend to," says Chuck Clough, Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist. Or, to be more precise, nobody who is sure to pay them back. Mr. Clough thinks short-term rates will fall sharply.
This recession has hit the hardest at financial services, but there are signs that all service industries are in trouble -- McDonald's is experimenting with discounted hamburgers. "The inventories of service industries are people," notes Mr. Clough, who foresees many more layoffs.
Still, there are reasons for hope, even if they are hard to see on Wall Street. The manufacturing sector has not caved in, and exports are rising nicely. Inflation is under control despite Saddam Hussein and the Fed evidently is serious about trying to get business moving. Its actions may not help much very soon, but in the current depressed environment, any piece of good news ought to be treasured.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
A Paper Company That Loves Itself

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
In the interest of full disclosure, the author of this column is a biblioholic whose favorite possessions are all catalogued in the Library of Congress and whose patron saint is Elbert Hubbard. Mr. Hubbard, writing almost a century ago in The Philistine magazine, warned that "this will never be a civilized country until we expend more money for books than we do for chewing gum." His disciples see a bookstore purchase as a contribution to the advancement of civilization.
The odds are that those purchases, seasonal and otherwise, also contribute indirectly to the coffers of the P.H. Glatfelter Company, an utterly endearing corporation based in Spring Grove, Pa. The Glatfelter people, in business for more than 125 years, make the paper that makes the books that fill the shelves and shopping bags of America. 
 But while the rest of us have been buying books, the Glatfelters have been shopping, too -- for their own shares, traded on the American Stock Exchange. The company apparently thinks its stock is a fine long-term investment. And some savvy Wall Street investors agree.
 While paper and forest product stocks have recently begun to outperform a sluggish market, paper manufacturers generally are not a popular choice when recession is at the door because they are seen as incurably cyclical, zigging and zagging with each spasm in the economy.
However, P.H. Glatfelter is not really in the same boat as, say, the Weyerhaeuser Company or Georgia-Pacific. Its specialty is uncoated publishing papers of all sizes, with a growing sideline in recycled printing stock. Jean M. Auel's latest best-seller, "The Plains of Passage," is printed on Glatfelter's recycled paper, for example, and the company has supplied the stock for countless Book-of-the-Month Club editions, including Anne Rice's "The Witching Hour" and Steven King's "Four Past Midnight." Indeed, about 30 of every 100 pages bound between hard covers these days are made by Glatfelter.
While this niche business is less cyclical than the market for commodity grades of paper, no one in Spring Grove, or on Wall Street, would suggest that the Glatfelter company is immune to hard times. (It is not unfamiliar with them either; surviving the Great Depression with one's business more or less intact probably puts today's economic downturn into perspective.) Although the company managed to generate strong sales in the first nine months of this year, earnings were lower than in the same period last year, as higher labor costs and lower product prices have squeezed profit margins. The current quarter looks strong, said M. Alanson (Jake) Johnson 2d, the company's chief financial officer, "but obviously, we don't know how tough it will be going forward."
Nor is the Glatfelter company untouched by the increasing concern about the environment. Long careful with its production processes, it plans to spend about $125 million over the next few years to make its Spring Grove pulp mill more nature-friendly. Even for a company with 1989 sales of more than $600 million, that is real money.
But there is one current problem this old-fashioned company does not worry about: the credit crunch. It seems to view debt the way an intelligent teetotaler views alcohol -- a substance with some rare medicinal uses, but one that should never be employed on a habitual basis. The company borrowed $179 million in May 1987 to buy the Ecusta Corporation, which makes the wispy-thin paper sold to cigarette manufacturers. The therapeutic purpose was to expand the company's business into a more recession-resistant line. And by September 1989, the loan was fully paid off.
At the same time, the company has sustained a pace of growth in its sales and earnings that would be the envy of many heavily leveraged companies. Analysts for Mabon, Nugent & Company note that Glatfelter's average annual return on equity and return on assets over the past decade "are the highest in our paper universe, outpacing the group averages by 50 percent and 90 percent respectively." They expect Glatfelter to generate a 20.7 percent return on shareholder equity this year, dipping to a still-respectable 17 percent next year.
But Joseph V. Battipaglia, director of research for the Gruntal Company and an early Glatfelter fan, says the most intriguing thing about the company is how it chooses to use its spare cash. It buys back its own shares -- by the millions.
By 1985, after numerous stock splits, Glatfelter had about 25.8 million shares outstanding, adjusted for subsequent splits. Today, it has just 22.6 million shares outstanding. And last Wednesday, its board authorized the repurchase of another 1 million shares through open-market and private transactions over the coming year.
 In October, Mr. Battipaglia noticed that Glatfelter had purchased 800,000 shares from Ruane, Cunniff & Company, the Wall Street investment firm whose nose for investment values is nearly legendary. (He sees no bearishness in this sale, by the way; Ruane, Cunniff still owns about 2.5 million of the company's shares, making it one of Glatfelter's largest stakeholders after the heirs of the founding family.) The transaction, done a bit below the market price of about $33.50, cost nearly $27 million. "They paid cash," Mr. Battipaglia said. "They just cut a check. And they're still debt-free."
It would be hard to argue with the past wisdom of investing in Glatfelter. Adjusted for splits, the shares climbed almost nine-fold during the past decade, and closed on Friday at $41.25. Prior to 1985, the company, wanting to improve the liquidity of its shares, had avoided buybacks. "By then, though, that wasn't as big a concern," Mr. Johnson said. "And we had been running around like chickens with our heads cut off trying to find good acquisitions, and none of them measured up to the value of our own company. Finally we said, 'Here's a good company right here.' So we started buying."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
A Last-Minute Gift List

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Looking for a cheap last-minute Christmas gift? Joel Tillinghast has some ideas. Mr. Tillinghast manages the $80 million Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund, a grab bag stuffed with stocks that sell for less than $15.
While small stocks have taken a real beating this fall, his quirky picks have enabled his fund to take less of a hit than its peers. The fund, which celebrates its first birthday this week, was down 3.1 percent at the end of November. That compared to an 8.9 percent drop for the 77 small-company stock funds tracked by Morningstar Inc., Chicago-based mutual fund consultants, and to a 21.8 percent drop in the NASDAQ index. 
 One reason is that the 32-year-old Mr. Tillinghast runs a defensive portfolio. When the market sours, most small-company funds fall through the floor. But Mr. Tillinghast's fund, despite its focus, "is a legitimate value-oriented fund, not an aggressive, bouncy type," said Eric M. Kobren, publisher of Fidelity Insight, an independent investment newsletter based in Wellesley, Mass. "Over the long term, he'll do well."
There is certainly a market for low-priced stocks. Curious investors support 20 or so newsletters about them, proving that these stocks have a built-in constituency.
Fidelity's has a $15 cutoff for purchases. And low stock prices give a boost to the fund's philosophy: Buy low (very low); sell high. Its small-company turf is a natural segue from Mr. Tillinghast's apprenticeship with Morris Smith, who was running Fidelity's Over-the-Counter Fund when the two worked together in the late 1980's. (Mr. Smith, of course, now runs Magellan). Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Tillinghast look for growth companies at value prices; Mr. Tillinghast gets an extra bang because of his bargain-basement prices, "like the people who bought Chrysler for $4 in the early 80's," he said.
Clearly, he can sniff out value. Stocks in the fund sell at eight times earnings, compared to a marketwide price/earnings ratio of 12. The median market capitalization of companies in the portfolio is less than $50 million.
 The fund's biggest bet is a basket of British utilities; 18 percent of the fund's assets are wrapped up in four British water companies privitized by the Thatcher government about a year ago: Northumbrian Water (current price, roughly $5.55), Welsh Water ($5.35), Southwest Water ($5.10) and Severn Trent Water ($4.60). Mr. Tillinghast says the companies have strong balance sheets, sell at only five times earnings and yield about 7 percent. Unlike American utilities, these have a chance to soar: After five years of heavy spending by the utilities to upgrade the mediocre British water, the Government is allowing them to jack up water prices.
One of the fund's first holdings was Frederick's of Hollywood, the Beverly Hills-based retailer that sells mainly lingerie. When Mr. Tillinghast bought the stock last winter, the price had sunk to $8 because of problems with its retail stores: "They had too many sex toys, which kept the average customer away," he said. Management has since refocused sales on lingerie and given the stores a "better-lit, more romantic atmosphere," said Mr. Tillinghast, who sold his shares for $10.
 He also has invested in Thomas Nelson Publishers ($10.375), a bible and religious-gift company based in Nashville. "This seems to be a counter-cyclical business -- when the economy gets tough and people are depressed and troubled, they turn to religion. So business is very good right now." He expects earnings to grow about 20 percent over the next two or three years.
 Ryan's Family Steak House ($5.625), a Greer, S.C.-based restaurant chain, has "the highest ratio of food cost to revenue in the country," Mr. Tillinghast says. For customers, that means getting a big meal for the average $6 dinner ticket. The company is almost debt-free and internally finances expansion of new restaurants at rate of 15 percent annually, Mr. Tillinghast says. He expects earnings and sales to rise 19 percent a year over the next five years.
His smallest holding is Bingo King ($2.625), based in Littleton, Colo., a company that manufactures Bingo equipment, has a market capitalization of $7.5 million and sells at five times earnings.
 In financial services, Mr. Tillinghast likes the United Federal Bank Corporation ($8.875) in State College, Pa., which sticks to the local market, an economically stable college town, and does "little wild real estate speculation," he said. It has a ratio of 18 percent equity-to-assets, triple what is needed for a savings and loan to be called well capitalized, and less than 1 percent of its assets are in non-performing loans, he said.
The Grant Street National Bank ($0.41) in Pittsburgh, is a spinoff of the Mellon Bank designed to get all of Mellon's bad assets off its books. It has paid off nearly all of its debt in the past two years, and management gives quarterly estimates of the liquidation value after all sales are completed. The latest: 90 cents a share, or more than double the share price.
 Can't decide what to buy? Buy a piece of the fund itself ($9.35); there is no sales charge, but the minimum investment is $2,500.

 
 
INCOME FUNDS OUT OF SYNC
 For the first half of 1990, the total returns for domestic and world income funds moved in tandem. But that reversed sharply in the third quarter, largely because the value of the American dollar plunged against foreign currencies. There is an unmistakable nervousness among investors about the strength of the domestic economy and the risks down the road.
What comes next? After the dollar falls far enough, American exports become cheaper and the economy picks up steam. At some point, the dollar will stabilize and the funds' performance should move into approximate alignment again.
No one knows when that will happen, of course; investors must make their own bets about which way the dollar is headed. But you can remove some risk from the equation by staying with short-term funds, which are less subject to price fluctuations than the long-term ones.

HEADLINE: Four Formulas for Avoiding the Mess in Banking

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Like a container of rotten food that makes an entire refrigerator smell bad, the problems of troubled banks are casting a pall over the industry.
But only about 1,000 of the nation's 12,400 banks are in serious enough trouble to be labeled by regulators as "problems," although their troubles are great enough to threaten the solvency of the Government-run deposit insurance fund. Their problems also obscure the fact that nearly 90 percent of the country's banks are still earning profits. Many banks are even managing to increase profits despite the weakening economy and problems with commercial real estate loans. 
 Four good examples of this are First Wachovia Corporation in Winston-Salem, N.C.; State Street Boston Corporation in Boston; Banc One Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, and BankAmerica Corporation in San Francisco. There are other successful banks, but these four illustrate how careful management and a focus on specific lines of business have helped companies avoid banking's current problems and left them poised for additional growth and profits.
The successful formulas in banking, many of which these four banks have skillfully adopted, are not deep secrets. Banking executives often cite four elements: The most important is the ability to avoid making bad loans, which seems obvious in an industry where just a 5 percent default rate is a sign of serious trouble, but is nevertheless at the root of problems at many banks.
Another is the presence of a strong consumer business that provides a stable source of deposits on which low interest rates are paid to depositors while offering opportunities to make high-interest loans. The third is development of fee-producing businesses, like corporate cash management accounts or credit card service systems.
Finally, many successful banks have learned the importance of the diversification of business by geography and product.
These successful strategies may not necessarily endure into the 1990's. A change in Federal law to allow banks to be owned by other kinds of businesses has been widely discussed in Washington. It would probably attract new investors with different ideas about making money in banking.
"If bankers do not keep up with changes, even their good busineses could become the dinasaurs of the 1990's," said James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm.

 
 
FIRST WACHOVIA
A Strategy Of Moderation
 When bankers talk about First Wachovia Corporation, the conversation invariably turns to the company's exemplary record of avoiding bad loans.
Based in Winston-Salem, N.C., First Wachovia eschewed the rapid growth in commercial real estate lending and financing of corporate takeovers in the late 80's. In 1987 and 1988, for example, when other banks rapidly expanded their commercial real estate lending because they saw no other way to generate profits, Wachovia pulled in the reins. "I was a little unpopular with some of my colleagues by saying it was time to slow down on real estate," said John Medlin, Wachovia's chairman.
But now, with defaults mounting on commercial real estate loans across the country, Wachovia is reaping the rewards of a lending system that relies on the separation of powers -- and competition between -- lending officers whose bonuses are based in part on how many loans they can issue and loan administration officers whose job is to make sure bad loans are not issued. In the last year, the company has been charging off as a loss less than half of 1 percent of its loans, a significantly lower rate than other large banks in its region.
To supplement its lending business, Wachovia has invested heavily in corporate cash management products -- such services as helping companies conserve cash by paying bills at the last possible moment -- and became a leader in this area. As a result, the bank can open doors at large corporations that might not otherwise consider doing business with a bank that ranks only 29th in the country.
Mr. Medlin said the stable, predictable flow of fee-producing businesses, like servicing student loans and credit card fees, which provided about a third of the company's total revenues of nearly $1.2 billion in 1989, "helps take some pressure off lending and gives us the luxury of not having to be aggressive at times when credit and pricing terms are deteriorating."
The years of successful lending have strengthened Wachovia's balance sheet to the point where it has more than twice as much shareholder capital as the minimum set by Federal regulators.
But Wachovia is more than just a skilled lender. Its diversified business includes a network of 363 branches, giving it more than a 20 percent share of North Carolina deposits and a 14 percent share in Georgia, where it bought a large bank in the mid-80's.
Bank officials like to say they bring a "high tech and high touch" philosophy to consumer banking. For example, Wachovia provides branch officers with a computer system that allows them to call up the file on every customer account. Each customer in North Carolina also has a personal banker who is qualified to handle every kind of consumer product a customer might want. Bank officials say such an approach and the bank's reputation for financial strength helps account for the 13.3 percent gain in consumer deposits over the last year.
 
Against the Grain Into the Global Market
State Street Boston Corporation has set two remarkable records this year. It managed to increase profits in the first nine months of the year despite the severe economic downturn in New England; and it has greatly expanded its foreign operations with four new offices, at a time when other banks are closing foreign offices and laying off staff.
As the nation's largest custodian and trustee for mutual funds and pension funds, State Street has long been a familiar name in the investment world. It is custodian for about 40 percent of the over $1 trillion of securities held by American mutual funds, and is the largest custodian and trustee for corporate pension funds.
The handling of securities and related record-keeping jobs in recent years produced a steady stream of profits that kept the company so occupied it was not tempted to plunge deeply into the lending business. Fiduciary fees, which now account for slghtly more than two-thirds of total revenues in 1989 of $676 million, grew 28 per cent annually in 1984 through 1989, and are up another 14 percent to $280 million in the first nine months of this year.
Although fees could decline as securities prices fall, State Street has been countering that possibility by developing a broad array of products related to its bread and butter record-keeping and safe-keeping businesses. State Street's executives believe the same companies that use it to keep track of pension fund investments might also need a cash management service, require foreign exchange trading, or need to hire State Street's trust department, the eighth largest in the country, to make investment decisions.
State Street is already the largest American bank that invests clients' funds abroad so that they equal the performance of foreign stock and bond markets. William S. Edgerly, the bank's chairman, said the bank's top priority is increasing its share in the global custody business of providing pension funds and others with the information they need about foreign exchange and securities markets to coordinate investment activities around the globe.
Although many larger banks are also pushing for the global custodian service business, State Street said it has kept pace. "Our focus on this business is better than some other very large banks that have fully diversified product lines," Mr. Edgerly said.
Like other New England Banks, State Street has been hit by a rash of loan defaults as the New England economy turned down. But the relatively small amount of lending, now $2.6 billion, or only about 18 percent of assets, compared with 60 percent at other banks, has kept the problem manageable. Losses from writing off bad loans nearly doubled to $32 million in the first nine months compared with a year ago, but the company still reported a 13 percent increase in profits, to $86 million from $76 million.
According to Mr. Edgerly, about 90 percent of State Street business lending is to New England middle-market businesses, an activity that he says will continue, despite recent setbacks. The company is almost completely out of the consumer loan business. It does not make home mortage or installment loans and recently agreed to sell its $425 million of credit card loans to the Household Corporation, a transaction that generated a profit of $60 million.
 
BANK ONE
Geographic Diversity In the Middle of the Road
 Ten years ago, Banc One Corporation was hardly known outside Columbus, Ohio. Today, after acquiring dozens of large and small banks, it is the nation's 24th largest banking company and a leader in the Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin and Texas markets.
The geographic diversity of its business -- something that many larger banks have yet to achieve -- is complemented by self-imposed restrictions that limit its lending to local consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses. "When you limit yourself to consumer and small business loans, it's a lot harder to get into trouble," said John B. McCoy, Banc One's chairman. "If a $50 million loan goes bad, you feel it. But it takes an awful lot of small bad loans to equal one of those big losses."
All the banks operate with identical accounting structures and must make monthly reports of results and projections. This allows early identification of problems and promotes what company executives see as a healthy competition among the banks.
After a decade of acquisitons and rising profits, Banc One has accumulated enough capital so that it now holds $9.20 of shareholders capital for every $100 of assets, after adjusting for risk of the assets. This is more than twice the minimum Federal regulators have said they will require beginning in 1992, placing Banc One near the top of the industry.
Banc One's executives believe a key part of the success has been the development of technology to help the bank provide better service to customers and operate fee-producing businesses that further diversify the company's sources of income. In 1989, for example, its credit card business and record keeping and processing it does for others had revenues of $81.1 million. Other businesses, like its new system allowing members of the National Tire Dealers Association to run a quick credit check while a new customer's tires are being mounted, produced fees of $136.1 million, not counting fees on deposit accounts.
To replace its old accounting system, Banc One has joined Electronic Data Services, a subsidiary of General Motors, in a $100 million project to develop a new generation of computer software for record keeping.
"We want a system that tells us more about our customers than just their account file," said John Russell, the company's senior vice president. With more information, the bank could, for example, adjust the prices of various products depending on the customer.
 
Building Business On Consumer Service
 BankAmerica Corporation, with 850 branches in California and a rapidly growing network in nearby states, epitomizes the benefits of a well-honed system for collecting consumer deposits and making consumer loans.
The stable base of consumer deposits was vital to the company in the dark days of 1985-1987, when it lost more than $1.8 billion and was struggling with more than its share of bad loans and a costly overexpansion into foreign markets. Having survived that crisis and cut its foreign presence to 40 countries from 76, BankAmerica is focusing again on its local market, where its branch system and the strength of the California economy produced more than $1.1 billion in profits in 1989.
Much of the improvement came from changes in managing the branch system. "We moved a lot of people and operations out of the branches and into specialized regional centers," said Frank Newman, chief financial officer. "It's not a brilliant new idea, but we did it very intensively."
Routine accounting tasks like reconciling customer accounts have been shifted to 20 regional centers where economies of scale are greater. The same system has been applied to the lending business. The bank has five centers for processing home mortgage applications, four centers for other consumer loans and eight centers for business loans. Branches still help consumers fill out loan applications, but the evaluation of the applicant and the decision on the loan are done in the processing centers.
The result of these back-office changes has been the reduction of noninterest expenses as a percentage of interest and fee revenues to 61.9 percent in the third quarter of 1990, from 83.6 percent in the second quarter of 1987. A median level for the country's 50 largest banks is 65 per cent.
BankAmerica remains one of the nation's most active lenders to large corporations and is benefiting now from an ability to collect higher interest rates and fees as more banks abandon that business. Within California, it has reorganized its lending to small and midsized companies by keeping commercial loan officers only in 50 strategically placed branches. By eliminating loan officers in areas where opportunities are not great, it no longer has lenders who are tempted to justify their existence by making loans that eventually turn sour.
Flush with the profits of its California business and of the Seafirst Bank in Washington, which it bought in the mid-80's, BankAmerica is pushing to diversify the geographic base of its consumer business. In the last year it has spent more than $400 million to buy eight savings and loans or savings banks, adding 127 branches in Arizona and 66 in Oregon, two states where it had been active but did not have a branch.
Richard Rosenberg, an alumnus of Wells Fargo & Company who became chairman of BankAmerica earlier this year, talks of the day when laws are changed to allow nationwide banking and BankAmerica can take full advantage of an intangible asset -- its name. "Don't forget," he likes to say, "This is the Bank of America."

HEADLINE: A Hot Market Emerges for the Third World's Bad Loans

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Behind the third world debt crisis, a market is bubbling.
The trading of the debt -- the swapping of often steeply discounted loans for cash, other loans or equities -- has grown in less than a decade into a $70 billion-a-year global market. While that is not big by the standards of foreign exchange, bond or stock trading, it is not bad either for a lot of paper that until this year was declining in value. 
 But this year, trading prices for the loans of most of the biggest debtors have been rising with a vengeance. The debt market has even been strong enough to rebound from the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis, a feat unmatched by the world's bond and stock markets and the dollar. Mexican debt is now trading at 45.625 cents per dollar of face value, up 30 percent for the year, and Argentina's debt, long one of the poorest performers, is up 70 percent, to 20 cents on the dollar. Of the major debtors, only Brazil has seen a decline.
"If you threw darts at the beginning of the year, you could not have lost money," said Giacomo de Filippis, one of the originators of debt trading while working for an Argentine bank and now head of his own firm in New York, Giadefi Inc.
Giving the market its lift are a number of ongoing economic restructurings that seem to augur a turning point for much of Latin America, which holds about 29 percent of the $1.3 trillion in third world debt.
The market has also gotten a boost from the debt-relief program initiated by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Under the Brady plan, several countries have had their debt burden reduced and have converted old loans into new bonds that are more attractive to investors because they are backed by international guarantees. As a sign of the growing acceptance of the debt-trading market, Mexico's so-called Brady bonds last week got their first rating from Moody's Investors Service Inc.
Besides causing debt prices to rise, the economic restructurings are altering the market's character and scope, offering new opportunities not only for some of the debtor countries but also for the big Western lenders who wrote off billions of dollars of loans in recent years when it became clear they would never be repaid.
Until recently, the debt has largely been the medium for a traditional trading market, a place in which Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Morgan Guaranty, Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan, Bank of America and hundreds of other banks could try to improve the value of their bulging debt portfolios or just shed them. These trading operations, along with those at some investment banks, have also been used to speculate on the movement in debt prices, producing enough income so that some institutions, like Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, have highlighted the profits in their earnings reports.
Now, because of the economic turnabouts that have begun in Chile, Mexico and Venezuela, commercial and investment bankers are opening up a traditional corporate finance business in a debtor's setting, a move that could well spread to Eastern Europe. Two venerable investment banks, Morgan Stanley Group and Goldman, Sachs & Company, have been lured into the business this year.
IN some cases, the bankers are packaging the debt held by a number of lenders -- including themselves, at times -- and swapping it for shares in state-owned companies being sold to the public, like Entel, the telephone company in Argentina. As part of the deal, the new owners often infuse the privatized company with cash to modernize or expand.
In other cases, the bankers capitalize on their ties to the third world to be hired as traditional advisers in raising new capital. MG-First Boston Asset Trading acted in this capacity when Mexico's state-owned development bank went to the Eurobond market this year to raise $100 million.
While privatizations have buoyed the debt market in the past, they have never been conducted on such a scale or with such commercial appeal. In the last two years, privatizations and traditional corporate finance deals have brought $18.4 billion to the five major debtors in Latin America, according to Salomon Brothers's John F. H. Purcell.
"This is the transition year," said Peter R. Geraghty, senior vice president in New York of NMB Postbank Groep N.V., a Dutch bank that is one of the major debt traders. "The market evolves. The trading market is not the be-all and the end-all. It is now M.& A. and corporate finance."
The move away from trading for trading's sake and toward corporate finance is a logical one, banking experts say. The deals provide attractive fees for the bankers. They are also less risky than playing the debt market and, for the large debt holders, provide another avenue for getting rid of debt.
"If Mexico and Brazil and other countries turn around, then this market becomes the old, traditional, humdrum capital-raising business," said Peter Woika, a managing director at J. P. Morgan & Company, the parent of Morgan Guaranty.
The success of the business depends, of course, on the success of the economic restructurings that are going on. As long as the programs, like those in Mexico and Venezuela, move ahead, there will be a market for raising cash or doing privatizations.
But if they are set back -- and Brazil is having new problems less than a year after the start of its austerity program -- then the business could dry up.
DEBT trading is a product of the debt crisis that began in 1982, when it became obvious that many third world countries would not be able to pay back the huge loans that Western banks had made to the governments.
At first, the trading took the form of simple swaps. A bank would consolidate its debt portfolio, trading off debt from Chile, for example, for that of Mexico, a country in which it had more confidence. Some banks, especially smaller ones, then decided to get rid of the risk entirely, and sold debt for a portion of its face value.
Some privatization deals in Brazil, Chile and Mexico helped give the market another rationale in the mid-80's, but these debt-for-equity deals came and went.
The biggest boost for the market came in May 1987, when Citibank bowed to reality and became the first big bank to set aside reserves for anticipated losses from third world loans. Other banks followed, making the trading of debt at less than face value much easier.
By the end of the 80's it was obvious that banks were unwilling to lend new money to the debtors. It was also obvious that some reduction of the existing debt level would have to be accepted as part of a solution to the crisis. To this end, the Bush Administration in March 1989 announced the Brady plan, which offered debt reduction to countries that were restructuring their economies to reduce inflation and lift trade barriers.
In July of that year, Mexico reached an initial agreement on a proposal for a 35 percent reduction in its debt and the exchanging of the old loans for the Brady bonds. This deal was finalized last March, at the same time that Venezuela reached its own debt reduction agreement. Other deals have been reached with the Philippines, Costa Rica and Morocco.
Dealers in third world debt are hoping that the Brady bonds will make the market attractive to larger numbers of investors, even retail customers. The bonds come with guarantees on interest and principal and can be repackaged into a number of financial products with broad appeal.
New bond and debt funds, like the Latin American Investment Fund Inc. at Salomon Brothers, are trying to attract such business but most dealers think the wider appeal of this still-risky market will take more time to develop.
DEBT traders have many of the accouterments found in big-league trading rooms. There are computers on their desks and prices on the computers. They have the toys that traders collect, like the baseball bat and hand weights on Stephen W. Dizard's desk at Salomon Brothers and the joke doll stuck to the window of the trading room at Bankers Trust Company. Last week, they even formed their own trading association, a sure sign of arrival.
The market is maturing in other ways, too. Prices for buying or selling debt are getting easier to obtain.
But the market still does not have the pace or the size of its bigger cousins that deal in equities and bonds. When Henry Ansbacher & Company, a merchant banker involved in debt trading, had its Christmas party this year in London, the market there ground to a halt. And debt trading is far from a 24-hour game, even though traders are based around the world.
Indeed, debt trading is far from a full-fledged market. Prices may be easier to obtain, but there are no guarantees a quote will be available when a trader needs one. And traders must be prepared to negotiate even when they see a broker's quote on a computer screen, because those prices are not firm, as they are in the stock and bond markets.
Traders must also be aware of potential conflicts of interest since some of the big banks that trade debt also are involved in negotiating debt reductions under the Brady plan.
"A market has wide distribution of assets and information and a complete network of market makers and brokers," said Nicolas Rohatyn, a managing director of J. P. Morgan and head of the firm's loan transaction unit. "None of that exists here."
But now that the action in third world debt is turning more toward corporate finance, those shortcomings may be less glaring.
"You're looking at finite issues to finite people: one-of-a-kind deals," Mr. Rohatyn said. "This is more of a business than a market."
 
 
 
NEW MARKET, NEW ABUSES?
 Every financial market has the potential for abuse and the growing debt-trading market is no exception.
One of the most hotly debated aspects of the market concerns banks that trade the debt of a given country at the same time that they negotiate a debt reduction agreement with that country. Critics see an inherent conflict of interest in this practice, one that could allow the banks to profit from inside information.
Bank executives strongly deny the potential for abuse, contending that they keep their trading and negotiating operations separate. As evidence, one banking company, J. P. Morgan, says its traders took a major loss in 1989 when Morgan announced an increase in its reserves to reflect the worsening condition of its debt portfolio. The traders were holding large positions of the debt, whose prices tumbled.
Allegations of another type of potential abuse are the subject of an ongoing Federal grand jury investigation looking into the possible diversion of funds at the debt-trading operation of the Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Bank.
The investigation was prompted by a report given to bank executives early last year by several traders at Security Pacific in which they described a pattern of transactions involving a fellow trader, Antonio M. Angotti. Mr. Angotti, they said, sold debt at below-market prices to friends at other institutions, who then sold the debt at the market price.
Earlier this month, the Swiss Bank Corporation and NMB Postbank Groep N.V., a Dutch company, confirmed that they had been subpoenaed in connection with the investigation. Both companies said they are not targets of the probe.
Security Pacific, which conducted its own investigation of the allegations, closed down the New York-based debt-trading operation in April 1989. The bank says its investigation revealed nothing "requiring further action."
Rita E. Hauser, a lawyer for Mr. Angotti, denies that her client did anything wrong. She added that the Security Pacific investigation cleared Mr. Angotti, who left the bank after the trading operation closed to become a White House fellow.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
The Dow and a Decade of Discount Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom is that the Federal Reserve Board delivered a giant Christmas gift to Wall Street last week by cutting the discount rate a half-point, from 7 percent to 6.5 percent. And figures collected by the archivists at Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in New York, show how such assumptions arose.
Not counting this recent action, the Fed has cut the discount rate by a half-point or more on 25 occasions during the past decade. The Birinyi folks checked to see where the Dow Jones industrial average stood three months after a major discount rate cut. And, in 18 of the 25 cases, the Dow was higher. Pretty reassuring, huh?
But before you uncork the champagne, look carefully at the record during the brief economic downturn in the first half of 1980 and the much deeper recession that began in July 1981 and continued through November 1982. Despite a lot of pushing and shoving from the Fed, the market didn't start to rebound until the recession was nearly over. Aspirin, anyone?

HEADLINE: All About/Smelling Good;
Two Crucial Days In Scent Peddling

BYLINE: By JOSH KURTZ

 BODY:
EVERY holiday season, the fragrance industry gets nervous. With more than 50 percent of annual sales taking place in the weeks before Christmas -- most in the last two days -- fragrance companies are like children wondering how bountiful their holiday will be.
 With more than 800 fragrances on the United States market and a notoriously fickle public, the companies seldom experience the blissful state their products are meant to induce. The industry always seems hyperactive, introducing an average of 60 new products a year. And in the past 18 months, many industry giants have found themselves with new owners or altered fortunes. This holiday season is the first in more than 25 years that Avon Products Inc., the perennial leader in women's fragrances, has not been No. 1. 
 Marketing is the key. Industry executives say that in a $25, four-ounce bottle of scent, the fluid and bottle cost the maker about $3.75. Add on marketing and some profit, and it goes to the retailer as about $15, where another marketing/profit chunk is added.
 
The Players
Unilever Outstrips Avon and Revlon
 The new ruler of both the men's and women's fragrance markets is Unilever N.V.-P.L.C., the Anglo-Dutch consumer products and chemicals conglomerate. Unilever built its lead the 1980's way: by taking over other companies. It stormed into the fragrance business in 1987, and in 1989 alone, spent more than $2 billion to acquire companies including Faberge Inc., Elizabeth Arden Inc. and Calvin Klein Cosmetics, the maker of Obsession and Eternity perfumes. Analysts expect more acquisitions to come, as Unilever seeks to preserve or extend its lead.
In the still-fragmented $1.83 billion-a-year women's fragrance market, Unilever, with a 12.6 percent market share, now seems secure. But its closest competitors, Avon and Revlon, are not far behind.
At Avon, some investors have been making a stink about the stock's fall from $41 a share in mid-1989 to about $27 recently. On Dec. 3, Chartwell Associates, an alliance of dissatisfied Avon shareholders, urged the company to repurchase $500 million of its common or preferred shares. Chartwell, which holds 26.2 percent of Avon's outstanding common stock and 19.8 percent of the voting shares, has hired Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. for advice. Avon's chairman, James E. Preston, said he would not respond until his committee on ways to enhance shareholder value releases its report in January.
Third-place Revlon, meanwhile, introduced a major new fragrance this year. It's Unforgettable, considered revlon's most ambitious start-up since Charlie, launched 16 years ago. It comes in a skinny bottle that looks like an Art Deco skyscraper and at a price of $23 for a 1.6-ounce bottle, higher than most other Revlon fragrances.
Revlon officials said the product was launched to capitalize on the company's "Unforgettable Women" advertising campaign, which has featured actresses Melanie Griffith and Susan Lucci, and Barbara Sinatra with her well-known husband.
The company -- led by Ronald Perelman, the master of leveraged buyouts -- has come under criticism for its stodginess, its reliance on low-priced fragrances and the steep discounting of its "junk bonds." With Unforgettable, "they finally decided to do something after 17 years," said Andrew Shore, a fragrance industry analyst at Prudential-Bache.
The smaller men's market, which includes aftershaves, has gone through some reformulation as well. In July, the Procter & Gamble Company bought the toiletries and fragrance division of the Shulton Group -- makers of Old Spice, the leading men's fragrance -- from the American Cyanimid Company for $370 million.
Under American Cyanamid, Old Spice and other Shulton products had stagnated because the company hesitated to spend on the necessary marketing, analysts say. Cyanamid's profits from the Shulton Group dropped from $52 million in 1988 to $18 million a year later.
Both the Shulton sale and the Avon shareholders' dispute are likely to help these companies in the long run, analysts say, by sharpening their focus and adding energy.
 
The Battlefields
From Glitzy Aisles To the Drugstore
 Like many fragrances today, Unforgettable can be bought in huge department stores like Macy's, in elegant boutiques and in discount drugstores like Duane Reade, an aisle or two away from mouthwash and dental floss. Some industry executives question whether a product loses its luster when it is so readily available. Not so, says Annette Green, executive director of the Fragrance Foundation, a trade group.
"Every industry is going to have to go where the customers are, not where they want to be," she said. "You can't just be in the Bergdorf Goodmans."
The biggest sales battles are fought on department store floors. Major retailers depend on cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances for about 9 percent of their sales, said Joseph Siegel, director of the National Retail Association's merchandising division. "That's why impulse items, like fragrances, are generally on the main floor," he said. "People go out of their way to buy furniture. They don't go out of their way to buy a tube of lipstick.
The fragrance companies are so intent on securing prime space for their products that they often pay retailers for prominent displays, and supply their own sales help. Retailers often have to referee squabbles among fragrance companies for the best positions.
"A lot of it is based on the expected volume level," said Michelle Williams, group fragrance manager for Bloomingdale's in New York. "We want to present to the customers what we think they're looking for."
Counter position, fancy bottling and ambitious marketing may mean nothing in an economic downturn. Consumers who until recently boughe different fragrances -- for work, recreation and romance -- are scaling back, buying just one. "In good times, you're willing to experiment with two or three scents," said Mr. Shore. "But not now."
Ms. Green is less pessimistic. "Everybody cries the blues in December until the last 48 hours before Christmas," she said. "We're probably on firmer ground than a lot of product categories. It's a gift that doesn't break the bank. And it's always easy for men to buy, because you don't have to get a size or a color."
 
The Tinkering
Trying to Please Fickle Consumers
 Since the late 1960's, fragrance buyers have become notoriously disloyal, adopting and abandoning new products as fast as the companies could turn them out. This year, along with a less-robust economy, the fragrance industry has suffered from an apparent shift in consumer tastes. Just as the new decade has brought an end to many excesses and indulgences, women's tastes in fragrances have become moderate and simpler.
"The passions and poisons and obsessions of the world have given in to the florals," Mr. Shore said. "We have definitely seen a return to the classics." Some of the beneficiaries of these trends, he said, are two long-popular Chanel products, No. 5 and CoCo, and another old reliable, Shalimar, from the French cosmetics company, Guerlain.
This hasn't stopped the industry from tinkering. International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., the nation's leading developer of scents, did $870 million of business in 1989 and works on hundreds of different products at a time, sometimes for competitors. Launching a new fragrance is no easy proposition; it can cost manufacturers $5 million to $30 million, depending on the amount of marketing.
The next olfactory fad, analysts say, will be "behavioral fragrances" -- mintier products that will be marketed to suggest that they make people more alert or give them a spiritual lift. Sarah Friend, director for fragrance evaluation at International Flavors, doubts that they will truly have such miraculous powers. But they might make people feel good. "You don't need a Ph.D to tell me that putting orange flowers in your tub is going to make you relax," she said. "You wear fragrance to give yourself a lift."
Lift, it would appear, lies in variety. "There are so many fragrances on the market today," observed Ms. Green, "it's nose-boggling."
 
 
 
IN GROWTH, IT'S A MAN'S WORLD
 Insects and animals have their own mating scents, and some humans do, too, at least those of the male variety. In a recent Gallup Organization survey of 808 men for the Fragrance Foundation, 21 percent identified what the foundation called a "killer cologne" as their choice to wear when trying to attract members of the opposite sex.
In the United States, women's fragrances still far outsell men's, by $1.83 billion to $860 million last year. But the men's total represented a 7.5 percent gain from 1988, compared with 5.2 percent for women. "Men are recognizing that vanity is not a terrible thing," said Andrew Shore, a fragrance industry analyst for Prudential-Bache. In the Gallup survey, 89 percent of the men said they had used aftershave or cologne in the previous six months, and half said they used it five times or more in the week before they were interviewed.
Indeed, the men's market appears to have the greatest potential for growth, a factor behind the Procter & Gamble Company's first major foray into the fragrance business, which took place this year. P.& G. bought up the toiletries and fragrance division of the Shulton Group, the maker of the venerable Old Spice aftershave and cologne, which is the perennial fragrance leader among men.
Procter & Gamble, with marketers reknowned for making the best of a good thing, is determined to increase Old Spice's market share. P.& G. has already launched a vigorous advertising campaign, reviving the popular Old Spice "Mariner Man," who last stepped ashore on television eight years ago.
When the company announced its Shulton purchase earlier this year, P.&.G. chairman and chief executive Edwin L. Artzt hinted that further acquisitions are in store. "The male toiletries and fragrances markets have great growth potential," he said, "and Old Spice represents an outstanding first entry for us."
P.& G.'s main competition comes from Unilever N.V.-P.L.C., the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group. With an old standby, Brut, and newer, higher-priced products like Calvin Klein and Obsession for Men, Unilever enjoys the largest market share, although a by no means dominant one.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
An Ominous Warning

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker; Anna Quindlen is on vacation. 

 BODY:
No one can imagine a Soviet foreign minister surprising Josef Stalin by the sudden announcement: "I quit." Thus, the startling resignation of Eduard Shevardnadze demonstrates that a considerable degree of freedom and democracy has been achieved in the Soviet Union -- a point not to be denigrated.
That makes it all the more ominous, and poignant, that Mr. Shevardnadze specifically said he was resigning to "protest against the onset of dictatorship" -- which he characterized as "approaching." 
 Secretary of State James Baker promptly responded that Washington viewed the resignation as a "warning . . . to be taken seriously," and obviously that's what it was. But as a warning against what? Those who might replace Mikhail Gorbachev? Or Mr. Gorbachev himself? Or a warning to him?
There's no doubt that the Gorbachev Government has been slow and uncertain in moving from the old, discredited Communist dictatorship toward democracy and a market economy. As a result, severe tensions have been generated in Soviet society, on the part of those who want faster movement toward reform as well as those who cling to old ways and old positions. Mr. Gorbachev is under sharp criticism from both groups.
More economic deprivation than Soviet citizens have been accustomed to also has resulted from his failure to organize a new system in time to replace the old -- or at least to establish rudimentary new economic functions. The resulting discontent has been made worse by the long-festering resentments -- which, ironically, now can be politically expressed -- of the various nationalities forcibly included, years ago, in the Soviet Union.
Nor are hard-line elements, including some military leaders, necessarily pleased by the remarkable external achievements of the Gorbachev regime -- which has relinquished the old puppet states of Eastern Europe, allowed the peaceful reunification of Germany and accepted greater military limits and more cooperation in its agreements with the U.S.
In his warning against dictatorship, Mr. Shevardnadze undoubtedly meant that some or all of these unhappy elements might combine to impose a new authoritarian regime, no doubt justifying themselves by claiming to "restore order" or "end chaos." These have been the slogans of dictators everywhere.
He did not make clear whether he feared that such a combination might overthrow Mr. Gorbachev and seize power, or if he interpreted recent events to mean that Mr. Gorbachev might try to call upon such elements to support increased power for his own Government. A close reading of The New York Times text of Mr. Shevardnadze's speech seems to me to disclose, however, a warning to Mr. Gorbachev that an effort to impose democracy forcefully could destroy democratic reform and turn into renewed dictatorship.
The resignation itself supports that interpretation. If Mr. Gorbachev's closest associate feared his overthrow, he would hardly abandon the battle before it really began. Mr. Shevardnadze, moreover, after declaring his devotion to Mr. Gorbachev and to his policies, and recalling that together they had done "great work in international affairs," added a pointed word: "but." In this context, his deliberate "but" almost certainly had the meaning of "yet" or "despite that."
"But I think that it is my duty [to resign] . . . I cannot reconcile myself with what is happening in my country and to the trials which await our people."
The phrase "what is happening" again seems to suggest that Mr. Gorbachev's reform plans are coming too close for Eduard Shevardnadze's comfort to an authoritarian effort that might suppress rather than achieve democracy.
On the other hand, Mr. Shevardnadze said that if his fears came true, "No one knows what this dictatorship will be like, what kind of dictator will come to power and what order will be established." Or perhaps that, too, was a warning to Mr. Gorbachev that he might not be able to control any reactionary forces he might attempt to harness to his own support.
This apocalyptic warning, as James Baker said, has to be taken seriously by the U.S. No doubt some Americans will urge a return to a hard-line anti-Soviet policy; but that would only encourage Soviet hard-liners to take their own action. For the moment, Washington has little choice but to support Mr. Gorbachev any way it can -- while hoping that he also takes seriously Mr. Shevardnadze's warning to him, if that's what it was.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 6, 1991, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transmission error, an article on Dec. 23 about the resignation of Eduard A. Shevardnadze as Soviet Foreign Minister rendered a quotation from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev incorrectly. According to Izvestia, Mr. Gorbachev said, "And even after everything I said, I don't want us to decide now that Shevardnadze is 'written off' and, so to speak, goes off into history." The use of a partial quotation, "Shevardnadze is written off," distorted its meaning.

HEADLINE: Sanctions Just May Avert War With Iraq

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Economic sanctions and the supporting blockade in effect against Iraq are dull stuff, and they suffer for it. Sanctions fail to engage the emotions. There is nothing that Americans can see and no distinct daily events to give us a sense of progress or failing. Dan Rather visits the troops in the desert and on the deck of naval ships, but how is he to visit sanctions? There is nothing to show on the television screen: no glamour or heroics. Just dull talk about Iran's declining gross national product and the drying up of its trade with the rest of the world.
Small wonder that many people grow impatient with sanctions and doubt their effectiveness, and that President Bush is "tired of the status quo" (front page, Nov. 24). Impatience lies beneath the debate about the risks and costs of sanctions, whether or not they will achieve our objectives, and how long they should be relied on to pressure Iraq into leaving Kuwait. I suggest America's experience with recent wars offers a useful and contrasting context for thinking about these questions.
When the Korean and Vietnam wars began, there was no certainty about the outcome. We knew the human and economic costs would be high, but not whether military action would achieve any or all of America's political objectives. Nevertheless, the political leadership throughout the country, and much of the public, supported these military efforts with a commitment that was strong and persistent for a long time. I can still hear past Presidents resolving to stay the course, bear any burden and hunker down -- for the long haul if necessary. Korea took three years and Vietnam twice that. Stay the course we did, even past the point when stalemate and compromise had become obvious and inevitable.
Sanctions just may prevent a war with Iraq. The uncertainties and risks that go along with sanctions are certainly no greater than those that go along with war. Yet Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney tells the Senate that he cannot "guarantee that sanctions will work" and that "we cannot wait indefinitely" for them to work. Far better if this country's political leadership supported sanctions for the long haul if necessary, and with the same resolve and persistence that they would ask of all of us if the country were now at war.
"Real men" may prefer strong action, but wise men know the value of patience.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Relaxing Its Ban on Oil Imports From Iran

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has quietly authorized American oil companies to import limited amounts of crude oil from Iran, partly relaxing a ban on all Iranian goods imposed in 1987 near the end of the Iran-Iraq war.
The action, approved by the President in early November, allows the companies to apply on a case-by-case basis for permission to import Iranian crude, with the provision that their payments be channeled into an escrow account that finances American claims against Iran dating to the 1979 overthrow of the Shah. 
 Companies will still be barred from sending money to Iran, the Treasury declared in confirming the action, which was first reported in Platt's Week, an industry newsletter.
The main motivation for the decision, a State Department official said, was to ease the payments awarded by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, an organization set up in The Hague in early 1981 to arbitrate disputes involving broken contracts and expropriated property.
But the move was also seen, the official acknowledged, as providing another oil-supply option should war break out in the Middle East and shortages develop.
The Government contended that allowing Iranian oil to be imported under the specific license, envisioned in regulations putting the 1987 ban into effect, "is not a concession" to Iran and that the action had no connection with the multinational sanctions against Iraq to which Iran is committed.
"It is our interests to do this since we wish to see the Security Account replenished," the official stated. "We want to encourage the settlement of claims."
But Iran badly needs to bolster its hard currency reserves, and to the extent that deposits are made to the escrow account from other sources, Iran's reserves are not depleted
The Security Account, the vehicle for paying tribunal awards, has been replenished by Iran on numerous occasions over the years, in many cases by reinvesting interest. But the balance has now fallen to $269 million, well below the required $500 million minimum, an official said.
 
Arco Settles a Claim
 This week, Arco, the Los Angeles-based oil company, settled under tribunal auspices a claim that is to yield it $9 million, but an Arco spokesman said he had no information about when it was expected to be paid or whether the company, largely a domestic operator, expected to buy Iranian crude.
Treasury officials said that no company has yet applied for an import license under the new program, although some have made inquiries since being privately informed that licenses were available.
The State Department stated: "Last month we decided to license the import of Iranian oil into the United States on a case-by-case basis where the proceeds of the transaction are to be deposited in the Security Account. If such transactions occur, this will help insure that there are adequate funds available to pay Tribunal awards to U.S. claimants. To date, over $2 billion has been transferred from the Security Account in satisfaction of Tribunal awards to U.S. claimants."
The United States imposed strict trade sanctions against Iran in late 1979, but these were lifted in January 1981 as part of the Algiers accord under which American hostages werealso released.
Partly reflecting the stigma that persisted, American companies tended to buy relatively little Iranian oil even after the Government signed a 1982 deal to buy bargain-priced Iranian crude for its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. By the mid-1980's, however, Iran was supplying substantial quantities to the United States.
In October 1987 President Reagan imposed a ban on all Iranian imports and tightened restrictions on what could be exported to that country. This was in response to what he called "increasingly bellicose behavior" by Iran, including attacks on American forces and American-flagged Kuwaiti ships in the Persian Gulf.

HEADLINE: Greenwich Welcomes Homeless From Stamford

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 21

 BODY:
A coalition of church and civic groups, with the consent of local officials, has welcomed homeless people into this wealthy Fairfield County town.
It is a limited welcome: each evening at 10, up to 14 homeless men are bused here from a shelter in neighboring Stamford. They spend the night on cots in local churches or a Y.M.C.A., and each morning after breakfast they board a bus to return to Stamford for the day. 
 But in a state where home rule is paramount and regional solutions to social problems are few, experts on homelessness say Greenwich's gesture is an unusual example of two towns voluntarily addressing a problem that does not affect them equally.
 
'A People Issue'
 "It's not a Stamford issue or a Greenwich issue, it's a people issue," said Barbara T. McKelvey, a former director of a homeless shelter in Stamford and now executive director of the American Red Cross chapter in Greenwich. "And that is what people are responding to."
Stamford, with 110,000 people, is largely suburban, with many wealthy neighborhoods, but it also has a large downtown area bordered by poor neighborhoods. Unlike the towns around it, it operates homeless shelters.
The arrangement with Greenwich, which is believed to exist in only a few other suburbs in the nation, was conceived this fall when Stamford social services officials feared that they might not have enough beds for their homeless population this winter.
Last winter, Stamford operated a 100-bed shelter for men in the classrooms at a former elementary school. But the school is being demolished, and the current shelter, a renovated factory called the Pacific House, has only 67 beds. In an emergency, like a night of near-zero temperatures, the building can accommodate up to 90 people.
 
Call Leads to Cooperation
 "The Coalition for the Homeless in Stamford gave Barbara a call and asked if the Red Cross could encourage Greenwich to respond because of the overflow problem in winter," said the Rev. Leonard A. Schneider, who operates Pacific House, Stamford's only homeless shelter for men. A shelter for homeless women and children is operated at St. Luke's Church in Stamford.
"Last winter, we had as many as 96 in a night," Mr. Schneider added. "This winter, we are at about 80 to 85 now, but it is not January or February yet."
The call to Ms. McKelvey led to meetings among the Council of Churches and Synagogues of Lower Fairfield County, the Greenwich United Way, the Greenwich Police Department, the Greenwich Department of Health, the Greenwich Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. and several Greenwich churches.
The outcome was that the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A. and three Greenwich churches -- Christ Church, First Presbyterian Church and First Congregational Church of Old Greenwich -- agreed to house, on rotating two-week shifts, up to 14 of Stamford's homeless men until Feb. 24.
 
'Pretty Nice in Greenwich'
 "I came from 28 years of working in shelters in New York, and this is a rare experience for me," said Mr. Schneider, who came to Pacific House a year ago after directing the shelter at 69 St. Marks Place on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. "Up here, interagency coordination is a big thing."
This week the first group of homeless men slept on cots in the basement of the Greenwich Y.M.C.A., and their reactions were mostly positive. "It's pretty nice in Greenwich," said Domingo Arroyo Jr., 34 years old, a Bridgeport native who is a recovering alcoholic and became homeless while he was drinking. "I like the view."
Besides sleeping in quieter, more spacious quarters than Pacific House, the homeless men taken to Greenwich have also awakened each morning to a freshly cooked breakfast served by teen-age girls wearing plaid kilts who are students at the Greenwich Academy, a local private school.
"I was skeptical," said Arthur Nelson, 26, a Stamford native and an unemployed construction worker. "When I was a kid, we would walk through Greenwich, and because we were black we would always get stopped by the police for doing nothing."
"But they seem to be getting it together now," he added. "Whether it is from the heart or not, I don't know."
 
History of Social Involvement
 Mr. Schneider said the arrangement is in addition to the money Greenwich already pays for the small number of its own homeless who are housed in Stamford shelters. He said Greenwich, which has a population of about 60,000 but does not have a permanent shelter, already provides Pacific House with $16,000 for the homeless. The United Way of Greenwich also contributes $50,000.
He added that the town government and the United Way chapters in Darien and New Canaan, two other wealthy suburban communities that border Stamford, also contribute to Pacific House's $800,000 annual budget, the bulk of which comes from the State of Connecticut. Stamford contributes $150,000. The Stamford United Way contributes $114,000.
"They are all paying more than their fair share," Mr. Schneider said, noting that there are too few homeless people in Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan to warrant permanent shelters in those towns. During the last year, Stamford has had about 600 homeless people seeking overnight shelter; Greenwich probably has less than a dozen.
Ms. McKelvey noted that Greenwich has a history of social involvement, particularly among its churches. "It has been absolutely overwhelming," she said. "We have 80 volunteers from one church."
Morgan Flatley, 16, a junior at the Greenwich Academy who was one of three young women serving breakfast to the homeless men last week, said: "I feel fulfilled in doing this, and once a week is not a problem for me. It is easy to get locked into this community and forget that not everyone is like you and has your life style."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE KREMLIN;
Bush Concerned Over Shevardnadze

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he was concerned about Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's warnings of the threat of dictatorship in the Soviet Union and said he hoped that any political change in the Kremlin would be peaceful.
In his first comment on Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation, Mr. Bush tried to make the best of the upheaval in Moscow, saying that "life goes on" and that he expected that Soviet foreign policy would not change, especially in the Persian Gulf. 
 The President appeared at a news conference in Camp David, his Maryland mountain retreat, with Prime Minister John Major of Britain, who arrived on Friday evening for his first meeting with Mr. Bush since he succeeded Margaret Thatcher last month.
Both leaders took the opportunity to project an image of collegiality and reaffirm both the "special relationship" between Washington and London and solidarity on the Persian Gulf.
 
No Talk With Gorbachev
 Mr. Bush said he had not spoken with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev since Mr. Shevardnadze resigned, stunning the Soviet leader and the rest of the world.
"I am convinced, from what we have received so far from the Soviet Union, that the policy on the gulf will continue," Mr. Bush said.
He said he and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had a "very close relationship" with Mr. Shevardnadze.
"But life goes on," he said, "and we will pursue the policies in the gulf, confident that the Soviet Union will continue on its path, and I will continue to work with this new and very encouraging bilateral relationship, work to enhance that in every way possible."
Mr. Bush said: "Obviously, people are concerned about, are wondering about the concerns raised and expressed by Mr. Shevardnadze. But we will, we will continue to deal with them in the future, here, as we have in the past, and hope that the changes that are taking place will be done in a very peaceful way."
 
Reaction to K.G.B. Chief
 Mr. Bush blanched when asked about a speech in the Soviet Parliament today by Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, head of the K.G.B. Mr. Kryuchkov told the Soviet Parliament, "Warnings are sounded that if we take decisive measures today to restore order, this will mean we wittingly agree to spill blood." He continued, "But respected comrade deputies, isn't blood already being spilled?"
In response, Mr. Bush said today: "We hope, very much, not. What, clearly, one wants to see is the reform program continuing. It's gone a long way in a short period of time, but it has a long way still to go. We hope it can travel that long road and do so without bloodshed and peacably."
He shrugged off an American military commander's suggestion that ground forces in Saudi Arabia would not be ready for war by Jan. 15, the United Nations deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
He said he would be discussing the military situation on Monday with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "But let me put it this way," he added. "If there was some clear provocation 10 minutes from now, the allied forces are ready to respond vigorously."
Mr. Bush and Mr. Major said they were, as Mr. Major put it, "of one mind" on their determination to enforce United Nations resolutions demanding that President Saddam Hussein withdraw from Kuwait.
 
Difficulties Complicated
 But Mr. Bush's remarks also carried the air of a President grappling with a difficult situation that has been made increasingly complex by Lieut. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller's comments about American readiness for combat, by the Administration's concern that Congress will return in January to debate gulf policy and send an irresolute signal to Baghdad, and by Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation.
Seeking to send Iraq a signal that the alliance against Baghdad is still strong, Mr. Major made it clear that he intended to follow his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, in supporting American policy. But he avoided Mrs. Thatcher's overt talk of war.
Referring to Mr. Hussein, Mr. Major said: "I hope he takes seriously the fact that the Security Council resolutions will be enforced. If he moves out, there won't be a conflict. If he doesn't, well, he knows what the consequences may be."
 
No Estimate of Prospects
 Both leaders declined to say how likely they thought a war was, or whether they expected Iraq and the United States to overcome a stalemate over when to hold the direct talks that Mr. Bush proposed on Nov. 30.
Asked whether he would be seeking a new endorsement of his gulf policy from Congress or a resolution explicitly supporting the use of force against Iraq, Mr. Bush said, "I want Congress fully on board."
"I'd love to see Congress say this minute that we fully endorse the United Nations resolutions and the President should fully implement them," he said. "Because I'm determined to do that and it would be very nice to send that solid signal out to Saddam Hussein. I think it would help him get the message as to what he's up against."
An Administration official said the White House was discussing the possibility of Congressional action on the gulf, but was not specifically asking for a resolution. The new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3 and is not scheduled to begin work until Jan. 23. Congressional leaders are considering a pro forma session during that recess.
 
'Wrong Signal' Feared
 "If they want to come in and pass a resolution endorsing the President's policy, fine," the official said. "But what we don't want is for them to come back just to debate the gulf situation. That would send the wrong signal to Saddam Hussein."
On Friday, Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, broke with many members of his party by explicitly endorsing the use of force in the gulf, if necessary.
"I believe that the interests we have at stake in the Persian Gulf are vital," Mr. Aspin said in a speech. "If all else fails, they are worth going to war for."
But Mr. Aspin, who said he believed that economic sanctions were not enough to force Iraq out of Kuwait, added that there was still a chance for diplomacy to bring about a peaceful solution.

HEADLINE: 21 States Imposing Drug Tax And Then Fining the Evaders

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON

 BODY:
A day after the police raided a jewelry store in St. Paul last month and charged its owner with cocaine possession, an agent of the Minnesota Department of Revenue went into the store and left with a bag of jewels. On Dec. 8 and 9, the jewels were auctioned off for $160,000, and the money went into the state treasury.
Reminiscent of a system used to combat bootlegging in Prohibition, more and more states are using the tax codes to go after drug traffickers and tap some of the vast proceeds gained from drug sales. 
 Under the approach, 21 states have imposed taxes on illegal drugs. On Jan. 1, Nebraska will become the 22d state to impose the tax. The states do not expect the dealers to pay the tax. Rather, the idea is to fine them much greater amounts for not paying the taxes if they are ever caught possessing or selling drugs.
 
Some Early Challenges
 The fines can be imposed and collected within hours of an arrest and are usually kept by the state even if the suspect is cleared of criminal charges. That person can appeal the confiscation of property through the state tax courts, but few do because the battle is so difficult.
When the laws went into effect, some of those arrested challenged the confiscation of their property, citing their Fifth Amendment rights against compelled self-incrimination. But the highest courts in several states have rejected those claims. In only one state has the highest court overturned the law, and that state, South Dakota, repealed its law. Since then, other states have modified their laws to take into account the South Dakota Supreme Court's objections.
"The drug tax is one of the best pieces of anti-narcotics legislation to have come along in years," said Robert D. Ebel, an official of the United States Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.
The key to the tax's effectiveness lies in the difference between criminal and civil penalties. Under criminal law, the prosecution must establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and assets may be seized only after a court is satisfied that the defendant's constitutional rights have been observed.
 
Burden on the Accused
 But under civil codes like the tax laws, the obligation shifts to the accused to establish that a penalty is unfounded or unfair. In a tax audit, for example, the burden is on the taxpayer to justify deductions, not on the tax collector to prove they do not exist.
In the same way, people arrested with drugs in their possession could be fined for a civil violation of the tax code if the state could show they had not paid any tax on the drugs. Even if they escaped criminal prosecution on grounds like having been illegally searched, under civil law they would have to prove to the tax-collecting agency that they were unaware of the drug.
"All we need to establish is knowledge and control," said Ken Kincade, a collection officer for the Minnesota Department of Revenue. "While the police have to establish ownership, we go after anyone who knows about the drugs and could do something to them."
The wife of a suspected drug dealer was taxed and then fined, Mr. Kincade said, because she had access to a room where the drugs were kept. A man who had sold his house and helped the new owner move his posessions, including some marijuana plants, was taxed and fined. (So was the owner of the plants, who also faced criminal charges.)
 
Strike at the Dealers
 While such laws have had little effect in some states, Minnesota and several others consider the approach to be an increasingly effective way of striking financially at drug dealers. Mr. Ebel and others say the measure is a workable way for the states to tap into the illegal and untaxed multibillion-dollar drug economy.
Harley T. Duncan, executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators, an association of state tax departments in Washington, called the tax "a pretty effective tool."
"It can immediately tie up a dealer's assets," Mr. Duncan said. "It can be used in plea-bargain deals, and it permits a far broader range of property forfeiture than under criminal statutes where a direct link has to be shown between the drugs and the property."
Some of the early critics of the measure maintained that by taxing drugs, the states gave the impression its use was legitimate. They said the imposition of a tax whose primary aim was not to collect money but to establish penalties was a cynical way to make up for ineffective criminal prosecutions.
Several years ago, Allan Green, a director in the Office of Legislative Research in the Connecticut General Assembly, expressed concern that the "expedited procedures" provided in the Minnesota law could jeopardize a defendant's right to due process.
But most of the early doubts about the constitutional issues appear to have been resolved, although doubts remain about the measure's effectiveness.
 
A 'Gimmick,' a Critic Says
 Richard D. Tulisano, chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Connecticut General Assembly, which is now considering such a law, said the drug tax is a "silly" measure that substitutes a "gimmick" for preventive measures. "If we can't collect regular taxes, we can't assume we'll collect on illegal things," he said.
Supporters argue that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the taxation of illegal gains, including a ruling in 1961 in a case involving embezzled money, James v. United States. In that case, the Court held that there "has been a widespread and settled administrative and judicial recognition of the taxability of unlawful gains of many kinds." So far there has been no challenge in the Federal courts of the drug tax.
The tax on illegal drugs is considerable. In Minnesota, for example, it is $1,590 a pound for marijuana and $90,800 a pound for cocaine. If dealers are caught without having paid the tax, they are subject to the tax plus a fine equal to 100 percent of the tax.
Dealers are supposed to buy tax stamps, which must be attached to the drugs just as tax stamps are attached to bottles of liquor and packages of cigarettes. They are not asked for their names or any other information when they buy the stamps, but just a handful of marijuana dealers have bought the stamps.
In the four years that its law has been in effect, Minnesota has fined suspected dealers $33 million for nonpayment of taxes and has collected $1.7 million. That program is expected to gain strength: Dorothy McClung, a lawyer for the state who was largely responsible for framing the law, is to become the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue on Jan. 4.
In almost seven years, Arizona has assessed $3.6 million and collected $210,174. Nevada has assessed $900 million but collected only $66,000 in three years. Experts say some states collect more money than others because of varying degrees of cooperation between the police and the tax authorities.
Taxation of illegal drugs is not new in this country. Aside from Prohibition, and the revenue raids on moonshine stills that are Southern legend, the nation had a Federal Marijuana Tax Act from 1937 to 1970. It was repealed in 1970 partly because of what the courts saw as inherent violations of the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. If dealers paid the tax, the police could be tipped off and gather evidence that the dealers were violating criminal laws.
It was such an objection that led the South Dakota Supreme Court to overturn that state's drug tax four years ago on the ground that compelling a person to register illegal activity with the tax authorities violated the Fifth Amendment.
 
Economically Fitting, Some Say
 Since then, Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Florida, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Texas and Utah have passed similar measures, but with some modifications to deal with the South Dakota Supreme Court's objections. This year, Georgia, Iowa, Oklahoma and Wisconsin followed suit.
Minnesota is often cited by the Federal authorities as having a model drug tax law for what is considered its ironclad protection against Fifth Amendment challenges, since dealers can buy tax stamps in anonymity. It was also the first state, in 1988, to have its law sustained through the state courts.
To supporters, such laws are not only constitutionally sound but also economically fitting. "The illegal drug trade can and should be taxed as a business or economic activity," said Lorne H. Seidman, a professor of legal studies at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and a supporter of Nevada's enactment of the tax in 1987.
And Mr. Ebel of the Federal Commission on Intergovernmental Relations said: "Drug dealers may be odious characters, but they are also entrepreneurs who must buy, sell and turn a profit to stay in business. This basic commercial aspect of the business creates a weak spot in the dealers' defenses against the law.
"There is absolutely no justification to giving drug dealers tax breaks just because their business is illegal."

HEADLINE: 2% OF G.N.P. SPENT BY U.S. ON CLEANUP

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
The United States devotes 2 percent of the total value of its annual output of goods and services to control pollution and to clean up the environment, an analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency has found. That is about the same as the most environmentally concerned European countries spend, agency officials said.
The nation spends nearly half as much to control pollution as it does to clothe itself and roughly a third of what it allocates to the military, according to the study, which the agency said was the first attempt to calculate the cost of pollution-control measures. The study was prepared for Congress and is now circulating within the Government in draft form. 
 It said the cleanup and containment cost would rise to as much as 2.8 percent of the total value of its goods and services, or gross national product, by the end of this decade. As a result, the study concluded, the pollution-control burden on municipalities will "increase dramatically," causing some smaller communities to face "severe difficulties" in financing control measures through increases in fees and taxes.
Agency officials say that except for the Netherlands, no other country is likely to devote a bigger share of wealth to clean up the environment in the foreseeable future. The Netherlands has declared its intention to spend 4 percent of its gross national product on pollution control.
 
Questions About Priorities
 The report also raises serious questions about whether some pollution-control activities are commanding more than their appropriate share of national wealth, William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. Administrator, said in an interview last week. "What it says to me," Mr. Reilly said of the report, "is that at this level of expenditure, there's a very large obligation to get it right."
Future programs to control and dispose of waste, particularly hazardous waste, "loom disproportionately large," given the wide array of other environmental problems that must be confronted, Mr. Reilly said. The waste programs, according to the E.P.A. analysis, are expected to cost $46 billion in 2000, as against $19 billion in 1987. Both figures are in constant 1986 dollars.
Expenditures related to controlling waste are expected to grow much faster than those to control air pollution, water pollution and the control of pesticides and toxic substances, the report said. Expenditures on waste control will increase to a third of the total by 2000 from a quarter currently, the report said, adding that most of the increase will be accounted for by efforts to deal with hazardous wastes under Federal laws enacted in the 1980's.
"That's a very disturbing admission of failure in past practice," Mr. Reilly said. While the money being spent to control hazardous wastes "do not represent an indictment of current effort and do not cause us to pull back from current effort," he said, "they are sobering."
 
Federal Help Limited
 Of the report's finding that municipalities' pollution-control costs will sharply rise and pose problems for some small communities, Mr. Reilly said: "It's true. I think we have proceeded to layer obligations on the local-government sector without any sense of the aggregate impacts."
But he said the Federal Government "is not in a mode to be able to help them much," although it provides some grants and technical assistance.
The study analyzed the total costs of Federally mandated pollution-control and cleanup programs that have been incurred and are expected to be by all levels of government and private business up to the year 2000. It did not include environmental activities that do not deal with pollution control, like wildlife conservation programs.
The study found that total costs rose to $100 billion in 1990 from $85 billion in 1987 and $26 billion in 1972 in constant 1986 dollars. By 2000, according to the analysis, the cost could rise to anywhere from $148 billion to $160 billion.
 
Big Emission Reductions
 The agency did not assess the benefits of pollution control in detail. That is to be the subject of a future analysis. But the report did estimate that emissions of sulfur dioxide into the air are less than 60 percent of what they would have been without pollution controls; that airborne particles are 30 percent of what they would have been otherwise; nitrogen oxides, 72 percent; carbon monoxide, 43 percent, and lead, 3 percent.
In 1987, private business paid 63 percent of the pollution-control bill, the Federal Government 11 percent, local governments 22.5 percent and state governments 3.5 percent. Because of large anticipated increases in the cost of cleaning up wastes from the military arms and the energy programs, the Federal share is expected to grow to about 15 percent in 2000 with the private share dropping to 60 percent, the local share to 22 percent and the state share to 3 percent. While the local share of total cost will decline, the actual costs will increase dramatically.
Expenditures for the control of air pollution were projected to grow to $44 billion in 2000 from $26.7 billion in 1987, in 1986 dollars. Outlays for the control of radiation were projected to grow to $896 million from $327 million in the same period; for control of water pollution to $57.6 billion from $34.4 billion, and for pure drinking water to $6.6 billion from $3.1 billion.
The cost of solid waste management was projected to grow to $22.3 billion from $16.7 billion.

Majors Look East for More Riches

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
During a recent tour of Japan by major league all-stars, both management and union executives went along eagerly looking for ways to expand baseball's business horizons to the Far East.
 But if trade winds of the times blow as consistently as they have in other industries, the Japanese can be expected to seek new baseball outlets not only on their own soil, but also right in the lap of the American pastime as well. 
 Rumors of Japanese interest in major league clubs surfaced last year, when the Seattle Mariners reportedly attracted some interest when they were on the open market. This summer, two limited partners of George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, were reportedly exploring the possibility of selling their minority shares to Daiei, one of Japan's largest supermarket chains.
 The reality of global markets and the buying power of both the dollar and the yen have not been lost on officials on either side of the Pacific. How such issues will be handled was a popular topic of conversation during the major leaguers' eight-game tour.
 "It is a more complicated question than just baseball," Commissioner Fay Vincent said. "We're part of a larger organization and we have legal restraints. It is not the policy of the United States, nor is it in its best interest, to inhibit economic activity with Japan. So baseball has to fit its own activities within those standards. I don't know if the Government standards really limit us, but we are not going to impose artificial restrictions on Japanese capital coming into this country."
 Vincent pointed out, however, that adherence to major league baseball's relatively new local ownership regulations made it all but impossible for majority interest in any club to be assumed by absentee owners, be they out of state or out of country.
 There are no rules barring minority interests or minor league ownership. And Suntory, the giant Japanese entertainment and food conglomerate, became part-owner of the Birmingham Barons, a Class AA Southern League team reportedly purchased for $2.5 million to $4 million before the 1990 season.
 The president, chief executive and managing partner of Birmingham is Marty Kuehnert, an American who first proposed buying the team along with a former Stanford University schoolmate. That friend, Gary Shaii, happens to be the son of Suntory's chairman.
 Kuehnert, who has business interests in Japan, resents inferences that it is somehow wrong to sell to the Japanese at all, pointing to negative publicity that invariably follows sales like those of Rockefeller Center, MCA and Columbia Pictures. Now, said Kuehnert: "There's this concern about Japanese business buying America's pastime. But what people don't know is that American brokers, American owners come to Japanese companies all the time and ask them to please buy this, please buy that. Then the Japanese take the flak. Look, everyone knows that Japan is a very wealthy country. And when people need money for investment, they see an economic opportunity and they come and ask for it."
 Vincent, who found himself denying unsubstantiated rumors that he had toured Japan to cultivate buyers, is also concerned about the potential for ill will. Acknowledging concerns on both sides, Vincent has appointed an ownership committee to deal with the so-called Japanese question.
 "I wanted a systematic way to think through any and all questions that might arise," Vincent said. "Such as, do we have strong position on minority interest? The Japanese are starting endeavors in the Dominican Republic. If they are going to do that, does it mean we're going to have to compete for kids?"
 Citing an increasing Japanese presence at winter meetings, Vincent also said: "The Japanese are there to compete for players and talk about signings. Do we have any policy on that?"
 Vincent said these were not exclusively "Japanese" questions, but rather questions that would apply to any foreign baseball entity. "But," he said, "at the moment the Japanese currency is so strong and the baseball ties are so strong, it's the only system that is powerful enough that it can and does take away players who could play at our level."
 Players, of course, see absolutely nothing wrong with that. "The best of all possible worlds is to have opportunities for players, no matter where they originate from, worldwide, the way it is in other sports," said Donald Fehr, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. Fehr added, "The clubs have agreed that Japanese efforts to sign free agents is appropriate."
 Are such policies reciprocal? Japanese players impressed the major leaguers by winning the all-star series. But if they wanted to play here, it's doubtful they could. "Japanese players are indentured servants," Kuehnert said. "They are still pre-Curt-Flood-type of players. Their contracts have reserve clauses and they have no freedom."
 As for Japanese teams, Vincent said: "I once asked the Japanese commissioner a hypothetical question. 'What if I owned Coca-Cola and I wanted to buy a Japanese baseball team?' He said, 'No!' "
 The fact that Americans may not be able to buy Japanese teams has not deterred interest in buying into that burgeoning market in other ways. While other countries are just starting out in baseball, the Japanese are already there. Not only do they have the economy, but a longstanding love for the game, a combination viewed as too valuable to pass up by major league executives, who market hats, jackets and other equipment, and the union, which markets trading cards, posters and other items.

The Lords Must Be Crazy

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
THE SHORTENING of daylight at this time of year must do something to the brains of baseball operators. How else to explain the sacking of Ernie Harwell, a national treasure of a broadcaster, by the pizza-and-football experts who run the Detroit Tigers?
Harwell had committed the crime of approaching the age of 73, still erudite after all these years, but instead of being given a holiday goose-with-trimmings for his excellence, he was turned into a lame duck. Charming. 
 The lords of baseball have also been wreaking havoc on a much broader scale in recent weeks. Their shopping frenzy has caused people in Buffalo to worry if they would be able to afford the grand national game if and when it arrives.
Only last Monday, Buffalo was selected as one of six finalists for the National League expansion of two more teams in 1993. Unfortunately, this will give the National League an imbalanced, rivalry-destroying schedule that has dragged the American League down since 1977. But nobody's perfect, and surely not these people.
The other expansion finalists are: Washington, D.C., which has lost two teams already; St. Petersburg-Tampa, Fla., a lovely region stuck with yet another sterile dome; Orlando, out in the middle of Florida, not near much except amusement parks; Miami, an important international city but whose Joe Robbie Stadium is neither configured for baseball nor logistically convenient; and Denver, which has been waiting a long time, and who really knows?
Buffalo is the best of the six. It has a perfect stadium, better weather than people think, a baseball-wise population belt in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Ontario, and a savvy ownership already in place.
How savvy is the ownership? Well, Robert E. Rich Jr. heard rumblings that people in his town were concerned that baseball prices have, as he put it, "gone through the roof." (A figurative roof; Rich, bless him, has built an old-fashioned ball park with real grass and real sky.)
These people in Buffalo are not fools. They have seen industry come and go. They have seen prices rise for heating homes. Yet they have also supported Class AAA baseball to the tune of one million fans in each of the last three seasons, a record for the minor leagues.
They have also seen the current teams recently spending $3 million per season on players who look suspiciously like potential expansion draft choices.
These current prices are courtesy of a local character known as Crazy Neal (His Prices Are In-SANE), who gave away tons of money so that CBS could have the rights to the post-season, plus a few odd regular-season games. Those daffy baseball operators liked Crazy Neal's style, just tossing dollars on street corners, so they imitated him. Wouldn't you know it? Along came agents and players to scoop up those bills.
Now the baseball operators probably don't have any more money. But baseball has a plan to make more money. It is called expansion.
Wait a minute, the people of Buffalo began to ask, who is going to pay that $95 million entry fee and those $3 million contracts for journeymen?
I am, Robert Rich said, in effect. And to further assure them, he issued a statement more than a week ago that said, in part, "While we remain committed to bringing major league baseball to Buffalo, we have said that we do not believe in baseball at any cost."
After his statement was interpreted in several ways, Rich said, one version led to an unfortunate headline that said, "Bowing Out in Buffalo." Not true. Bob Rich and Buffalo are not bowing out, he insisted in an interview late last week.
"People are saying, 'Geez, I bring my family to one game a week,' " Rich said. "Does this mean I can only bring one friend a month?' We are saying it's got to have the same feeling, the same ambience, that baseball in Buffalo has now. We want to allay their fears."
Rich said that Buffalo would be one of the smaller markets in the major leagues, but big enough to support a team. He added, "The proposed expansion draft is generous, and you can win with a developmental approach."
And while ticket prices would surely rise from the current $3-7 minor league scale, Rich said they would be consistent with major league baseball prices(roughly $4-10.25 last season) "and not what people pay at Madison Square Garden, or for the Buffalo Bills." He also recognized that people would not appreciate huge increases in cable television, concessions and parking.
"We are committed to baseball in Buffalo," Rich said, "but you have to look at the whole cost. I don't think we're pessimistic. We're keeping an eye on all these trends. People say, are you going to be a voice? I hope this is not just an auction. We plan to speak out."
Baseball had better wonder who is going to pay for these ludicrous salaries. It is welcome news that the owners and the players are forming a joint economic committee, only a decade after Larry O'Brien, David Stern and Larry Fleisher salvaged professional basketball with labor peace.
Baseball's dollar-flinging will be difficult to stop. The Ernie Harwell foolishness is easy. Rich should hire Harwell immediately to truly usher Buffalo into the major leagues. Think the pizza-and-football experts would enjoy the Detroit region beaming its antennas toward Buffalo? Serve 'em right.

HEADLINE: Social History From Berkow

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
Ira Berkow's moving column ("A Black Star Long, Long Ago," The Times, Nov. 24) on George Gregory, the first black basketball all-American, constitutes an important piece of social history. For example, it documents virulent racism in Northern universities, such as Columbia and Rutgers, in the 1920's and 1930's. The disgraceful treatment accorded George Gregory and Paul Robeson by contemporary student athletes is a reliable barometer of deeply held racial attitudes by the society at large during much of this century.
One point which we can extrapolate from the experiences of Gregory, Robeson and Jackie Robinson is that the long-term effects of racism throughout American society have been cumulative. Most black Americans, athletes included, pay a price for our nation's unresolved racial dilemma each and every day.
Some sports have (begrudgingly) given the very best black athletes a shot at the golden ring. Other sports -- golf is the most visible today -- continue to reflect society's historical bigotry. It may seem unfair to single out golf (or tennis or swimming) when these sports merely mirror the attitudes of the majority in our nation. The fact is, however, that each breakthrough moves a few more white Americans in the direction of justice and equality, while also opening up economic opportunities to a few more minority men and women.
Even more convincing are the occasional elevations of black athletes to leadership positions -- a head football coach in the N.F.L., two major league baseball managers, and a growing number of N.B.A. head coaches. These visible advances help to demonstrate that intellect is as widely shared among all segments of the human race as athletic ability. Ultimately, we may well break the circle of cumulative deprivation resulting from our racial legacy.
Progress in sports plays a part in promoting progress in our society.GILBERT JONAS

Euphoria Gives Way to Fractured Feelings of Gloom

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
THE gesture did not make the front pages and it probably won't influence policy much. Nonetheless, when the Friends of the Earth, the environmentalist organization, wrote to Secretary of State James A. Baker last week warning that war against Iraq would be an ecological disaster, it seemed to be a small sign of the tenor of these last few days of a strangely ambiguous year.
It is true, of course, that nothing could be more environmentally unsound than waging war -- and Friends of the Earth also alluded to the great loss of human life that a Persian Gulf military conflict would entail. 
 Still, the letter seemed to reflect how complicated the world has become, how burdened with special-interest pleadings -- how everyone seems still to be craving something at the end of a year that began on such an optimistic note, virtually promising that everybody would get something. Everybody now seems to be wondering what, if anything, they got.
Friends of the Earth wants desert plants to be protected from tanks, shorebirds from chemical warheads. The bank regulators want more insurance. The Government wants more taxes but doesn't want to tell the people who will have to pay them. Everybody wants more money and, certainly, more personal security. Contrary to popular myth, The New Republic announced last week, the Christmas season is always a "blue" time, marked by "environmental degradation, hazardous products and travel, and -- perhaps most important -- inefficient uses of key resources."
This Christmas season seems undisguisedly blue, especially when compared with the general merriment that prevailed when 1990 began, promising a new, easier and simpler era. The hoped-for peace dividend seems already to have fallen through some hole in the national pocket. The economy, far from celebrating the miracle of German unification, chose just this moment to bring seven years of expansion to an end. Recession looms. Banks fail. And there is the prospect of war.
Is the year-end malaise just a passing mood or does it stem from something deep and permanent? Does the sourness suggest that the country might even be in the great decline envisaged by Paul Kennedy, the Yale University historian whose 1988 book, "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers," held that the United States was following the unfortunate pattern of the great empires of history? Mr. Kennedy wrote that economic power leads to "imperial overstretch," which in turn produces economic exhaustion and a loss of power -- in short, permanent decline.
Is that our fate? A new group, led by Joseph Nye of the Harvard Center for International Affairs, emerged this year to challenge both the fact and the inevitability of decline. Mr. Nye, in a book called "Bound to Lead," argued that the United States was still the global number one and would remain so for a long time.
The biggest crisis of the moment, the looming war in the gulf, could be used to support both the declinists' and the revivalists' arguments.
"The gulf will be a defining point," Mr. Nye said. "If we end up with a success -- meaning that Iraq withdraws either after negotiations or as a result of a short war with few American casualties -- then the American people will say to themselves, this is where we can and should be leaders. If it's a failure -- and by failure I mean either a falling apart of the coalition or a war involving large American losses -- then they will say that we can't lead."
For most people, those simply trying to make ends meet, the great historical abstractions may have curiosity value, but the real issue is getting by at a time when so many people are losing their jobs. In the first 11 months of the year, 55,000 companies declared bankruptcy. The polls do not show despair, not yet, but they do show something pessimistic in the country's mood. In November, Gallup indicated that 64 percent of Americans were dissatisfied with the way things were going in the United States, the highest figure since 1979, the year of the Iran hostage crisis, when the figure went up to 84 percent.
"We're experiencing the end of the illusions of the 1980's," said John Guare, the playwright whose "Six Degrees of Separation" is sold out through March at Lincoln Center in New York City. Mr. Guare, speaking for a large group that always found something false about the upbeat nature of the Reagan years, meant that problems ignored, forgotten, pushed under the rug for the better part of a decade are now coming back to haunt the country, demanding attention.
"The decade of auto-hypnosis seems to be over and people want to know what's happening and who's to blame," he said.
Does that mean that the 1990's, following the decade of happy greed, will be the decade of sad despair? Maybe not. The Gallup poll that showed people dissatisfied with the state of the country said 85 percent of them were satisfied with the way things were going in their personal lives.
"It doesn't astonish me that there's a mood of dissatisfaction about the country, but it does that people think things are going well in their personal lives," said the economist Robert Heilbroner. He cites the things that are conspicuously going wrong as reasons for the national discontent -- the homelessness, the poverty, the physical deterioration that many people see around them every day. And yet, he says, "there doesn't seem to be a grass-roots desire, a yearning for a new New Deal, an effort just to clean things up."
It seems likely that, after what looked like clarity early in the year, the fogs have gotten so thick that many people have simply retreated into the domains of private life, essentially giving up on public problems.
Many single-interest groups are demanding satisfaction, but few are addressing the large fact regarding the common welfare, which is that after the optimism of a few months ago, most of the hard work waits to be done.

Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Recession?

BYLINE: By CARLYLE C. DOUGLAS

 BODY:
THE numbers, the experts and the politicians were all in general agreement last week that the wolf is at America's door. The only debate was over how big it might be, how long it might stay and, among storekeepers, how many holiday shoppers it might scare away.
Acknowledging that there was a "weakness in the economy" that demanded attention, the Federal Reserve Board moved to spur borrowing and spending by lowering the rate it charges banks to borrow to 6.5 percent from 7 percent. The change in the discount rate, the first in nearly two years, got a wag of the tail from Wall Street -- the market rose more than 30 points and held the gain all week -- and one major bank responded by dropping its prime rate, the rate banks charge their most credit-worthy business customers, from 10 percent to 9.5 percent. 
 In the meantime, however, three other major banks announced they would be reporting huge fourth-quarter losses. The nation's largest bank, Citicorp, said it was looking at perhaps $400 million in quarterly losses and would cut its payroll by 4,400 workers in addition to the 3,600 it laid off earlier this year.
And when banks are troubled, so is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. William L. Seidman, the F.D.I.C. chairman, said the agency might lose as much as $5 billion next year as 170 to 200 banks fail. Such a loss piled on top of the $4 billion lost this year from a like number of failures, Mr. Seidman said, would bring the agency uncomfortably close to insolvency.
There was other bad economic news as well. The Commerce Department reported last week that if huge farm subsidy payments were not counted, personal income actually fell in November, mainly because of cutbacks in manufacturing. The agency also reported that consumer spending last month, which included the start of the Christmas shopping season, rose only 0.1 percent.
Though government forecasters tended to emphasize the possibility that a downward spiral in interest rates might boost consumer spending enough to keep the recession brief, some private economists were more pessimistic. "It will be a long and moderately severe recession," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Langston & Co.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady noted on "Meet the Press" that the nature of business is, after all, cyclical. "I don't think it's the end of the world even if we have a recession," he said. "We'll pull back out of it again. No big deal."

New Leader Of Haitians Offers U.S. a Wary Hand

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
ALONGSIDE his pledges to uplift the poor and provide justice for victims of the Duvalier dictatorship, another deeply resonant theme loomed large in the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide's sweeping victory last week in Haiti's first democratic elections. Like no other major Haitian political figure of recent times, Father Aristide gained in popularity by challenging what many Haitians see as the overbearing influence of their powerful American neighbor to the north.
While Father Aristide's chief rival, Marc L. Bazin, a conservative former finance minister and World Bank official, campaigned as the man best able to attract American help to jump-start the economy, the leftist priest shunned aid-centered solutions and dared Haitians to regain their dignity by taking their fate into their own hands. His suspicions of United States policies have been reflected in such statements as criticisms of food-aid programs as destructive agents that maintain the country in a state of dependency. 
 These statements strongly echo the feelings of many Haitians, who, citing a history that includes 19 years of military occupation early this century and three decades of American support or acceptance of repressive dictatorships, harbor strong doubts of Washington's good will.
No sooner had Father Aristide's victory become apparent than supporters, from his closest aides to many in the huge crowds that coursed through the streets in celebration, began to question whether their choice of a frankly leftist leader would be accepted by the United States or subverted by the invisible American hand that many Haitians instinctively blame for whatever goes awry here.
Partly to put such fears to rest, Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, rushed to put his imprimatur on the election results. He promised that the United States would respect the Haitian people's choice of a leader and would quickly extend political and financial support to the new Government when it takes office on Feb. 7.
President-elect Aristide's surprised entourage, newly conscious of the vastly different demands of campaigning and governing, accepted the olive branch and extended one of its own; it invited President Bush to the inauguration and made its clearest statement yet that foreign investment would continue to be welcome.
Despite such moves, officials and political analysts in both countries say that a smoothly functioning relationship between Haiti and the United States will only emerge after a testy period of frank discussions and confidence-building measures.
"For us the United States has always been the country that has bothered, controlled, done and undone whatever it wanted to in Haiti," said Louis Roy, author of the Constitution adopted after the Duvalier dynasty fell nearly five years ago. He is also president of the Council of State, which has shared power with the provisional President, Ertha Pascal-Trouillot.
 
Bitter Memories
 "You supported Francois Duvalier despite all of his abuses, and when he died, instead of allowing the dictatorship to melt away, the United States stepped in to help consolidate his son's power," Dr. Roy said, bitterly dismissing as inadequate the periodic American efforts to isolate the Duvalier regime. "Today every Haitian regards any American interference with a suspicious eye. We don't want the United States to drop their relations with Haiti, but when the people have finally made their own choice, we don't want you to bring it down."
On the American side, while officials say that the demise of the perceived threat of Soviet expansionism makes it easier to work with a presidential entourage top-heavy with past and present Communists and leftist academicians, there is strong skepticism about the effectiveness of the protectionist and collectivist strategies advocated by many in Father Aristide's camp.
After the glow of initial good-will gestures has passed, tensions could result if the United States and the multilateral donor institutions in which its voice is strong balk at assistance programs that go against the grain of free-market policies. "Their ability to function and equip themselves depends on their ability to attract outside assistance," said a United States official, who added that while American commitment to respecting the result of the election was irrevocable, significant development assistance would depend on "macro-economic policies that are sound."
Some supporters of Father Aristide, while awaiting further indications from their new leader of his intended policies, expressed cautious optimism that a serious ideological rift with Washington can be avoided.
"There are questions we cannot resolve without international aid, like fighting contraband and drugs, and improving education and health care," said a supporter who asked not be identified. "We will follow a formula of the left, not of Communism, which has failed all over the world, and we are hopeful the United States will not see us through its old prism."

For Bush, a Season Of Bad Tidings And Poor Timing

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH lighted the National Christmas Tree the other night, a custom dating back to Calvin Coolidge. The capital is awash in Christmas cards and gifts, since politicians and lobbyists are in the business of friendship, and the holiday parties have built to a low, alcoholic roar.
But there is a tremor to the times, an anxiety at the edges of the seasonal cheer. Rarely have peace and prosperity looked so fragile. Never has the Bush Administration looked so besieged by problems at home and abroad -- many of which are of its own making. 
 In his first 18 months as President, Mr. Bush seemed fortune's child, rolling along at extraordinary heights in the public opinion polls, buoyed by a still-solid economy and a world that seemed bent on democracy. He was the happy beneficiary of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, the tumbling wall in Berlin and the lurching toward perestroika in the Soviet Union.
But the international scene has turned far more perilous in recent months; that much was summed up in the resignation last week of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
Mr. Shevardnadze was a known and trusted quantity in the treacherous world of Soviet politics, a man with a special relationship to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and a valuable ally in the standoff against Iraq.
His loss alone was troubling to the Bush Administration, but even more troubling, perhaps, were Mr. Shevardnadze's reasons for leaving: his warning that the Soviet Union was heading toward some form of dictatorship.
Mr. Bush had more worries in the Persian Gulf as well. For weeks the United States has tried to apply steady, unremitting pressure on Saddam Hussein to withdraw Iraqi forces from Kuwait by Jan. 15, the deadline set by the United Nations. But that careful diplomacy, built on the threat of imminent military conflict if the deadline is not met, seemed undercut last week when Lieut. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, the deputy commander of American forces in the gulf, told reporters that American-led forces would not be ready to attack by Jan. 15.
 
The Education Debacle
 Still, the Administration's foreign policy seemed a model of discipline and coherence compared with its handling of domestic issues. Last week the White House was consumed with a furor over minority scholarships, a furor that was fanned by its own sloppiness.
It began with the announcement of what was widely seen as a Scrooge-like ruling by the Education Department: that colleges and universities receiving Federal funds could not grant scholarships exclusively designated for minority students.
It ended with a complicated revision of the policy that allowed the use of private money specifically designated for minorities, but not money from a college's general operating funds. The administration also established a four-year transition for the new rules. Along the way, the episode highlighted the deep divisions within the White House and the Republican Party over such fundamental issues as civil rights, and specifically over the point at which an affirmative action remedy turns into an unfair racial preference.
The White House's attempt at a compromise also gave new ammunition to Mr. Bush's critics, who charge that this President has only passing interest, and few core beliefs, on many issues of domestic policy.
 
Democratic Detractors
 "I think the real failings are on the domestic front," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Majority Leader, who is widely seen as a potential Presidential contender in 1992. "I don't think there's a sense of direction about where we need to go.
"There's this preoccupation with ideology, new paradigms, philosophical umbrellas, rather than trying to see where the country needs to go and doing something about it. I think we're falling behind economically in almost every respect."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, another potential contender, sounded similar alarms when he came to Washington last week. "There is a long-term national economic crisis as dangerous to this country as Saddam Hussein," Governor Cuomo said. "But so far, there is little evidence that Washington is prepared to deal with it."
This is not just another chorus from the gloom-and-doom Democrats. The economic news has been unrelentingly grim in recent days: industrial output fell 1.7 percent in November, while the economy lost more than a quarter of a million jobs. The Federal Reserve acknowledged the obvious last week and cut the interest rate it charges commercial banks, signaling that recession is now a greater concern than inflation.
Perhaps the only reason Mr. Bush is not getting even more criticism over domestic affairs is the anxiety over the international scene, as if the nation were so consumed with its heart palpitations that it cannot focus on the pain in its belly.
"The pent-up demand to come home and deal with our own problems will surface as soon as the gulf situation is resolved," said Thomas E. Mann, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution.
Mr. Mann added, "The uncertainty about the direction of domestic policy is very embarrassing for this Administration, and makes them even more vulnerable than they would be given the economic downturn that's occurring."
This is an old problem for Mr. Bush, one often described as the vision thing, which he was able to finesse in a Presidential campaign that revolved more around symbols and tactics than the problems of the day. It was the stuff of good-natured joking during more placid times; now, the continuing search for a domestic vision has turned out to be deeply unsettling to his party.
"Beginning with the State of the Union, I believe we're going to see a significant shift," said Representative Jerry Lewis of California, chairman of the House Republican Conference, referring to the President's address to Congress in late January. "I really do think the President will shift gears to begin to share with the public where he thinks we ought to be heading on a broad range of domestic concerns."
Others, however, were less sanguine as they watched the internal struggles in the White House, reflecting the broader struggles in a party trying to redefine itself for the post-Reagan era.
Some conservatives were talking of "new paradigms" for governing, fundamentally restructuring social welfare programs to reflect more individual choice through measures like encouraging tenant management of public housing projects. Some were preaching the old supply-side gospel of tax cuts, arguing that the recession now demands a return to Reaganomics. Others insisted that the Administration will have to abide by its budget agreement with the Democrats and forswear major tax cuts. The President, who so often seeks to please all sides, will soon have to choose.
This is more than the bureaucratic squabbling that is customary in the weeks leading up to the State of the Union address. Passions are very high in the Republican Party. Conservatives have not forgotten the fight over the budget and the Administration's embrace of higher taxes, which was simple heresy to the party's right wing. The old Reagan coalition of movement conservatives, Republican regulars and so-called "Reagan Democrats" is under extraordinary strain, which will only intensify in the 1992 election cycle as the party begins to debate once more such bitterly divisive issues as abortion. Mr. Bush's job is not made easier by the White House political operation, overseen by John H. Sununu, who has shown an uncanny ability to alienate Washington politicos.
So it goes in the shadow of the 35-foot-tall Colorado blue spruce now glittering on the Ellipse, just next to the White House, as George Bush celebrates his second Christmas as President.

Oil Shock or No, Shoreham Is Still Heading for Oblivion

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
ONE reason given for building the Shoreham nuclear plant was to reduce Long Island's dependence on expensive, unreliable foreign oil. Last summer, as the plant waited to be dismantled, the invasion of Kuwait doubled the price of oil on the world market, raising for a moment the possibility that the Iraqi dragon could be the savior of the distressed damsel of nuclear power.
But Shoreham is as doomed as ever. On Friday the Long Island Power Authority voted to submit a decommissioning plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The reasons that Iraq finally did not make a difference will loom large in the nation's energy situation for years to come. 
 The first is that nuclear plants do not replace the whole barrel of oil, only the part that is typically used in big power plants. That is the heavy end, what is left over after refineries have removed the molecules used for more valuable products, like gasoline, jet fuel and heating oil. And heavy oil is plentiful.
When traders thought supplies were short, they quickly bid up the price of the light products far more than the heavy. The light, low-sulfur crude oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, for example, went from under $20 at the beginning of July, before Iraq's saber rattling, to a peak of over $41 in October. But the price shift in the oil bought by Lilco was much smaller: from $16 before the crisis to about $26 at the peak.
Morris J. Greenberg, vice president of the WEFA Group, a consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said that heavy oil "is one of the easiest of all petroleum products to find substitutes for, particularly natural gas."
"There are surplus supplies of gas still available, and more coming onto the market," he said. During the Persian Gulf crisis, the price of gas has risen only modestly above the normal seasonal fluctuation.
And more gas is coming to Long Island. As the oil markets were rising, the Iroquois pipeline, which would carry gas from the Trans Canada Pipeline across Long Island Sound, was collecting key approvals; most experts think its construction is a certainty now.
 
More Megawatts
 In addition, over the last five years Lilco, despairing of ever running Shoreham, has added far more capacity than the 800 megawatts the plant would have provided. It reactivated its Far Rockaway generating station, adding 100 megawatts. It increased the output of other plants by 95 megawatts. It developed a way to keep its plants on line 90 percent to 95 percent of the time, above the national average, effectively adding 300 megawatts. It built three small combustion turbines in Brookhaven, giving another 240 megawatts. And by installing high-efficiency equipment on customers' premises and radio-controlled shut-off switches on pool pumps and home air conditioners, Lilco cut peak load by 188 megawatts.
It was not only improved efficiency that helped lower demand; recession contributed, too.
"It would have been good business to have Shoreham," said Richard J. Rudden, an energy consultant based in Hauppauge and a former Con Ed executive. But now, he said, "the capacity is not required."
This does not mean that the price increase was without costs for Long Island. Joseph W. McDonnell, a Lilco vice president, said that fuel comes to about 30 percent of utility costs, so the 60 percent increase in oil paid by the company would have resulted in an 18 percent rise for customers without mitigating factors.
But Lilco cut oil use bybuying power made from coal or other sources from other utilities and by burning more natural gas in its own plants. Oil produced 59 percent of the company's power in July but only 46 percent in November.
Also holding down the price increase was Lilco's annual switch to winter rates. So the total increase for customers was about 3.7 percent.
Dr. McDonnell, asked what difference Shoreham would have made, said that if it ran as well as the average American nuclear plant, it would have produced about 25 percent of the power that Lilco needs, cutting oil consumption by more than half. But he turned down an opportunity to say that this was a good idea.
When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves Lilco's application to demote Shoreham from its status as an operable reactor, the plant can be sold to the Long Island Power Authority; in the meantime, the plant cost ratepayers $150 million in 1990.
Operators still practice startup and shutdown procedures in a computerized simulator so they can pass their annual licensing exams, but many of those who would be required to run the plant are long gone. Of the 1,100 Lilco and contractor employees who were there in May 1989, when the agreement for abandonment was reached with New York State, nearly half have left, including "a number of people who felt their career path was in the nuclear area," Dr. McDonnell said.
The prospects for the nuclear industry as a whole do not seem to have improved much from the third oil shock, either. It would take prices approaching $100 to make some of the plants finished in the 1980's, after multibillion-dollar overruns, look like good investments. Building new nuclear plants at prices now prevailing would be like conserving dog food by substituting sirloin.
Said Mr. Greenberg: "Even if relative fuel prices appeared to justify new nuclear plants, it would be very difficult for private utilities to go ahead and finance a power plant right now. Investors are not going to be excited about it."

China Keeps Door Closed On Dissent

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
A FEW days ago, as Chinese officials were impassively listening to the highest American human-rights official urge the release of political prisoners, the Beijing Intermediate Court was conducting hearings several blocks away in preparation for sentencing two young democracy activists.
The visit last week of Richard Schifter, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, came at an opportune moment: just in time to open a dialogue on human rights before dissidents jailed after the Tiananmen Square crackdown of June 4, 1989, are expected to go on trial and be sentenced to long prison terms. 
 Still, the lesson of the week seemed to be that while China had become willing to listen to American officials talk about human rights -- a step forward -- it remained unwilling to pay any heed. "To exchange views on human rights is one thing and to interfere in internal affairs under the pretext of human rights is another," Li Zhaoxing, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said after Mr. Schifter left. He said China would agree to continue the dialogue but had no plans to free the jailed intellectuals.
For more than a year, China seemed to freeze the legal status of its June 4 dissidents, keeping them behind bars without formally arresting them. But in November, relatives of several dissidents received notices of the arrests that said the prisoners were accused of "counter-revolutionary incitement and propaganda." At least two were accused of sedition, a capital offense.
Beyond these notices, the families have been told nothing, which fans their fears and frustrations. They also face difficulty finding lawyers, only one of whom has dared risk his career to advise dissidents, according to a Chinese citizen who knows the lawyer.
Mr. Schifter was told trials had not begun. But an official of the Beijing Intermediate Court confirmed on Thursday that court hearings had begun in the case of two prominent democracy activists, Zhang Ming and Zheng Xuguang, who are being prosecuted together for their role in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
"They have not gotten more liberal in what they consider offenses against the socialist system," said Timothy A. Gelatt, a New York University law professor whose specialty is China. "From an ideological point of view, don't expect better treatment for these people. The law remains harsh. The ideology remains harsh."
 
A Shift of Attention
 One reason China may be going ahead with the trials now is that it believes that the international outrage over the killings in Tiananmen Square has simmered down. A Chinese official says he has seen confidential documents in which Chinese leaders point out the benefits that the Persian Gulf crisis has brought this country, notably a diversion of attention from human rights issues here.
"While the United States is watching out for the possibility of war, China can settle its domestic situation quietly," the official said. "Before, the whole world was watching China, and so it didn't move at all."
In addition, China's permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council has proven a source of leverage over the United States during the crisis.
Indeed, China's international stature, both politically and economically, seems to have suffered few long-term setbacks. While World Bank loans are not fully restored, trade with the West has surged. In the first 10 months of this year, China had an overall trade surplus of $6.2 billion, compared to a deficit of $6.6 billion during the same period last year. Moreover, it achieved a record trade surplus of $1.2 billion with the United States in October, making it likely that the year-end surplus in American-Chinese trade will be a record $10 billion or so.
Another reason that trials may be taking place only now is that China's own attention was previously focused elsewhere. Until September, when China began hosting the Asian Games, it was preoccupied with elaborate preparations for those games, which were intended to dispel the shadow of the June 4 crackdown. "Before the Asian Games there was more a nebulous sense that 'We can't do this now, it's going to hurt us,' " said a Beijing-based Western diplomat. "Now it's not so much that the international climate is better, but that they feel more in control."
But some Chinese say that even after such recent international successes as the opening of relations with Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Indonesia, they believe the Chinese leaders will take care to prevent another international backlash. One Chinese student who spent many months in prison after the crackdown said he thought that there would probably be no executions and that jail sentences would be relatively light -- five years or less. That compares to sentences of 15 years meted out to dissidents in past democracy movements.
"They are very insecure," said a middle-aged Beijing scholar. "On the outside, everything looks wonderful, but on the inside, they are still controlling us very tightly, even more so than before."

HEADLINE: Blunt Regulator Thrives in the Banking Crisis

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Six months ago the White House was trying very publicly to push L. William Seidman, the nation's top banking regulator, out the door, exasperated by his self-confidence, independence and tart tongue.
But those qualities are now seen as assets, and the Bush Administration is happy to have him stay on as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates 12,399 banks, and the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is overseeing the bailout of the savings and loan industry. 
 Mr. Seidman (pronounced SEED-man) accomplished this turnabout by making himself Mr. Indispensable. As the White House and Congress prepare to battle over reorganization of the nation's banking and financial services industries, he has emerged as the White House's vehicle for delivering the stream of bad news about the banking system that other Government officials have been reluctant to convey.
 
Value of Bad News
 The Administration believes some bad news, though not too much, is essential to motivate Congress to undertake a sweeping reorganization of the industry.
Mr. Seidman's good relations with Congress and the press help give him the leverage to push his own agenda. Happily for the White House and for him, his agenda is largely in sync with what the Administration wants.
On the other hand, he provides political cover for President Bush and the Republicans if problems among the nation's banks and savings associations become much worse.
"He will be the scapegoat if things fall apart," said a friend of his in the banking industry.
Since the attempt to remove him in May, the drumbeat of bad news for savings institutions and banks has grown steadily louder as Mr. Seidman's relationship with the Administration has mended. The banking industry is reeling from declining earnings, while the fund that insures bank deposits is expected to post record losses as it makes good on deposits at the growing number of failing institutions.
 
Experience Required
 "We are in a reasonably difficult period," a senior regulator said. "His experience is necessary now."
Mr. Seidman, a 69-year-old native of East Grand Rapids, Mich., has been at the F.D.I.C. since 1985, and his six-year term expires in October. For the last few weeks he has been coy about his plans. He has said for months that he would step down before then, but he has yet to set a date. He also insists that he does not want to be reappointed.
In an interview on Wednesday in his spacious sixth-floor office suite overlooking the Washington Monument and the Old Executive Office Building, he sidestepped the issue of his future, saying he hoped to figure out what to do while spending the holidays with his family at his 15,000-acre ranch in New Mexico. His hobbies there include raising expensive Corriente cattle and riding and raising horses.
"I haven't had a lot of chance to focus on it, between getting my skeleton back together and handling the daily emergencies around here," he said, referring to surgery on his hip last month and the mounting problems of banks and the Federal program that protects depositors.
 
'An Old Man's' Choices
 He is torn, he said, between what he called "my duty to the institution and financial institutions," and "a very long list of wonderful things for an old man" to do, including television commentary, the presidency of a university and the resumption of an active corporate career.
He also gets conflicting advice from his six children, most of whom have suggested he move on, and from his wife.
"She feels that I'm essential to save the financial system, poor misguided lady, so she wants me to do my duty," he said.
Mr. Seidman, who was trained as a lawyer and an accountant, was a managing partner of Seidman & Seidman, his family's accounting firm, when in 1974 he became one of President Gerald R. Ford's top advisers on the economy and the New York City fiscal crisis. In the 1960's he was an adviser to Gov. George Romney of Michigan and helped run his unsuccessful 1968 campaign for President.
 
A Corporate Officer
 Returning to private business in 1977, he spent five years as vice chairman and chief financial officer of the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the copper producer. He returned to Washington in 1983, as the co-chairman of the White House Conference on Productivity, and then was chosen to head the F.D.I.C. Last year, when Congress created the Resolution Trust Corporation, he added that chairmanship to his portfolio.
One important factor in his decision over how long to stay on, he says, is "who I want to work with, and who wants to work with me." The Bush Administration's leading official on the banking overhaul is Under Secretary of the Treasury Robert R. Glauber. Both men say they are getting along fine.
The attitude at the Treasury Department represents a sharp retreat from the stance taken six months ago. At that time, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, pressed for Mr. Seidman's departure after several disagreements that had lingered for more than a year.
 
A Cool Relationship
 Foremost among them was Mr. Seidman's opposition to a proposal to fold the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation into the Treasury. When the savings and loan bailout legislation was being prepared last year, relations between Treasury officials and Mr. Seidman were so cool that he did not learn of the Administration's plans for his agency until he was told by a Congressional aide.
His sharp tongue and unpredictable nature also did little to endear him to the Administration.
He ridiculed an idea that bank depositors pay a premium for insurance based on the size of their accounts in a change from the current system in which banks pay the fees. To the irritation of some senior White House officials, he repeatedly and publicly referred to the proposal as the "reverse toaster theory," referring to the incentives banks often give to new customers.
The remark infuriated Mr. Sununu, and the fight with the White House chief of staff became so widely known that Mr. Seidman recalls that friends subsequently sent three toasters to him.
 
Contrast to Brady
 He remains a studied contrast to Mr. Brady, who has maintained a lower public profile on financial issues and instead wields his influence by being the President's chief counselor on economic issues.
While the Treasury Secretary steadfastly rebuffed urgent requests to appear before Congress recently to explain how much is needed to bail out the nation's crippled savings and loans, Mr. Seidman did not decline a single invitation from Capitol Hill. Rather, he used the witness table brilliantly, offering a steady stream of brutally pessimistic projections to disarm those critics who have accused him of understating the problems facing the deposit insurance program and the savings and loan industry.
If he stays on much longer, Mr. Seidman would be facing the political test of his life. Republican strategists have warned that more problems with the savings and loan bailout and the banks could spell disaster for President Bush in 1992. There is a growing perception that with more trouble for banks on the horizon, Mr. Seidman could be an easy fall guy if things get much worse.
Asked about this concern, Mr. Seidman said: "That's a good insight into Beltway thinking. I'm not going from here to run for President or dog catcher or anything else."

Freshman With a Mission

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

DATELINE: PROVO, Utah

 BODY:
SOME time long before letters from dozens of colleges began to arrive, long before the jammed gymnasium at Emery High School, the two Utah state championships, the national all-star games and the beginning of his freshman season at Brigham Young University, and long before Shawn Bradley grew to 7 feet, 6 inches, there was a trip to an amusement park and a realization that remains as vivid as if it occurred yesterday.
"There was this bumper car ride," Bradley remembered. "All my friends were all excited about these bumper cars, and I was excited, too. And the lady goes, 'I'm sorry, you can't go on this ride.' 'Well, why?' She said, 'You have to stand over here.' 
 "So I went over in the corner and started crying, and I asked my Mom, 'Why won't she let me ride?' I was above the height limit for the little kids. I was a little kid. I was one of the youngest ones there. My Mom finally went over and told her, 'This kid is one of them. They're friends. He's always been that way. You can't treat him like that.' She wasn't quite that nice. She gave her a piece of her mind.
"They finally let me go on. But it has always sat in the back of my mind: Why didn't she let me go? I know because there were rules. But at the time I thought, hey, I'm a little bit different. That was the first time I realized I was a little bit different."
That difference has helped Bradley excel at a game that can become a career that can provide an athlete with a lifetime of financial security. But unlike many of those chosen few on the fast track from high school all-America status to the riches the professional game can bring, Bradley has also shown a rare ability to place his game in perspective.
His style, so surprisingly fluid for a 78-inch, 210-pound college freshman, inspired comparisons and speculation and wonder long before Bradley became a high school graduate: How big? How good? How high? How much? He has quickly established himself as a player capable of changing opponent's shots, if not the game itself.
Heading into the Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden this week, where Brigham Young will face South Carolina, Bradley leads the Cougars with averages of 18.3 points and 9.2 rebounds. And he is averaging 6.3 blocks a game, which led the nation last week. Six games into his college career, he blocked 14 shots to tie a National Collegiate Athletic Association record.
Even among the biggest players at the most competitive level, there is a difference. "The thing about Shawn that separates him from a lot of big guys is his desire to play the game," said Roger Reid, the Brigham Young coach who gained 11 inches at the center position, from 6-7 Steve Schreiner to the most highly recruited athlete in the history of the Cougar program.
"With a lot of big guys, somewhere along, someone said, 'Well, you're big, so you ought to be a basketball player,' Reid said. "And they're really not sure they want to be this basketball player. But that's what they do because somebody said they're supposed to.
"Shawn has his own self-motivated desire to be a basketball player," Reid said. "That's half the battle. I've been around big guys, 6-10 guys, 6-11 guys, that don't have the desire. Shawn really wants to be very good."
The freshman's voice is as deep as his arms are long. "If I was 6-6 or 5-6, I'd play the game," Bradley said. "I just have an innate love for basketball. I love it. It's a sport where you're running, you're cardiovascularly in condition. Your muscles have to be in condition. You're thinking. Everything is going on. It's a sport that involves almost everything. It's just so much fun to play."
The time has already come for Reid to point out that Bradley's game has moved closer to a business. That time came less than three weeks ago, not long after the return from an enjoyable, educational, but unproductive trip to Philadelphia, where foul trouble limited Bradley to just 15 minutes of play in a loss to La Salle.
That was the trip when Shawn Bradley, perhaps for the first time as an adult, found himself standing face-to-face with someone who forced him to stretch his frame as high as it could go. Bradley usually stands with self-assurance, his shoulders erect. But the day he met Manute Bol of the Philadelphia 76ers was unlike anything he had experienced.
"It's not every day you meet someone 7-6," Bradley said. "And it's not every day someone 7-6 meets someone 7-7.
"We were measuring up, standing there, trying to get the extra little bit."
As he remembered the happy confrontation, Bradley's chin inched outward and upward. His nose reached higher. His eyebrows arched.
"And someone said, 'I don't know, Manute. I don't know. It's awful close,' " Bradley recalled. "And he said, 'No, man. I'm still the king. I'm still the king.' That was sweet."
There was just one problem. Between the meeting with Manute, and the pregame interviews, and the tour of historic Philadelphia, and the autographs he signed for people behind the bench, Bradley had not been able to find any time to stop and consider what had to be done in the game.
So after the Cougars arrived back home, Reid thought it was time to talk. "I said all the people want to talk to him only because of what he does on the floor," said Reid. "That same attention can turn sour if you're not successful. So I had to tell him, 'You can talk to all these people if you want, but you better be businesslike when it's time to be businesslike. You better know how to adjust to all that attention.' "
Two days after their talk, in a game against Eastern Kentucky, Bradley's 14 blocked shots tied David Robinson's N.C.A.A. record and established an imposing personal standard. "If he's able to get 14 blocked shots, I expect that," Reid said. "I expect him to be in that neighborhood."
The coach expects that Bradley's commitment to improvement will guarantee it. "Just by adding one pound and any kind of strength, every day he's in the weight room, every day he picks up any kind of weight, he just gets better," Reid said.
"The best way people try to defend him is physically manhandling him. Holding. Pushing. Don't let him go where he wants to go. With added strength, that will never happen."
Bradley said he does not have an idea of how accomplished he can become. What some people would define as potential, Bradley sees as a potential barrier.
"If any player put a limitation on how good he or she could be," he said, "then they wouldn't be as good as they could have been."
Aside from an injury, there is just one factor that could disrupt Bradley's progress towards becoming a dominant player at Brigham Young for the foreseeable future. His devotion to the game, and to his daily improvement, is matched only by a devotion that will soon take him away from the game.
Bradley has decided that after his 19th birthday, next March, he will acknowledge the wishes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and leave for two years on a mission. He will receive an assignment to spread the word of his faith anywhere from a domestic site to a hostile, primitive area on another continent. Wherever he is sent, the strict regulations of the mission would leave little, if any, time for basketball.
It is a voluntary commitment that many outstanding Brigham Young athletes, including Jim McMahon, Steve Young and Danny Ainge, have chosen not to accept. The length and restrictions of the missions complicate any effort to achieve continuity in a basketball program that has played in 7 of the last 12 N.C.A.A. tournaments. Two of the six basketball players currently away on missions would have provided a badly needed balance in the backcourt.
"We love it and we deal with it," Reid said. "We endorse it 100 percent."
The father in Reid understands the importance of the missions; his son, Randy, is one of the six departed players serving the church from Kentucky to New Jersey to Argentina. But the coach within Reid would rather not have to wait until the 1993-94 season for Bradley's sophomore year; that is, if there is a sophomore year at Brigham Young.
If Bradley should serve on his mission and then leave for the National Basketball Association -- a scenario Bradley holds as an option -- it is possible that the greatest player Roger Reid will ever coach will be gone forever after one season.
"I don't know if there are many people in the country that would like to really try that," Reid said. "Take a Bobby Knight or a Dean Smith. I'm not sure they'd like to work with that too much."
In an era that has seen elite athletes coddled from the time they are in elementary school, pushed through an educational system without adequate reading skills, offered tens of thousands of dollars in illegal inducements and then tempted by N.B.A. dollars to leave school, it seems unthinkable that someone as young and gifted as Bradley could see beyond the trappings and volunteer to serve at a time in his life with such stunning economic potential.
"I hear it now," Bradley said. "'Why are you going to give it up? Why are you going to put off all that money? What if you lose your touch?'
"But it really doesn't bother me," he said. "It's something that the church officials and the Lord have asked us to do. We don't have to. It's not mandatory. We're not going to get kicked out of the church if we don't. But it's something they strongly suggest you do. And it's something I've always wanted to do.
"It's something that I think is mandatory for me, that I need. It's something that I want very much.
"I have often compared my excitement to go on the mission to the excitement I have coming here to play basketball. They're parallel."
Sometimes, when he is alone, Bradley wonders why all these things have happened to him. The world of an 18-year-old Utah farm boy is expanding from coast to coast, and soon may stretch beyond an ocean. His dream, the N.B.A., is coming closer to his reach. He has made friends that he can see becoming friends for life.
"When you're little," Bradley said, "you always remember a big-time change in your life. You remember big-time events. And this is a big-time event right now in my life, going from high school to college, playing basketball for the first year, making all these friends. This is a big-time event."

A Way to Help, With a Penny And a Thought

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
"The barrier between me and the homeless has grown higher over the years," Theodore Faro Gross wrote recently. "With it has come a feeling of powerlessness, combined with an uneasy mixture of guilt and anger.
"But walking down Broadway did not become an acutely uncomfortable experience until my daughter started putting to me questions I couldn't bring myself to answer. Like this one, posed as she pointed to a man crouching against the back of a newsstand: 'That man is cold. Why don't we bring him home?' " 
 Mr. Gross, a 41-year-old playwright and author of children's books, lives with his wife, a children's neurologist, and their 4-year-old daughter on Manhattan's Upper West Side. One day last year, when he fetched his daughter at the apartment next door, his neighbor retrieved Mr. Gross's keys from a porcelain jar jammed with unopened penny wrappers. Why, the neighbor's husband demanded, had he gone to a bank to get the wrappers if nobody bothered to use them?
"I said, 'You two have the same arguments we have,' " Mr. Gross recalled. "I was working on a children's story at the time with a character, a young bear, and something in the story had to do with a collection of pennies. I remember thinking, is this a story or is this something else?"
Mr. Gross's vision turned out to be something else. It evolved into grist for a story, this one.
"I canvassed my floor," he said, "and asked two questions: Do you have any pennies in your apartment? And how would you feel about giving them to the homeless? One neighbor showed me goldfish jars filled with pennies. Another neighbor's son had a cookie jar filled with pennies."
Encouraged by fellow congregants and officials at the West End Synagogue, guided by advisers from the Community Resource Exchange and by students from Columbia University's nonprofit law clinic, and supported by executives at Chemi cal Bank, where his wife's cousin works, and by a coin-count ing company, Mr. Gross organized Common Cents.
 Volunteers "har vest" coins, mostly pennies, from their neighbors. The entire proceeds -- without anything deducted for overhead -- are donated to the Coali tion for the Homeless. Mr. Gross got to know the Coalition six years ago when, through Artists in Action, he registered voters who had no permanent address. The contributions help pay for meals for homeless people from Grand Central Terminal and City Hall Park, rent subsidies to prevent homelessness, temporary housing for AIDS patients, and summer camp for children from welfare hotels and shelters.
Mr. Gross said he raised about $1,000 in his own apartment building last year and that volunteers harvested $1,000 in coins from two smaller buildings. This holiday season, he said, 47 buildings have been or are being harvested by volunteers ranging from 12 to 82 years old; residents of 25 more buildings are poised to join in.
About 12 billion pennies have been minted this year. The Government figures that 129 billion are in what is loosely described as circulation. Actually, some are being hoarded while many others, devalued as a nearly obsolete inconvenience, have been forgotten in pockets, containers and drawers. From each household that contributes, Mr. Gross estimates that Common Cents collects an average of $13 in coins.
As an emerging Vaclav Havel of West Side civic affairs, Teddy Gross regards volunteering to canvass for Common Cents as an entry-level job in grass-roots social activism. But, he said, "there's a limit to how much can be done run out of my kitchen," as he works at being a playwright (his latest is "a post-Contragate interpretation of the Trojan War") and a father. Piled in a corner of his apartment are canvas money bags awaiting delivery to the bank. Mr. Gross, using the Yiddish word for a container with which alms are solicited, calls the bags "post-inflation pushkes."
He has applied for a modest grant to cover administrative costs, including the Common Cents telephone (212 PENNIES). He is also exploring whether utility customers and merchants can be convinced to round off their bills and receipts, respectively, and to donate the difference.
The Coalition for the Homeless, meanwhile, hopes to persuade commercial tenants and managing agents to cooperate in mounting efforts like Common Cents in office buildings.
Mr. Gross has no illusions about solving homelessness. But, he said, "I realized that pennies and the homeless were the same: wasted capital, scorned and ignored." Sometimes, a big difference can begin with what seems like small change.

HEADLINE: Japanese Brokers Accused

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Japan's Finance Ministry has begun an investigation into whether Japanese brokerage houses intimidated two Japanese companies into canceling an agreement to issue new bonds through Salomon Brothers, an American brokerage with offices in Tokyo.
The ministry's confirmation that the investigation is taking place out of the public eye appears to be a tacit acknowledgement of a discriminatory practice that the ministry has long said does not exist. 
 The case has potentially broader implications, both for American efforts to obtain fairer competition in the Japanese financial markets and for the Finance Ministry's battle to keep other Japanese regulators out of its territory.
 
 Criticism by Treasury
 Two weeks ago, a report by the United States Treasury Department criticized the Japanese Government for continuing to provide unfair advantages to Japanese banks and securities companies.
The report acknowledged progress toward the opening of Japan's financial markets but noted that many remaining barriers were informal, involving exclusionary practices rather than explicit rules. One area singled out was the underwriting of securities for Japanese companies. It has been rare for a foreign securities firm to act as a lead underwriter.
Makoto Utsumi, the ministry's Vice Minister for International Affairs, said the report was inaccurate. "We have nothing to be ashamed of," he said in defending the ministry's record of deregulation.
 
 Inquiry Opened Quietly
 About the same time that the Treasury's report was released, the Japanese press reported that the two Japanese companies had canceled their deal with Salomon Brothers, a unit of Salomon Inc. Within days of those reports, the Finance Ministry quietly opened its investigation.
Another regulatory agency, the Fair Trade Commission, while generally regarded as toothless, has in recent months investigated and put a stop to some cartel-like practices in the financial industry, including meetings at which commercial bankers agree upon interest rates.
Those recent cases suggest the Finance Ministry has tolerated such anti-competitive practices, lending support to assertions by some experts that it may be using its enormous regulatory powers to benefit Japanese banks and securities companies to the disadvantage of consumers and foreign concerns.
The Salomon case involves two companies, the Oji Paper Company and the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company, that canceled offerings of yen-denominated bonds of which Salomon was to be the lead manager. The bonds were to be convertible later into stock.
It was the second time Salomon had tried to crack the lucrative underwriting business here; last winter it managed an offering of dollar-denominated bonds for Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc.
Salomon had won the latest deals by offering the companies extremely low interest rates on the bonds. It was able to do so by using a sophisticated technique that involved swapping the bonds into dollars, adding an option and then privately placing them with American investors, mostly insurance companies.
 
 Unusually Harsh Language
 Days later, Japan's biggest broker, the Nomura Securities Company, publicly protested Salomon's plans in unusually harsh language. "It's like exporting AIDS from Wall Street," Tadashi Takubo, an executive managing director of Nomura, was quoted as saying in the Japan Economic Journal.
Nomura later said that neither Mr. Takubo nor any other official would comment further. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical and Oji Paper have been unwilling to comment on the matter.
But Salomon executives insisted that Japan's Big Four securities houses, Nomura, the Daiwa Securities Company, the Nikko Securities Company and the Yamaichi Securities Company, had intimidated the companies into backing away from using an American lead underwriter.
 
 Accused of Making Threats
 These executives contend that the Japanese firms accomplished this by making veiled threats that their legions of stockbrokers would not encourage clients to buy the companies' shares, or would perhaps even encourage investors to sell the shares.
Tadashi Uemura, an official in the Finance Ministry's securities bureau, confirmed that the hearings were taking place. He said the Japanese firms had denied some descriptions of what had taken place. "We have not yet decided how we will respond to this matter," he added. But commonly such hearings are themselves the remedy, since the point is to send a warning to Japanese firms not to create such embarrassing episodes.
Another senior ministry official added that there was some concern about how Salomon was able to offer the two companies such good terms on the bonds. "The main point is we need to make clear that we do not have a policy of excluding foreign firms from the Euroyen market," he said.
 
ACTION ON ILLEGAL CARTELS

TOKYO, Dec. 23 (REUTERS) -- Japan plans to raise sharply the surcharges on companies involved in illegal cartels in response to a United States request for tougher penalties against violations of anti-monopoly laws, officials of Japan's Fair Trade Commission said on Friday.
Unlike fines, surcharges are administrative penalties used in Europe and Japan on companies that form cartels. The surcharges are imposed on sales in the period the company is found to have joined a cartel.
The commission plans to impose surcharges of up to 6 percent on a company's sales, for a period of up to three years, an official said. It now imposes surcharges of 2 percent on manufacturers, 1 percent on retailers, five-tenths of 1 percent for wholesalers and 1.5 percent on other companies. The charges average 1.5 percent of sales.
A United States Assistant Attorney General, James Rill, said last month that Japan should impose surcharges on illegal cartels amounting to 10 percent of sales.

HEADLINE: Casinos Falter, but Atlantic City's Fortunes May Be Rising

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
From his office on the seventh floor of City Hall, Mayor James Whelan has a panoramic view of the city: the glittering towers where gamblers play out their dreams and the mean, gritty slums where dreams are about all anybody can afford.
Both parts of town are changing dramatically. But for the first time since voters made casino betting legal, the casinos are looking down, while the city is looking up. 
 Mayor Whelan gestures toward the skyline carved along the boardwalk by DonaldJ. Trump's huge Taj Mahal and the other pleasure palaces, which even in a time of economic distress are money machines of awesome power -- and which now are producing resources for the city even as their owners face problems.
 
Shifting Fortunes
 The change in fortunes is visible. "For the first time since 1976, for the first time, you look out the window and you don't see any construction cranes," said Mr. Whelan, a native of Atlantic City who was a swimming coach and City Councilman until he became mayor five months ago.
But while there is no construction in thecasino area of the city, at least one crane is at work: in the Northeast Inlet, a devastated area just beyond the casinos that is sometimes compared with the South Bronx or war-torn Beirut.
The crane recently topped off a new housing development, plucking up the second floor and setting it atop the first as a kind of crown amid a seedy filigree of vacant lots, boarded-up homes and abandoned warehouses. The development of 130 new homes, financed by Harrah's casino, is not merely an oasis in the squalor. After nearly a decade and a half of unfulfilled promises, it is the most visible project to be completed in the city with casino money. There have been four other housing projects built under the aegis of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, an agency established to transform some of the revenue from legalized gambling into urban renewal for this troubled city. But the two largest ones were high-rises set on less than an acre apiece, and they did little to announce their presence.
These new low-rise units in the Northeast Inlet, part of a development called Harbour Pointe, cover two city blocks. And they are only the first phase of an ambitious project that will eventually cost $600 million and aims to turn the devastated area into a thriving middle-class neighborhood.
The new units are to be quickly followed by 200 more apartments built by K. Hovnanian, New Jersey's largest residential developer, and subsidized by the development authority.
Many people here believe the completion of the first phase is the start of Atlantic City's long-awaited renaissance.
After years of excuses, neglect and buck-passing, the casinos have been forced by the state to set aside a percentage of their gross win -- the total revenue from the gaming tables -- to help rehabilitate the city. The development program, authorized in 1984 and started in 1986, mandates that the casinos reinvest 1.25 percent of their gross revenues in projects that benefit the city, or, in some cases, other parts of the state.
Paradoxically, the signs of the city's revival come at a time when the gambling industry itself is in trouble after a dozen years of spectacular growth.
The city now has 12 casinos, and their gross gaming revenues last month totaled $240 million, about $8 million a day.
 
Trouble at the Casinos
 Although that was up from November 1989, when the gamblers left $214 million at the tables, the industry is in difficulty, brought on by junk-bond financing, large promotional expenses, a flattening market and overexpansion typified by Mr. Trump's Taj Mahal, which alone soaked up $30 million of the total November gaming revenue.
The Atlantis closed its doors 18 months ago, Merv Griffin's Resorts International went into and out of bankruptcy and Mr. Trump has said the Taj Mahal will probably enter bankruptcy. Whether or not it will come out is an open question.
But even if some casinos founder, total gambling revenues -- and thus the casino contribution to the city's development -- are not likely to drop sharply.
By the time legal gambling was adopted in 1976 in an attempt to save the city, all the elegant old hotels had been torn down, the boardwalk was all but deserted, and the city's population was declining sharply and becoming increasingly poor.
The casinos flourished, but the city continued to spiral downward. Its population today is about 38,000, half what it was in its heyday.
 
Lack of Housing
 The casino industry employs some 40,000 people, but almost all of them live outside the city. One reason is lack of good housing. The redevelopment program is changing that, as well as undertaking projects to revive the sagging business district.
Other changes also offer the city signs of hope.
The new Casino Control Commission chairman, Steven P. Perskie, who left Trenton as Gov. Jim Florio's chief of staff, sees his job not only as policing the gaming industry and putting it back on sound financial footing, but also as point man for the city's renewal. Mr. Perskie, like Mayor Whelan, is a Democrat.
The former Mayor, Jim Usry, a Republican, has been indicted on corruption charges, like two of his recent predecessors. Some previous mayors have also been known more for hostility toward Trenton than cooperation.
"For the first time in political history," Mr. Perskie said, "we have a Mayor who is part of the solution rather than part of the problem." Mr. Perskie grew up in the Atlantic City area and, as a member of the Legislature in the 1970's, wrote the bill legalizing casino gambling.
 
Coordinating Efforts
 Governor Florio also appointed him, Mayor Whelan and other key players to a new agency, the New Jersey-Atlantic City Coodinating Council, to cut through a chaotic array of agencies and authorities often characterized by infighting and rivalry.
One example: For a decade, traffic planners have urged that traffic lights on major thoroughfares be timed to speed traffic. When the state offered $500,000 through a transportation authority last year for a study, city officials turned it down for fear of "losing control" on the issue. Only public criticism changed their minds.
Racial divisions in the city -- which has about an equal number of black and white residents, and a growing number of Hispanics -- remain severe. But Mayor Whelan was elected by a landslide -- by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent -- on a racial unity theme; Mr. Usry, who was the city's first black mayor, based his campaign on a racial appeal to the city's blacks, aligning himself with the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, and refusing to campaign in white neighborhoods.
Meanwhile, the huge injection of casino capital means that the redevelopment authority can undertake projects that would otherwise be financially imprudent in a town as depressed as Atlantic City. The Harrah's development, Harbour Pointe, for example, cost $28 million and was heavily subsidized by the authority. Units that will sell for $69,000 actually cost over $200,000.
 
Commercial Development
 Over the next 25 years, the authority plans to spend $1.4 billion of casino money, the greatest part of it in Atlantic City.
The agency also recently enlarged its scope, planning redevelopment of two other large neighborhoods, Chelsea and Westside, as well as focusing on two economic development areas, the entrance corridor to the city and the downtown central business district along Atlantic Avenue. Besides extensive housing rehabilitation, projects include a commercial office building and a new 234-room hotel.
Plenty of problems remain, however.
While the city has firmly decided to sell the city airport and leave its proposed expansion to the state, neither the sale nor the establishment of an authority to run it has come to pass. Nor has any major air carrier stepped forward to provide the expanded service that many say is necessary to expand the market reach of the casinos.
And despite Mr. Whelan's electoral mandate, former Mayor Usry continues to act as a political rival. When Mr. Whelan hired a new city business administrator and increased salaries of other department heads, the former Mayor personally gathered signatures on an ultimately unsuccessful petition to block the moves.
Even the most optimistic people here concede that the problems are enormous. The 130 units of new housing built by Harrah's are complete, for example, but new sidewalks and gutters are six months away.
While the logjam on timing the city's traffic lights to expedite traffic has at last been broken, even Mayor Whelan, who is already replacing the city engineer, said he did not know when the job would be done.
"All this is much harder than it would seem," he said.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
2 Top Republicans Keep on Feuding, and Talking

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
This is a city of shifting alliances, strange partners, feuds folding into rapprochement, the constant clash of ego and expedience. But not many can figure out the relationship between Newt Gingrich, conservative bomb thrower, and Richard G. Darman, Machiavellian budget maker.
Over the last month the two men have engaged in a public duel that included speeches, philosophical debate, subtle and not so subtle digs, even an ultimatum. At the same time, privately, they keep talking -- and talking and talking, 10 to 12 hours in a variety of settings over the past three weeks, said one Republican close to Mr. Gingrich. 
 Burton Pines, a senior official at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative study group, struggled to explain the two men in a recent interview and then sighed, saying it was, perhaps, a task better suited to his wife, a psychotherapist. But there is more at work here than id and ego, although there is probably plenty of that.
"I think it's partly about real issues, it's partly psychodrama, and it's partly posturing," said one senior Administration official.
Like many great political spats, it all began with a speech. This one was delivered by Mr. Darman, the White House budget director, and grandly titled, "Neo-Neo-Ism: Reflections on Hubble-ism, Rationalism and the Pursuit of Excellence (After the Fiscal Follies)."
Some say the talk was intended to be lighthearted, a whimsical trip through domestic policy and the fads that often sweep it. But there is little room for whimsy among Republicans these days, riven as they are between right and left, old imperatives and new paradigms. Mr. Darman's speech, to the Council for Excellence in Government, a nonpartisan organization of former senior Government officials, was taken very seriously by some conservatives, a slap by the dark prince of establishment Republicanism at their search for new ideas.
The most obvious target was Jim Pinkerton, the young White House aide who has been promoting a "new paradigm" for domestic policy, emphasizing values like empowering the poor. But Newt Gingrich quickly made the fight his own.
 
One More Fight
 Mr. Gingrich, the House Republican whip, was coming off a harrowing autumn, having broken bitterly with the White House over the budget negotiations and having endured a humiliatingly close re-election race in his district in the Atlanta suburbs. But being Newt Gingrich, a man whose political passions are in a permanent state of arousal, he had room for another fight left in him.
Mr. Gingrich said his initial reaction was that the Darman speech was sad, an exercise in "preppy humor" and -- most insulting of all in Washington policy circles -- "not very important in and of itself." But in the days that followed, the Georgia Republican decided that Mr. Darman was trying to take on the conservatives and their search for a new domestic policy.
So Mr. Gingrich delivered a public ultimatum to the budget director: Recant or resign. Mr. Darman, to whom the word arrogant is assigned as often as hothead is to Mr. Gingrich, did neither, and Washington braced itself for the mighty clash of two formidable egos.
Instead, the two men began to talk.
Mr. Gingrich says they are seeking to air their differences, to try to debate the shape of domestic policy as the White House prepares its next budget and State of the Union message. Mr. Darman refuses to be interviewed about it.
 
Battle for the Party's Soul
 The Darman-Gingrich tension is just part of the broader battle for the soul of the Republican Party. The struggle over the budget last fall reflected these passions: Many Republicans found the Administration's acceptance of higher taxes a stunning repudiation of not only the economic orthodoxy of the party but also of a successful political formula, a victory for the accommodationist wing of the party.
Mr. Gingrich broke with the White House over the budget and became a leader of the opposition. He scoffs at the notion that, after 10 years of Reaganomics and growing deficits, it was simply an act of good government to raise some taxes and reach a budget deal with the Democrats.
"In Washington, governing is almost always a synonym for tax increases," Mr. Gingrich said. "When you see someone described as willing to govern, it means they're willing to raise taxes."
Mr. Gingrich says he is on a quest for a governing conservatism, a way of adapting an opposition movement to the task of running the country. "In our 10th year as the party holding the White House, we still have not begun to replace the welfare state," Mr. Gingrich complained. Conservatives are also lobbying intensely for Mr. Bush to return to tax cuts and supply-side economics in his State of the Union message.
 
The Establishment Embodied
 Mr. Darman, on the other hand, is the embodiment of establishment Republicanism, a man of process as well as politics, a principal deal maker in this fall's budget making. This alone rubs some people the wrong way. It is hard to be a Republican in the House, after 36 years of Democratic rule. It is harder still to watch a Republican Administration, in the person of Mr. Darman, underscore your lack of power by striking deals with Congressional Democrats.
Mr. Darman, moreover, approached the budget talks with considerable pride of authorship. Some Darman-watchers theorize that he considered the eventual agreement a crowning achievement and was hurt at the scorn heaped upon it. "He had just pulled off this great budget deal and nobody liked it," said one senior Republican who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "This was supposed to make him Jim Baker Jr."
Indeed, in his celebrated speech, Mr. Darman declared that the budget agreement was "a giant step toward controlling the deficit," but added, "I realize I may be the first to suggest unequivocal support for the five-year deficit reduction program just enacted."
The budget director then proceeded to warn against a rush toward "new paradigms" for governing, and cast a skeptical eye on the general American affection for new ideas, including, he said at one point, "New-Newt-ism." Such approaches, he said, should be tempered with pragmatism, and reflect "the hard choices of detailed program design and resource allocation."
The game was on.
 
A Speech for a Speech
 Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Darman give big speeches with big ideas and big titles. So it was only natural that Mr. Gingrich would respond to Mr. Darman's "Neo-Neo-ism" speech with one of his own. It was called: "Beyond the Incrementalism, Hard Choices vs. Hard Thinking."
Mr. Gingrich told his audience: "I am not as smart as the director of the budget. I did not go to the Kennedy School." (He did, however, embark on a Gingrichian tour of ideology, values and American culture, raising questions like, "Are families simply randomized gatherings of humans who happen to cohabitate for a brief period?").
On the matter at hand, striking a blow for new paradigms against the onslaught of the managerialists, Mr. Gingrich raised the specter of another Kennedy School graduate, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.
Mr. Darman was wrong to dismiss the "isms" that sweep this country, Mr. Gingrich asserted: "Ideological battles matter. If they didn't matter, we would be talking about President Dukakis, he himself would be giving a large part of this speech, because he is a technocrat and he wanted us to believe that ideology didn't matter."
In the capital, this is strong stuff.
Some Republican strategists said it made perfect sense for Mr. Gingrich, given his conservative base, to rise to Mr. Darman's challenge. "Attacking Darman, Newt benefits," asserted one Republican strategist close to both men.
 
'Common Ground for Reform'
 It is less clear why the two men are doing all this quiet talking.
"We're trying to find a common ground of reform," said Mr. Gingrich. "What he thinks is sustainable within the budget agreement and other things that he is wedded to, and what I think meets the basic needs of the Republican Party and the constituencies we represent." But the Georgia Republican acknowleged that his fellow conservatives are wary of all this consorting.
"They're real glad I took him on and they're real worried that I'm talking to him," Mr. Gingrich said. "There's a sense that it's easier to drive him out of the Government than it is to work with him."
Mr. Pines of the Heritage Foundation agrees: "We see no purpose in trying to convince him. We know he's an enemy of empowerment. We know he makes fun of the new paradigm. We know that he's an old-line Wall Street Republican."
 
'Trash the Other Guy'
 A senior Administration official theorized, "I think they have these meetings and then they go home and trash the other guy to their friends."
The denouement is not far off. Once President Bush produces his budget and his State of the Union, Mr. Gingrich will either be within the White House fold, with Mr. Darman, or outside it. The fact that he is talking to Mr. Darman, Mr. Gingrich says, should not be overestimated. "There's a tendency to say, 'We've had these nice talks; doesn't that mean something?' " the Georgia Republican said. What matters is the result, he added.
Or, he said as he reflected, "In the land of pure process, the principled man is a heretic." Can this marriage be saved.

HEADLINE: Pink Slips for Law Firm Partners As Tradition Bows to Tough Times

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
At Hale & Dorr's annual meeting at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in early 1988, the law firm's managing partner singled out Blair L. Perry for his contributions over the previous 31 years.
Mr. Perry was not ready to retire, and continued to practice law. But last March, almost two years to the day after that festive dinner, the same managing partner approached Mr. Perry with a very different message: this time, he was letting him go. 
 For the 61-year old Mr. Perry and partners like him at large law firms throughout the country, pink slips are becoming increasingly common. A century-old tradition of job security, dating to the early days of America's great firms, is dying -- a casualty, oddly enough, of both the current recession and of the preceding prosperity.
 
The Importance of Partnership
 Once, a partnership at a large law firm like Hale & Dorr, perhaps Boston's most illustrious firm, was akin to tenure at a university. While the odds against becoming a partner were long indeed, and those rejected were expected to leave, the prize made the risk worthwhile. Barring egregious misconduct, partners were partners for life. A law firm took care of its own, through alcoholism, financial problems, depression, divorce and other calamities.
But as law firms mushroomed, their cohesiveness and collegiality eroded. Mr. Perry was the 35th lawyer at Hale & Dorr when he started in 1957; with his departure there will be 316.
 
Into the Upper Echelons
 Now, tough times have hit the legal profession. A recession that has already seen hundreds of junior lawyers lose their jobs is spreading into the upper echelons, affecting lawyers who do not produce or for whatever reason no longer fit in.
In the last few months, several large firms in New York, including Rogers & Wells, Webster & Sheffield, Shea & Gould and Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler have asked partners to leave. Previously, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy of New York and Winston & Strawn of Chicago, did the same. And legal recruiters say the job situation is likely to get tighter.
"In the bell curve of how bad it's going to get, we're probably less than halfway up the slope," said K. C. Victor, a legal recruiter in New York. Another recruiter, Carol Kanarek, said, "It's just in its baby stages."
Lesley Friedman of Special Counsel Inc., which places lawyers in temporary positions, said she had begun to receive numerous resumes from discharged partners. "It's a first in the legal profession," she said. "One thing that astounds me is the quality of the partners. They're people from the best firms and the best law schools. It's really heart-breaking and scary."
 
Some Bleak Job Prospects
 A lawyer recently told to leave the large New York firm where he had worked for more than 30 years lamented that "partnership" now meant next to nothing. "We've had recessions before," he said, "but not a one of them entailed what's happening to law firms now, not a one. Ten years ago we hadn't been through this period of greed, when firms overexpanded."
He complained that discharged partners faced bleak job prospects unless they had "portables" -- that is, they could bring to their new firms as much as $1 million in business. "It's been rough," he said. "I'm not ready to retire, but the market's terrible. There's no maneuvering room unless you control major clients, and then they'd never have let you go."
In that sense, Mr. Perry is fortunate. Next month he will join Fish & Richardson, Boston's largest patent firm. "You wonder if you've slipped a notch and don't know it, but I'm satisfied that I'm as fine a lawyer as I've been in the past," he said. "It's very flattering to know you're wanted after being kicked in the teeth by your management."
Still, he has not told all his soon-to-be-former partners about his new job. "I tell them I'm going to stand out in front of the building with a tin cup and a sign that says 'Former Partner at Hale & Dorr' and see how much I can collect," he said. "If they have any sense of humor, they laugh."
 
'I'm Being Forced Out'
 The precise scope of the discharges, which are concentrated among lawyers specializing in real estate, corporate transactions and mergers and acquisitions, is hard to quantify. Many are being presented by the firm as "early retirements" rather than as discharges. That is the term that Hale & Dorr's John Fabiano used to describe Mr. Perry's departure.
But Mr. Perry said: "I don't regard this as a negotiated 'retirement.' I'm being forced out, against my wishes."
Bradford Hildebrandt, a consultant in Somerville, N.J., specializing in the economics of large law firms, said firms first talked of cutting unproductive partners five or six years ago. But only recently, he said, had they actually begun doing so.
"From time immemorial, partnership was really a lifetime commitment and problem partners were basically taken care of," Mr. Hildebrandt said. "Now, partnership is more a matter of 'what have you done for me lately?' "
In some instances, he continued, firms that had long disdained economics had become almost obsessed with them. "We've trained our present management to be so bottom-line oriented that some might have become a bit hard-hearted and short-sighted," he said. "They're underestimating the importance of human values."
 
McCarthy Incident Recalled
 Mr. Perry came to Hale & Dorr via Williams College and Harvard Law School. After having earned the highest score in the state on the Massachusetts bar exam, he arrived at the firm in 1957. That was three years after Joseph Welch, the firm's most famous partner, angrily accused Senator Joseph R. McCarthy at the Army-McCarthy hearings ("Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?") of besmirching the reputation of Frederick Fisher, a young Hale & Dorr associate.
Such loyalty was typical of Hale & Dorr and firms of its type. Mr. Perry, who specialized in maritime and intellectual property cases, earned a reputation for brilliance, doggedness and independence. He also played a role in the firm's management, when he formally invited James St. Clair to return to the firm after he left to defend President Richard M. Nixon in the end game of Watergate.
For a time in the early 1980's Mr. Perry was derailed, professionally and personally, by divorce. Still, he helped the firm enter the lucrative field of high technology and intellectual property, a contribution that Hale & Dorr's managing partner, John D. Hamilton Jr., acknowledged at the firm's partnership meeting in February 1988.
"Blair, you had the foresight to lead Hale & Dorr into a new area of law," he said, as Mr. Perry stood by. "Without your continued support the ballgame would never have started and we could never have loaded the bases as well as we have to date."
 
Token of a Championship
 Mr. Perry, he said, symbolized the "many partners who make significant contributions which often go unheralded." In appreciation, he presented Mr. Perry with a baseball signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers team that won the 1955 World Series.
Scarcely two years after those words of praise, when Mr. Perry had recovered from an illness that had forced him to work at home for a time, he was called to meet with Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Fabiano, ostensibly on another matter. Mr. Hamilton told him the firm wanted him out, no later than the end of the year.
"I was quite taken aback," recalled Mr. Perry, who said never before had his work been criticized. "I said: 'What am I accused of doing? Am I not functioning well?' "
He said Mr. Hamilton told him that competency was not the issue, but listed several other grievances: that Mr. Perry worked at home too much, had a reputation as a "loner" and did not "leverage" -- that is, use enough paralegals and associates -- on his cases. The firm, Mr. Perry was told, had decided he would be "happier somewhere else."
Mr. Hamilton did not return repeated phone calls. Mr. Fabiano refused to comment on the meeting.
 
Weeks Filled With Lasts
 Mr. Perry said he considered insisting on a vote of the entire partnership, which was ostensibly required to remove anyone, but later rejected the idea. "A lot of people whose advice I respected told me, 'You can win the vote, but life here will be so uncomfortable for you that you'd wished you left."
On Oct. 25, after the firm had increased its initial settlement offer, Mr. Perry agreed to leave by Dec. 31.
The last few weeks have been filled with lasts: his last Christmas party, his last meeting with fellow litigators, his last partnership meeting, where he could hear what the firm describes as the "golden parachute" it is giving him being discussed and approved.
Looking out his window toward North Station and the Boston Garden, sitting among boxes containing 33 years of legal effects, Mr. Perry pondered that meeting for a moment. "It was sort of as if you died and you were attending your own wake," he said.

WPP Outlook Turns Worrisome

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
In a further sign of the pessimism with which advertising executives are looking ahead to next year, the WPP Group said Friday that it would not pay a previously announced interim dividend to shareholders because of weak cash flow.
The reaction of investors was sharp and negative. In London, WPP's shares -- which had traded earlier this year at well above 7 ($13) -- fell 18 percent, or 11 pence, to close at 50 pence (about 95 cents). In over-the-counter trading in the United States, the company's American depository receipts fell 35 percent, or $1.1875, to $2.1875. 
 WPP, based in London, is one of the three largest communications and advertising companies in the world and is the parent company of two large American agencies, J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy & Mather. Another big London-based advertising holding company, Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., also stunned analysts earlier this month with an unusually grim forecast for 1991.
 
No January Dividend
 WPP had told shareholders in August that it intended to pay an interim dividend of 13.7 pence, or about 25 cents, a share in January.
Cancellation of the dividend was disclosed in a letter from David Ogilvy, the chairman of WPP, to shareholders. In explaining the company's actions, Mr. Ogilvy wrote, "We now consider that it would not be in the best interests of the company to pay the interim dividend."
While the company was confident of "achieving satisfactory profits," he said cash flow was "below our projections" because of the adverse economic climate.
The announcement surprised some analysts. Last month, Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, told analysts that he expected WPP's 1990 pretax profits to be somewhat lower than brokers' estimates of 110 million.
That caused a precipitous drop in WPP's stock, which quickly lost more than half its value. But most analysts considered the company basically sound. They reacted by lowering their estimates of WPP's 1990 profits to about 85 million.
"I was surprised," said James Dougherty, an analyst with County Natwest Securities. "I don't know why there was any need to do this. It is the action of a company that is in desperate straits."
Mr. Dougherty said he had expected that WPP would have a couple of tough years but that the situation was "a long way from disastrous."
Contacted at his office in London, Mr. Sorrell declined to comment.
Even though the advertising industry is in a bad slump in the United States and Britian, Thompson, one of WPP's large networks, is performing well. Like other international agencies, Thompson has been helped by its extensive networks in Europe and Asia, which are expanding rapidly.
The picture is gloomier at Ogilvy. The agency has lost several high-profile accounts this year, most recently a major portion of the $50 million Nutrasweet account. In addition, its Scali, McCabe, Sloves unit has been racked by account losses and embarrassed by the publicity over a faked Volvo ad.
"Ogilvy has yet to prove that it was worth the trouble of an expensive acquisition," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst at Paine Webber.
Although Mr. Sorrell has declined to comment about WPP's prospects next year, Mr. Ogilvy hints in his letter at what the future holds. In discussing dismal forecasts for the industry in 1991, Mr. Ogilvy said, "It may therefore be some time before the group can resume the pattern of growth in profits and earnings experienced up until a few months ago."
Mr. Sorrell is considered a shrewd deal maker, building an empire through a succession of acquisitions, including the first hostile takeover of an agency, the acquisition of J. Walter Thompson in 1987. He succeeded in buying Ogilvy two years later.
Some analysts said WPP's falling fortunes might make it difficult for the company to pay its debts. WPP has debts of more than $600 million, primarily incurred in the acquisition of Ogilvy.
WPP has been talking with its creditor banks, trying to renegotiate its loan arrangements; J. P. Morgan & Company is the company's lead banker. Rupert Faure-Walker, a spokesman for Samuel Montagu & Company, WPP's financial adviser, said he was "confident that WPP would secure favorable arrangements with its banks."
WPP is trying to renegotiate some guarantees involved with its loans, including the amount of cash reserves it must maintain, Mr. Faure-Walker said.
Unlike financially troubled Saatchi & Saatchi, WPP is not expected to sell any of its units as a way of raising cash. But the company will probably cut costs in other ways like employee layoffs.

The Final Warning

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Not since Maksim Litvinov, Stalin's commissar for foreign affairs, vainly warned his own leader and the world against appeasing the dictator Hitler has a Soviet diplomat shown the vision of Eduard Shevardnadze in warning of the impending dictatorship of freedom's faithless friend, Mikhail Gorbachev.
 Consider how this historic admonition reverberates around the globe: 
 In the Soviet Union, people seeking religious toleration or fearful of ethnic persecution are in a panic to escape. Dissidents see the face of Stalin's secret police chief, Lavrenti Beria, in the bland features of Vladimir Kryuchkov of the K.G.B., who exhumes the politics of paranoia to rail at C.I.A. subversion even in the corn being delivered by the West. The Red Army's colonels of crackdown go unrebuffed.
 The occupied Baltic States brace for brutality from their quisling, the Latvian Boris Pugo, recently elevated by Mr. Gorbachev to head what is fast becoming a new version of the Ministry of Fear.
 In the United States, the Gorby-at-any-price claque derogates the Shevardnadze warning, grimly sticking with its man as the bulwark against Stalinism even as his inner circle reveals the truth: The dictator has chosen to label freedom "chaos," and prettify repression as "order," for the purpose of holding a tight union and preventing the development of a free confederation.
 America's doves are looking for a dividend in the resignation of the man who brought Soviet policy into the coalition against Saddam Hussein. They hope that K.G.B. and Red Army elements that opposed the Shevardnadze line may now press for a deal that leaves the Iraqi dictator, a longtime Soviet client, in peace and in power; U.S. accommodationists, eager for delay in the Persian Gulf, would prefer the Arabist Boris Primakov or the anti-American Valentin Falin as Kremlin Foreign Minister.
 Here in Britain, where the principled resignation of a key minister led to the toppling of Mrs. Thatcher, the resignation of Mr. Shevardnadze is seen as a harbinger of the downfall of Mr. Gorbachev, or at least the doom of the "good" Gorbachev.
 Recent Red Army cheating on conventional disarmament agreements, tacitly approved by the "bad" Gorbachev, humiliated Mr. Shevardnadze. What now troubles Francois Heisbourg, who heads the Institute for Strategic Studies here, is a possible setback for the Start treaty, scheduled for completion at a Moscow summit in February.
 Strategists are attracted to Start today for a reason that would have been considered bizarre a year ago: It may better enable both superpowers to count and control the Soviet Union's nuclear missiles in case of a union breakup; also, the missiles scheduled for retirement first are sited in the Ukraine, a fast-loosening republic.
 How does the departing Minister's cry for help in reform resonate in the minds of those who always believed Mr. Gorbachev to be a power-hungry opportunist, improvising glasnost as a means to jettison the burden of Eastern Europe and save the Soviet Union for Socialist central control?
 We find it hard to comprehend how his apologists in the West can still cling to the notion that he is saving us all from sinister forces of repression, and that we should help him as he applies a little discipline -- some unavoidable skull-cracking -- to those irresponsible types whose calls for self-government cause "chaos." Even our Secretary of State takes the moment of the Shevardnadze resignation, the first such political self-sacrifice in Kremlin history, to remind us of the dangers of "chaos."
 The people closest to the Great Juggler know better. After five years of talk about restructuring, he has built only a new edifice of power for himself, the K.G.B. and the Red Army generals, making the Soviet Union safe for dictatorship.
 Some of his early followers attributed a dream to him -- a vision of a less regimented, more productive land. They have now been shunted aside, subjected to harassment and humiliation that leads to self-purge, by men with harder eyes and more brutal ways.
 The Great Juggling Act is coming to an end. To an internal empire whose unity can be saved only by voluntary federalism, the juggler has dropped his pins on the side of inescapable union. To a command economy that can be rescued only by the profit motive, he comes down on the side of further control. To peoples who need the rule of law, he proclaims the law of the ruler -- "presidential rule," this millennium's final euphemism for tyranny.

Profitable Increase in Selling Stocks Short

BYLINE: By Richard D. Hylton

 BODY:
A sign of the times is that it is the Wall Street bears who are now buying corporate jets. Feshbach Brothers, based in Palo Alto, Calif., the country's largest short-seller, recently paid nearly $11 million for a Challenger 601A jet, according to Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
The Feshbachs may need the jet to visit a lot more clients a lot faster these days, since they are racking up strong returns on their main short-selling partnership -- the $550 million Southgate Partners. They now have almost $1 billion in various funds, up several hundred million dollars this year. 
 A short-seller borrows shares and sells them at the prevailing price. These sellers expect the price of the shares to fall by a specified date, allowing them to repurchase the shares at a lower price later and return them to the borrower, making a profit on the difference. In this way, short-sellers can gain in a declining market.
But even during the bull market of 1985-89, according to a recent report by Cambridge Associates, returns for all dedicated short-sellers -- those whose portfolios are exclusively in short-selling -- ranged from 20 to 30 percent, far ahead of the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500. Not surprisingly now, since the broad market indexes have fallen sharply, short-sellers are realizing returns as high as 70 percent.
Their success has not gone unnoticed by money managers, who have recently turned from their bullish ways and started their own short-selling funds to cash in on the market's nearly unending stream of bad news. "There seems to be a proliferation of short-sellers," said one money manager who handles about $800 million for private clients and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
James S. Chanos of Kynikos Associates, which has about $400 million in its short-selling fund, said his firm had only about $1 billion committed to dedicated short-selling funds a year ago, but that now the amount was about $2.5 billion.
The professional shorts are not the only ones getting in on this game. Individual investors have lately taken a much more visible role, and several brokerages report that retail short-selling in October and November climbed sharply. On the New York Stock Exchange, the short interest climbed from about 706 million shares in September to nearly 856 million in December.
This short-selling boomlet among retail customers can be bad news for professional short-sellers. During extended bear markets, the effect of short-sellers concentrating on a small universe of stocks can cause quick, devastating turnarounds for the market. Beginning in October and continuing last month, some of the less-experienced shorts created such a snapback when, at the first sign of a rising market, they rushed to cover their positions in widely shorted stocks, buying shares to replace the borrowed ones they sold. The sudden burst of demand created a small rally that battered some of the professionals' portfolios.
The Feshbachs, for example, took a beating in November. For the first nine months of 1990, Southgate's net return was about 47.3 percent, according to the Cambridge Associates study. The Feshbachs had taken little of their profit out of the market when the small rally last month chopped off about 15 percent of their gain.
"Nobody likes to lose money in a short period of time, and we figured out a way to do it in October and November," Joseph Feshbach said. "But we've made up a lot of that in the past few weeks."
Some changes in the portfolios of the big short-sellers have come with the sharply higher amounts of capital that have begun to pursue many of the same stocks. The large amounts of capital dedicated to shorting small-capitalization stocks has eliminated some of the opportunities for short-sellers of these stocks. Because these thinly capitalized stocks have relatively few shares trading on the market, short-selling opportunities are limited because it is harder to borrow enough shares so an investor can make a worthwhile transaction or buy enough shares to cover a short position.
Partly as a result of this, the portfolios of some of the largest short funds now contain an unusually large proportion of the large-capitalization, widely traded issues that offer greater liquidity.
Of course, the lending and borrowing binge of the last decade has weakened many large companies. That has done a lot to turn large-capitalization issues -- of both financial institutions and the companies that borrowed heavily from them -- into bonanzas for short-sellers.
Shorting the financial-services sector, mainly banks and savings and loan institutions, has paid handsomely, and much of the short interest is concentrated in these stocks. The finance sector of the S.& P. 500 fell 28.4 percent through the end of September. Short interest in Citicorp, for example, increased 98.8 percent from October to November, rising to 16.9 million shares. Given the average daily volume of about 2.28 million Citicorp shares, it would take about 7.4 days to cover that position, according to Birinyi Associates Inc., a New York-based investment research firm.
Consumer-goods producers, airlines and retailers are among the other segments where short-sellers are placing bets. In November, the greatest rise in short interest was in Toys "R" Us stock, with short interest up 35 percent, according to Birinyi Associates.

Because of an editing error, the Market Place column in Business Day on Monday incorrectly paraphrased a comment by James S. Chanos of Kynikos Associates about the amount of money committed to funds that specialize in the short selling of stock. He said $2.5 billion was now committed to all such funds, not just to the Kynikos fund, compared with about $1 billion a year ago.

HEADLINE: Herbert Salzman Is Dead at 74; Economics Adviser to 4 Presidents

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Herbert Salzman, a business executive and merchant banker who served four Presidents in the field of international economics, died yesterday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 74 years old and had homes on the East Side of Manhattan and in Westport, Conn., and Klosters, Switzerland.
He died of leukemia, his family said. 
 Mr. Salzman, who had careers in business, government and banking, also served in 1983 as a New York City commissioner who advised on foreign business in New York City. After that he was a general partner in Bradford Ventures Ltd., a merchant bank that invests in promising companies.
Born to Russian immigrant parents in Brooklyn, Mr. Salzman attended public schools there and, in 1934, the Reali School of Haifa, Palestine. He graduated cum laude from Yale College in 1938 and also took an advanced management program at Columbia University in 1954.
 
Joined Father's Company
 Out of Yale, he joined the Standard Bag Corporation, founded by his father, William S. In World War II he enlisted in the Navy as an ensign. He was a lieutenant commander when he returned to civilian life in 1946.
A vice president of Standard Bag from 1938 until he became president in 1959, he was instrumental in the company's strong growth. When Mr. Salzman turned 50, he sold the company and went into Government service.
President Lyndon B. Johnson made him assistant administrator for the Agency for International Development in 1966, and the following spring he was put in charge of the agency's new private resources division. That office was created to channel private initiative and capital into projects in poor countries.
Mr. Salzman's division handled an investment guarantee program, forerunner of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. A quasi-public body underwritten by Congress, its purpose was to offer American money to third-world nations for economic development while insuring the investment against the risks of political upheaval and expropriation.
 
Worked With Javits
 One promoter of the program was Senator Jacob K. Javits, a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mr. Salzman worked closely with him in shaping the corporation. The agency was created by legislation and was to have begun operations on July 1, 1970, but Senator Javits jousted with President Richard M. Nixon over who should run it.
Mr. Javits warned the Senate that unless Mr. Salzman was nominated, rather than President Nixon's favorite, the Senator would block funds for the corporation indefinitely. A compromise was reached at the end of the year when Mr. Nixon submitted a new list of 12 directors, with Mr. Salzman as executive vice president.
Mr. Salzman, who was reappointed by President Gerald R. Ford, remained with the corporation until 1976. The following year President Jimmy Carter sent him to Paris as the United States representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a post he held until 1981.
 
Held New York City Post
 Mayor Edward I. Koch, as part of an overhaul of his Office for Economic Development, named Mr. Salzman Commissioner of the Office of International Business Development in 1983. He began the job on March 15 but resigned in July.
At the time he informed the Mayor's office that he considered his mission accomplished by having gauged the extent to which foreigners were doing business in the city and setting forth the ways of keeping them and attracting more.
Over the years Mr. Salzman served on many governmental and private bodies, including trusteeships at the Studio Theater, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and Harvard's Center for International Affairs.
He is survived by his wife, the former Rita Fredricks; two sons, Anthony David and Jeffrey Jonathan; a sister, Sally Pepper, and two grandchildren, all of Manhattan.

New President Named By Worlds of Wonder

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
Worlds of Wonder Inc., the once successful maker of high-technology toys, last week named Keith E. Schaefer president of the company. Worlds of Wonder, which grew rapidly on the strength of Teddy Ruxpin, a talking stuffed bear, was bought by private investors in February 1989 after declaring bankruptcy in December 1987.
Mr. Schaefer, who is 41 years old, succeeds Joshua W. Denham, who has been appointed to a new position as executive vice president at Worlds' parent company, Sheridan Companies Inc., which has interests in toys and housewares, including Worlds of Wonder, Lewco and the Manhattan Toy Company. Mr. Schaefer will report to Franklyn S. Barry Jr., Worlds' chairman and the majority owner of Sheridan. 
 Most recently, Mr. Schaefer had been senior vice president of NEC Technologies Inc., in charge of the company's computer and home entertainment marketing in Chicago.
"To me, Worlds of Wonder is an absolute once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take the company from where it is today to back on top of the mountain and this time do it with control, do it with a focus on the bottom line and at the same time keep the magic for children that it has always had," Mr. Schaefer said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Schaefer added that he was anxious to return to the San Francisco Bay area, where he has continued to own a home. Worlds of Wonder is based in Fremont, near San Jose. "I've been itching to get back to the Silicon Valley and the whole entrepreneurial spirit that's missing in Chicago," he said.
Before NEC, Mr. Schaefer worked for the Atari Corporation, which he joined in 1980 as national sales manager, rising ultimately to executive vice president for sales and distribution. He began his marketing career at Procter & Gamble, where he joined the company's brand management group in 1973. He was later a brand manager for the Clorox Company.
He received his M.B.A. from the University of California at Los Angeles, and his B.S. in economics and political science from the University of Pittsburgh. He is divorced and has one child.

HEADLINE: Health Problems of Inner City Poor Reaching Crisis Point

SERIES: Islands of Illness/Health Crisis in the Cities

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
While Americans elsewhere are living longer, healthier lives, residents of the inner cities inhabit islands of illness, epidemics and premature death. After decades of gradual improvement, the health of the urban poor took a turn for the worse in the late 1980's and has now reached critical condition.
 Experts blame new depths of urban poverty and inadequate medical services for the situation. Struggling for day-to-day survival, people have little time for niceties like doctor's visits. Poor nutrition and overcrowded housing create ideal conditions for the spread of disease. The arrival of AIDS and crack pushed chronic hardship into crisis, shattering families and monopolizing scarce health dollars. 
In the past three years, cities have reported skyrocketing rates of tuberculosis, hepatitis A, syphilis, gonorrhea, measles, mumps, whooping cough, complicated ear infections and, of course, AIDS. The number of cases is still often small, but most of these diseases were considered on the verge of eradication only five years ago after steadily declining since the beginning of the century. Many of them are virtually unknown in middle-class or wealthy neighborhoods.
 
'I've Seen Horrible Things'
 Dr. David Wood, a pediatrician at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, called 1990 a "gangbuster year" for inner city epidemics. "If you look at maps of measles outbreaks in Los Angeles and where the poverty is, they are the same."
 Studies also show that impoverished city dwellers with serious conditions like cancer and heart disease die far more quickly than their middle-class counterparts because treatment begins so late. "I never saw a woman die of cancer of the cervix until I came to the Bronx," said Dr. Carolyn Runowicz, a gynecologist at the Montefiore Medical Center. "On Park Avenue, women get pap smears, which prevent it."
 The death rate among the poor is also higher. In 1988, deaths from diabetes-related illnesses totaled five times as high in central Harlem as in the city's wealthier neighborhoods.
 But statistics, which at best count deaths and infectious diseases, capture only a glimpse of the big picture. They do not tally unnecessary suffering or the lifelong handicaps that result when treatable conditions like asthma and epilepsy go unrecognized or neglected.
 "I've seen horrible things," Dr. Wood said. "Kids who have such frequent seizures that they can't go to school. Kids with asthma who don't get medications and can't play outside because they get coughing fits. It's like years ago when people with unsalvageable conditions were hidden away."
 Dr. Harold P. Freeman, chief of surgery at Harlem Hospital in New York, caused a stir earlier this year when he reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that a black man in Harlem was less likely to reach 65 years of age than a man in Bangladesh. While violent crime is part of the problem, the paper said high rates of disease were the primary cause.
 "When 67 people die in an earthquake in San Francisco, we call it a disaster and the President visits," said Dr. Freeman. "But here everyone is ignoring a chronic consistent disaster area, with many more people dying. And there is no question that things are getting worse."
 In Newark, Dr. Beatriz Arpayaglou has learned to be a pessimist. "We're seeing scenes here straight out of underdeveloped countries, diseases that haven't been seen in the United States since the turn of the century," said Dr. Arpayaglou, a pediatrician with the University Hospital in Newark's Children's Health Project, which sends medical teams to low-income housing projects in vans fitted like medical offices. "It's really very frightening."
 In the next room of the medical van at the Stella Wright Apartments, a nurse, Anne Young, was seeing Kison Chauvers, a 2-year-old boy with anemia from nutritional deficiencies. The day before the team had rushed a 5-year-old girl to the hospital with a life-threatening kidney infection whose symptoms had been neglected for several days. Her grandmother, the stoic guardian to seven children of two daughters who died of AIDS, could not get the child to a doctor sooner.

 
Epidemics of Yesteryear

 To Poor, Vaccines Prove Elusive
 Different cities have fallen prey to different diseases:
 In New York City, 1,017 babies were born with congenital syphilis in 1988, the most recent year for which figures are available, up from only 16 in 1982. New York City accounts for about half the cases nationally.
 Newark has had a 35 percent yearly rise in the number of new tuberculosis cases between 1988 and '89, and the pediatric clinic at Newark's University Hospital reports a fourfold increase since 1987. There has been a 15 percent increase in tuberculosis cases in the country as a whole since 1988, largely in urban areas.
 In Los Angeles this year several hundred people have been hospitalized for measles, and 30 have died. The number of measles cases nationwide rose to 17,000 last year, from a low of 1,500 in 1983. The city had also played host to an outbreak of rubella, or German measles, which has left at least nine babies with serious birth defects. Rubella is a mild illness in adults but leads to blindness in the offspring of women who catch it while pregnant.
 Washington is just recovering from a three-year mumps outbreak. After seeing less than half a dozen cases a year for a decade, the city had about 200 reported cases in both 1988 and '89.
 "These epidemics are sentinel events for the crumbling of our public health services," Dr. Wood said. Measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough are entirely preventable with vaccines, but many people do not get the shots.
 Nationally, asthma rates have undergone a dramatic and somewhat baffling rise, a rise doctors say is more pronounced among the urban poor. Dr. Michael Wietzman and colleagues at Boston City Hospital found that black children were twice as likely as white children to have asthma.
 In many studies, scientists compare black and white rather than rich and poor to eke out information about health care differences, since it is easier to figure out race than salary from medical records and far more blacks than whites live in the inner city. But most experts say it is primarily poverty, not race, that raises the risk.
 "It's mostly the social dimensions of being black," said Dr. Weitzman, now chief of Pediatrics at Rochester General Hospital in Rochester, N.Y. "Its being poor, living in overcrowded housing, having a low birth weight, being exposed to household toxins."

 
In Need of the Basics

 Hazardous Homes, Dangerous Diets
 Experts say the growing number of people who live in substandard housing with poor sanitation creates conditions favoring the rapid spread of infectious disease. "Diseases transmit more effectively and rapidly in crowded living conditions," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate deputy director of disease control programs for Los Angeles County. "A few years ago we went out to investigate a typhoid case and we found 27 people living in one house sharing a bathroom."
 As middle-class people worry about clean air and the ozone layer, many scientists blame indoor pollution for the high rates of asthma and other diseases among the poor. In the Boston study, the factor most tightly linked to a child's risk of developing asthma was smoking by the mother, Dr. Weitzman said. Poor young women from minority groups are the country's fastest growing group of cigarette smokers.
 Living in decaying housing, 68 percent of very poor black children and 36 percent of very poor white children in central cities have blood lead levels greater than 15 micrograms per deciliter. The Centers for Disease Control now defines toxic levels at above 25, but the agency said last week that it would advise local health officials to take action when children have lead levels higher than 10.
 Diets rich in fat and low in nutrients also take a toll. Many poor children have chronic anemia, a low red blood cell count caused by a lack of iron in their diet, leaving them perpetually tired.
 Once sick, poor people in the inner cities tend to suffer serious complications. Dr. Wood remembers examining a 9-year old girl with a facial tic and discovering 20/200 vision and profound hearing loss from damage done by untreated ear infections. "She was holding her face funny partly because she couldn't see," he said. "Her parents had seen a few doctors and used up their money. No wonder she's failing in school."

 
Quality of Care

 Prevention, And Much to Cure
 For poor people in the cities, access to care is part of the problem. To be treated in a public clinic for sexually transmitted disease in Washington, a patient has to be in the clinic by 9:30 A.M. and often must wait most of the day, said Dr. Reed Tuckson, former Commissioner of Health for Washington.
 The typical wait to schedule a pedriatric appointment in inner city clinics was several months, according to a survey done by the New York Children's Health Project, a medical outreach program affiliated with the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.
 But many experts say an even greater issue is the quality of care. The Community Service Society of New York polled 248 primary care doctors in poor neighborhoods in the Bronx as to whether they offered 24-hour coverage, had 20 or more regular office hours a week, accepted Medicare and had admitting privileges at a hospital -- what the society defined as minimum components of a decent medical practice. Only six met the criteria.
 The society's study also found that more than 60 percent of doctors providing prenatal care could not actually deliver babies because they had no hospital affiliation; the mothers were referred to an emergency room.
 "The family says yes we're seeing a doctor, but when you look the care is not well organized," said Dr. Karen Burke, medical director of the New York Children's Health Project. Experts say that clinics in poor neighborhoods focus on acute illnesses and ignore routine care like pap smears, anemia screening and vaccinations, which are generally less profitable.
 Pediatricians are particularly worried about how early lives plagued by health problems will affect children as they age. Babies born in Central Harlem are four times as likely to have very low birth weight than babies born in more prosperous New York neighborhoods, a statistic with lifelong consequences since babies under 3.5 pounds are more likely to have seizures, mental retardation, heart problems, asthma, blindness, deafness and learning disabilities. In today's inner cities, drug abuse and poor prenatal nutrition often converge to yield tiny babies.
 "A kid in a middle-class suburb who has an ear infection gets antibiotics and gets better," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the New York Children's Health Project. "A poor kid with an ear infection doesn't and progresses to chronic infection, hearing loss and language delays."
 In both Newark and New York, most of the preschool children seen in the mobile vans are not fully vaccinated, leaving them vulnerable to serious diseases.
 Other inner city children have been wastefully, though not harmfully, vaccinated over and over again because of a lack of medical records. At a health van in Harlem, 15-year-old Jewel S. had no records because his life has been a flurry of different welfare homes and schools as he and his mother flee an abusive father.
 The surging number of poor children and the rising costs of medicines have stymied vaccination programs, Dr. Woods said. In the early '70s, the total cost of a child's vaccinations was under $5; now it is several hundred dollars.

 
Contrasts of the Crisis

 Determining Death By Money and Race
 In a study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology this year, scientists at the Washington, D.C., Commission on Public Health estimated that blacks in Washington were more than four times as likely as whites to die prematurely, before 65, of heart disease, asthma, pneumonia and some cancers. While the death rates for blacks in Washington have climbed steadily since 1982, the rates for whites have not changed.
 "We looked at conditions that people shouldn't be dying from in the prime of life," said Dr. Eugene Schwartz, the study's first author, and the chief of the Washington Bureau of Cancer Control. "And remember, death is a very crude measure. It's the tip of an iceberg, the end of a long chain of illness and disability that we don't have a handle on."
 Dr. Freeman tells of the shock of moving to Harlem Hospital from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, also in Manhattan, but four long miles downtown. "When I came to Harlem Hospital in the late '60s I suddenly found I was seeing extremely advanced cancer, and that hasn't changed," he said. Because they come so late to treatment, only 30 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer at Harlem Hospital live 5 years, compared to 70 percent of white women and 60 percent of black women overall in the United States. Dr. Freeman has set up free cancer screening at Harlem Hospital two mornings a week.
 The fates of blacks and whites, rich and poor are diverging. The National Center for Health Statistic first started comparing black-white infant mortality in 1950, and the difference has never been greater than it is today, with black babies dying at twice the rate before their first birthday. While the life expectancy of whites rose to 75.6 years in 1987, that of blacks fell to 69.2.
 Doctors involved in outreach efforts hope they will save a few lives but know these are frail, jury-rigged solutions.
 "We're using Band-Aids, and things are getting worse rather than better," Dr. Freeman said. "You have to see disease in the context in which it occurs: poor education, unemployment, homelessness, hopelessness."
 Dr. Tuckson said: "It's hard to tell young black men in the inner city to practice safe sex or not to smoke. They'll laugh: 'You're telling me not to smoke so I won't get cancer when I'm 50? Hell, don't tell me about 50 'cause I'm not gonna make it out of my teens.' There are an extraordinarily large number of Americans who don't believe in any concept of a future and so don't believe in investing in it."

A Land Where Tinsel Lies in Tatters

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, the Philippines, Dec. 20

 BODY:
There seems to be less Christmas spirit and simple pleasure in Roman Catholic Manila this year.
Most of the lights that used to adorn major streets like Roxas Boulevard have not been put up this year. The Mayor of Manila, Gemiliano C. Lopez Jr., has even been criticized for trying to brighten up the trees along Roxas with capiz shell lanterns, with some suggesting that energy is too expensive now for such fripperies, even at Christmas. 
 For businesses, sales are not good, though anything would be better than last Christmas, which followed a nearly successful coup attempt against President Corazon C. Aquino.
Filipinos are spending "much, much less," said a jeweler in Makati, Manila's main business district, which the coup plotters were occupying a year ago. "And whatever anyone tells you," he said, "tourism hasn't come back, either."
 
'Apathy and Fatalism'
 Nor have many foreign investors, perhaps overly concerned about the lack of stability here, as Mrs. Aquino loses more political leverage as the 1992 elections draw closer and the coup plotters, despite their lack of success, inevitably continue to plot. Senior Western diplomats say they expect further efforts at destablization, perhaps including assassination attempts, and another coup attempt, but expect it to fail.
"There's no real popular support for a coup any more," a diplomat said. "The problem now is apathy and fatalism: there's not much popular support for anything or anyone."
In addition, this has been a particularly miserable year for natural tragedies here, with a bad drought hurting agriculture, a devastating earthquake in July and a ferocious typhoon last month that pounded one of the country's few bright spots, Cebu, and destroyed up to 90 percent of the mango crop.
 
Who's Sorry Now
 "Many diehard Corystas," supporters of Mrs. Aquino, universally known as Cory, "are now sorrystas," said Blas F. Ople, a leader of the opposition Nationalist Party. While a debate rages between those who traditionally look to government to solve their problems and those who favor a more liberal, market orientation, he said: "The poor woman is stuck in dead center, where nothing moves. It's a balance of incompetence."
Others joke that while the Philippines may be giving the United States a hard time in negotiations over American military bases here, Manila has joined NATO -- No Action, Talk Only.
When there is action, it's often fumbling. After the highly confusing and unpopular round of energy price rises, some demonstrators, including a few from the middle class, were promoting, possibly with Christmas in mind, what they called the "four R's": Roll back, Reform, Resign, Repent.
Still, most Filipinos and diplomats here believe that Mrs. Aquino will be nursed along to the end of her six-year term in 1992, unless the economy really crashes and can be manipulated by her enemies.
"The economy is the main security threat just now," a senior military adviser said. "If the crunch really comes or oil goes up to $50 a barrel, all bets are off."
 
'Economic Wind Shear'
 A war in the Persian Gulf, a senior diplomat said, "would be like an economic wind shear for this decrepit DC-3 country, which is belching smoke but still in the air."
But a financial crunch is coming in the next quarter, perhaps as early as January, even without a gulf war. The fight is over fiscal discipline and the nature of the economy, and after a long period of patience with Manila, the International Monetary Fund is now fed up.
It is playing a serious game of "chicken" with Manila, holding back on a large amount of needed funds until fiscal reforms are made.
At stake is at least $700 million in loans from the fund itself. But hanging on the fund's seal of approval is at least $1.2 billion in new aid and loans, including the contributions of a multinational fund set up to help democracy here.
With tourism and investment off, the country has foreign exchange enough for only one and a half months of imports at current levels, and oil, which must be paid for in dollars, remains expensive in this period of phony war in the gulf. Growth next year is expected to decline sharply to about 2 percent, and inflation reach 16 percent.
So the fund wants a cut in the Government's deficit, an end to subsidies on staples like petroleum, import liberalization, better tax collection, and tax reform, to help make the Philippines a sounder, more competitive, more export-based economy.
 
Looking for Action
 And this time it wants action, not merely promises, from a weakening Government and a Congress that has its collective mind on the 1992 elections. Still, no one expects the fund to send the ship of state to the floor of Manila Bay, and most diplomats expect the country, as usual, to muddle through.
Senator Rene V. Saguisag remains one of Mrs. Aquino's firmest supporters, but like her, says he will not run again for office in 1992. Building democracy here is like building a medieval cathedral, brick by brick, he said, "and we will at least have put down our share of bricks."
But 1991 will be "a very, very tough year," he said. "For this Christmas, I suppose we can say, like the French priest at the end of the Terror, 'I survived.' We just have to hope the worst is behind us now."

HEADLINE: Talking Business/with a former state insurance commissioner;
Need for Stronger Regulation Seen

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
With insurance company insolvencies apparently on the rise, attention is increasingly focusing on state regulation as one culprit. Critics charge that state insurance departments are starved for resources and are no match for industry lawyers and accountants. The critics say Federal insurance regulation may provide a solution.
James P. Corcoran, who was commissioner of New York State's Insurance Department from 1983 until last January, argues that Federal regulation is no solution to the problems of insurers, but acknowledges that state regulation needs strengthening. Under Mr. Corcoran, New York State's Insurance Department, considered one of the strongest in the nation, grew to 800 people from 600 while its budget doubled to $60 million. 
 Q. What specifically needs to be done to upgrade state insurance departments?
A. There has to be consistency of funding at insurance departments around the country. There are strong departments, and then there are underfunded departments. This has resulted in inconsistent treatment of insurers. The weaker departments need more computer technology, and they need to hire more actuaries.
Q. Is the issue purely money or is it a question of competence, too?
A. Money and competence are linked. You cannot expect top people to stay in these jobs and remain underpaid for too long. They deal with multitudes of lawyers and outside actuaries, many of whom are better paid than they.
Q. Do you agree with critics who argue that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is a paper tiger that promulgates unenforceable rules because it has no enforcement power?
A. Not really. The association is undergoing a courageous self-analysis. I'm talking about its recent decision to begin certifying state insurance departments. Certification means that an insurance department has adopted various model laws passed by the association and has adequate funding and staff. There is one question that remains: What happens if an insurance department is not certified? Shouldn't there be more teeth?
Q. Do you favor Federal regulation of insurance as one solution to weak state regulation?
A. You need to tell me precisely what you mean by Federal regulation. No one has said what the Feds would do. One view is that Federal involvement with insurance should be in the form of a national guaranty fund. My idea on that is that if you have a national guaranty fund, impose a deductible so that policyholders have some incentive to investigate an insurer's financial condition.
Q. Do you object to the current characterization of insurers as facing a financial "crisis"?
A. There is no crisis. There is a manageable problem that needs to be addressed now. One problem relates to matching, whether the maturity of investment contracts that insurers sold was properly matched to the maturity of the assets the insurers invested in. That's what regulators are currently trying to determine.
Q. So does that mean that you do not expect the number of insurance company insolvencies to rise sharply?
A. I do not. The problem will be managed. There is tremendous sensitivity to the possibility of a major problem if nothing is done. The industry also understands the need to cooperate in the sense that policyholders have to believe that the industry is solvent. Yes, there will be mergers and acquisitions to lessen the number of companies -- there are too many companies writing too little business -- but there won't be a sharp rise in insolvencies.
Q. Does this mean that individual policyholders need not worry about insurers' health?
A. People are still covered by state guaranty funds. So even if the XYZ fly-by-night insurer goes broke, the individual does not get hurt. But there is a reason for insurance companies to worry because they will continue to pay for the cost of guaranty funds. As to the consumer, while the average person has insurance limits above his policy limits, that is not the ideal situation. You don't want people buying investment-type products from insurance companies and the salesman saying: "Don't worry. It's covered by insurance." Consumers should have some incentive to look at an insurer's financial condition.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Long-Term U.S. Issues Fall

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds dropped and yields rose yesterday in a shortened pre-Christmas trading day, while most bills posted small gains.
Dealers attributed the sharp declines in the longer maturities to a relatively modest amount of selling by portfolio managers who wanted to add cash to their balance sheets, despite an extremely thin market. 
 The market in Government securities, which normally does not have fixed trading hours, closed at 2 P.M., Eastern standard time, or two hours after the Treasury and Federal Reserve closed their offices.
 
 Slightly Above Lows of Day
 As it was, the close found the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, being offered at 104 11/32, down 25/32, or slightly above its lows of the day. The decline raised the long bond's yield to 8.35 percent, from 8.27 percent on Friday.
The Treasury's long notes, the 8.5 percent issue due November 2000, dropped 18/32, to 102 4/32, as its yield rose to 8.18 percent, from 8.08 percent on Friday.
That portfolio managers would choose to take profits in a predictably thin market was not the only surprise of the day. The Federal Reserve added a further $1.5 billion of reserves to the banking system through customer repurchase agreements after it had injected a substantial amount of reserves on Friday to cover holiday credit demands by effecting six-day systemwide repos.
 
 Funds Rate at 6.5 Percent
 At the time of the Fed's latest infustion of reserves, the key funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans was trading at 7 1/8 percent, or an eighth above what is currently perceived as the Fed's target for this bedrock cost of credit. Perhaps as a result of the Fed's action, the funds rate closed at 6.5 percent.
But the Treasury bill market, which is the most sensitive to any action by the central bank, largely ignored the drop in the funds rate. The discount rate on the 90-day bills closed down a basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point, at 6.54 percent; six-month bills rose two basis points, to 6.63 percent, and the one-year bills added four basis points, at 6.56 percent.
 
 Next Bill Sale on Jan. 2
 Because of the shortened holiday session, the Treasury held its weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills last Friday, But the bills will still be dated Dec. 27. The Treasury's next auctions of bills are scheduled for Jan. 2, also because of holiday considerations.
After the market reopens tomorrow, the Treasury plans to auction $12.5 billion of two-year notes, which traded on a when-issued basis to yield 7.29 percent, up five basis points from Friday. On Thursday, the Treasury will auction $8.5 billion of four-year notes, its last of this maturity. The four-year notes traded on a when-issued basis to yield 7.74 percent, compared with 7.66 percent last Friday.
Starting in January, the Treasury will hold a monthly auction of five-year notes, instead of every three months, as has been the practice.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
The Boston Globe said last week that it would reduce its work force by 100 full-time positions through attrition in the next five years.
The 100 positions represent about 5 percent of the full-time staff at The Globe, which employs 2,075 full-time and 500 part-time workers. 
 "We are experiencing the same economic forces affecting other companies," said William O. Taylor, the publisher of The Globe and chairman of its parent company, Affiliated Publications Inc. "Advertising is down significantly this year, and the outlook is cautious at best."
Mr. Taylor has said that he expects earnings to be down significantly at Affiliated Publications and that the company plans to raise the price of The Globe in April to 50 cents, from 35 cents, in areas more than 30 miles outside the city.

HEADLINE: Japan Offers Adults New Electronic Toys For Holiday Season

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Few countries celebrate the holidays as intensely as Japan does. As the end of the year nears, droves of blue-suited office workers take fellow employees, their best customers and their bosses on endless celebrations, often ending up in one of thousands of "snack bars" and "hostess clubs." As part of the ritual, a big-screen television set showing a music video with lyrics printed on the screen is flipped on, a microphone is passed around, and after sake and beer overwhelm traditional Japanese reticence, people begin to sing along. All night.
Now, with an enthusiasm born of long and noisy nights, Japan's industrial giants think the outside world is ready for large numbers of yet another export: those same "laser karaoke" systems that combine music, video images and lyrics in scrolling captions. 
 Japan's electronics makers are pushing a $1,000 karaoke kit for the home this holiday season. But karaoke systems are just one of the new gadgets Japan's electronics makers are selling this season. For those too shy or tone deaf to sing along, there is always the $400 Data Discman, a Walkman for those who would rather read a dictionary or encyclopedia than listen to Michael Jackson (it is Sony's hottest product of the year), or any number of car navigation systems, Japan's newest status symbol now that car phones are passe.
Not all of those products are yet available in the United States; with increasing frequency, the hottest electronics innovations are introduced first in Japan, where manufacturers feel they can gauge consumers' reactions firsthand. But even amid signs of recession, it is America that the Japanese makers ultimately have in mind, so the electronic ghost of Christmas present here is bound to be the ghost of Christmases yet to come in the United States.
Just ask Makoto Sakoh, an international marketing manager for sing-along systems at the Pioneer Electronic Corporation who has been visiting bars from New Orleans to Woodbridge, N.J., to study how karaoke systems need to be modified to suit American tastes. Pioneer says it has already installed 20,000 karaoke systems in American bars, restaurants and homes. (Pronounced kar-ah-okay, the word means "empty orchestra.")
"The basic concept is the same around the world," Mr. Sakoh said. All laser karaoke systems are centered on a videodisk player, hooked to a large television and a powerful set of speakers. The music "library" consists of disks, each containing about 28 songs and each matched with a different music video.
A laser beam "reads" the song and video much as it reads sound on a compact disk. But through a microphone, it also mixes in the voice of a person singing along. In bars or restaurants, patrons watch the video and sing along, cued by the on-screen lyrics. The system adds a lot of echoes, making even the off-pitch sound good, especially as the evening wears on.
 
The Shy American?
 "I am not trying to bring Japanese culture to other countries," Mr. Sakoh said the other day, when asked whether the United States was ready for the era of just-in-time sing-alongs. "American karaoke is quite different from Japanese style. In Japan, karaoke customers sing alone. In the U.S., they sing in groups. I don't know why. Maybe Americans are really very shy."
In his office at Pioneer's headquarters here, Mr. Sakoh keeps a video of a recent beach party for college students in Daytona Beach, Fla., who seem anything but shy. He shakes his head as he watches a group of swimsuit-clad students scream out the refrain of "Born to Be Wild" at a bar Pioneer hired to promote its system.
"These people are crazy," he says.
Half a million karaoke systems have been installed in Japan, or one for every 250 Japanese. The market is saturated, though Sony has found a hit this year with a poor man's karaoke system that consists of a bullhorn that alters one's voice and plays a limited repertoire of tunes stored in computer chips.
 
Popular in Asia
 While Pioneer, which did a $500 million business in karaoke systems last year, thinks America will eventually be ripe for karaoke, right now the big market is in Asia. (The exception is South Korea, where bitter memories of Japan's occupation have resulted in laws barring the sale of Japanese songs.)
In Taiwan and Hong Kong, restaurants often install several Chinese-language systems, at a cost of $4,000 to $8,000 each. "They have to put them in private rooms," Mr. Sakoh said, "because too many fights were breaking out about what to play."
If karaoke is Japan's export hit, the nation's at-home Christmas present is the Data Discman, Sony's latest entry in CD-ROM players. A CD-ROM is a compact disk jammed with digital data, usually encyclopedia entries or phone directories or transcripts of court decisions and newspaper articles. But until now, one usually needed a computer, hooked to a CD-ROM disk drive, to get at the reams of data packed onto a single disk. No longer.
The Discman is a one-pound, palm-sized keyboard with a pop-up liquid-crystal display. About four inches by seven inches, it "plays" eight-centimeter disks, about the size of "CD Singles" or small CD's that play one song. But they are big enough to pack a huge amount of computer data: Type in a key word and you can call up an encyclopedia entry.
 
A Hot Novelty
 When Sony brought out the Data Discman, at roughly $450, its product planners thought it would be a novelty, but not a big seller until many textbooks, dictionaries, instruction manuals, even product catalogues were available on the tiny disks. They were wrong. At the end of last month, Sony had already sold 90,000 units and told its factories to pump out 20,000 a month.
But so far, the only model is a Japanese-language one. Sony says English-language material has not yet been put in the right format for the miniature disk player. The problems are expected to be solved by next summer. Already, one feature of the players works in any language: Data Discman users who are tired of reading can pop in a CD single. The Discman plays music, through a set of headphones.
Another new category of electronic gadgetry in Japan this season also uses CD-ROM: car-navigation systems, which display a street map on a dashboard screen and indicate a car's exact location. As the car moves, so does a dot tracking its position on city streets and open road.
 
U.S. Technology
 American companies have been experimenting with such systems for years, and provide much of the key technology. But the first major commercial systems seem to be coming out in Japan, largely because an organization called the Digital Road Map Association -- financed by electronics makers and automobile companies -- has turned out a four-disk road atlas that covers all of the archipelago, from Hokkaido to Okinawa. A set of disks costs just shy of $300.
The disks are placed in a CD-ROM player installed in a car, and the maps appear on a color, flat-panel liquid crystal display screen.
But while many technologies are being marketed to track a driver's position, none yet work as well as their promoters contend.
The most advanced systems, like Pioneer's new $4,000 model and similar ones being marketed by Mazda and Toyota, fix a car's location by receiving signals from 16 global positioning satellites in orbit. The satellites have long been used by the military, and by ships.
The signals are received by a flat, box-like antenna mounted on a car's trunk. Fed into the navigation system's computer, the signals are matched with the maps, displaying the car's movements with an accuracy that can be measured in yards.
The problem is that not enough satellites are yet in orbit to give 24-hour coverage of the earth -- meaning that in midafternoon and after 9 P.M. in Japan, the system is useless. And on a recent test through the streets of Tokyo, the signal was frequently lost, especially in areas surrounded by high buildings. Nonetheless, Pioneer says it has sold 6,000 units since the system went on sale this summer.
 
Gyroscopes and Compasses
 Competing systems, promoted by Mitsubishi Motors and others, do not rely on satellites. Some use a gyroscope, which senses every turn of the car and adjusts the map display accordingly. Others use a compass in combination with a sensor that counts the rotation of a car's wheels and calculates the distance traveled. Both systems, however, require the driver to enter a precise position before setting out on a journey.
All three technologies suffer from a common problem: So far, the CD-ROM maps are not very detailed.

HEADLINE: Anxious California Braces for Another Dry Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORRO BAY, Calif., Dec. 20

 BODY:
The drought that has stricken California and the Southwest is entering its fifth year, and probably nowhere has water become more of a preoccupation of daily life than here on the central coast of California.
An ordinary puddle can be a source of wonder; people funnel waste water from their washing machines to their gardens, and Joy Elliott, the police chief's administrative assistant here, catches the three gallons of cold water that come up before the hot water starts in her morning shower and saves it for the lawn. 
 The drought has left gardeners and construction workers without jobs and has prompted the City Council here to consider importing water by barge from Canada. Neighbors snitch on one another for wasting water, and the town is riven by recriminations over getting more.
"People get angry," said Sandi Ford, Morro Bay's water conservation enforcer, or "water witch," as she calls herself. "Nobody ever thought the day would come when we didn't have water."
But that day has come for most of California, Nevada and Arizona. All signs point to a fifth consecutive dry year, forcing restrictions that could fundamentally alter living styles in a region for which cheap, plentiful water has long been the blood coursing through the veins of the economy. Water rationing will start Feb. 1 in Southern California, the land of swimming pools and car washes.
The drought could also affect other parts of the country, as California farmers, who produce half of all the fruits and vegetables in the United States, change crops and cut acreage.
And the drought has stirred growing complaints among urban residents that California farmers, who use more than 80 percent of the water, waste the cheap, federally subsidized water they get by inefficient irrigation and by growing crops like alfalfa and cotton, which require a lot of water.
Almost nothing has been untouched by the drought in California, whose population of nearly 30 million competes with forests, wildlife, agriculture and industry for increasingly scarce water. Wells are going brackish and electricty rates are up, partly because of lost hydroelectric power.
Despite a snowstorm in the Sierra Nevada this week it will take much more to reverse the cumulative effect of four years of drought. Since Oct. 1, when the wet season normally begins in arid California, precipitation has been only 25 percent of normal, and stream flows are ominously low.
 
Dropping Water Levels
 At a time when reservoirs are normally refilling after the summer the water levels in California's reservoirs have been dropping and now stand at 57 percent of the average for this time of year. They are down by four million acre feet of water, or about 10 percent below last year's level. An acre foot is 325,851 gallons, about enough to supply two families for one year.
"Right now we are partially using reservoir storage," said Maurice Roos, chief hydrologist at the California Department of Water Resources. "We just will not be able to supply the water we used to."
In Nevada, the nation's fastest-growing state, John W. James, a climatologist in Reno who is chairman of the Governor's Drought Review and Reporting Committee, said, "It's like being behind three months on your car payment and you can't make this month's payment, either."
Cities, water agencies and farmers throughout the region are taking costly emergency measures to find more water and conserve what they have. In Santa Barbara, 80 miles northwest of Los Angeles, the City Council voted Tuesday to build a plant to purify seawater, even as a debate continued over whether to also build a pipeline to tie the city into the State Water Project, a system of dams, reservoirs and aqueducts that channels water from the Sierra Nevada to farms and cities through much of California.
 
Rationing to Start Feb. 1
 On Dec. 11 the Metropolitan Water District, which supplies two-thirds of the water to Southern California, ordered a 10 percent cut in supplies starting on Feb. 1, the first such rationing since 1977. The order has forced cities from Los Angeles to San Diego to consider adding stiff penalities to the current rules against washing sidewalks and watering plants during the day.
Morro Bay, a fishing and tourist town of 10,000 people 12 miles northwest of San Luis Obispo, depends entirely on underground water, and four of its eight wells have gone dry or bad.
The City Council is considering a number of options, all very costly. These options, in addition to the proposal to import water from Canada, include desalination, diverting coastal streams, tying into the State Water Project and reclaiming waste water.
Drought is nothing new to California. In "East of Eden," a novel about Salinas Valley settlers in the first two decades of the 20th century, John Steinbeck wrote about cracked land and listless cattle nibbling at dry twigs.
"People would have to haul water in barrels to their farms just for drinking," he wrote. "And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way."
Since then the vast water systems have turned deserts into prosperous farms and sprawling industrialized cities that today are, in a way, even more dependent on water than Steinbeck's settlers.
Despite four dry years, California farmers have managed to keep production up, with $17.5 billion in sales last year. But this could be the break year for many, with water deliveries expected to be cut by 65 percent if heavy precipitation does not occur soon.
Those with permanent crops, like almonds or citrus, will have to buy water at any cost to preserve their plants for better years, said Mary-Ann Warmerdam, director of natural resources for the California Farm Bureau.
 
Some Terrible Choices
 Other farmers will have to switch to crops that use less water, like broccoli, garlic and onions. Those who can will switch to pumping water found underground, despite the heavy expense.
But there is so little good underground water on the west side of the vast Central Valley that farmers like Ted Sheely face some terrible choices. He raises cotton and tomatoes on 1,000 acres in Huron, in Kings County south of Fresno. His only choice may be to stop planting cotton. "If I don't have enough water I'll have to cut back and lay off people," he said.
The situation is no better across the Sierra in Nevada, where Gov. Bob Miller's 12-member drought committee is expected to send a drought plan to the Legislature next week.
For California cities, the effects vary enormously. San Francisco, which gets 80 percent of its water from just one reservoir, cut water use last year by 25 percent with rationing, but more cuts may be needed. Los Angeles, with more diverse sources, is expected to get by in 1991 with a relatively modest conservation rate of 10 percent, said Bruce Keubler, assistant chief engineer for the water system of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
But nowhere is the situation more critical than here on the central coast, and to some extent the problem is self-inflicted. About 20 years ago voters in Morro Bay refused to approve a bond measure to tie in to the Whale Rock Reservoir, forcing the town to remain on well water. Of the four remaining wells, two are so brackish that a portable desalination plant had to be rented to make the water potable.
Many people say the problem is that water has been too cheap -- only about $20 a month for a family of three. "People pay more for cable televison than water," said Mayor Rose Marie Sheetz.
Now the residents of Morro Bay are beginning to pay the price of past neglect.
Many are angry at the motels, where they believe tourists waste water. "They take longer showers than we do," one businessman complained. In Morro Bay, the problem is that tourism is not only the worst drain on water, but also the mainstay of the economy.
"We're hanging on by the skin our teeth right now," said G. H. Nichols, the director of public works.

HEADLINE: No Happy Season for Retailers

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
The Christmas shopping season, which concluded last night with a soft thud, held a number of surprises, but none were very jolly.
In telephone interviews yesterday, merchants around the country generally expressed disappointment with the 32-day season, which began the day after Thanksgiving. Most said their business was flat, or about equal to their 1989 sales. Some said they had a small decline, and others reported a slight gain. 
 But when merchandise inflation of 2 to 4 percent is excluded from their results, almost everyone interviewed had a real decline from the figures a year earlier. "The poorest Christmas season in years" was a common expression.
Perhaps the biggest surprise, merchants said, was that retailers' predictions of a dismal season were not pessimistic enough. Many forecasts called for a 5 percent gain, but it is now expected that when all the numbers are in the industry will probably register a decline.
 
 No 'Cliffhanger'
 Another surprise was that the much-hoped-for "cliffhanger" never developed. Increasingly, in the last few years, heavy consumer buying has come later and later in the holiday season. Many merchants this year hoped that a late surge would reverse the season's earlier sluggishness. Although stores were busy over the final weekend and yesterday, the sales were lower than expected.
And a third surprise was that in some stores higher-priced goods outsold medium-priced items. "The customer has been clearly value-oriented," said Arthur Martinez, vice chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, "but the irony is that the bigger-ticket, mostly designer goods sold well, while the real lag was in the more moderate-priced merchandise."
 
 Dominated by Price-Cutting
 Both direct and indirect consumer concerns hampered sales. "Consumers are so bombarded with bad news, the economy, the deficit, the Mideast and so on that it's no wonder they bought less than last year," said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation of Minneapolis. Price-cutting dominated the season's merchandising. Some of it was done by retailers trying to stimulate a season already in trouble.
But also, in the big cities and their suburbs, hundreds of stores, run by more than a half-dozen highly leveraged or financially troubled retail chains, slashed prices to raise cash. This brought in many customers, but also caused others to wait for still lower prices elsewhere.
"We'll show a gain over last year, but it's been a difficult season because we had to compete with the 'broke' competition," said William Dillard Sr., chairman of the Dillard Department Stores of Little Rock, Ark.
Holiday business was also hampered by unseasonally warm weather in the East and South. This created a huge inventory buildup in cold-weather apparel. Such clothes are both a seasonal item and a holiday gift. This prompted Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's biggest retailer, to advance its usual post-Christmas sale to two weeks or so before Christmas.
The 30-degree swing in the weather from a cold 1989 to a warm 1990 was also cited as a particular problem by Bloomingdale's in New York and Rich's in Atlanta.
 
 K Mart Stocks 'Under Control'
 "We'll be flat to 1 percent ahead, despite the extra shopping day this season, unfortunately," said Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive of the K Mart Corporation, the nation's second-largest retailer after Sears. "I wish it were better," he added, "but we kept our stocks under control, so that we are $600 million less in inventory in our K Mart division."
Mr. Macke of Dayton Hudson said: "The season was less than great. We think our same-stores will be flat. But our Target discount stores will be up 1 to 2 percent, our Mervyn's promotional apparel stores will be flat, and our Dayton Hudson department stores will be down by 1 to 2 percent. But all our inventories are surprisingly good."
Bloomingdale's 15 stores will wind up with "a very small decrease over all -- and a couple of percentage points down in our same stores," said Julian Taub, senior vice president for planning. But costume jewelry, Christmas decorations and men's furnishings had a strong season. Still, Mr. Taub said, speaking with a light touch, "December was our second-best month of the winter; October was a better month with less of a drop."
 
 Saks Margins Held Up
 Saks Fifth Avenue will be flat for the month, said Mr. Martinez, its vice chairman. But he added: "We operated with below-normal expenses so our margins held up. We should have a fine profit." He said that the markets in Boston and New York were the chain's hardest hit. Markets in Florida and Texas were strong while California's was satisfactory, he added.
Roger Farah, chairman of Rich's, said he expected the department store chain to register a slight decline in December because of warm weather and the regional economic slump. But Wilbur A. Fix, chairman of Bon Marche in Seattle, said that despite "a kick in the pants from a 12-inch snowfall last week," in a city that is unaccustomed to snow, "our business picked up, so we expect a 5 percent increase in our same stores this month."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Republicans Silent and Smiling

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
While Gov. Jim Florio and his fellow Democrats struggle with the prospect of yet another budget crisis, Republicans are offering few suggestions, hoping to keep the public's anger over Mr. Florio's 1990 tax increases boiling right up to the 1991 elections.
If the Republican strategy succeeds, the party would stand a chance of capturing both houses of the Legislature for the first time in nearly two decades. 
 "The question is: Will taxes be an issue in '91?" said Steven A. Salmore, a professor ofpolitical science at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, who is also a Republican political consultant. "I certainly don't see it coming off the agenda."
 
Hiring and Building Freeze
 As Mr. Florio comes to the end of his first year in office, he is facing a possible budget shortfall of $600 million. He has put a freeze on hiring and major building projects while his administration drafts plans that are likely to include layoffs and the elimination of some state departments.
These budget problems come only months after Mr. Florio pushed $2.8 billion in tax increases through the Legislature to close another budget gap and raise more money for public education. Those tax increases heightened widespread anger that voters directed against the Governor's party in November, leading to the near defeat of New Jersey's most popular Democrat, Senator Bill Bradley.
Professor Salmore and other Republicans now project a series of events in the coming year that could make the issue of rising taxes even hotter by next November, when every seat in the Legislature will come up for election, something that occurs only once eery 10 years.
Those events begin in January, when employers start withholding larger amounts from paychecks because of Mr. Florio's income-tax increase enacted last June.
Though the Florio administration estimates that the $1.7 billion income-tax increase will affect only 17 percent of taxpayers, those at the top of the income scale, the new rates are certain to renew attention to the tax question.
 
Property-Tax Relief in Doubt
 One explosive issue is Mr. Florio's statements during the 1989 campaign that he saw no need for new taxes. Only months later, he raised not only the income tax but also the sales tax and other taxes.
The next potential hazard for the Democrats is the Governor's insistence that the new taxes will be offset by property-tax relief. Most voters interpret that to mean their property taxes will go down, or at least stabilize.
The likelihood of that in a battered economy, when tax revenue is falling locally as well as at the state level and nearly every community is struggling to balance its budget, is uncertain at best. If it does not happen, already skeptical taxpayers are likely to see tax relief as another broken promise.
"There are two issues at work here," Mr. Salmore said, "taxes and credibility, and the credibility problem is going to be more potent in the end."
Meanwhile, Republicans are doing well, in a sense, by doing nothing, at least as far as taking the legislative initiative on taxes and revenues.
"I think Jim Florio and the Democrats in the Legislature made dreadful mistakes," said Garabed Haytaian, the Assembly's minority leader and the chief legislative critic of the Florio tax increases. "The worst sin was not to bring the Republicans in to discuss this in the beginning. They have nobody to blame but themselves."
 
Democrats Told to Start Over
 Rather than offer an alternative tax plan, or try to repeal the Florio package piecemeal, the Republicans have urged Democrats to set their house in order by scrapping the whole tax package and starting over, a prospect that almost certainly would plunge the Legislature into partisan debate.
The Republicans have also called on the Democrats to take the lead in cutting costs. Mr. Haytaian, for example, has urged cutting state jobs by 5 percent, a move Governor Florio has said would probably violate existing labor contracts.
"Now they have a new potential deficit of $600 million," Mr. Haytaian said. "There is only one way to prevent that, you have to cut jobs."
But Mr. Haytaian emphasizes that the real goal is to start from scratch. "We have always said, let's put the whole package back on the table."
 
'I Told You So'
 At the same time, he also says that it is the Democrats who are in trouble, and that it is their responsibility to get out of it.
"I don't want somebody to say to me, what's your proposal?" he said. "I do want to say, I told you so.
"Now I want to sit down with the Assembly and the Governor and bring in the middle-level managers and get them to tell us how we can cut costs."
Mr. Haytaian is making it clear that the Republicans will do nothing that would take the heat off the Democrats.
This week, for example, the Speaker and Democratic leader in the Assembly, Joseph V. Doria Jr., declared he would not extend the life of the state's troubled trust fund for uninsured hospital patients, and asked for a bipartisan effort to come up with a new system, one that would very likely require another tax increase.
But Mr. Haytaian responded, "It's the Democrats' problem. They control the Legislature."
 
'The Voters Sent a Message'
 Jeff Michaels, the executive director of the state Republican Party, also maintains that the only solution to the pending new budget crisis, and the only balm to taxpayer anger, is to start over.
"The Republican position all along has been that the tax package was disastrous for New Jersey," Mr. Michaels said. "And we were proved right by the voters. The voters sent a message that they want the tax package scrapped and the school funding formula scrapped."
"The Republicans are willing to go back to the drawing board," he said. "Jim Florio is unwilling to do that."
In addition to requesting wide-open tax and budget renegotiations that would almost certainly keep the issue alive indefinitely, Republicans are also making it known that they support machinery to allow for the recall of legislators and the governor, for binding procedures for initiative and referendum to make or repeal laws by popular vote, and for limiting lawmakers' terms.
The first two, recall and initiative and referendum, are among proposals pushed by an anti-tax group, Hands Across New Jersey.

HEADLINE: The Economy May Droop, but Gifts to Charities Are Climbing

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Even as thousands of New Yorkers are losing their jobs and economic forecasters are painting a bleak future for the region, New Yorkers are digging deep and coming up with increased donations for organizations that help the needy.
Many charities -- including the United Way of New York City, the United Jewish Appeal-Federation and Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York -- are reporting increases in giving, a result of aggressive fund-raising and, some say, of the generosity that people express in tough times. 
 "Charity comes out of hard times, not good ones," said Kermit Eady, president of the Black United Fund of New York. The fund helps 33 small organizations meet the growing needs of poor blacks. Mr. Eady said contributions to the fund, which raised $2.7 million last year, "are upward" this year.
The United Way of New York City, which has a goal of $84 million this year, has seen a9 percent increase so far in its campaigns for employee pledges at 200 local companies.
"We are elated because we're seeing New Yorkers somehow finding the money -- small dollars and some big gifts," said Ralph Dickerson, the president of United Way of New York City.
 
Salvation Army Trailing
 While some charities are reporting shortfalls, they are attributing that to factors other than a lack of generosity. For instance, the Salvation Army's Christmas appeal is running 11 percent behind lastyear's, but a spokesman said that was probably because the organization was having a hard time recruiting volunteers to mind the familiar kettles that dot shopping districts. The kettle campaign raises slightly more than $1 million a year.
Nationally the 2,300 separate United Way campaigns are expected to grow by 4.6 percent -- the first time in eight years a collection has been outpaced by the rate of inflation, which is running at 6 percent.
But in New York City the United Way is outdistancing both inflation and comparable fund drives in Boston, Washington, Cleveland and Detroit.
Still, the New York campaign is lagging behind San Francisco's, where there has been an 11 percent increase in giving over last year's showing. In Indianapolis and Seattle donations are up by about 10 percent.
In New York, social services historically have depended on a partnership between government and private contributors going back more than 100 years, according to AlanJ. Abramson, a political scientist who analyzed how services are delivered for the Urban Institute, a Washington research organization. Typically city, state and Federal sources provide 40 to 65 percent of the budgets for services by more than 4,000 private, nonprofit health or social-service organizations -- everything from prenatal care to shelter for people with AIDS. The balance comes from individual contributors, companies and foundations.
 
Government Support Weakening
 With both New York State and New York City grappling with huge budget deficits, charitable organizations are bracing for a drastic decline in government support.
"We know a great part of the $2 billion the city and the $1 billion the state usually provides for basic social services are in jeopardy," Mr. Dickerson said. "Still, we're glimpsing a spirit in people who have jobs to help keep money flowing until economic conditions can be turned around. People are saying, 'I'm staying here; I'm going to help on my block, and in my neighborhood.' And that is bringing in the money in New York, which is really a town of 500 neighborhoods."
The New York Archdiocese's annual Cardinal's Appeal surpassed its $7 million goal and raised $9 million, said Joseph Zwilling, director of communications. In addition 30 separate parish campaigns received $11.2 million in gifts or pledges. The 30 parishes retain at least 80 percent of the funds they raise for their own needs, like building repairs.
The Brooklyn Diocese, which runs a separate appeal for Brooklyn and Queens, also reports a rise in donations.
Lester M. Salamon, director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies and the author of several reports on nonprofit social-service organizations, said it was not unusual that charity appeared to be increasing as the economy foundered.
"An increase in private giving is consistent with historic patterns in which giving continues to grow in the early months of a recession but then levels off," he said."We know this happened in the mid-70's and early 80's."
 
Widespread Generous Giving
 Organizations ranging from the Gay Men's Health Crisis, which helps people with AIDS, to Fountain House, which helps former mental patients adjust to life on their own, have reported large increases in their donations.
But even that generosity is not enough, according to Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, which expects its holiday mail campaign to bring in about $400,000. "Even if we received 10 times that total," she said, "it would not begin to meet the need."
Some campaigns began slowly but have recently begun to pick up.
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which solicits on behalf of seven leading charities, recently moved ahead of collections at this time last year after a slow beginning last month. The total raised in the last campaign was $4,372,283.
"We are receiving many letters from contributors saying that in these uncertain economic times, it is more important than ever to help those in desperate need," said Arthur Gelb, president of The New York Times Foundation, which administers the campaign.
 
Elderly Feel the Pinch
 The Children's Aid Society, the largest nonsectarian provider of help in the city for families and children, reported that its gifts were down about 10 percent from 1989. Many of its contributors are elderly New Yorkers on fixed incomes.
"Still, people who can afford it clearly are giving more, stirred by the open, brutal face of poverty all around us," said Philip Coltoff, the executive director. "My sense is we'll achieve our goal by year's end."
The annual drive of the U.J.A.-Federation, a major provider of services to 130 member agencies that assist 1.5 million New Yorkers of all faiths, is only slightly ahead of 1989. But then the orgnization simultaneously solicited for two other campaigns this year: More than $75 million was collected or pledged for Operation Exodus to help settle Soviet Jews in Israel and another $75 million for a multi-year $1.2 billion capital campaign for the benefit of members, said David G. Sacks, president of U.J.A.-Federation.
A number of organizations have assured increased donations by expanding their appeals.
United Way of New York, for instance, has solicited contributions from foreign-owned businesses, including banks and investment firms with large offices in the metropolitan area.
 
'Ambassadors' Solicit Funds
 It also has recruited a corps of "ambassadors" to carry its message to the public. One is Ed Glynn.
"When I go out to talk to business groups in Manhattan, I usually begin by telling them they may recognize me as someone they saw on the streets, living in a cardboard box, panhandling for change with a Styrofoam cup, usually outside the door at the post office or bank on Lexington Avenue," Mr. Glynn said in a recent interview. "My block was 45th Street."
That was three years ago. Now he works for an agency that helps New Yorkers with drug and alcohol addictions.
"I tell people, 'Because of the money you give, there is one less body you have to look at on the street and one less panhandler's cup put in your face.' "

The Economy
Falling prices are making an impact on the American economy for the first time since the 1940's. Real estate prices are most notable, but deflation is also visible in steel, aluminum, plastics and other commodities used in manufacturing. Over all, the price drops are still outweighed by increases for many things, like medical care, college tuition and legal services. [Page 1.]
The Christmas shopping season held a number of surprises, but none was very jolly, merchants said. The biggest surprise of the season, which ended with a soft thud, was that retailers' predictions of a dismal season were not pessimistic enough.

HEADLINE: Bizarre New Class of Molecules Spawns Its Own Branch of Chemistry

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
AN explosion of research in what scientists are hailing as a new branch of chemistry has followed the recent discovery that bizarre ball-shaped molecules made entirely of carbon atoms can be easily produced in large quantities.
The ball molecules were tentatively identified five years ago, but laboratories succeeded in synthesizing only microscopic amounts of the new compounds -- too little for chemists to verify the molecules' structures or study their properties. The very existence of carbon-ball molecules was challenged by some scientists. 
 But two months ago, physicists at the University of Arizona in Tucson and the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, announced that they had discovered a way to make large quantities of the ball-shaped molecules. In one of their first experiments, they discovered that the carbon-ball molecules, when purified, combine in a crystalline form that chemists had never suspected could exist.
And this month the Arizona-Heidelberg collaboration and the I.B.M. Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., independently published photographs in the British journal Nature that verify the existence of carbon-ball molecules beyond reasonable doubt. The photographs, made with scanning electron microscopes, clearly show the spherical molecules, packed together like so many ball bearings, on sheets of gold foil.
The carbon-ball molecules are named "fullerenes" in memory of the architect Richard Buckminster Fuller, whose designs often exploited the geodesic dome -- a strong hemispherical structure made of interlocked beams. The new carbon molecules, which are also very strong, are held together by similar patterns of chemical bonds between neighboring carbon atoms.
Chemists regard the fullerenes as three-dimensional analogues of the two-dimensional benzene ring, a hexagonal array of six carbon atoms that is a component of more than six million chemical compounds. Compounds containing benzene rings include vanilla flavor, cleaning fluid, three of the amino acids essential to life, pharmaceuticals, dyes, explosives, plastics and countless other substances. In theory, the new family of fullerenes could become components of an even greater variety of chemical combinations than those based on the ubiquitous benzene ring.
Though practical uses remain to be found, researchers are confident that fullerenes will produce rich rewards. "This is a brand new field of chemistry," said Dr. Donald R. Huffman of the University of Arizona. "Up to now, chemists and physicists have lacked sufficient fullerene material. But now it's possible to make fullerenes by the pound, and a lot of laboratories are interested in the possibilities -- Exxon , A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories, U.C.L.A. and Berkeley and many others. Everyone's excited."
Representing the University of Arizona, Research Corporation Technologies, a nonprofit organization in Tucson, has filed for worldwide patent protection of the techniques for making fullerenes. Other research groups are expected to apply for related patents. A measure of the intense interest in fullerenes was evident at a late-night meeting of the Materials Research Society in Boston in November. The meeting was attended by more than 500 scientists, an exceptional number for such a symposium.
 
Sowing a Bucket of Seeds
 Even skeptics have been impressed by the discovery that fullerenes can be mass-produced. One of them, Dr. Donald J. Cram of the University of California at Los Angeles, said he was convinced that fullerenes had a bright future. Dr. Cram received a 1987 Nobel Prize for his development of cagelike carbon molecules.
"The discovery that these soccer-ball-like molecules can be made in large quantities will have an effect on chemistry like the sowing of a bucket of flower seeds -- the results will spring up everywhere from now on," he said. "I'd be surprised if we don't see thousands of new fullerene compounds in the next few years, some of which are almost certain to have important uses."
Some scientists speculate that fullerenes might provide a new class of lubricants, since the microscopic carbon balls can apparently roll as freely as ball bearings. Chemists see carbon balls as potential connecting molecules in millions of new compounds, many of which are expected to have very unusual properties. For example, some fullerene compounds may be capable of storing electric charges in novel ways, and this could lead to great improvements in storage batteries.
Fullerenes have also intrigued astrophysicists, who have speculated that carbon balls might exist in interstellar space. If so, the study of fullerenes could illuminate the behavior of certain types of stars.
The existence of fullerenes was postulated in 1985 by research groups led by Dr. Richard E. Smalley of Rice University in Houston and Dr. Harold W. Kroto of the University of Sussex in England. By irradiating graphite with powerful laser pulses, the Rice chemists produced carbon vapor that condensed into microscopic clusters. Spectrographic and X-ray analyses suggested that many of these clusters contained 60 carbon atoms each.
 
Molecules of 1,000 Atoms
 Applying the fundamental principle that every molecule tends to assume a shape corresponding to its lowest possible energy, the scientists deduced that each 60-atom cluster would probably assume a three-dimensional form corresponding to a truncated icosahedron -- a hollow, ball-like molecule with 60 vertices and 32 faces, of which 12 would be regular pentagons and 20 would be regular hexagons. Geometry implies that each pentagonal face should be bounded by five hexagons. Spectrographic and X-ray analyses tended to confirm these theories.
Dr. Smalley said the scientists also found egg-shaped configurations with 70 carbon atoms, and he added that depending on the conditions in which carbon vapor was condensed, clusters of 1,000 carbon atoms or more might form. In fact, the Rice group discovered, any even number of carbon atoms, from at least 1,000 atoms to as few as 32, can combine as a spheroidal molecule. (When chemists tried to reduce the fullerene molecules to fewer than 32 atoms, they broke up spontaneously.)
Fullerenes form when solid carbon condenses as soot from hot carbon vapor, and the vapor's rate of cooling determines the types and amounts of fullerene compounds created in the condensation, Dr. Smalley said. Chemists at Rice and Sussex theorize that under most conditions the condensation of the vapor results in the addition of carbon atoms to a molecular pattern resembling warped chicken wire. As atoms are added to the outer edges of this array, the chicken wire grows as a spiral suggesting the chambered nautilus, a primitive shellfish.
When conditions are favorable, the chicken wire closes on itself and joins at its edges to form spheroids -- most often, fullerene molecules of 60 carbon atoms.
 
Breakthrough in a Vacuum
 A major impetus in fullerene research came in September, when Dr. Huffman and fellow physicists at the University of Arizona and the Max Planck Institute hit upon a way to make large quantities of these bizarre substances. Dr. Smalley, a chemist, said he and his colleagues were stunned by the breakthrough achieved by Dr. Huffman and the other physicists.
"Their approach to the problem was very different from ours," Dr. Smalley said. "Their demonstration that fullerenes could be mass-produced as easily as metallic aluminum brought the study of fullerenes out of a backwater and into the mainstream of science."
In the method pioneered at the University of Arizona, an electric arc is passed between graphite electrodes in a vacuum chamber containing a small amount of helium. Carbon from the electrodes vaporizes and is then allowed to cool, condensing as soot on surfaces inside the chamber.
About 5 percent of this soot, the scientists found, is C60 fullerene molecules. Those molecules can be separated from the soot, purified and refined into crystals.
 
A New Form of Carbon
 "One of the reasons physicists and chemists are so excited by these fullerene crystals," said Dr. Donald S. Bethune of I.B.M.'s Almaden Research Center, "is that they have revealed the existence of a third elemental form of carbon -- a form of which we had been completely unaware." The two previously known forms are graphite and diamond.
But it is the potential chemical versatility of fullerenes that has put dozens of major laboratories to work. The unique qualities of the carbon atom -- nature's universal connecting joint -- underlie scientists' fascination with the new fullerenes.
When a carbon atom joins with other atoms to form a stable molecule, the internal structure of the carbon atom requires it to form four electronic links with neighboring atoms. In most cases, these links are in the form of single or double bonds. In fullerenes, Dr. Smalley said, single and double bonds are probably distributed around the molecule, and it does not easily react with other chemicals. But if some or all of its double bonds are converted to single bonds, the molecule becomes reactive and can form links with other atoms or molecules.
Some research groups are working in secret, developing patent applications for materials and techniques that could have great economic importance. Dr. Huffman said one research group was believed to have succeeded in bonding fluorine atoms to all 60 carbons in a fullerene molecule. Such a molecule might, like Teflon, be exceptionally slippery and resistant to chemical attack.
The Rice chemists themselves expect to synthesize salts in which a single electrically charged metal atom would be imprisoned within each carbon-ball molecule. Material made from such molecular cages could carry electric charges without having to react chemically, and might replace electrochemical components like lead and acid in conventional storage batteries.
"Whatever happens," Dr. Smalley said, "it seems to me that the extraordinary potential variety and the cheapness of these new fullerene compounds guarantee their importance as commercial materials. This is the dawn of a new era in materials science."

HEADLINE: Big Science Gets Smaller as Its Promise Loses Luster

SERIES: Big Science: Is It Worth the Price?/Last artical in a series appearing periodically on the largest new research projects.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
 EXPERTS say 1990 will probably be considered a turning point in the history of the Federal Government's support of big science, with decades of enthusiasm giving way to wariness as costs soared, budgets tightened and major endeavors turned out to have serious flaws.
At the heart of the shift was the 12-ton, 43-foot-long, $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, which, after 45 years as a dream and 13 years of planning, promised a new era in astronomy from its post hundreds of miles from Earth. Instead, it produced fuzzy images from a flawed mirror. 
 "There's a sense of disenchantment with the promise of big science," said Representative George E. Brown Jr., a California Democrat who has served on the House Science Committee for a quarter-century and is now its chairman.
Several Federal programs meant to build large instruments for advancing the frontiers of science had their budgets substantially cut in the 1991 budget. And the biggest project of them all, the proposed 500-foot-long, $37 billion space station, was ordered by Congress to undergo a complete redesign to cut costs and complexity.
Experts predict larger cuts in the future because of the tightening Federal budget squeeze and the agreement hammered out by White House and Congressional budget negotiators in October for no real growth in discretionary domestic spending over the next three years.
"It's a looming disaster" for the big projects, said Dr. Robert L. Park, a physicist at the University of Maryland who directs the Washington office of the American Physical Society, the nation's pre-eminent professional association of physicists.
Before the budget turmoil, large new projects planned for completion in the 1990's numbered nearly two dozen. They were to cost more than $60 billion to build and more than $100 billion to operate over their lifetimes, placing a heavy mortgage on the nation's research spending well into the future.
Representative Brown said a consensus was forming in Congress to scale big projects down or, for ones too far along to change, to stretch out their construction timetables.
He also noted that after several lean years, Government support was growing for small science, in which researchers work alone or in small groups rather than in vast teams. The budgets for the Government's two leading agencies that pay for small-scale science, the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, both rose in the 1991 fiscal year, the foundation by 11 percent and the institutes by 9 percent.
Experts have recently warned that big science projects were becoming so numerous and expensive that, in a time of budget austerity, they were starting to impinge upon small endeavors.
By definition, small science is relatively cheap. Its fruits -- antibiotics, transistors, lasers -- tend to have everyday applications. Big science uses huge instruments like giant telescopes, atom smashers and planetary probes to explore some of science's most fundamental questions or to open new realms of inquiry. Its scale is big because in some fields the easy things have already been done, and futher progress demands larger, more powerful scientific tools.
The most dramatic upset this year among the big science projects involved the space station Freedom, an orbiting outpost from which up to eight astronauts would fashion new materials, study the physics of fluids, grow crystals, perform medical experiments and scan the stars. Design work started in 1984, with completion set for the mid- to late 1990's, after about 30 shuttle flights. In designing Freedom, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration rejected the idea of putting up small self-contained units that could be linked and could achieve limited operation step by step. Instead it planned a single large unit that would function only when fully assembled.
But early this year, space agency investigators found that the giant structure was so delicate that it would need thousands of hours of external repairs and maintenance every year -- an unacceptably high number, the investigators said, since the maintenance would require space-suited astronauts to walk outside the craft, a risky operation.
The original maintenance goal had been 130 hours of space walks a year; in July, the NASA investigators estimated that 6,200 hours of maintenance would be needed even before the station was permanently manned, raising the knotty question of who would do the work.
 
A Simpler Space Station
 This and other setbacks prompted Congress to trim the $2.45 billion budget request for the station by $550 million in October and to demand that it be redesigned so it could be built in self-contained stages rather than as a single entity.
On Dec. 10, a White House panel echoed that message. "We believe the space station Freedom can be simplified and constructed on a more evolutionary, modular basis," said the 12-member panel, whose head is Norman R. Augustine, chairman of the Martin Marietta Corporation.
Representative Brown said the recommendations, which NASA has generally endorsed and begun to carry out, would delay the station's completion into the 21st century.
Another big science project fared somewhat better. The Earth Observing System, a $30 billion array of six large satellites that NASA wants to orbit starting in 1997 or 1998, saw Congress trim its 1991 budget request from $235 million to $191 million.
The costliest environmental research project ever, it aims at learning how the global environment works and is altered by human activity. Critics say NASA's bureaucratic ambitions have made the plan overly grandiose, delaying the system's completion and the gathering of vital data.
This criticism was buttressed in August when a panel of the National Research Council, a Washington-based group that advises the Federal Government, found that smaller, simpler satellites could begin monitoring the climate sooner and recommended that they take priority over the Earth Observing System.
Responding to the critics, Dr. Greg Wilson, an official in NASA's earth science program, said the agency had broadened its effort, taking a number of steps to loft small satellites sooner. "We're seriously working options," he said.
 
Cutting the Collider
 The largest budget cut for big science, measured as a percentage of the 1991 request, went to the Superconducting Supercollider, a huge particle accelerator planned for the plains of Texas. Its 54-mile race-track-shaped tunnel would be fitted with 10,000 superconducting magnets, each about 100 feet long. By speeding subatomic particles through the magnetic prison and smashing them together, the machine would give scientists a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces and particles that are the building blocks of all matter.
The proposed machine came under criticism this year over its sharply rising costs and over vexing problems in the design of its giant magnets. It started out in 1987 as a $4.4 billion venture, but the estimate rose to $8 billion this year, and one Federal panel said it could cost as much as $11.7 billion.
Amid growing debate over the machine's merit, Congress cut the $318 million budget request for the collider by $75 million, or 24 percent, in October. Russell L. Wilie, a spokesman for the project, said the situation was not as grim as it appeared, since Congress also allowed the use of $25 million in construction funds left over from 1990 and Texas will release $60 million of the $1 billion in promised state money for the project.
Congress put some big science projects on hold this year, including a $190 million observatory to study gravitational waves, and President Bush's proposal to establish Moon bases and explore Mars. Citing "severe budgetary constraints," Congress deleted virtually the entire amount requested for preliminary research on the exploration plan, whose lifetime cost is estimated at up to $500 billion.
 
A Cap That Will Pinch
 Federal and private experts say budget pressures on big science are about to get even worse, and sharply so, as the three-year cap on domestic discretionary spending limits growth to the rate of inflation. For science and technology, this means that any real increases will have to come at the expense of other parts of the discretionary budget, like education and housing.
"Many of the programs that will be competing with science and technology have very highly organized, vociferous constituencies," Dr. D. Allan Bromley, President Bush's science adviser, recently told a White House audience of scientists. If the nation's science program gets no better political support than in the past, he said, it will face "very real danger."
Some experts foresee a bloodbath. "It's going to be very, very messy," said John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington. "A lot of these projects are going to be asking for big bucks, and there's no place for it to come from."
Dr. Park of the American Physical Society said stretching out large projects was not necessarily a good thing. "Total costs go up," he said. "Plus, the problems the device was intended to solve might not be relevant anymore."
Representative Brown said the crisis would probably force the projects to find foreign partners with whom to cooperate and share costs, as some have already done.
 
A Time of Opportunity?
 Some experts see the looming changes as a time of opportunity to bring the Federal science effort into better balance by increasing the emphasis on small science projects, especially those that promise to aid industrial competitiveness. They say Federal policy makers generally failed to foresee how the most ambitious array of big science projects in the nation's history would squeeze little science and each other. A new balance is critical, they say, since small science, despite its name, is the largest and most important part of the American scientific enterprise, its health vital to that of the economy.
"This year could be a turning point," said Erich Bloch, who recently stepped down after six years as director of the National Science Foundation. "I think we have to make it a turning point. These things don't happen by themselves."

THE SERIES SO FAR
 The series began on May 27 with an overview of several projects that supporters believe will herald a new age of discovery, but that critics fear will starve smaller, more practical projects of scarce Federal funds.
An article on May 29 discussed the Superconducting Supercollider, the $8 billion particle accelerator that may help explain the fundamental forces of the universe. On June 5 an article outlined the monumental project to map the three billion building blocks of the human genetic code. The proposed space station Freedom was the subject on June 10, and the elaborate satellites designed to study the global environment were scrutinized on June 19.
How small-scale, but important basic research is faring was the subject on Sept. 4, and the most recent article on Oct. 9 discussed a proposal to build a hot fusion machine intended to generate vast amounts of safe, cheap and clean energy.

HEADLINE: The Group and the Self: New Focus on a Cultural Rift

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
WHILE Americans say the squeaky wheel gets the grease, in Japan the maxim is "the nail that stands out gets pounded down." And while American children who won't finish their food are given stern warnings not to waste it, Japanese children are told, "Think how bad the farmer who raised this food for you will feel if you don't eat it."
Such contrasts have emerged from a rapidly growing body of scientific studies that show how deeply individualism runs in most Western cultures, and how shallow that vein is in most others. 
 The new cross-cultural studies are confirming what many observers have long noticed: that the cardinal American virtues of self-reliance and individualism are at odds with those of most non-Western cultures. They also suggest that the nature of American individualism has been changing toward a greater emphasis on raw self-interest, and that the rise of individualism in a society goes hand in hand with economic growth.
The work contrasts individualism with "collectivism," in which a person's loyalty to a group like a family or tribe overrides personal goals. Recent studies say this outlook predominates in most cultures of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.
The late Raoul Narrol, a professor of anthropology at the State University of New York at Buffalo, found in a 1983 study that such societies have among the lowest rates of homicide, suicide, juvenile delinquency, divorce, child abuse and alcoholism. They also tend to have lower economic productivity, though as countries like Japan become more affluent, they also tend to become more individualistic.
The collectivist cultures comprise about 70 percent of the world's population, according to the studies. But virtually all the data of modern psychology and most other social sciences come from the most individualistic cultures, like the United States. As a result, some social scientists say, many Western assumptions about the universals of human behavior actually apply to a minority of people, albeit those in the most advanced economies.
"There are many kinds of individualism," said Robert N. Bellah, a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley who wrote "Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Culture" (University of California Press, 1985). "The individualism that's on the rise recently in the U.S. is one of 'What's in it for me?' with immediate gratification of one's own needs coming before all other loyalties. Commitments like marriage only hold while they pay off."
Leading the study of individualism or its absence, and the argument for its importance in understanding people around the world, is Harry C. Triandis, a psychologist at the University of Illinois who came to America as a college student from his native Greece.
Writing in the current issue of The Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, an influential journal, and reviewing over 100 scientific studies, Dr. Triandis argues that the distinction between individualism and collectivism holds the key to understanding a range of telling contrasts from culture to culture.
Though many seem minor, they bespeak vast differences in how people see the world and themselves:
*A lecturer in the West will be introduced as "distinguished," while speakers in Asia will always begin by saying how little they know about the topic at hand.
*A telephone operator in Greece will be rude and unhelpful until the caller establishes his identity, while American operators tend to be uniformly friendly to everyone.
*In countries like Pakistan, Peru and Singapore, people take it for granted that those at the top of the social hierarchy are very different from those at the bottom and that they should keep their distance. In countries like the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, such an attitude is seen as offensively anti-egalitarian.
<> <> Perhaps most critical for understanding contemporary events is the role of the collectivist outlook in generating friction between ethnic groups. "While collectivists are very nice to those who are members of their own groups, they can be very nasty, competitive and uncooperative toward those who belong to other groups," said Dr. Triandis. "There is an unquestioned obedience to one's own group and even a willingness to fight and die for it, and a distrust of those in other groups."
This attitude, he said, encourages the kind of ethnic fighting common in many parts of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, India and the Middle East.
In an individualist culture, people's personal goals take priority over their allegiance to groups like the family or the employer. The loyalty of individualists to a given group is very weak; they feel they belong to many groups and are apt to change their membership as it suits them, switching churches, for example, or leaving one employer for another.
In such cultures, people subscribe to values like "winning is everything" and "to be superior, a man must stand alone," Dr. Triandis wrote in the November issue of The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. The article includes findings from studies of people in Illinois, Hawaii, Hong Kong, Peking, the Philippines, Japan and Europe.
 
Different Commandments
 Collectivist societies put high value on self-discipline, accepting one's position in life, honoring parents and elders, and preserving one's public image for the sake of the group, Dr. Triandis reported. Individualists stress equality, freedom, having an exciting and varied life, and personal enjoyment.
Child rearing in collectivist cultures is intrusive; children have virtually no privacy or autonomy. "A child's dependence on parents is considered good, as is breaking the will of the child to obtain complete obedience," Dr. Triandis said. When there is conflict between personal and group goals, the group takes precedence. People feel comfortable in hierarchies, and place a premium on harmony within their group.
People with a collective focus tend to think in terms of long-term goals, which benefit the whole group, Dr. Triandis said; their time frame is likely to include "a chain of generations." Individualists, by contrast, "look for immediate rewards for their efforts."
In collectivist cultures, Dr. Triandis found, family integrity is of the utmost importance. People strongly believe, for instance, that children should live at home with their parents until they get married, and that aging parents should live at home with their children.
"In short, the values that are most important in the West are least important worldwide," said Dr. Triandis.
 
Most Invididualistic: The U.S.
 The difference can be seen readily in literature, according to a 1983 analysis by Francis Hsu, an anthropologist recently retired from Northwestern University. Dr. Hsu found that novels in the West typically focus on a lone figure seeking private goals, while those of the East commonly celebrate duty to kin or other authorities, despite personal temptations. A Western prototype is Huckleberry Finn, striking out on his own; an Eastern one is Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita, being persuaded to do his duty and plunge into battle.
In a worldwide study of 116,000 employees of I.B.M. in 1980, Geert Hofstede, a Dutch psychologist, was able to rank 40 cultures according to the strength of individualism or collectivism.
The five most strongly individualist cultures were the United States, Australia, Great Britain, Canada and the Netherlands, in that order. The other countries of Northern Europe also ranked high.
The five where collectivism was strongest were Venezuela, Colombia, Pakistan, Peru and Taiwan. It was also strong in Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Turkey and some countries of Southern Europe, including Greece and Portugal.
Growing affluence and geographic mobility contribute to the spread of individualism in a culture, Dr. Triandis finds. Likewise, within a given society, "individualism is higher among the affluent, socially and geographically mobile, more modern segments," he said. But as countries like Japan become more prosperous, people start to show more signs of individualism, especially the young and urban.
The most individualistic people in a collectivist society tend to be "rebels ready to migrate from the oppression of the culture," said Dr. Triandis. That may partly explain why societies like Canada, the United States and Australia, all settled by immigrants, are among the most individualistic.
"People in different cultures have very different premises about what defines a person, with different consequences for how they think, feel and act," said Shinobu Kitiyama, a psychologist at the University of Oregon, who, with Hazel Markus, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, will publish research on the subject next year in the journal Psychological Review.
"In white middle-class America people think of themselves as a bundle of traits, preferences and desires," Dr. Kitiyama said. "But in Asian culture people conceive themselves in terms of a dense web of social relations."
 
Traps for Social Scientists
 One telling difference between American and Asian cultures, Dr. Kitiyama found, emerged when people described their contribution to a collaboration. "When you ask Americans to give a percent figure that estimates how much each member of a team contributes to the overall effort, the total is almost always greater than 100 percent. People overestimate how much weight they pull."
But in Asia, the reverse was true. People underestimated their contribution, so the total for the group was usually less than 100 percent. Such self-effacement, Dr. Kitiyama said, is part of the way people in a collectivist culture preserve harmony within their group. Studies in China, for example, show that people who are modest about their successes are better-liked than those who take pride in them.
The difference in life goals between such cultures was evident in a 1978 survey of Pacific and Asian nations by Yasumata Tanaka, a psychologist at Gakushin University in Tokyo. He found that 64 percent of New Zealanders and 50 percent of Australians subscribed to the goal of "doing whatever I think worth doing," while only 32 percent of Japanese and 12 percent of Indians agreed with that strongly individualist goal.
Some social scientists say the American focus on individualism has gone overboard. Barry Schwartz, a psychologist at Swarthmore College, has written that failure to realize the limited appeal of individualism around the world leads to basic errors in social sciences like economics. The pitfall is in overgeneralizing how essential a part of human nature individualism is; a "greedy self-interest" cannot be assumed as "an eternal law of human nature," Dr. Schwartz wrote in "The Battle for Human Nature" (Norton, 1986).
Dr. Bellah, the Berkeley sociologist, sees a broader danger. "In earlier days," he said, "the individualism in America was one that also honored community values. Today we have an ideology of individualism that simply encourages people to maximize personal advantage. This leads to a consumer politics in which 'What's in it for me?' is all that matters, while considerations of the common good are increasingly irrelevant.
"There's perhaps a better model in the democracies of Europe," he went on. "There you find a strong sense of the dignity of the individual with an equally strong social responsibility."

HEADLINE: Capital Gains: Respite or Requiem?

 BODY:
President Bush has indicated he won't push for a capital gains tax cut next year. That would be a welcome advance for fiscal fairness, assuming he really means it. Better yet, he should drop the idea altogether.
Capital gains -- the income to investors when they sell investments that have increased in value -- are currently taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, mostly at 28 percent. Prior to the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the maximums were 20 percent for gains and 50 percent for ordinary income. The 30-point difference invited schemes to avoid the higher rate, and tax shelters flourished. 
 Elimination of this special treatment was the balance wheel of the reform package, and properly reflected the spirit of reform: tax equality for all forms of income.
Mr. Bush pledged in his 1988 election campaign that he would restore the preference. In backing off now, he appears to be yielding to the realities of politics and the budget, rather than economic sense.
The Democrats will have extraordinary strength in the newly elected House; only twice before has a President faced a larger opposition majority. Since his pledge was thwarted by the last Congress, he could hardly expect to do better in the new Congress that convenes in January. Moreover, under the rules of this year's budget agreement, he would have to propose an offset to the revenue that would be lost if the capital gains tax were cut.
The President's intentions won't finally be known until he presents his new budget in five weeks; the capital gains issue is still being pressed by some Administration diehards. But it's clear from Mr. Bush's own lips that he hasn't given up his "philosophical commitment" to the idea that a tax break for capital gains stimulates growth.
There is little evidence that it does what the President supposes. Rather, it channels investment into activities designated for the tax payoff, regardless of their economic merit, or it simply rewards cashing in old investments. Moreover, the biggest providers of investment capital for risky new ventures have been tax-free institutional investors, like pension funds and endowments.
There is abundant evidence, however, that a capital gains tax cut would favor the well-off. Of the 110 million individual income tax returns in 1988, fewer than 8 million reported capital gains, and three-quarters of the gains went to taxpayers whose income exceeded $100,000. Over a longer span of years, middle-income taxpayers can benefit, too, of course -- when they sell a house, or stock. But that's relatively infrequent for the average American, and little stimulus for the economy.
Even -- or especially -- in the face of a recession, a tax subsidy for the rich is without merit. This idea deserves a quiet burial.

HEADLINE: A Quieter Christmas

 BODY:
So there he was, a portly septuagenarian sunk deep in a leather chair. This was definitely not Santa Claus. His cheeks were sole-gray, his face wreathed in sorrow. What could the matter be? "Christmas is wearing a gloomy face this year," he said. "It's warm when it ought to be cold. It rains when it ought to snow. There are more floorwalkers than customers in the stores. Worst of all, my assistant asked me this morning -- get this -- whether it would be O.K. to fax his Christmas cards."
Now that was a stunner. For what the gentleman's assistant had raised was the idea -- gloomy indeed -- that we as a nation have become so tangled in technology, so beguiled by faxes, cellular phones, third-generation paging devices, voice mail and E-mail that the simple act of writing and mailing a note is now quite beyond our patience or power. Had Christmas, like just about everything else, become mechanized? 
 And slowly the answer formed. It was, resoundingly, no. The fax-mad assistant notwithstanding, evidence abounds that this is a back-to-the basics Christmas, less self-indulgent, showy, commercial, exhibitionist and, yes, more personal and intimate than Christmases immediately past.
The main reason is as depressingly plain as an article in Friday's Times. The New York metropolitan area lost 100,000 jobs in private industry in 1990, the article reported, half of them in New York City. The money that fueled the conspicuous consumption of the Reagan years, especially among those not-so-young-anymore and certainly not-so-upwardly-mobile-anymore professionals, simply isn't there.
According to The Wall Street Journal, among the more prominent casualties of the grim realities of the 90's have been the status symbols of the 90's: the Brooks Brothers suspenders, the Rolex President Watches, the $200 leather-bound Filofax personal organizers and, of course, that ever-popular stocking-stuffer, the two-door BMW 325i. Instead, people are buying things they need, including "sensible brown shoes," according to one woman quoted in The Times, and postponing discretionary pleasures for a later day.
This may not be wonderful for the economy, but it is a usefully sobering reminder of what Christmas is about. Christmas is a joyous, festive secular celebration, but that is secondary. It is a religious holiday. Thus there's much to be said for observing it quietly, simply and unpretentiously. Indeed, the great moment that it recalls, the birth of the Christian Saviour, was itself a remarkably unadorned event: a carpenter named Joseph, his young wife, a stable, the Child.
There were, of course, gifts: the Wise Men brought beautiful things, gold and myrrh and frankincense. But the lesson of that day was that no temporal gifts could match the greatest gifts of all: the gifts of sharing, and sacrifice.

HEADLINE: The Wizard of Oz Unmasked as the President

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The television network production of "The Dreamer of Oz" (review, Dec. 10), on the alleged origins of L. Frank Baum's "Wizard of Oz," is perhaps artistically sound. But it is as much a fantasy as what it purports Baum's description of that little Kansas farm girl and her trip to the magical kingdom to be. I watched in hope that it would make note of Baum's political thinking. The closest it came was to have his mother-in-law a women's suffrage activist, of sorts. 
 Articles going back to one by Henry Littlefield in American Quarterly in 1964 have exposed the politics of "The Wizard of Oz" and Baum as a political activist in his own right, a champion of what was called populism at the turn of the century. The movement was then headed by William Jennings Bryan during his two unsuccessful Presidential attempts in 1896 and 1900 against William McKinley.
It was in 1896 that Bryan made his famous "Cross of Gold" speech at the Democratic National Convention, in which he used the metaphor of the crucifixion of the farmers of America on a cross of gold by the Eastern industrial establishment by insisting on maintaining the gold standard, rather than a silver-backed currency. Silver, Bryan insisted, would have provided the oppressed farmers with easier financing.
Baum was a Bryan supporter, with reservations. His Kansas locale was a way of placing the fantasy trip in the midst of the farm belt, and little Dorothy's three traveling mates all held political significance. The Cowardly Lion was Bryan himself, and indicated that Baum thought his candidate was little more than a loudmouth speechmaker with little substance. The Tin Man was the unemployed industrial worker who was rusting with idleness, and his Scarecrow was the farmer who didn't have the leadership and sense to take up his own political fight.
The rest of the characters and locales also served Baum's populist thinking. The Wicked Witch of the East was, of course, the evil banker who exploited the little people, or his Munchkins. Dorothy was wearing silver slippers that symbolized Bryan's (and Baum's) quest for the silver standard, and her trip took her down the Yellow Brick Road, which was the gold standard.
Who else could the Wizard be but the President sitting in the White House in Washington, or the Emerald City. We all remember that the Wizard acted and spoke in a manner that made him appear just as the people wanted him to, Baum's cynical view of all politicians. In the end, the Wizard is shown up as an antipopulist scoundrel and is thus exposed by the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Lion. To complete the picture, "Oz" was not a tab on a filing cabinet, but the abbreviation for ounce, by which gold was measured.
Had Baum lived exactly one century later, his "Wizard of Oz," with just about all of the same characters in place, would be as timely. The beauty of his artistry is buried in the sadness of our times.

HEADLINE: FALL IN U.S. PRICES, FIRST SINCE 1940'S, BEGINS TO SPREAD

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For the first time since the 1940's, falling prices have returned to the American economy, and they are starting to spread.
This new deflation is most visible in real estate. But prices are also dropping for steel, aluminum, plastics and other commodities used in manufacturing. And while prices are still rising for many things, like medical care, college tuition and legal services, recent data show the beginnings of deflation in some consumer products, like cars, furniture and kitchen appliances. The lower prices are often masked as rebates, sales and steep discounts; these are becoming fixtures rather than just special events. 
 The decline of some prices is beginning to show up in the Consumer Price Index, which measures the costs of a cross section of services and products. Not since 1960 has the United States entered a recession with that index rising by as little as it is today -- averaging just 3.9 percent at an annual rate over the last three months, not counting energy prices.
 
Accustomed to Inflation
 Deflation, with its promise that the dollar will buy more each week than the week before, might seem a welcome experience for a nation accustomed to inflation -- if it were not for the worrisome consequences. Principally, deflation causes problems for a nation burdened with debt, and debt in the United States increased to record levels in the 1980's.
The problem is that falling prices mean lower revenues for businesses of all sorts with huge debts, including manufacturers and real estate developers. This makes it harder for them to pay off their loans. The result has been rising defaults that are squeezing hundreds of banks and pushing some to the brink of failure. The loan crisis in turn forces rushed sales of buildings and other assets, and this hurry to sell reduces prices even further.
 
Median Wages Inching Up
 Many wage earners might benefit from deflation as long as they do not lose their jobs in the recession that is helping to push down prices or do not suffer cuts in hours or pay. So far, by most measures, median wages are still inching up. But if deflation takes too much of a toll on revenues and profits, then layoffs and wage cuts might spread, as they did during the Depression. That in turn would make debt repayment harder for many individuals, who had counted on secure jobs and rapidly rising wages to make their debt seem less burdensome.
The high levels of debt are the biggest cause of deflation, many economists recognize. Irving Fisher, a prominent economist early in the century, pinpointed the syndrome in which deflation follows debt in a 1933 article, now a classic in economics, that reviewed the Depression's damage.
"This is different from the experience of the Great Depression," said Ben Bernanke, a Princeton University economist, "but something related to the 1930's is beginning to happen."
Deflation caused by debt differs from other episodes of falling prices in the United States since the Depression. The last such episodes occurred in the late 1940's and early 1950's, the most important coming in 1948-49, when a huge demand for goods after the war finally leveled off. There have also been isolated episodes of falling prices, including the sharp drop in oil prices and the steep decline in farmland prices in the mid-1980's.
The sharp drop in real estate prices today would also be passed off as another temporary episode, if not for the context. The heavy borrowing to finance the real estate boom and the numerous corporate takeovers could turn out to be the opening stage of Fisher's cycle in which deflation follows debt. It is a cycle that can make deflation spread throughout the economy rather than remain in isolated sectors.
 
 Economy Called Resilient
"There will be wide deflation this time," said John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist. "But the American economy is far more resilient than it was in the 1930's. And if things get bad enough, there is an inescapable obligation on the part of the Government that did not exist before to step in and reverse the trend."
In the Fisher scenario, all the borrowing and spending, instead of producing profits for business and new wealth for society, simply create too much capacity and too many products. For example, 30 percent of all the commercial office space in the nation today was built in the last 10 years, according to the F. W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill, which gathers such data. "And 20 percent of all office space is vacant, generating no rental revenue at all," said George Christie, Dodge's chief economist. "That's also a record."
Something similar is happening in cars. New Japanese plants in the United States are supplementing the output of Ford Motor, General Motors and Chrysler and the industry as a whole is producing more cars than Americans can easily absorb. Wynn Van Bussman, a Chrysler economist, calculates that industrywide rebates and incentives averaged $952 a car last month, more than offsetting price increases on some new car models.
"The problem with lowering prices is that costs are rising, particularly labor costs," Mr. Van Bussman said. "Society is not organized for deflation. We have so seldom had it. We need price increases of at least 1 or 2 percent a year to lubricate the system."
 
 Furniture Prices Down
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks prices, is also beginning to pick up early signs of deflation. Furniture prices, for instance, are down 3 percent since late 1989. Kitchen appliances, glassware, various textile products and numerous commodities are also lower in price than they were a few months ago.
And while the bureau's Consumer Price Index still shows sharp increases for health care, funeral expenses, legal fees and other services, price increases for many manufactured products are disappearing.
"We have simply not been able to raise prices before this recession began," said Walter Joelson, chief economist at the General Electric Company.
 
Real Estate Defaults Growing
 But if the car companies and other manufacturers are being squeezed for profits and cash, the real estate industry is furlongs ahead of any other in the debt-deflation cycle. Without sufficient rental income, developers fall behind on loan payments and eventually default. Today this is happening mainly in the Northeast, but the defaults are spreading to other regions.
To cover the loans, either the developers or their banks try to sell the properties. The effort drives down prices, so that even if properties are sold, they often do not bring enough to repay loans. Across the country, the best commercial properties are off in price by 5 percent to 10 percent, David Shulman, a real estate expert at Salomon Brothers, reports. And home prices are either dropping or no longer rising in nearly every state. The median price for houses has declined by 6 percent nationwide since July. Not in years has real estate deflation been so widespread.
In some cases, condominium developers, unable to sell a one- or two-bedroom apartment in the Northeast for their original offering price of $300,000 or $400,000, have been forced to auction them for prices $100,000 less.
 
Effort Increases Burden
 Describing the process of deflation caused by debt in 1933, Fisher wrote, "The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debts increases it." Rushing to sell an office building for, say, $1 million helps to drive down its price to $500,000. But the mortgage owed to the bank remains at $800,000. The banks had made the $800,000 mortgage loan mostly with depositors' money.
Now the bankers are, in effect, taking money from their pockets to reimburse depositors. That process has exhausted, or almost exhausted, the capital of hundreds of commercial banks that lent heavily in real estate. Fourteen percent of banking's total loans outstanding are in real estate. An additional 4 percent are in loans for corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts. The sharp decline in "junk bond" prices in recent months means that the resale value of the indebted corporations is also deflating.
In lockstep with the Fisher scenario, the banks are responding to the crisis as they did in the early 1930's -- by not making new loans. The aim of a bank doing this is to reduce its loan portfolio to bring it back into line with the bank's capital, which has shrunk. The banks say that Federal regulators have forced them to act this way, by requiring them to increase their capital at the wrong moment.
 
Difficulties for Banks
 But others argue that in a recession the banks cannot find low-risk loans that would assure them of the profits from interest income to rebuild capital. "And if a solid company does walk in with a good loan proposal, the banks are so uneasy they don't make the loan anyway," said Robert Heilbroner, the economic historian.
Whatever the reasons, the reluctance to lend has spread to the insurance industry, another big source of credit. The upshot is that hundreds of companies, unable to refinance their debts, try to liquidate them through the sale of offices, factories, machinery and other properties. And the deflation in real estate spreads to other industries.
"If banks are not lending, and they aren't today, then if I want to sell an asset to you, and you cannot find a bank or other lender to finance part of the purchase, the asset will go to zero," said Albert Wojnilower, a senior adviser at the First Boston Corporation.
 
Not as Severe as in 1930's
 But few if any economists expect the deflation that developed in the early 1930's to recur as severely in the 1990's. Prices fell by as much as 11 percent a year in the 1930's, and wages also contracted so that thousands of workers received fewer dollars in their weekly paychecks at the end of the year than they had at the beginning. The wage declines played a major role in cutting production costs and thus giving companies the leeway to reduce prices during a period of very weak demand, economists say.
By most measures, wages for the average worker are rising today, although by smaller amounts than a year or two ago. And savings are safe. During the Depression, when a bank failed, a family's savings were instantly wiped out; now they are protected by Federal deposit insurance. "You can imagine the lines that would be forming at the banks today without deposit insurance," Mr. Galbraith said.
 
Rise for Services Continues
 Perhaps most important, the 1930's lacked the huge presence of a service sector and of Government spending on Social Security, welfare and other services. These outlays help to keep prices rising, despite the debt-deflation cycle now under way. Prices might be falling for real estate and even manufactured products, but they continue to rise for services like medical care.
But if the 1990's are not the 1930's, other factors are helping to bring down prices. For one thing, the baby-boom generation is mostly through its home-buying years. The new generation of young couples establishing homes is much smaller, reducing the demand. The downturn also coincides with a drop in grain prices. Big harvests and fewer Soviet purchases are helping to deflate prices.

HEADLINE: Herbert Salzman Is Dead at 74; Economics Adviser to 4 Presidents

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Herbert Salzman, a business executive and merchant banker who served four Presidents in the field of international economics, died Sunday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 74 years old and had homes on the East Side of Manhattan and in Westport, Conn., and Klosters, Switzerland. 
 He died of leukemia, his family said.
Mr. Salzman, who had careers in business, government and banking, also served in 1983 as a New York City commissioner who advised on foreign business in New York City. After that he was a general partner in Bradford Ventures Ltd., a merchant bank that invests in promising companies.
Born to Russian immigrant parents in Brooklyn, Mr. Salzman attended public schools there and, in 1934, the Reali School of Haifa, Palestine. He graduated cum laude from Yale College in 1938 and also took an advanced management program at Columbia University in 1954.
 
Joined Father's Company
 Out of Yale, he joined the Standard Bag Corporation, founded by his father, William S. In World War II he enlisted in the Navy as an ensign. He was a lieutenant commander when he returned to civilian life in 1946.
A vice president of Standard Bag from 1938 until he became president in 1959, he was instrumental in the company's strong growth. When Mr. Salzman turned 50, he sold the company and went into Government service.
President Lyndon B. Johnson made him assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development in 1966, and the following spring he was put in charge of the agency's new private resources division. That office was created to channel private initiative and capital into projects in poor countries.
Mr. Salzman's division handled an investment guarantee program, forerunner of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. A quasi-public body underwritten by Congress, its purpose was to offer American money to third-world nations for economic development while insuring the investment against the risks of political upheaval and expropriation.
 
Worked With Javits
 One promoter of the program was Senator Jacob K. Javits, a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mr. Salzman worked closely with him in shaping the corporation. The agency was created by legislation and was to have begun operations on July 1, 1970, but Senator Javits jousted with President Richard M. Nixon over who should run it.
Mr. Javits warned the Senate that unless Mr. Salzman was nominated, rather than President Nixon's favorite, the Senator would block funds for the corporation indefinitely. A compromise was reached at the end of the year when Mr. Nixon submitted a new list of 12 directors, with Mr. Salzman as executive vice president.
Mr. Salzman, who was reappointed by President Gerald R. Ford, remained with the corporation until 1976. The following year President Jimmy Carter sent him to Paris as the United States representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a post he held until 1981.
 
Held New York City Post
 Mayor Edward I. Koch, as part of an overhaul of his Office for Economic Development, named Mr. Salzman Commissioner of the Office of International Business Development in 1983. He began the job on March 15 but resigned in July.
At the time he informed the Mayor's office that he considered his mission accomplished by having gauged the extent to which foreigners were doing business in the city and setting forth the ways of keeping them and attracting more.
Over the years Mr. Salzman served on many governmental and private bodies, including trusteeships at the Studio Theater, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and Harvard's Center for International Affairs.
He is survived by his wife, the former Rita Fredricks; two sons, Anthony David and Jeffrey Jonathan; a sister, Sally Pepper, and two grandchildren, all of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Pope, in Christmas Message, Warns on a Gulf War

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Pope John Paul II delivered a blunt admonition to world leaders today that war in the Persian Gulf would be "an adventure with no return."
In his annual Christmas message, "Urbi et Orbi" -- "To the City and the World" -- the Pope called for talks to resolve the crisis. But at the same time, he seemed to suggest that Iraq had to withdraw from Kuwait, saying "the inalienable rights of people and nations" must be respected. 
 Moments after speaking about the gulf from the central balcony of St.Peter's Basilica, John Paul urged a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one, he said, that would acknowledge "the legitimate expectations" of each side. This reflected a frequently expressed papal theme: that Israelis and Palestinians had equal rights to their homelands and to secure borders.
The gulf and Israel were lumped together in a prayer for "the tormented nations of the Middle East." It was not clear, however, if the Pope intended a direct political link between the two issues, as Iraq has demanded. Thus far, the United States and its Western allies have insisted that Iraq must first leave Kuwait, and only then could anoverall settlement of Middle Eastern problems be discussed.
International issues, including Eastern Europe's political rebirth and Africa's continuing ordeal of hunger and conflict, dominated the papal message, delivered before several thousand people gathered on a drizzly late morning in the vast square below the balcony. The Pope also offered brief season's greetings in 53 languages as part of remarks that were carried in live and delayed broadcasts to millions of television viewers in 60 countries.
It was not the first time since the gulf crisis began nearly five months ago that John Paul had pleaded for peace.But this was his sternest appeal, and, coming three weeks before the United Nations deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, it carried added urgency.
"For the area of the gulf, we await with trepidation for the threat of conflict to disappear," he said, speaking in Italian. "May leaders be convinced that war is an adventure with no return. By reasoning, patience and dialogue with respect for the inalienable rights of people and nations, it is possible to identify and travel the paths of understanding and peace."
The Pope spoke after celebrating a Mass inside the basilica. Earlier, he had presided at the traditional midnight Mass and at services soon after dawn in his private chapel. At the midnight celebration of Christmas, a speaker read a prayer in Arabic that asked God to "enlighten the minds ofthose responsible for nations so that they become builders of peace and make every effort to build it in justice and reciprocal respect."
As usual, St. Peter's Square contained the Roman Catholic faithful and the merely curious. Because of the dreary weather, it was a thinner crowd than usual, and as he spoke, some drifted away to a Nativity scene.
In the front ranks, a group of pilgrims unfurled a large banner identifying themselves as Ukrainians, and they cheered when John Paul included Ukrainian among the dozens of languages in his Christmas greetings.
The revival of the Catholic Church in the Soviet Ukraine, which until recently was forced to survive underground, has been a special concern for the Pope. It is believed that he wants to be sure that full religious liberty andchurch property rights are restored there and elsewhere in the Soviet Union before he accepts an invitation from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to pay a visit.
Turning to Africa, John Paul echoed a concern he has expressed for the last year -- that the West's desire to help the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe should not come at the expense of struggling third-world countries where "freedom is compromised because of underdevelopment."
Calling for a "more just world ethical and economic order," he said that "only effective and respectful cooperation between the rich countries and the emerging people can prevent the contrast between North and South from becoming a widening abyss that will increase the already vast and disturbing archipelago of poverty and death."

HEADLINE: Amid Gulf Crisis and Cold War End, Questions on U.S. and NATO Roles

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
The crisis in the Persian Gulf and the end of the cold war, despite political uncertainty in the Soviet Union, are adding fuel to a major debate about strengthening Western Europe's defenses and reducing its dependence on the United States.
Government officials in West Germany and Britain support the idea of building up the European defense pillar, something they hope would encourage the United States not to withdraw to the other side of the Atlantic. But others, even in Britain, argue that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization may no longer be the best way to insure that the United States keeps devoting resources to European defense. 
 "NATO should remain in being only as long as necessary to create the conditions that would allow it to be dissolved," Sir James Eberle, a retired admiral and a former NATO field commander, said this month in a speech when he stepped down as director of the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
The 16 NATO countries agreed at a meeting in London in July to transform their alliance into a political entity, and said they hoped for agreement on the outlines of a new post-cold-war strategy by early next summer. At the same time, nine of NATO's European members are showing increasing interest in a new role for an organization they belong to -- the Western European Union, a long-slumbering vestige from the early days of the alliance.
 
Nucleus of Future Defense
 Close cooperation among the nine members of the Western European Union could form the nucleus of a common military policy for the 12-nation European Community, a proposal by the French President, Francois Mitterrand, and the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, suggested this month.
Supporters of the proposal say it would lend influence to the economic and political power of the European Community and satisfy American demands that the countries of Europe do more for their own defense.
Even British officials, traditionally more inclined to rely on sovereign military power and close links with the United States than on European cooperation for their defense, have shown interest in the Western European Union.
The organization, which took shape and was trying to organize a multinational European army in the early 1950's, decided in August to coordinate and increase naval activities in the Persian Gulf in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Before that, it was used in 1987 to coordinate the activities of countries that sent ships to the gulf to protect tankers threatened during the Iran-Iraq war.
 
Brushfires Outside Europe
 Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain, in a statement in Berlin on Dec. 10, said the Western European Union could be a bridge between the European Community and the United States. He said it might also provide the framework for a multinational reaction force that could be used to respond to security threats outside Europe, something NATO has not been able to do.
Alan Clark, the British Minister for Defense Procurement, also said recently that Europe needed "something slimmer, less set in its ways than NATO, something capable of faster response" to defend itself now that the threat of overwhelming nuclear and conventional attack from the Soviet Union has receded.
"The purpose of NATO is achieved," Mr. Clark said in remarks to a London audience that were reported by The Independent newspaper on Dec. 10. "It won. The W.E.U. probably is the nucleus" of the future European defense role, he said.
One difficulty is that the Western European Union involves only nine European countries. Another is that until recently, few people knew that it still existed. Its secretariat is in London, opposite the grounds of Buckingham Palace. A 108-member parliamentary assembly meets occasionally in Paris, where the union also has a small international staff and an institute for security studies.
 
Overstaffing Criticized
 Where Mr. Clark questioned what the 4,000 military and civilian employees at NATO headquarters in Brussels were doing anymore, the Western European Union has only 53 in London, including seven security guards, two drivers and two messengers.
"We have no secure communications with NATO or with the national capitals," said the Secretary General, Willem F. van Eekelen, a former Dutch Defense Minister.
He said he would not need a vast bureaucratic structure to support the kind of European military force he has proposed, to be started from a brigade of 4,000 or 5,000 soldiers from each participating country, with their own staffs, logistical support and artillery. A single European general would exercise divisional or corps command.
The Western European Union could have sent such a force, if it existed, to the Persian Gulf, he said.
 
French Are Not Impressed
 Mr. Hurd suggested moving the union to make it easier to coordinate with NATO and the United States. But so far, the suggestion has not been taken up with enthusiasm by France, which has kept its own forces out of NATO's military command structure.
Mr. van Eekelen suggested that the debate about the American role in Europe's defenses would become more acute after 1994, when all Soviet troops have been withdrawn from Germany.
Though the United States encouraged the Western European Union when it took shape in the early 1950's, American diplomats in London, Brussels and Rome are somewhat skittish about reviving the idea nowadays. Mr. van Eekelen said that Europeans would have to be just as ready as Washington to consult their allies, through NATO, before making final defense decisions in order to avoid raising suspicions.
Europeans who have often felt that Washington did not so much consult as inform them after the fact of what it had decided could now behave in much the same way toward the United States, some NATO diplomats fear.
 
What Will the Germans Do?
 One of them said the Administration was particularly concerned about how Germany, economically and militarily the most powerful European country, would act.
The Administration felt severely let down by the lack of German response to American appeals to do more in the Persian Gulf. Germany has sent no combat forces but has provided logistical support for the air and sealift of some of the American troops.
"The reality is that the decision as to whether or not Saddam Hussein has to be removed from Kuwait by force of arms rests entirely with the President of the United States," Sir James Eberle said, pointedly observing that the impression of an international military effort there was misleading.
"Whatever the outcome, the cost of the gulf operations will be seen by most Americans to have fallen largely on the United States," he said. "This will inevitably raise deep questioning of the future world leadership role that the United States wishes to play. Europe cannot stand aside from its own responsibilities."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Gulf Summit Talks End on a Mixed Note

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 25

 BODY:
The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council ended a four-day summit meeting today by warning Iraq that war was the only alternative to its peaceful withdrawal from all of Kuwait.
The council, the Persian Gulf's economic and military cooperation group, held its 11th annual summit meeting in Doha, the capital of Qatar. 
 In a closing statement read by Abdullah Bishara, a Kuwaiti who is the group's general secretary, the council demanded Iraq's total and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait before Jan. 15, "to spare the fraternal Iraqi people and the people of the region and the whole world the horrors of a destructive war." It also said that Iraq would be held responsible for compensating Kuwait and its people for the looting and plundering of the country.
The group, made up of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar, wanted to add its own voice to the growing chorus of threats to Saddam Hussein from the Bush Administration, European leaders and Egypt, among others.
But underlying its oratory was a realization that the council had failed, despite billions in arms purchases, to deter a threat to one of their member states and that the future would likely be determined not by these tiny sheikhdoms but by the superpowers of the region and the world.
 
Warning by Saudi King
 Saudi Arabia's dominance within this group and its status as a regional economic power were reflected in the weight attached to the sole public pronouncement by King Fahd, the Saudi ruler. In a tough speech on Monday, the King said his country and the rest of the gulf were prepared to go to war if this was the only way of forcing Iraq to leave Kuwait.
The Riyadh Government's role both within the council and in the conflict is critical. First, it was Riyadh's request for assistance in deterring what it viewed as an Iraqi threat to its territory that brought American ground forces to the region. Second, the overwhelming majority of American forces are now based there. In the event of war, Egyptian and other Arab forces stationed in the Saudi desert would be fighting under Saudi command. And politically, Saudi consent is indispensible to any peaceful or compromise resolution to the gulf crisis.
No important pronouncements had been expected from this gathering of sheiks and kings, and none were forthcoming. "They were just trying to get through this summit," a Western diplomat said. "They had to hold it because not to hold it would have been disastrous."
The statement said the council had approved "recommendations by their Defense Ministers for the consolidation of the member states' defense capabilities," but it did not elaborate. King Fahd and council officials emphasized the need to review existing security arrangements for the region, but most members believed that future defense arrangements could be meaningfully discussed only after the crisis is resolved.
 
Unanswered Questions
 "Will the crisis be resolved through peace or war?" an Arab diplomat asked. "Will Saddam Hussein be around or not? Will Iraq's military forces be intact or not? Will there be an Iraq as we know it today? We cannot decide on future structures for the gulf until these questions are answered."
Officials in Washington and Western diplomats here asserted that there were no serious disussions taking place at this time about future defense arrangements. But, they added, there was a consensus forming that prepositioning equipment and installations in this area made economic and strategic sense.
"A lot of what we have brought here will probably remain here," said Col. Jerry Nelson, commander of the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, the 900-member United States Air Force unit that has been based here since the end of August. "It would be cheaper to haul the Arabian peninsula back to the United States than to go through this again."
John Duke Anthony, president of the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations and an expert on the Persian Gulf who attended the session, argued that the council should not be judged too harshly for failing either to deter or to respond to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
 
Iraqi Regional Power
 "This organization had emphasized air and naval capabilities because until recently it had contemplated a threat from Iran," Mr. Anthony said. "But to evict Iraq from Kuwait, you need land forces, tanks and artillery." Besides, he said, the six members were dwarfed by Iraq. "Altogether, the military forces of the six equal one-eighth of Iraq's regular army. Iraq has 10 times as many tanks, 8 times as much artillery, and 4 times their combat aircraft."
There was little sense at the meeting that Iraq's aggression had induced a sense of humility among the gulf leaders. Meetings between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and George Bush have had less security than this assemblage did. Journalists were virtual prisoners in a hotel across town from where the leaders met, and most gulf state officials never ventured anywhere near the 400-member Arab press corps or the few Western journalists.
Though the council attempted to adopt a united front in its public declarations, longstanding differences came up repeatedly in the private meetings. Oman, for example, has vigorously pressed for a negotiated solution to the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. As the only member of the council to receive high-ranking Iraqi officials, it has championed the efforts of the Algerian President, Chadli Benjedid, to devise an Arab solution that would secure Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait without war.
But Saudi Arabia, in the statement by King Fahd and in his previous statements, has taken a far tougher approach, emphasizing that there can be no compromise with Baghdad, at least on the matter of Kuwaiti territory.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN THE GULF;
Iraqis' Christmas: Joy and a 'Weight'

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 25

 BODY:
With the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, the Rev. Kamal Bidawid thought he had passed his last Christmas with death and destruction hanging over his 250-family congregation of Chaldean Catholics.
During the eight brutal years of that conflict, Father Bidawid said the requiem Mass for most of the 15 men who had died in combat and were buried in the congregation cemetery donated by the Iraqi Government 25 miles outside the city. He thought he had put the pain of those years behind him. 
 Today, sitting in his office among several young parishioners on holiday leave from the Iraqi Army's front lines in Kuwait, the 37-year-old priest was somber and as reflective as a religious leader can be in a country that tolerates religious expression so long as it does not become political expression.
 
'The People Need Peace'
 "This Christmas was different because this year the people need peace," Father Bidawid said in an interview. "When a man has no peace, he cannot do anything." He said the prospect that Iraq might go to war with the American-led forces amassed in Saudi Arabia had settled on Iraqis like a weight.
"People live their lives only seeing and hearing," he said. "They believe very strongly that our Lord will give them peace, and because they cannot do anything to change their fate, we pray -- like Christians, we pray."
War has done nothing but deplete Our Lady of Perpetual Health, one of two dozen Chaldean churches in Baghdad, Father Bidawid said.
Chaldean Catholics represent more than half of the one million Christians in predominantly Muslim Iraq, a country of more than 16 million people. Smaller groups of Christians belong to the Syrian, Latin and Armenian rites of the Roman Catholic Church and to the Armenian Orthodox Community.
A decade ago, the rolls of the Chaldean parish were flush with about 500 practicing families. But in 1980-82 and again in 1990, Iraqis who could obtain exit visas to immigrate to the United States, Europe, Canada or Australia did so, leaving behind a parish that is roughly half the size today, Father Bidawid said.
 
Encroaching Real Estate
 The small white masonry church with heavy Romanesque dome sits about a mile from the Tigris River, just east of the encroaching high-value real estate taken up by luxury hotels and the Ministry of Military Industry and Industrialization, which is run by the son-in-law of President Saddam Hussein.
On Monday night, Father Bidawid and a small cast of children re-enacted the Nativity scene before a packed congregation, including visitors from other churches. The men sat in the front pews and the women and children behind, because that is tradition, Father Bedawid said.
As the lights dimmed, the youthful costumed players acted out the story of Meriam and Yousef and their journey to comply with the Roman census decree, and their arrival at Bethlehem, where there was no room in the inn.
No detail was neglected in the pageantry. Even the star that guided shepherds and kings to the manger entered the upper nave of the church through a gimbaled portal from where it danced down a wire toward the birthplace of Jesus, snagging only briefly on the blade of a ceiling fan.
Narrated in Arabic and accompanied by lilting chants in Aramaic, the nearly extinct Levantine language spoken at the time of Jesus, the story reached its climax when the child playing Meriam held up a baby doll wrapped in a blanket and drew a standing ovation.
 
Pageantry Throughout Iraq
 Similiar scenes were repeated all over Iraq during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day services for the country's Christians, whose Christmas traditions seem to exert a disproportionate influence on the Muslim majority during the holiday season.
"In this country, the majority was Christian before Mohammed" and the sixth-century Muslim conquest, Father Bidawid said. "Even Tikrit," the hometown of Mr. Hussein, "was a Christian city, because we had a bishop at Tikrit."
"Christians are the salt of this land," the priest said. "We are faithful to this country, and we gave thousands of martyrs during the war because it is our country."
A few miles from the church, in a small Syrian Catholic enclave, a large Iraqi family invited a visiting American to a Christmas dinner of baked chicken, potatoes, sheep intestines stuffed with rice and meat, pickled turnips and stuffed grape leaves.
In this typical working-class house, over glasses of the local Farida beer, the talk was of war and politics, somewhat restrained because of the foreigner's presence, but also relatively frank as Iraqi political discourse goes. A picture of Mr. Hussein was on one wall in the adjoining television room next to a rendering of the Last Supper.
Red divans ran along the perimeter of the living room in Arab diwanniyya, or meeting-room, style, under needlepoint works of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane and of a pair of kittens. An artificial Christmas tree stood in the corner, well trimmed with golden balls, angels and red bows.
 
Hope of Avoiding War
 The strongest view expressed in the house this Christmas was that Mr. Hussein would pull his forces out of Kuwait at the last minute to avoid war while pressing his economic grievances against Kuwait in an ensuing round of Arab diplomacy.
Baghdad is full of rumors this week that the Arab Baath Socialist Party workers throughout the country have received secret instructions from Mr. Hussein to begin public demonstrations on Jan. 10 to beg the leadership to avoid war and at all costs preserve the leadership of Mr. Hussein. This public display would presumably allow a face-saving "out" for Mr. Hussein if diplomacy has yielded nothing on the eve of the United Nations Security Council deadline for withdrawing his forces from Kuwait.
The family's oldest son, who spent more than nine years in the army, was called back to duty last week, along with several cousins and neighbors who were born between 1957 and 1960.
"I think we will only be in the army for one month this time, so I am very happy," the son said.
His father, a full-bellied man of 60 with tradesman's hands and whiskers trimmed in the Turkmen style of northern Iraq, leaned over to the visitor after dinner and said, "I tell you, people in Iraq like Saddam Hussein, because they know that if he goes there is no one better."
The man's wife, who spent most of the week cooking pastries for this gathering, said her Christmas wish was that the threat of war would recede so Iraqis could once again travel abroad, where she would like to go to visit her brother.
"God willing, we will be able to go, if Bush doesn't destroy everything," she said with a hearty laugh.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Challenge Goals Of Liberal Wave at City Hall

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
The Draconian budget cuts in City Hall have not only sent city agencies reeling to slash services and personnel, but radically changed the agenda for dozens of liberal advocates who joined the Dinkins administration, putting their reform programs on ice and often pitting them against the very groups they once championed.
"It is very discouraging," said Nancy Wackstein, the director of the new Office on Homelessness, who finds herself trying to salvage homeless policies she had condemned before the election. "In the 1980's we all thought about what we would do when we had power. Now we have it and there is nothing to play with. The social justice agenda will have to wait another decade."
Many of the former advocates are working in departments that may have to cut their operating budgets by as much as 10 percent in the fiscal year that starts next July 1 and have been ordered to cut 7.5 percent out of this year's budget. 
 Many realize that they may not even be able to do as much as their old nemesis, Edward I. Koch. Many of the groups they once worked for have labeled them ineffectual. And the social problems they have fought for years to resolve may actually get worse under their guidance.
Keith J. Summa, the advocacy director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said: "These former advocates represent different issues now. When you are a city official you have to answer to the Mayor, not the homeless."
 
Few Plan to Pull Out
 Despite the budget cuts, most of those who joined the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins with high hopes have no plans to pull out, especially as they battle for their programs in the current round of budget negotiations. While many admit to being frustrated, they also say they believe that the Mayor is sincere in his concern for the city's poorest residents.
But some critics worry that the Mayor, determined to make his administration fiscally solvent, is turning away from the very groups and people who helped elect him.
"It is very frustrating to see the same unremarkable proposals coming out of City Hall," said City Councilman Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Manhattan Democrat, "especially since the expectations were that this administration would be open to new ideas and actively seek the advice of people who have not had access previously and are experts in their fields."
The reversal of roles, from advocate to city official, has not always been easy for these new city officials, especially since they often must endure criticism from their former colleagues.
 
'My Beliefs Have Not Changed'
 Ms. Wackstein offers one of the starkest examples. She worked as an advocate for the homeless before joining the Dinkins staff when he was Manhattan Borough President. Before the election, she criticized the use of hotels and large shelters for the homeless.
"My beliefs have not changed," Ms. Wackstein said. "I still do not believe that hotels or congregate shelters are good for families and children, but I have a better understanding as to why the prior administration had been forced to use these facilities."
With the budget cuts, Ms. Wackstein and her staff will be fortunate to retain the homeless programs established by the Koch administration, and have little hope of expanding or significantly altering the old policy.
"Homelessness is a problem that has some known solutions, but very expensive solutions, and that is what will not happen," Ms. Wackstein said.
While Ms. Wackstein and other advocates see the root cause of homelessness and crime as socio-economic, they work for an administration that has decided to pump much of its scant resources into beefing up the police, although it has chosen a few social programs for support.
As the Mayor's term wears on, these sentiments hold less sway with advocacy groups.
"If they did not believe these changes were possible, why did they advocate for these changes?" asked Virginia G. Shubert, the director of the AIDS project for the Coalition for the Homeless. "I look at them and feel the loss of allies."

HEADLINE: New York State Cutting 600 Workers This Week

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 25

 BODY:
More than 600 New York State employees, virtually all of them prison workers, will put in their last day on Wednesday as part of a plan to eliminate an estimated $1 billion deficit in the state's $50 billion budget.
In all, 2,000 state workers are to be laid off by the end of the fiscal year on March 31. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has promised to eliminate another 4,000 jobs through attrition and early-retirement incentives. Next year, the Governor has said he may have to eliminate 12,000 more jobs. The state has more than 200,000 employees. 
 Included among the employees to be laid off on Wednesday are about 300 prison guards and 300 other prison workers.
Thomas Kennedy, the president of Council 82, the prison guards' union, said being laid off during the holiday season was especially tough.
"There's no good season to be laid off," Mr. Kennedy said. "But given these economic times, and the fact that it's holiday time, it's very difficult."
 
Cuomo's Intervention Sought
 On Monday, the leadership of Council 82 met with the Commissioner of the State Department of Correctional Services, Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, to discuss the layoffs amid rumors that the guards were considering a strike or some other protest.
"Council 82 has not called for a job action or a strike, as is rumored, on Dec. 26," Mr. Kennedy said after the meeting. But he warned that anxiety among guards was running high, and he said he would like Governor Cuomo to intervene.
"The last time we saw this type of dissatisfaction with the way we're being treated, there was a strike in 1979," Mr. Kennedy said.
In 1979, the Governor, Hugh L. Carey, called in the National Guard to run the prisons during a 16-day strike by prison guards upset over negotiations for a new contract.
 
No National Guard Alert
 "I call for the Governor's intervention into this issue -- into the reasons why our staff is so disgruntled -- before too long," Mr. Kennedy said, "because the levels of anxiety out there are growing with each passing day."
Mr. Kennedy said the rumors of a possible strike have been fueled by contacts between state prison officials and National Guard officers.
"The National Guard has been in to one of our facilities for a tour in the last week," Mr. Kennedy said. "It looks to our people like we're being provoked."
A National Guard spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer Allen Koblenzer, said on Monday that the Guard had not been placed on alert because of any possible action by the prison guards. Mr. Coughlin's spokesman, James Flateau, said the tour was "pure coincidence" and had nothing to do with any possible job action by the guards.
Other state workers who will put in their last day on Wednesday include 19 employees of the Division of Parole and the Commission of Correction.
Those who are leaving the state work force on Wednesday received their pink slips at least three weeks ago, said Mardi Massaroni, a spokeswoman for the Governor's Office of Employee Relations.
Twenty-three more layoffs will take effect on Jan. 2. Those workers will come from the Division of Criminal Justice Services, the Division of Military and Naval Affairs and the Department of State, Ms. Massaroni said.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Says Many Retirees May Use a Simpler Tax Form

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service, an unlikely source of holiday cheer, has announced that millions of older Americans will now be able to switch to a simpler income tax form.
The I.R.S. said Monday that income earned from pensions, annuities, individual retirement accounts and taxable Social Security benefits may now be declared on the relatively short and simple 1040A tax form. Previously, such income had to be reported on the longer, more complex 1040 form. 
 Arthur Altman, director of the tax forms and publications division of the I.R.S., said that as many as 4.5 million Americans, most of them retired, would be able to file the shorter form. He noted that not only was the form simpler, but also that it was printed in larger type and, therefore, easier to read.
Patricia Hoath, a senior program specialist with Tax-Aide, a volunteer program that provides free tax advice to retirees, said it might take a while for people to learn that they could use the easier form. But, she said, "Once the transition period is over, this will be helpful to older people."
This year, packages containing the tax forms and instructions from the I.R.S. will begin to appear in mailboxes on Dec. 28. In recent years, the forms had arrived on the day after Christmas.
 Mr. Altman said that Fred T. Goldberg Jr., the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, had decided that it was not in keeping with the spirit of the season to have tax packages arrive in the mail the day after Christmas, and so directed that the mailing be delayed for two days.
About 97 million tax packages will be sent out this year. In addition, 11 million postcards, instead of the full package of tax forms and instructions, will be sent to people who filed farm or business returns last year. The presumption is that these businesses use professional preparers and do not need the package, although they can get one on request. Last year, the I.R.S. saved $1 million by sending out postcards in place of the full packages.
The service expects that about 113 million tax returns will be filed for 1990.
As for the new tax year, beginning on Jan. 1, employers must resume deductions for Social Security taxes for workers who had paid the maximum tax before the end of the year. The Social Security withholding in 1991 will be 6.2 percent on wages up to $53,400, an increase from the maximum taxable wage base of $51,300 in 1990. This withholding covers retirement, disability and survivor benefits.
In a change from last year, 1.45 percent of all wages up to $125,000 will be withheld in 1991 for Medicare insurance. In 1990, Medicare payments were included in the overall Social Security payments up to $51,300.
Employers are required to match the entire 7.65 percent payroll withholding for Social Security and Medicare benefits.
 
Personal Deduction Rises
 Mr. Altman of the I.R.S. noted that reporting requirements were virtually unchanged for 1990 from 1989. Most of the changes Congress made in the tax code in 1990 will take effect with 1991 earnings and will affect returns filed starting in 1992.
One of the few changes for 1990 filings is that the personal deductions for taxpayers and their dependents will rise to $2,050, from $2,000, as an adjustment for inflation.
Another change will reduce the amount that may be deducted for interest from personal loans, like car loans and credit card accounts. Last year 20 percent of such interest could be deducted from tax payments, but this year only 10 percent may be deducted.
Mr. Altman said he hoped taxpayers would use the prepared label sent along with the tax forms, which he says contains information that helps the I.R.S. tax processors complete their work on individual tax forms more quickly and accurately.
Based on experience, the I.R.S. expects to make refunds averaging $900 to more than 70 percent of taxpayers. Errors in filing tend to delay the refunds by several weeks, he said.
 Henry Holmes, a spokesman for the agency, said returns prepared by accountants or other professionals tended, not surprisingly, to have a lower error rate than those filled out by the taxpayers themselves. Of 54.5 million returns prepared by professionals last year, about three million were found to contain errors, while of 57.5 million returns prepared by taxpayers, 7.3 million had at least one error.
One of the most common mistakes, Mr. Holmes said, is to state incorrectly one's filing status -- whether or not the filer is the head of a household. Many single people fail to identify themselves as heads of households even though they may have children or other dependents.
Another frequent error is made by people who fail to claim deductions for which they are entitled or who incorrectly compute those deductions. For example, people do not claim deductions for all of their children or do not identify dependents like elderly parents. People who are blind or have some other disability that makes them eligible for a deduction, in addition to the standard deduction, often fail to claim it, Mr. Holmes said.
There are also problems with the returns of low-income taxpayers who file incorrectly for earned income credits on their taxes, Mr. Holmes said.
These errors are usually caught during the processing of tax forms, he added, but they slow the operation, costing the Government and the taxpayers money.

HEADLINE: HAWAII JOURNAL;
Rare Storm Over Race Ruffles a Mixed Society

BYLINE: By RICHARD HALLORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Dec. 23

 BODY:
In racial and ethnic relations, Hawaii is nor mally a gentle place, a mosaic of Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Caucasian and other Americans living in amity.
But under the surface are undeniable tensions rooted largely in economics. Caucasian and Asian Americans are on the top and middle of the economic ladder, while ethnic Hawaiians and Filipinos are on the bottom. 
 Like Hawaii's volcano, Kilauea, those tensions sometimes erupt. A woman of ethnic Hawaiian descent, Haunani-Kay Trask, recently set off one such explosion.
It started three months ago when a white student at the University of Hawaii, Joseph Carter, wrote a letter to the student newspaper lamenting what he called "Caucasian bashing" and asserting that "racism is not an exclusively white endeavor."
Ms. Trask, who teaches Hawaiian studies at the university, replied with a letter to the newspaper reciting what she saw as white oppression of ethnic Hawaiians and contending that "Mr. Carter does not understand racism at all" and should leave the state.
Mr. Carter did just that, flying home to Louisiana.
An uproar ensued, with critics of Ms. Trask calling her a racist who had abused her position by lashing out at a student. The faculty of the philosophy department, in which Mr. Carter had studied, condemned Ms. Trask in a unanimously approved resolution that gained wide publicity.
Ms. Trask's supporters shot back, contending that she was asserting her rights to free speech. In an interview, Ms. Trask denied picking on Mr. Carter, who has returned to the university and plans to re-enroll in January.
"I always raise this issue," said Ms. Trask, whose family name derives from a Caucasian great-grandfather. "This has been my position for 15 years. I am a nationalist. I am asserting my claim to my country."
The university's Center for Hawaiian Studies, of which she is director, accused the philosophy department of "plantation tactics of threat, reprisal and intimidation."
But members of several ethnic groups have argued that Ms. Trask has been "un-Hawaiian" in raising these issues with such vehemence. The Hawaiian way, they say, is to be gentle, patient and circumspect.
Ms. Trask responded: "I am not soft. I am not sweet, and I do not want any more tourists in Hawaii."
Newspapers have been filled with letters from all sides, radio and television stations have interviewed the main players, and the issue has been a staple of lunchtime conversations.
Some of the contention turns on the Hawaiian word "haole" (pronounced HOW-LEE), which originally meant foreigner, but is now widely used to mean a Caucasian. Mr. Carter asserted that ethnic Hawaiians use it pejoratively, but in her letter Ms. Trask said, "Only new arrivals resent it because they have not had experience in a numerical minority."
In everyday conversation, many Caucasians in Hawaii refer to themselves and other whites as haole. The word becomes pejorative, one Caucasian said, "only when certain adjectives are added in front of it."
The racial and ethic climate here is rarely this heated. On the contrary, those born here and many newcomers often marvel at the civility of this diverse society.
Floyd Takeuchi, a Japanese-American, said the state is "remarkably cohesive, remarkably free of strife." In the days before World War II, he said, people in various ethnic groups worked together but lived largely in separate neighborhoods and did not socialize much.
Since just before statehood in 1959, that has been slowly changing with the movement of Asians and others, especially Japanese-Americans.
Hawaii residents give several reasons for the relative racial harmony. The most important, they agree, is that everyone here is in a minority.
In a population of just over one million, Hawaii is 24 percent Caucasian, 23 percent Japanese-American and 20 percent ethnic Hawaiian and part-ethnic Hawaiian. Filipinos, at 11 percent, are the fastest-growing group. Other ethnic groups round out the population.
In addition, the good feelings conveyed by "aloha," a word that is hard to translate but alludes to human warmth, is still alive.
Then, too, said Ilima Piiamaia, an ethnic Hawaiian, "people get along here because everyone celebrates everyone else's holidays."

HEADLINE: S.& L. Debacle Hinders Change In Banking Law

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Despite the grave problems in the industry, an overhaul of the nation's banking laws next year faces such serious political obstacles that the chief proponents of change say their chances of success are no better than even.
With many of the country's prominent banks losing money and some threatened with failure, with the Federal deposit insurance fund hanging by a thread, and with companies unable to get the loans they need to prosper, President Bush has promised that his top domestic priority in 1991 will be to restructure a financial system that has been basically unchanged since the Great Depression. 
 He wants to break down the barriers that now keep commercial banks, investment houses and securities companies out of each other's businesses and that restrict banks from operating across state lines. Those steps, he maintains, are necessary to make American financial institutions efficient and competitive worldwide.
 
Problems Called Avoidable
 Some members of Congress especially fear that the authority of banks cannot be expanded without encountering the same calamity that the savings and loan industry met when it was allowed to enter new businesses. But the President's advisers insist that those problems can be avoided.
The President's strong support makes the prospects for change better than ever. But huge roadblocks lie in the way, just as they have in almost every Congress since Richard M. Nixon tried unsuccessfully to change the banking system 20 years ago.
"I don't deny for a minute that the chances are probably no better than 50-50," said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, the commanding officer of the Administration's troops who will be fighting the battle on Capitol Hill. Some other senior Administration officials put the odds even lower.
So many competing interests are involved that Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Federal Reserve governor, likens banking legislation to a Rubik's Cube. All the pieces must be fit together simultaneously to solve the puzzle, and moving one into place tends to upset the order of the others.
The Treasury Department has not finished preparing all the elements of the legislation the President will send to Congress next month, but the basic principles are well known.
The package will include measures to shore up the deposit insurance system, an effort that politicians, bankers and regulators agree is essential; the measures are expected to pass in one form or another. It will permit banks to open branches nationwide. And it will allow banks to merge with securities companies and investment firms. Banks could then sell stock, underwrite bonds and operate mutual funds, activities from which they are now proscribed.
 
A Fundamental Change
 That would mean a fundamental change from the Depression era, when fear of dominance by a few large banks and of bankers taking wild risks with depositors' money led politicians to divide financial authority into separate fiefdoms.
The issue, officials say, is an especially attractive one for President Bush, because unlike other potential domestic policy initiatives, it would not cost the Government money. The President is seen as having a better chance of getting his legislation through Congress than his predecessors did for several reasons.
The most significant one is that the White House and the Treasury are giving the matter top billing. In previous Administrations, other issues were deemed more important.
In addition, banks are now in such a weakened condition that no one can plausibly argue that they could end up dominating economic activity or that the businesses bankers want to enter are riskier than commercial banking itself.
 
Nonpartisan Issue
 These other circumstances are also in the President's favor: The issue is basically nonpartisan, important given the Republican minorities in Congress. Technological and regulatory changes in recent years have made many restrictions obsolete. The securities industry, which fought fiercely against previous attempts to enact such legislation, is on board this time. And key regulators, who objected in past years to measures that might have cost them some authority, are more or less united behind the Administration.
But other factors militate against success. What has generally killed banking legislation over the years has been the opposition of competing financial institutions that are often more influential than large banks. While the securities industry has joined with the big banks, powerful lobbies like community bankers, realtors and insurance brokers remain set against change.
And this year, the legislation faces a new and maybe even bigger hurdle -- the specter of what happened to the savings and loan associations when they were given authority to expand into unfamiliar areas of business.
Furthermore, the Senate and House banking committees are badly crippled nowadays, and their leaders may not have the stature or the capacity to push through monumental legislation.
Finally, authorities in and out of the Government question whether anyone in the Administration involved in the banking issue has the tactical political skills that will be needed.
"Our biggest problem is going to be to show that this isn't the savings and loan mess all over again," said Robert R. Glauber, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance.
 
Not Covered by Insurance
 In the Administration's view, the savings institutions collapsed, at a huge cost to taxpayers, because the industry was badly undercapitalized and poorly regulated. In the case of banks, Mr. Glauber and Mr. Brady say, stiff capital requirements and strong supervision would be imposed, and the losses banks incur in outside businesses would not be covered by Federal deposit insurance.
But politicians are so gun-shy after the savings and loan experience that those kinds of promises may be insufficient. Representative Charles E. Schumer, an influential Democrat on the House Banking Committee, believes this could be the legislation's Achilles' heel. A liberal from Brooklyn, Mr. Schumer is normally an Administration antagonist, but he expects to be a strong supporter of the banking legislation.
"Even if it's carefully structured," he said, "even if it avoids all the problems of the S.& L.'s, someone gets up on the floor and says this is the S.& L. crisis all over. You have shivers down the spine of Congress people, and they run for the doors."
 
Conflicting Interest Groups
 The Administration's other main obstacle is all the conflicting interest groups. Many bankers want the authority to sell insurance and real estate, but that would bring realtors and insurance agents, wary of the competition, out in force against the legislation. Many politicians say this would doom the legislation.
The problem from the Administration's perspective is that small community bankers do not care about underwriting bonds or becoming stockbrokers, but many would love to have desks in their branches where they could sell life insurance or run real estate agencies. That could induce them to accept legislation otherwise intended mostly to help large banks.
The large banks have been generous with campaign contributions. But in the aftermath of the savings and loan disaster, the money comes a bit tainted.
Every Congressional district has realtors and insurance agents. They "are the world's best lobbyists," said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat on the banking committee. "That's what they do for a living," he added. "They make home calls. That's their culture. They will have to be accommodated."
The Administration hopes to mobilize manufacturing and service industries on the side of the banks with the argument that a strong banking system is necessary to a healthy business climate.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said his panel would begin work on the legislation as soon as it is submitted. He added that he was tempted to limit the bill to deposit insurance and not get into the broader issues.
 
Sapping of Strength Seen
 Mr. Riegle and the second-ranking Democrat on the banking committee, Alan Cranston of California, are two of the five Senators being investigated by the Ethics Committee because of their past relationship with Charles H. Keating Jr., who faces fraud charges in California and has become the symbol of the savings and loan debacle. The investigation has sapped their political strength, many Senators say.
On the House side, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas is a relatively weak and unpopular chairman of the banking committee. Chairmen are normally re-elected to their post routinely, but more than a third of the Democratic Representatives voted this month to unseat him.
Another problem is that unlike the Senate, where the banking committee will be the only one involved, jurisdiction in the House is divided between the banking commitee and the Energy and Commerce Committee.
The chairman of the second panel, Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, is a powerhouse, and he has not committed himself on the banking bill. He has close ties to the securities industry and has been partly responsible for blocking an expansion of bank authority in the past.
 
Dingell Might Go Along
 The securities industry favors the legislation this time because the Administration has promised to permit securities firms to enter commercial banking as well as allow banks to get into securities. That being the case, Mr. Dingell might go along.
The prevailing view in political and banking circles is that the Administration may also have a personnel problem. Mr. Brady, who was briefly a Senator from New Jersey a decade ago, is well liked in Congress, but many question whether he has the temperament to handle messy politicking. His top assistant, Mr. Glauber, a professor on leave from the Harvard Business School, is personable and has few peers as an expert on banking laws, but he has little background in politics or lobbying.
The most experienced political figures in the Administration -- John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff; Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d -- give no indication of becoming involved.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Getting More Gas From Coalbeds

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 25

 BODY:
A decade after Congress granted the first tax incentives for drillers to gather natural gas from coal deposits, a small group of energy companies finds itself in a booming, subsidized and profitable business.
By some estimates, more than 500 billion cubic feet of natural gas recovered from coal deposits -- known as coalbed methane -- will flow into pipelines in 1990. That means coalbed methane will amount to 3 percent of the natural gas that analysts expect will be consumed across the continental United States this year. Five years ago, coalbed methane contributed only 10 billion cubic feet. 
 Further increases in production are widely expected. Many analysts say discoveries announced in the last five years are enough to meet all of the nation's natural gas consumption for more than four years. And analysts say rising production of coalbed methane should keep natural gas prices from rising substantially for several years.
Improvements in the drilling technique have played an important role in developing coalbed methane as a reliable and clean energy source. The new technique loosens the coal deposit freeing the methane in such a way that it flows more easily around the well bore.
But most analysts say these advances would not have been made without the financial aid from Congress.
"This is one of those examples of where a Government tax-incentive program worked extremely well," said John H. Wood, head of the proved reserves program for the United States Energy Information Administration. "Production is growing very rapidly."
Methane, like coal, is formed from decaying plant matter that has been tightly packed under extreme pressures for millions of years.
 
Global Warming
 Energy companies have known since the 1920's that coal layers contain methane, often in large concentrations. Indeed, exploding concentrations of underground methane have killed thousands of miners. The Federal Bureau of Mines estimates that 300 billion cubic feet of methane escapes from underground coal mines each year, contributing to global warming.
Until the more productive method was developed in recent years, high costs discouraged energy companies from trying to capture methane from the coalbeds.
Amoco Inc. drilled the first successful methane-recovery well in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado in 1977.
Amoco used essentially the same drilling technology in its coalbed wells through most of the 1980's as it did in its oil and gas wells. Drill bits carved a well to the lowest depth of the coal seam. A pipe was lowered to the bottom of the well and concrete was forced out the bottom of the pipe until it rose up to the surface between the pipe and wall of the well. This formed an outer casing or shell to protect the pipe and prevent mud, gases and coal from seeping into groundwater supplies.
Small bullets were then shot through the steel pipe and concrete that lay within the coal seam to create holes through which the methane could flow into the well. Next, a mixture of sand and water was pumped under heavy pressure from the surface into the well to further loosen the coal and get the methane flowing more rapidly into the well.
 
Stress-Cavity Technique
 Since 1988, most drillers have used a newly developed method, called the stress-cavity technique, that dramatically accelerates the methane flow rate by exposing more coal to the well bore. The steel and concrete shaft stop short of the coalbed and do not go through it as is the case with the older method. Water and natural gas are pumped alternately from the surface directly onto the coal, carving a huge hole as chunks of coal are flushed back to the surface through the narrow drill pipe. Afterward, a liner pipe is placed at the base of the well to prevent more coal from being sucked in as methane is released from the coalbed. The methane flows through holes drilled in the liner pipe.
The Devon Energy Corporation, based in Oklahoma City, said it drilled 10 wells this year using the stress-cavity technique near the sites of wells drilled with the older method. J. Michael Lacey, vice president of operations and exploration at Devon, said the payoff was production of 92.8 million cubic feet a day for the new wells compared with five million cubic feet a day at the older ones.
Drilling costs for both types of methane wells, which average $400,000 a well in the San Juan Basin, are only a part of total development expenses. Additional wells must be drilled, often to depths of 8,000 feet or more, to flush salt-heavy water produced from the coalbed back underground.
Sources of drinking water no deeper than 400 feet have been badly polluted by water pumped from coalbeds and released at the surface. Local officials filed environmental lawsuits in Alabama this year over water handling procedures at several drilling sites in the Black Warrior basin, delaying drilling programs there. For this reason, ARCO, for one, halted its drilling program at 25 wells instead of completing the 100 wells it had planned.
Field stations are required to separate the water and methane that flow from the coal layer, as well as remove carbon dioxide from the methane. Pipeline companies limit carbon dioxide to 1 percent of a total natural-gas shipment because the molecule corrodes pipe. Before treatment, carbon dioxide levels in coalbed methane are as high as 15 percent. Pipelines for gathering the methane and connecting to lines operated by pipeline companies are another big expense.
 
$600 Million Tax Credit
 By all accounts, the drilling advances as well as the $3 billion invested in coalbed methane wells and related equipment would not have occurred without the special tax credit Congress approved in the 1980 Fuel Use Act. The credit amounts to a reduction in taxes on income from sales of coalbed methane. Congress recently estimated that the credit is worth $600 million for the years 1991 and 1992 combined.
Producers said the credit gave them the financial cushion to experiment and develop the technology for mining the coal gas. The credit was set to expire at the end of this year, but a two-year extension for all coalbed methane wells was included in the latest budget.
Before that extension, most analysts and producers anticipated a sharp decline in drilling in 1991 for coalbed methane. A resurgence is now expected in 1992.
"A lot of small companies now realize they have another two years" to organize and finance drilling programs, said G. Warfield Hobbs, a former Texaco geologist who specializes in the economics and financing of coalbed methane production. "It's going to grow exponentially."
Mr. Hobbs, managing partner of Ammonite Resources in New Canaan, Conn., estimated that 2,400 wells have been drilled for coalbed methane this year, or more than one-third of all natural gas wells drilled in the United States, at a cost of more than $1 billion. He said the amount of methane production should reach a trillion cubic feet a year, or double this year's rate, within a few years.
John E. Olsen, a natural gas analyst with the First Boston Corporation in Houston, said the effect of the tax credit for producers was that the break-even price of coalbed methane was 25 cents a thousand cubic feet, well below the approximately $2 a thousand cubic feet that buyers are paying at this time of year. (Coalbed methane sells for slightly less than other forms of natural gas.) And for the year, Mr. Olsen said, the tax incentive amounted to an after-tax benefit of $1.26 for every thousand cubic feet.
Among the major energy companies, Amoco, ARCO and Conoco had the most output from the two largest areas of coalbed methane production. All three were active in the San Juan Basin, and ARCO and Amoco had smaller drilling programs in the Black Warrior Basin.
Meridian Oil, a Houston-based unit of Burlington Resources, was one of the largest drillers in New Mexico. Smaller independents such as Devon Energy, Taurus Exploration, McKenzie Methane and Energen also were active in coalbed methane this year.
Many natural gas producers drilling in locations far removed from promising coalbed methane sites opposed the tax-credit extension. They blamed the subsidy for depressing market prices as more coalbed methane was produced, and fear the situation will worsen. Supporters of the subsidy countered that they shoulder the risk of huge losses if their coalbed projects yield little methane.
Mr. Hobbs said rising coalbed methane output, as well as new natural gas supplies coming on-line in the Arkoma Basin of Oklahoma and in the Mobile Bay field off Alabama, should keep natural gas prices from rising substantially for several years.
 
Cutting Prices
 Domestic producers have already lured some California customers away from Canadian producers by cutting prices on shipments that include large amounts of coalbed methane, Mr. Hobbs said. Canadian producers delivered 1.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to American customers last year, and many are concerned they will lose market share in California to marketers of coalbed methane from the San Juan Basin.
The American Gas Association, a trade group in Washington, estimates probable reserves of coalbed methane at 90 trillion cubic feet. The trade group estimates total probable reserves of all forms of natural gas in the United States at 796 trillion cubic feet. The United States consumed 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas last year.
"Most people agree that this is a large resource," said Dr. Wood of the Energy Information Administration. "It's a matter of whether it's economical to get it out of the ground. That in large part is dependent right now on the tax credit."

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
The Justin Battle: A Waiting Game

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
A COUPLE of years ago, the battle for Justin Industries would not have seemed very odd. Now it seems extraordinary.
Justin, based in Fort Worth, is a small conglomerate with its biggest interests in boots and bricks. It is run by John Justin, a 73-year-old former mayor of Fort Worth who has no desire to sell. 
 Mr. Justin is busy fighting a tender offer to buy most of the company's shares at $18 each, well above any price at which Justin has traded. The offer came from a group led by two 32-year-old men, one of them a former aide to Asher B. Edelman, the corporate investor and chairman of the Datapoint Corporation. For much of the financing, they are relying on a commitment from Paine Webber Inc. to sell bonds.
Before the "junk bond" market collapsed, such deals were common. But the conventional wisdom now is that they cannot be done, a belief that Mr. Justin has emphasized in letters to shareholders.
Barry S. Rosenstein, the former aide to Mr. Edelman, conceded that the takeover market had changed and that he feels a bit lonely. "We're the only financial tender out there now," he said in an interview. "I feel like a dinosaur." But he said he was confident that financing could be completed.
In fact, the tender offer, which has been pending since September, is little more than a sideshow. The real battle is likely to come at a shareholders meeting. Perhaps that will be in March, when the 1991 meeting is scheduled to be held. But it could be earlier, since a court may yet order a repeat of the 1990 meeting.
Last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that Justin had violated securities laws in failing to disclose before the 1990meeting that it had changed its bylaws to make it all but impossible for shareholders to throw out directors between annual meetings. That action, taken in November 1989 as the takeover effort was getting under way, was not disclosed until August. After a flurry of negative publicity, the board reversed its decision in September. Mr. Justin said that the failure to disclose was simply a "technical violation" of little importance.
But the judges did not order a new meeting; they only told a lower court judge to consider that issue. When the company announced that the court did not order the meeting, the shares promptly fell to as low as $12. But they recovered after the insurgents emphasized that the court was explicit in saying securities laws had been broken. On Monday, the shares closed unchanged, at $13.25 each, in over-the-counter trading.
Mr. Rosenstein's ally in the takeover attempt is Perry H. Sutherland, whose family controls the privately held Sutherland Lumber Southwest Inc., a Midwest retailer. The two men have acquired an 11.9 percent stake in Justin, just over one million shares, at an average price of more than $14. Mr. Rosenstein said they had spent another $2 million arranging financing and paying various fees, including legal fees.
While bank financing for most of the purchase seems secure, Paine Webber's "highly confident" letter for subordinated debt gives the firm the option to walk away for a variety of reasons, including "market conditions." But Mr. Rosenstein said that the deal would not be highly leveraged and emphasized that it did not rely on selling major assets of Justin. He said he was confident the money could be raised when needed.
Mr. Justin dismissed the $18 price as unreasonably low. "It is less than 1.5 times book value, and this company will sell for more than that," he forecast. He said that the Acme Brick business was doing well as the Texas economy started to revive, and that the boot business, based on the Justin, Nocona and Tony Lama brands, was "very good." In the first nine months of the year, Justin reported profits of $4.4 million, or 49 cents a share, on revenues of $208 million.
The Tony Lama business was bought by Justin after the first approach from Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Rosenstein, and was denounced by them as a "scorched earth" acquisition that had forced them to lower the price they could pay. But Mr. Justin said it was working out well, in part because Tony Lama no longer offers unreasonable credit terms that had "destabilized" the industry.
The tender offer is unlikely to go anywhere soon, if only because Mr. Justin, his board and his managers control 23 percent of the company, while an employee ownership plan holds 16 percent. That makes it almost impossible for the raiders to assemble the two-thirds of the shares they need to complete the deal.
But at an annual meeting, the group would only need a majority of the shares voting to replace the board, and Mr. Rosenstein said that goal is possible, although far from assured.
Anyway, he said, he and Mr. Sutherland are long-term investors who are prepared to wait and fight the battle with Mr. Justin over and over. "He can win 9 of 10 shareholder votes, and we win when we win that one," he said. "We've said to John, 'We've got 40 years on you. We can wait.' "
That wait, warned Mr. Justin, could be a long one. Although Mr. Rosenstein described Mr. Justin as being "in failing health," Mr. Justin said he was in "as good health as can be" and had no intention of retiring.

HEADLINE: Jump in Oil Profits Is Expected

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Many major oil companies will post sharply higher profits this quarter. Prices of crude oil and natural gas are far higher than they were last year, and fewer companies are likely to report big charges against earnings, as they did a year ago.
In fact, some companies may double their profits and touch off renewed charges of profiteering. But even with this strong fourth quarter, the industry will probably fall short of its expectations a year ago that it would increase earnings from operations by more than 10 percent in 1990. 
 "People will see in the fourth quarter what they had anticipated in the third quarter," said George F. Friesen, oil analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital Group in New York. "Earnings will be outstanding."
 
Crude Up by $10 a Barrel
 The big oil companies have sold crude at about $30 a barrel in the quarter, or $10 a barrel more than in the corresponding quarter a year ago. That is a 50 percent increase. Natural gas prices will average close to $2 per 1,000 cubic feet for the quarter, compared with $1.70 a year ago and $1.36 in the third quarter.
While gasoline has become slightly cheaper at the pump in the last two weeks, the wholesale price of gasoline has fallen faster, thanks to slowing demand from motorists and lower crude prices. Service stations, many of them owned by the oil companies, are restoring profit margins to what they were a year ago. After the Persian Gulf crisis began in August, these margins shrank as the retail price of gasoline rose more slowly than the price of crude.
 
Wholesale Prices Down
 According to Platt's Oilgram, gasoline retailers in the New York area paid an average of 68.9 cents a gallon for unleaded regular gasoline at wholesale last Wednesday, compared with a high of $1.002 on Oct. 17. In Los Angeles, the average wholesale price dropped to 65 cents a gallon last Wednesday; the high was $1.01 on Oct. 2. On average, motorists paid $1.37 a gallon for unleaded regular in the week ended Dec. 18, the American Automobile Association said.
Mr. Friesen said he expected a dozen international oil giants to report an average gain of 64 percent in overall profits this quarter. He completed his forecast last week. The same 12 companies posted a 17 percent decline in profits for the third quarter.
The results at some oil companies may be startling. Mr. Friesen estimated that profits at Chevron, British Petroleum, Phillips Petroleum, Texaco and Unocal will more than double in the current quarter from the 1989 quarter, excluding any special gains or write-offs.
That news could be so stunning, he warned, that some members of Congress might renew their attacks on the oil industry, accusing companies of profiting from the Persian Gulf crisis and high gasoline prices.
 
Some Earnings Declined
 Those complaints died down after the industry reported a wide range of financial results for the third quarter in October; earnings at some companies declined. An Energy Department investigation concluded early this month that the oil industry did not profit unfairly from the run-up in gasoline prices.
Percentage changes in quarterly net income can be complicated in the oil industry. Operating performance is often masked by gains or losses from sales of producing properties, by legal settlements and by charges against earnings for environmental expenses.
In the fourth quarter a year ago, for instance, ARCO reduced profits by adding $345 million to a reserve for future environmental expenses. Phillips Petroleum wrote off $280 million of its investment in the Point Arguello field off the Southern California coast, where an environmental dispute stalled production. Chevron wrote off $445 million for the same reason, plus $800 million in special charges.
Chevron said last week that it would take a special charge of approximately $220 million in the fourth quarter to reduce the recorded value of its fertilizer division. The company said in November it wanted to sell the unit. Thomas A. Petrie, chairman of Petrie, Parkman & Company, a Denver investment firm, said that while other write-downs were likely, the cumulative total would probably be far less than in the final quarter last year. "The integrated companies ought to do real well this quarter," he added.
Yet even such a strong finish to 1990 is not likely to fulfill the industry's widespread expectations last year that earnings from operations would increase by more than 10 percent this year. Production units suffered when oil prices fell below $15 a barrel in the spring, and chemical profits have been depressed because of slowing demand, flat prices and rising costs. Also, refining units now confront the same problems as chemicals after posting big gains in the third quarter.
 
Just a Few Percentage Points
 Charles T. Maxwell, senior energy strategist at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell in New York, said the industry would finish the year with a gain over 1989 of just a few percentage points in operations.
Dillard P. Spriggs, president of Petroleum Analysis Ltd., a research firm in New York, agreed. "Those who really took it on the chin in the third quarter, those heavily in chemicals, probably will do well to match last year," he said.
The higher crude costs after Iran's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 were accompanied by White House pressure to restrain gasoline price increases at the pump. The combination hurt profits in chemicals and refining and marketing operations.
 
Losses by Many Marketers
 Many gasoline marketers lost money in the third quarter. With President Bush and Congress warning against a surge in gasoline prices, big oil companies did not pass on the entire increase in crude and refining costs to motorists. They increased pump prices an average of 35 cents a gallon while crude costs rose by 60 cents at the refineries.
The result was third-quarter profits that surprised many analysts as well as industry critics. Many of the big integrated oil giants, like Mobil, Shell Oil and Exxon, reported no profit increases or declines for the period.
As the American economy slumps, these and other diversified oil companies still confront lower demand for gasoline and other refined products. Refiners have cut back output to below 84 percent of capacity, from 92 percent last summer. Companies that depend on that sector of the industry are showing strains. Ashland Oil, a large refiner, said last Friday that it expected a loss this quarter.
 
Drop in Premium-Grade Sales
 Since the Iraqi invasion, motorists are buying less premium-grade gasoline, a high-profit item for refiners. Premium-grade gasoline now accounts for only 17 percent of all retail gasoline sales. It was 24 percent a year ago.
Industry executives said last summer's surge in pump prices caused a sudden drop in overall demand. Gasoline sales amounted to 6.9 million barrels a day in the week ended Dec. 14, compared with 7.4 million barrels a year ago, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
Warm weather in November and the first three weeks of December also has hurt refiners, and helped homeowners, cutting into deliveries of home-heating oil. Inventories, which soared on fears of shortages and higher prices after the invasion, were 16.5 percent higher than they were this time last December, when a record cold wave swept much of the nation. Stocks in the week ended Dec. 14 totaled 132.6 million barrels, according to the institute.
 
Slide for Chemicals
 Chemical divisions also are in a slide. With sales flat or declining in the weak economy, most producers have been unable to raise their prices in step with their higher operating costs. Crude oil is a major expense. Even though crude prices have fallen since the peak at $40 in early October, the current price is substantailly higher than a year ago.
The world's oil storage tanks, terminals and tanker vessels are well stocked. Crude supplies are abundant. In response, the shares of oil companies have tumbled in the last two months. Mr. Maxwell, for one, said earnings of oil companies would be unchanged in 1991 from this year.
Many oil analysts expect crude prices to plunge to $15 or lower by spring if the Persian Gulf crisis ends peacefully and Iraq and Kuwait add as much as four million barrels a day of production to world supplies. The February crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange finished last week at $25.92 a barrel.
 
OPEC Impact Called Small
 Analysts said oil companies would not suffer much damage if the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, especially Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, keep a pledge made earlier this month to curb output. OPEC's new price target is $21 a barrel.
Many analysts expect crude to fall from an average of $25 in the first quarter to $19 next summer, then recover to more than $21 by the year's end. For now, investors are looking no farther than prospects for Mideast peace.

HEADLINE: Chinese Trade Practices Raising Concern in U.S.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
China's growing trade surplus with the United States, expected to be surpassed only by Japan's next year, is emerging as an important irritant in relations between the two countries.
Administration officials and some members of Congress say China's surplus, which is expected to overtake Germany's and Taiwan's, is in part a result of unfair trade practices. 
 The Americans complain that the Chinese are "dumping" products, or selling them at below cost, and are circumventing United States import quotas by shipping goods through other countries.
"The surpluses mean we're headed for trouble with our economic as well as political relations with China," said Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania.
"And when you engage in unfair trade practices, you lose friends fast," said Mr. Heinz, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade issues.
The growing trade gap is expected to figure prominently in the Congressional debate next year on trade with China. The issue before Congress is whether to strip China of commercial privileges and raise tariffs on billions of dollars of toys, apparel and other Chinese exports here. Chinese textiles represent one-fifth of its United States surplus, and China manufactures about half the toys imported by the United States.
Each June, China's "most favored nation" treatment, which keeps its tariffs as low as for most other countries, is subject to review by the President. President Bush decided this year to continue the special treatment.
On Oct. 18, the House, still mindful of the crushing of the democracy movement at Tiananmen Square in 1989, voted to punish Beijing by removing the trade privilege the Chinese have enjoyed since 1980. But , the House's 247-to-174 vote was short of the two-thirds that was needed to override the President's decision.
Next year, lawmakers say, the concern over trade surpluses and trade fairness could tilt the balance. Chinese surpluses have soared from $6 billion last year to an expected $11 billion this year, with Japan expected to come to more than $40 billion and Taiwan and Germany to around $12 billion each. Next year, a $15 billion surplus is forecast for China.
In an increasing number of cases, the Chinese are being accused of dumping, or selling exports below cost, in the United States in order to raise market share. Under American trade law, duties on dumped products can be raised to offset the unfair advantages.
A number of cases have been brought by the textile industry, which has taken the brunt of the Chinese export offensive. China shipped two billion square yards of textiles here last year -- everything from cotton nightwear to wool sweaters -- compared with 325 million square yards in 1980.
The textile industry has won dumping duties against products like cotton print cloth and industrial wiping cloths. Other dumping cases involved axes and sledgehammers and small electric fans.
 
Using Other Countries
 Textile industry and customs officials insist that the Chinese are circumventing American textile import quotas by moving goods to the United States through Macao, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries.
"In our opinion, the Chinese are engaged in massive quota fraud," said Carlos F. J. Moore, executive vice president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, an industry trade association.
What makes the issue potentially explosive is that China is one of the few remaining non-market economies. Far from reflecting a lack of American competitiveness or supply-and-demand forces of the marketplace, its trade surpluses result from targets, quotas, administrative guidance and other calculated decisions by Beijing authorities.
"This is somewhat alarming," noted Roger W. Sullivan, president of the United States-China Business Council, "because until recently, China was making the point that it was not a mercantilist nation and not seeking to pile up foreign exchange."
 
Restatement of Doctrine
 Mr. Sullivan, whose organization represents American companies doing business in China, said the change in Beijing's thinking could be seen in a recent statement by its Soviet-educated Prime Minister, Li Peng, that China's policy was not only to push exports but also to limit imports and bring in only necessary goods. In effect, it was a restatement of the old Communist doctrine of economic self-reliance.
Before the 1989 crackdown, more liberal policies had allowed for a rapid increase in imports and resulted in a large drain on hard currency reserves.
American officials say they have raised the issues of surpluses and trade unfairness in virtually all recent discussions with the Chinese.
The latest was a meeting in Washington on Dec. 10 and 11 of senior Chinese trade officials led by the Vice Minister for Trade, Gu Yongjiang, and Americans led by the Under Secretary of Commerce, J. Michael Farren.
 
Warning of Political Problem
 American officials say they warned the Chinese that the surpluses could become a significant political problem if not addressed.
"Our objective," said a senior Administration official, "is to get the Chinese to go back again to reforming their trading system toward more market-oriented operations."
American officials raised both the issues of creating trade surpluses -- through quotas, import substitution programs, export subsidies and other measures -- and of circumventing textile and apparel quotas through third countries.
Although the Chinese officials promised to investigate the accusations of irregularities, one American official said the Chinese were "not very sympathetic to our problem."
This official added, "They will pursue their interests and get away with anything they can."
Tien Mingwang, Minister Counselor at the Chinese Embassy here, denied that his Government was trying to create trade surpluses by closing its market to imports. He cited a special mission to the United States last October that bought $700 million of wheat, chemical fertilizers, timber, and other products.
"This was the first purchasing mission in our history," he said, adding that others may follow. "This is to show our desire for further expansion of imports from your country."
He said his Government would investigate all the trade accusations. "We would like to put the trade in textiles on a healthy basis," he stressed.

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 25

 BODY:
A majority of people surveyed in several European countries have a favorable view of Japan but say it is not fulfilling its international responsibilities, the Foreign Ministry reported today.
Among the chief criticisms was that Japan needs to correct its trade imbalance. But many respondents in the poll, the sixth conducted by Japan since 1977, said the creation of a single European market at the end of 1992 would improve relations between Japan and the European Community, the ministry said in a news release. 
 The survey was conducted from September through October by private research organizations in each of the countries surveyed: Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.
In all seven countries, "the degree of trust in Japan is rather high," ranging from 71 to 91 percent, the ministry said.
In every country except Italy, however, a majority of respondents said they thought Japan was not fulfilling its international role. Japan, the world's No. 2 economic power after the United States, has come under criticism for not doing more to assist forces in the Persian Gulf and to reduce its chronic trade surpluses.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RAISE DUE, BUT NOT FOR BUSH

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Federal workers everywhere, from Vice President Dan Quayle to the troops in the Persian Gulf to the groundskeepers at the White House, will get a raise next year.
There is one exception: President Bush. 
 The Presidential salary stays frozen at $200,000, where it has been for the last 22 years and five Administrations.
For several million rank-and-file workers, both military and civilian, the pay increase is a flat 4.1 percent. But thousands of top Federal executives are getting big raises, generally on the scale of $20,000 to $30,000, because of a 1989 law that lifted the lid on salaries.
Mr. Quayle's pay will increase to $160,600 from $124,000. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley get the same 29 percent increase. Cabinet salaries rise to $138,900 from $107,300.
The Constitution precludes increasing, or lowering, the President's salary while he is in office, so Mr. Bush has no immediate prospects of a raise.
 
'No Complaints' From Bush
 Mr. Bush has "no complaints," said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, adding: "He thinks his pay is adequate. The Presidency's still a pretty good job."
No one disputes that, but an expert panel that reviewed Government salaries two years ago recommended increasing the President's salary in 1993 to $350,000 plus a cost-of-living adjustment. Congress ignored the recommendation.
The consumer advocate Ralph Nader takes another view. Mr. Nader, who lobbied strenuously to block the raises, said the President should revoke the 1991 raises and cut his own pay "as a gesture to the American people at a time of considerable sacrifice for them."
"At a time of deficit and recession, he should set an example," Mr. Nader said.
Whatever the salary, the Presidency is rich in perquisites, from a fully-staffed mansion to the limousines, helicopters and Boeing 747 jumbo jet.
"The President probably gets the equivalent of another $500,000 in perks," said Lloyd N. Cutler, who was chairman of the 1989 Quadrennial Pay Commission. "The perks make up for an awful lot of salary."
Still, Mr. Cutler said, the President's salary is "way below what it ought to be."
If Mr. Bush's salary were commensurate to that of corporate chiefs and top lawyers, "I suppose you'd be over $1 million," Mr. Cutler said. "With present budget constraints, this President would never ask for a raise if he were going to run again."
 
'A Darn Good Salary'
 Fred Hohlweg, a pay expert with the Office of Personnel Management, said $200,000 "was a darn good salary" when it went into effect in 1969.
The Consumer Price Index has increased nearly fourfold since 1969. If the President's pay had kept pace, Mr. Bush would be drawing $730,000 a year. Put another way, $200,000 today barely buys what $55,000 did in 1969.
Walton R. Winder, a vice president of the Towers Perrin Company in New York, said the chief executives of the nation's 100 largest corporations averaged $1.3 million in cash compensation last year, more than five times their 1969 level.
Even top jobs at universities and nonprofit organizations pay more than the Presidency, Mr. Winder said.
Vice Presidents, on the other hand, have never had it so good.
When the first Congress fixed George Washington's salary at the kingly sum of $25,000 in 1789, the lawmakers allotted $5,000 for Vice President John Adams -- 20 percent of the President's salary.
When Mr. Bush became Vice President, he was earning less than 40 percent of Ronald Reagan's salary as President.
But by the time Mr. Bush turned the job over to Mr. Quayle, it paid $115,000. Mr. Quayle got a $9,000 raise earlier this year and starting Jan. 1 he will be earning barely 20 percent less than Mr. Bush.
The first 17 Presidents got the same $25,000 salary that Washington received. Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President, got a $25,000 raise that doubled the salary to $50,000 in 1873 for his second term.
 
Slugger and the President
 In 1909, Congress voted another $25,000, raising the salary to $75,000 when William Howard Taft took office as the 27th President. It remained there for the next 40 years.
In 1930, when Babe Ruth signed an $80,000-a-year contract with the New York Yankees, the slugger was asked if he thought he should be paid more than President Herbert Hoover.
"Why not?" Ruth replied. "I had a better year than he did."
Harry S. Truman, the 33d President, became the first $100,000-a-year President in 1949. Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson drew the same salary, but that doubled to $200,000 in 1969 when Richard M. Nixon took office.

John Duffy was composing incidental music for Shakespeare plays and television films 16 years ago when he came up with a way to help other composers make connections with potential audiences and collect fees at the same time. With a $54,000 grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, he made an offer to concert promoters around the state: If they programmed contemporary works, they could have the composers -- famous ones as well as fledglings -- on hand to explain their pieces.
Mr. Duffy called his project Meet the Composer, and it took him three months to give away that first bankroll. But two years later, he was helping to start Meet the Composer affiliates in other states. Since then, the organization, of which Mr. Duffy is president, has grown prodigiously. Besides its original Composers Performance Fund program, which sponsors about 8,000 performances a year, Meet the Composer has underwritten composer-in-residence posts at 32 American orchestras. 
 And in 1988 it began a $600,000-a-year consortium program under which several ensembles join to commission new works, thus guaranteeing them multiple performances.
"There was a tremendous gulf between concertgoers and composers," Mr. Duffy said of the early days of Meet the Composer. "So when an opportunity to help other composers came up, I knew very clearly what needed to be done. I also knew that our success had to be clear within the first few months, to show that there was a demand for the kind of organization I had in mind."
All told, the organization hands out about $2.5 million a year, of which 43 percent, by Mr. Duffy's calculations, goes to women and minorities, with around a third going to jazz composers. Among the recent products of the program are Hannibal Peterson's "African Portraits," an exploration of African and black American musical styles, which was given its premiere by the American Composers Orchestra last month, and Julius Hemphill's "Long Tongues: A Saxophone Opera," which had its New York premiere at the Apollo Theater three weeks ago.
 
Composing for Students
 In June, the organization awarded $400,000 in grants to 22 composers and 20 choreographers for new dance works. It has started an educational program, in which composers visit schools and compose works for the students to play. It also publishes two free handbooks, "Commissioning Music" and "Composers in the Marketplace: How to Earn a Living Writing Music." And it has recently started a jazz-commissioning program.
"One of our original tenets was that our grants would represent the whole gamut of music -- symphonic, jazz, chamber, theater and experimental," Mr. Duffy said. "Our first six grants, in fact, went to jazz composers. And we have always encouraged people to look out for women and minority composers.
"We don't beat people over the head with it. But there is a lot of stereotypical thinking out there, some of it in surprising places. For years, the Women's Hall of Fame, in Seneca Falls, would apply to Meet the Composer for grants, but always to commission a male composer. One year they called, and I said: 'Look, it's odd to have a women's organization always commissioning music from a man. What about a woman?' We sent them a list of women composers, with addresses, and they began looking at scores and listening to tape. From then on, they considered women composers.
"There have also been times we've suggested to community groups that present chamber music that they try a jazz composer. In most cases, people just haven't thought of it. They think that when you say Meet the Composer, it means 'serious' music, in quotes. They don't think about the fact that what Ornette Coleman does is composition. We like to enlighten people."
 
The Art of Finding Money
 Meet the Composer has had a way of finding the money to support its ambitions. Even now, when many arts organizations are feeling a financial pinch, Meet the Composer seems scarcely affected. In July, it received a $2 million grant from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund to cover four years of consortium commissions.
The organization has also received grants from the Ford Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Rockefeller Foundation and A.T. & T. in recent years. And it gets nearly $500,000 a year from the National Endowment for the Arts.
Its substantial budget notwithstanding, Mr. Duffy sees Meet the Composer as a grass-roots organization. In 1976, he encouraged regional groups to form Meet the Composer affiliates by giving them annual grants of $15,000. The first year, that amount was to represent 75 percent of their grant budgets. The second year, it was to represent 50 percent, and the third year 25 percent. Affiliates' budgets thereby grew from $20,000 to $60,000 in three years.
"Setting up the affiliates was like peopling the earth with composers," Mr. Duffy said. "We didn't want to seem like carpetbaggers. We just wanted to spread the good word. And we made sure that affiliates had grass-roots connections, were evangelical in their zeal, and stressed commissions, collaborations and giving young composers a chance. Our rule was that 60 percent of the affiliates' grants had to be for local composers, so that all the money didn't go to East Coast and West Coast composers.
"We've learned interesting things from the affiliates. We learned, for example, that in the Midwest, a lot of composers earn a living writing liturgical music. That's hardly the case in Manhattan."
 
Composers in Residence
 Mr. Duffy has dreamed up new programs for Meet the Composer every few years. One of the first, the Composer-in-Residence Program, started in 1982, has become one of the organization's most visible endeavors, partly because the works the composers write during their three-year residencies are recorded by Nonesuch Records. Besides writing for the orchestras with which they are associated, the composers in the program advise music directors on contemporary programming. But the program is by design to end in 1992.
"My thought -- and this may have been a misjudgment -- was that if in 10 years the orchestras had not taken on the program themselves, then we've missed the boat," Mr. Duffy said. "We have always thought of this as a self-destructing program. What we're aiming for now is to raise money and to help orchestras endow permanent chairs for resident composers."
The Jazz Program, which Meet the Composer started last year with $250,000 in grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and A.T. & T., was meant to address such a need. Jazz composers have also been elegible for grants from the organization's other programs, but Mr. Duffy felt that they needed special encouragement. The first set of jazz grants went to 18 musicians. Among the recipients are Geri Allen, Leroy Jenkins, Henry Threadgill, Butch Morris, Oliver Lake, Stanley Cowell and Benny Carter.
"Most jazz composers that I've spoken with and worked with want opportunities to work in larger forms," Mr. Duffy said. "They have seen Aaron Copland writing film scores, and Philip Glass writing symphonic works. Yet those opportunities are not open to jazz composers. Of course, writing for orchestra presents certain problems for jazz composers. What do you do about improvisation? What it takes for them to solve these problems is a residency with the group they're writing for. They get to know the players and the institution, and solutions emerge."
"When we started," Mr. Duffy added, "I would never have dreamed that we would make the progress we have. We've come through periods when funding has been cut and when there were economic disasters in the country, but we seem to have been blessed. We have built up tremendous loyalty in the field. And by bringing composers and audiences together, we have come a long way in banishing the idea that the composer is someone above the crowd, or someone who wore a wig and has been dead for a long time. We started in the 1970's with young composers who are now on their feet. Now we're starting with a new bunch, and we're hoping to open the same kinds of doors for them."

HEADLINE: For Movie Theaters, a Bad Big Year

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 25

 BODY:
When the movie industry tallies the final box-office gross for 1990, the total figure will be more than $4.7 billion, making this year the second best in Hollywood history, nearly as good as last year. So why are the owners of many of the country's 23,000 movie theaters singing the blues?
Their dissatisfaction, which reflects the figures now appearing on some annual profit-and-loss statements, has less to do with overall revenues than with how box-office receipts are split between the companies that make movies and those that exhibit them. Though nine movies have earned more than $100 million at the box office this year, a combination of too many theaters and too few films with staying power means that many exhibitors are experiencing a profit squeeze and, in some cases, even recording losses. 
 This month, prospects have improved somewhat with the release of a slew of films banking on prestige or star appeal, such as "The Godfather Part III," "Awakenings," "The Russia House," "Kindergarten Cop" and "The Sheltering Sky." But those movies appear to have come too late, too closely bunched together and at too high a price to reverse the slide.
 
Hoping for Longevity
 Typically, studios and other film distributors can expect a 70 percent share of what a movie grosses during its opening week, with the remainder going to the exhibitor. That scale then descends gradually, so that by the time a hit movie is in its 10th or 12th week at a theater, the exhibitor will be turning over only 25 or 30 percent to the distributor.
"The longer a picture plays, the higher the percentage the exhibitor keeps," said William F. Kartozian, the president of the National Association of Theater Owners. "If a picture turns over at a rapid rate, the exhibitor is always paying the highest rate, and that's pretty much what happened in the summer."
Even a much anticipated box-office hit like "The Godfather Part III," which opened at 1,800 theaters today, may not alleviate the situation, because of the stiff terms being negotiated. Exhibitors complain that Paramount Pictures is demanding that they make a 12-week commitment, with Paramount getting 70 percent of the box office the first 2 weeks, 60 percent for the next 2, and 50 percent for another 2.
Both theater owners and studio executives like nothing better than a movie that has "legs," or the ability to bring audiences into a theater week after week. This year, however, only a handful of movies, most notably such sleeper hits as "Ghost," "Pretty Woman," and, more recently, "Home Alone" and "Dances With Wolves" have demonstrated that kind of durability.
 
Blaster After Blaster
 In contrast, the expensive action-adventure pictures that had been expected to dominate the summer season and had been the object of spirited bidding by exhibitors, including "Days of Thunder," "Robocop 2," "Dick Tracy" and "Another 48 Hours," showed little staying power. Throughout June and July, one "body count" movie after another was released, making a big splash its opening weekend and then being overtaken a week later by the latest entry.
"This summer, one A picture after another performed the way that a horror or exploitation film typically would," said an executive at one major independent production company here. "They would do a ton of business the first week and then plummet 40 to 50 percent. It was two, three or four weeks, and out, which really hurt the exhibitors."
In addition, film exhibitors have found their bargaining power weakened by a decade-long expansion in the construction of theaters, which has pushed the total number of movie screens in the United States from 17,095 in 1979 to 23,129 by 1988, according to the National Association of Theater Owners. With big mortgages and other loans to pay back, those newcomers have sought to compete aggressively with existing outlets, paying top dollar for films they think will pull in moviegoers, whose numbers have not grown significantly.
The prosperous west side of Los Angeles offers a dramatic example of that tendency. In the last 3 years, 3 new complexes with 17 screens have opened just in Santa Monica, pushing the total there to 23 screens, all of them hungry to attract audiences with first-run feature hits.
 
Distributors Take Advantage
 Film distributors have been quick to take advantage of that situation. "This summer, I was getting over 50 percent of the aggregate gross on some of my pictures, which was something new for me," said one industry executive who specializes in distribution. "When that happens on picture after picture, it very rapidly goes to the exhibitors' bottom line."
The upper hand enjoyed by distributors stands in contrast to the recent past, when the balance of power often favored the film exhibitor, especially in smaller areas where there was little competition or cities where a single chain dominated the market.
"There are no more monopolies, and the distributor welcomes that," said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which monitors and compiles box-office data. "All you have to do now is walk across the street and sell to the opposition."
Several of the country's largest theater chains have found themselves squeezed as a result. The General Cinema Corporation, which operates some 1,500 screens around the country, last week reported a $9.8 million operating loss for its theater operations during the third quarter of 1990 and a 42 percent overall decline in profits during its fiscal year ending Oct. 31.
Richard A. Smith, the chairman of the company, said the disappointing results reflected "somewhat weaker film product, particularly during the important summer season." At the same time, he noted in a statement to shareholders, "operating expenses were significantly higher, however, due to increased occupancy costs for newer theaters and higher film costs."
 
Event That Didn't Happen
 Movie industry executives here said General Cinema, in a decision typical of what has befallen exhibitors this year, had bet heavily that the Walt Disney Company 's "Dick Tracy," starring Warren Beatty, Madonna and Al Pacino, would be the "event" movie of 1990, as "Batman" had been the summer before. But after a strong opening weekend in which it earned $22.5 million at the box office, "Dick Tracy" quickly tailed off, grossing $104 million before moving into video this month.
Difficulties for exhibitors have also been deepened by an overall decline in moviegoing, which is masked by increases in ticket prices that account for growing movie revenues. Hollywood studio executives said they expected ticket sales for 1990 to drop about 5 percent from 1989's figure of 1.13 billion, which was virtually the same as the total 10 years earlier.
Any downturn in attendance is bothersome for another reason: it means less popcorn, soda and candy, sources of revenue that might compensate somewhat for stiffer film rental terms, are being bought. "When you don't have people coming through the turnstiles, your concession sales are not going to be as good," said Peter Farwell, vice president for corporate relations for General Cinema.
At this juncture, a Christmas season even busier than usual is not expected to provide much financial relief for exhibitors. Though an unusually large number of quality movies are being released this month, many are expected to fall victim to the same "churn" effect that crippled most big budget films this summer.
 
Too Much for Too Much
 "There's too much out there," Mr. Krier said. "People don't have enough time and money to see them all."
Several theater chains seem to think one partial solution to the problem is to suspend their ambitious construction programs and shut a few of their existing theaters in areas that have too many. Several major Hollywood studios have also announced plans to increase production, which would be another important step toward restoring a balance between supply and demand.
"There are certain rules of economics that pertain to theaters as much as to gasoline stations or supermarkets," Mr. Kartozian said. "In some years the distributor is favored, in others it is the exhibitor. The pendulum always swings in this business, and this situation is not necessarily going to be long lasting."

HEADLINE: A New Year's Fete Of Art, Not Alcohol

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
FROM Boston to Calgary to Honolulu, more than a million Americans and Canadians are expected on New Year's Eve to ring out the traditional celebration of booze, noisemakers and hangovers and ring in Mozart, ballet performances and a wide selection of popular entertainment from rock 'n' roll to reggae to hula dancing.
Fifty-five cities in the United States and Canada will serve up performing arts and family entertainment as nonalcoholic alternatives to the carousing and midnight countdowns and fleets of intoxicated drivers who make the night one of the deadliest on American roads. 
 In some respects it is an extension of a new militancy against public and private drinking, drunken driving and hazardous holiday risk-taking like fireworks on the Fourth of July and trick-or-treating on Halloween.
But more than that, the multicultural events seek to accomplish what is not supposed to be possible in many cities: a drawing together of diverse crowds after dark in downtown areas, reaffirming a community spirit through the celebration of the arts.
The idea started 15 years ago in Boston, where the streets have filled on recent New Year's Eves with as many as 500,000 people. Encouraged by that's city's experience with peaceful, festive crowds, the idea began to spread in the 1980's to other communities.
"New Year's Eve is the safest night of the year in Boston," said Zeren Earls, director of First Night Boston, the nonprofit organizing force behind Boston's celebration and others elsewhere that are based on the Boston model.
This year First Night Boston will feature more than 1,000 artists performing at 41 indoor and 18 outdoor sites along a wide corridor in the heart of the city.
"People are in the best mood, walking the city streets with their children, taking in everything from inner-city rap groups to Handel and Haydn," Ms. Earls said.
Others derive a benefit about as rare in some metropolitan areas as chamber music in a fast-food outlet: a revived sense of community.
"When we started First Night Montclair three years ago, I was amazed by the sight of people discovering it was all right to talk with strangers on the streets of their town," said Gerald Fierst of Montclair, N.J., a community of 36,500 about 15 miles west of New York City. "In modern America we've lost many of our rituals and on New Year's Eve we're attempting to create one of a community at peace as we go into the future together," said Mr. Fierst, a professional storyteller who spins fables for children on New Year's Eve.
A Montclair neighbor, Lucretia Robinson, sees a combination of trends behind the enthusiasm, the anti-drunken-driving movement being just one of them.
"In the past parents were forced to decide between having 'a good time' or staying at home with their children and watching the Times Square ball go down at midnight on television," she said. "And the economy is forcing a change in attitude that excesses like two Porsches in every garage is a terrible value, and that the conviviality and closeness of family-centered and community activities are more meaningful."
In a city like New York, where homelessness, crime and other intractible urban ills have enshrined a streetwise dictum -- "never make eye contact with a stranger" -- into a daily way of life, opportunities to cross the barriers of silent alienation often seem available only to dog-walkers and those in movie lines.
Midtown Manhattan, with its theater, nightlife and other cultural offerings, is not like other cities in which downtown life ceases after 7 P.M. But the annual Times Square crush, with its accompanying drinking and rowdyism, is the essence of what the First Night movement hopes to offer as an alternative elsewhere, said Ms. Earls of First Night Boston. So far, no one has sought to establish something like it in New York, she said, but First Night has taken root in the region in Montclair, Hartford, Stamford, Conn., Albany and Buffalo.
"There's a hunger everywhere for this kind of expression, but people are at a loss at how to go about creating it," said Philip Slater, a writer and social critic in Santa Cruz, Calif.
Michael Lears, director of the American Studies Department at Rutgers University, said: "Coming out into the streets to celebrate together sounds like a very European way of doing things. Americans have spent so much time escaping from their community by locking themselves up at night with television sets and VCR's that we've created a global village but lost a local one."
The First Night movement, which added 20 cities in the past year alone, has been set in motion chiefly by nonpolitical groups. In most communities the effort was spearheaded by local arts councils, newspapers, civic-minded individuals or merchant associations. In Dayton, Ohio, it came to life under the auspices of the Alzheimer's Association.
"I liked the focus of shifting away from alcohol to the arts," said Merry Lee Corwin, the force behind First Night Honolulu, which is holding its inaugural effort Dec. 31 and is expected to draw 100,000 celebrants.
Ms. Corwin got $150,000 in seed money from the Hawaiian Community Foundation, a cultural group, to set up an office, and another $100,000 from local businesses. In addition, $5 buttons that provide adult admission to all 30 performance sites on New Year's Eve from mid-afternoon to midnight are being sold and Ms. Corwin said she hopes that organizers will sell 30,000. All programs are free to children.
For that $5 a button holder can choose from a luau of concerts and acts ranging from Ballet Hawaii, the Maui Dance Company and a reworking of Shakespeare's "Merry Wives of Windsor" to a Hungarian dance troupe, circus performers, a Japanese ceremonial drummer, Samoan choirs and a master Chinese noodle maker. The evening ends at midnight with a fireworks display.
Many smaller cities do not have the backing of large companies. Consequently, most First Night celebrations in New England suffered deficits last year when bad weather descended on the region and button sales plunged.
The recession in New England has squeezed business contributions this year. In addition, state budget-slashing has sharply reduced public arts grants to the celebrations. In New Haven, the First Night celebration was canceled when only $12,000 in contributions was collected by October to meet a $130,000 budget.
While some communities like Princeton, N.J., hold arts-related New Year's Eve activities, they are outside the alliance started by First Night Boston. Now known as First Night International, the alliance charges a one-time fee, ranging from $500 to $1,500, for use of the copyrighted name First Night, and sets a number of rules.
A participating city agrees to stage a celebration that is focused on the arts and multicultural expressions of the community. Local artists are to outnumber those imported for the day; the event should be affordable to families, extra attention must be given to the needs of children and teen-agers and alcohol consumption is discouraged. Profanity and sexual references by the performers are banned.
Winning the participation of a wide range of racial and ethnic groups in a community requires aggressive marketing, Ms. Earls said.
Charles R. Stith, pastor of the black congregation at Union United Methodist Church of Boston, said New Year's Eve was one of the few opportunities outside of sporting events that offered community-wide participation in a racially divided city. On Dec. 31 his church will open its doors for a program of gospel music.
"I don't think the outreach or the participation has been as extensive as any of us would like, but First Night does cut across color lines," Mr. Stith said. "It represents an opportunity -- tragically one of the few opportunities -- to bring people together. It's a great way for any community in the country to begin a new year."

HEADLINE: Help Moscow's Reformers -- Soon

 BODY:
The West's leading financial institutions called last week for radical reform of the Soviet economy -- but without massive aid from the West. That's a cautious stance, endorsed by President Bush, and guaranteed to protect Western leaders from ridicule should perestroika fail.
But it's too cautious by half. The Soviets are engaged in a ferocious political battle between reformers and reactionaries, between those who seek decentralized markets and political democracy and those who seek to preserve centralized control. As Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze warned last week when he resigned, the reactionaries may be gaining the upper hand. 
 If that's so it becomes all the more important for the West to tip the scales in favor of the reformers with the promise of aid, conditioned upon further reforms. By pledging tens of billions to back up reform, the West risks only a pittance of its collective wealth. By withholding the aid, it risks immeasurably more.
In a major report, the International Monetary Fund and three other Western financial institutions made a shocking disclosure: living standards in the Soviet Union are only a tenth as high as in the United States, and closer to Costa Rica than Western Europe. Unless there's a radical turnabout, the economy will probably shrink an additional 10 percent this year and next.
The study calls on the Soviets to decontrol prices, liberalize trade, privatize enterprises, control wages and cut budget deficits. In the short run, each of these policies would prove painful, driving up inflation and unemployment. The study adocates technical assistance to help the Soviets construct, seemingly overnight, the institutions that developed over hundreds of years in the West: enforceable contracts, property rights, accounting standards, private banks and stock markets.
Technical assistance is important. But it's not nearly enough. The Soviet economy is collapsing, and economic reform threatens the livelihoods of millions of families. Unless displaced workers are offered assistance, radical reform will never begin. That's why Western money is essential, and why it can't wait until reforms become fact.
President Bush has offered the Soviets food and medical aid and "associate" status in the I.M.F. and World Bank. Food and medicine are crucial. But by denying the Soviets full membership, Mr. Bush cuts them off from large loans. Here again, caution is unnecessary, even shortsighted. Membership in the the I.M.F. and World Bank has drawn centralized economies closer to the West, notably in China during the 1980's before Tiananmen Square.
The power of this economic lever was confirmed by a surprising source when the chairman of the Soviet intelligence agency, K.G.B., warned last week that accepting Western economic aid threatened to impose an alien capitalist outlook.
The West does not need to choose between unconditional bailout and passivity. It can promise the Soviets assistance, withdrawing the offer if the Soviets renege on the reforms outlined in the I.M.F. study. But if the West waits, it will undermine reformers faced with a scary traverse from the certainty of centralized control to the seeming chaos of markets. A promise of substantial aid, conditioned upon steady progress, could remove the fear and make the traverse possible.

HEADLINE: Heading for a Deep Recession?

BYLINE: By Rudolph G. Penner; Rudolph G. Penner, director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1983 to 1987, is a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I fondly retain my WIN button. It symbolizes President Gerald Ford's 1974 campaign against inflation (Whip Inflation Now), which I played a bit part in organizing. It also represents the worst economic forecast of the 1970's.
At the inflation summits of September 1974, no economists warned of a serious recession ahead. Yet, within two months it became apparent that the economy was in free fall. Ultimately, the gross national product suffered what is still the largest peak-to-trough decline since the 30's. 
 There are eerie similarities between 1974 and 1990. Then as now, the economy had recently experienced an oil shock, although the shock of 1973-74 was far greater than that recently imposed by Saddam Hussein. Then as now, the Federal Reserve adamantly fought inflation until the eve of the recession. Then as now, economists claimed that inventories were not excessive.
Only later did it become apparent that the inventory data was of terrible quality, and that economists had been misled. Could it be that economists now -- a majority of whom are forecasting a mild recession -- are also being misled?
Inventory data were improved significantly after the 1974 fiasco. But data collecting agencies have been squeezed by the budget battles of the 1980's. In a recent survey conducted by the newsletter Blue Chip Economic Indicators, 76 percent of the economists responding felt that the Government's statistics had deteriorated over the last decade. Since the quality of data was pretty bad 10 years ago, that is truly frightening.
While the composition of the economy has changed significantly, our statistical techniques have not. Important data on payroll employment are particularly suspect. A month ago it was reported that employment in October fell by 68,000. This month, that October number was revised to a decline of 178,000. That is a large change, big enough to have altered the attitudes of the Federal Reserve and other policy makers.
The cost of improving the accuracy of such data is trivial compared with the economic losses that can ensue if we do not make the effort. To its credit, the Bush Administration has advocated greater spending for statistical agencies, but much more has to be done.
I do not mean to imply that economists armed with better data will suddenly become brilliant forecasters. No amount of good data will allow us to forecast a Persian Gulf crisis, which will have a crucial impact on the economy in 1991.
More important, the nuances of human behavior are never easily captured by the statistical equations used by economic forecasters, regardless of the quality of the data available. Therefore, good data will not insure good forecasts. But bad data can cause some bad ones.
Even with good data, there is an inherent tendency, as we enter a recession, for forecasts to understate the impending troubles. Paul Samuelson has quipped that economists can at best forecast minus one month. That may be optimistic, because of the problems we have figuring out what happened last month.
Recessions seldom look as serious at the beginning as they do at the end. It is the cumulative changes in human behavior as the recession unfolds that kill you, and they develop differently in each downturn. This recession has the shadow of war hanging over it, and we can't know how that will affect the decisions of consumers and investors.
In November and December of 1974, as it became obvious that the economy was collapsing, economists scrambled to ratchet down their forecasts. This year, with weekly announcements of new and more ominous data, a similar but less intense scramble seems under way. That implies to me that this recession will not be as severe as 1974's. But, then, who am I to know? I rely on the same data and techniques as everyone else.

HEADLINE: Magnetic Trains Offer Environmental Benefits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As the inventors of superconducting magnetically levitated trains and holders of the original 1968 patent, we wish to comment on "Doubts About Magnetic Train Mount" (letter, Dec. 3) by Marjorie and James Young. Our published designs have formed the basis for the levitation and propulsion systems in the Japanese superconducting maglev project the Youngs discuss, as acknowledged by its developers.
The Youngs state that maglev consumes at least three times as much energy per passenger mile as Japan's bullet high-speed rail train. However, their comparisons reflect totally different conditions. The Japanese maglev trains will travel at 300 miles per hour in tunnels where air drag effects are large, while the bullet trains travel at 140 m.p.h. in the open air. Sixty percent of the proposed Tokyo-Osaka maglev route is in tunnels because of the mountainous terrain. This new route represents a social decision by the Japanese to open previously undeveloped portions of their crowded country.
When traveling under similar conditions -- at the same speed and both in tunnels or both in open air -- maglev passengers use much less energy per passenger mile than high-speed rail passengers. This is because maglev vehicles are much lighter than high-speed rail trains, and there is no mechanical friction with the track.
The Youngs also do not compare maglev with auto and air travel. Maglev at 300 m.p.h. uses half the primary thermal energy per passenger mile that 60 m.p.h. autos do, and only a quarter of that used by airplanes. United States transport energy use would be considerably reduced by shifting to maglev. Moreover, maglev does not use oil fuel, but electricity from clean coal, hydro, solar or nuclear power.
The Youngs are wrong in stating that maglev cannot carry freight. Maglev could readily and economically transport most of the United States truck-type freight, in addition to passengers. Maglev forces are distributed over a large area on the guideway, and there is no mechanical contact; thus maintenance requirements are very low, even if freight is carried. In contrast, carrying freight on high-speed rail trains would quickly wear out and destroy the precisely positioned tracks from the constant heavy pounding. Even carrying passengers, high-speed rail tracks require a large maintenance force.
As for the health effects of magnetic fields, maglev can be designed so that passengers experience a constant magnetic field of the same strength -- about 1/2 gauss -- as all life forms evolved in and are exposed to on earth. Passengers in electrified rail trains typically experience strong magnetic fields that alternate at power-line frequencies. Such alternating fields are of potentially much greater concern.
Maglev, if it is implemented, will have enormous environmental, safety and economic benefits. It can greatly reduce pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, provide greater and safer mobility at lower cost, and reduce dependence on foreign oil. If we are to improve our environment and living standards, we must bring forward new technologies to solve our crisis problems.

HEADLINE: MAGNETIC TRAINS OFFER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS;
Cannot Be Ignored

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The doubts about magnetic levitation train technology in Marjorie and James Young's Dec. 3 letter seem more like arguments for a maglev research program than against one. Possible hazards of electromagnetic radiation are one problem that must be thoroughly studied and addressed by shielding or some other method.
The comparison with the Japanese bullet train (shinkansen) by power per passenger is misleading. The bullet train achieves a high rating in this category because hefty employees shove 300 passengers into cars designed for 100.
True, passengers will not be allowed to stand in the aisles of a maglev vehicle going 300 miles per hour. But speed is a necessity, and becoming more so, because of the trend toward lighter-weight, more valuable cargoes and the increasing value of people's time. William B. Johnston of the Hudson Institute has observed that "In our future transportation needs, the rising importance of time stands out as the single most important and most overlooked issue."
The expense of maglev research and development is justified by its enormous potential. Intercity transport in the United States for trips of up to 400 miles consists of fuel-inefficient jet flights and even more inefficient auto trips. The short flights clog up the airspace at hub airports, which are on the verge of a congestion crisis; the autos jam highways and befoul the air. Maglev can replace many jet flights and car trips, relieving both air and highway congestion, while also eliminating a great deal of petroleum use.
Add to that the opportunity to develop and build an emerging technology that could revitalize our laboratories, universities and economy as the space race did in the 1960's, and it is evident that maglev simply cannot be ignored.

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Year: Dreams Delayed By Fiscal Slump

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
One year ago on a crisp New Year's morning, David N. Dinkins took the oath of office as Mayor of New York City saying, "I recognize that we cannot do everything we should, that our finances may get worse before they get better, that for now our dreams are bigger than our budget."
Today the Dinkins administration is struggling with fiscal problems far deeper than the new Mayor imagined, and its daily challenge is to hold the line, to minimize the pain of layoffs of city workers and deep cuts in services. What dreams it has time for are of an eventual upturn in the city's economy. 
 If there is a thread that runs through Mr. Dinkins's first year in office, it may be deferred dreams, dashed expectations and daunting problems. His overwhelming challenge, he acknowledged in an interview last week, has been to deal with the city's worsening economy, with all that means for the quality of life in the city and for his own standing with his liberal coalition.
 
'It's Beyond Dreams'
 The candidate who campaigned on a platform "that government should be an agent for change, that government can't afford to stand on the sidelines," is doing his best to keep his city's government from changing too much -- for the worse. Mr. Dinkins's closest advisers acknowledge that improvements must be measured around the edges, and even some of those efforts may be delayed by budget constraints.
"It's beyond dreams," said Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "It's doing the things you never dreamed you'd have to do. It's not a question of all the good things you won't get to do; it's the bad things you do have to do."
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, a longtime Dinkins supporter, said: "It has been an extraordinarily difficult time for this administration to go through the usual difficult times that each new administration faces. When the ground under you is constantly in motion, when the doorway keeps getting shorter and narrower, it's quite likely that there will be lots of visible bumps, and I think we've seen most of them."
Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, "It's sort of ironic that David Dinkins, considering his platform and commitment to so many things, is becoming most of all an expert on austerity."
The Mayor who won with broad union support granted the teachers' union a 5.5 percent raise but may now have to lay off 20,000 city workers to help close looming budget gaps. After vowing to be the toughest mayor on crime, he has struggled for an ambitious program to hire more police.
As Manhattan Borough President, he issued a report called "A Shelter Is Not a Home," but as Mayor, he has had to delay efforts to close big shelters because there is not enough permanent housing. He has dedicated his administration to children, and insisted on including some education and youth programs in his anti-crime plan. But he has also ordered cuts in the education budget that will affect classroom teaching.
And he has been the target of critics who have questioned everything from his competence to his clothing, from his willpower to his wisdom. Friends and opponents have suggested by turns that he was too slow, too soft, too stubborn, too sanguine, too snooty.
In some quarters, expectations for the city's first black mayor were so low that he was praised extravagantly for required acts, like balancing his first budget, while other expectations were so high that he was faulted for failing to resolve thorny disputes, like the black-led boycott of two Korean-American groceries in Brooklyn.
 
'A Mixed Report Card'
 "It's a mixed report card," said Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the Health and Hospital Workers Union and a major backer who helped persuade Mr. Dinkins to run for mayor. "On the one hand, I believe that he has brought to the city a sense of calmness in the decision-making process, and we don't have what we used to have with Ed Koch, the instantaneous reaction to almost every single event that was taking place in the city, and that sometimes exacerbated the tensions."
"On the other hand," Mr. Rivera added, "he has seemed kind of indecisive. There is a growing perception among the people in labor that he's paying too much attention to the Wall Street community and the bond raters and not enough to the working people of New York."
Douglas H. Lasdon, executive director of the Legal Action Center for the Homeless, sees a lack of imagination.
"There's a sense of vision, or courage or bold and creative ideas that is missing," Mr. Lasdon said. "I think when presented with alternative ideas, he can pick the decent idea. But they haven't come up with anything bold, and there are plenty of ideas out there and not all of them cost money."
By the same token, Mr. Lasdon said, the Mayor "has taken progressive, smart and energetic people and hired them in key places, and that difference for us means that we can have civil and constructive negotiations with them." He added, however, "it doesn't translate into anything because the big ideas have to come from the top."
The Mayor's chief political aide, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, said he was as disappointed as anyone that so many of Mr. Dinkins's goals had had to be deferred. "We were hoping we could have the same level of resources that our predecessor had to work with and try to implement some of the Mayor's programs," he said.
Mr. Dinkins himself said, "There are many more things that I'd hoped to accomplish, especially in the area of human services, that just plain cost money."
But he and Mr. Lynch say that the administration is not trying to please the financial community at the expense of other constituents.
"It isn't like currying favor," Mr. Lynch said. "Their confidence in the administration has an impact on our ability to sell bonds, and if our rating is lowered, that can have a tremendous impact on revenues because we'll have to pay more to borrow, which means there's less for the city to do the things people want us to do."
 
'I Haven't Forgotten'
 The Mayor said: "I haven't forgotten who got me elected. But who got me elected isn't relevant to what one has the ability to do with the money that's available."
In a host of ways, Mr. Dinkins's ability to make a difference has been limited by the economic downturn that his own advisers call a crisis. For example, Barbara J. Fife, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, said the administration would have adopted a more restrictive policy toward real-estate development than the Koch administration had, if it were operating in the same economic climate that fostered a decade-long building boom.
As it is, she said, the administration is eager to spur the economy, and there is so little development that possible differences in policy are irrelevant. The city's own plans for building long-term projects have also slowed.
"These are times when it would be good to have publicly funded projects to stimulate the economy," she said. "But because of our need to get our debt-service costs down, we're even cutting our capital budget," so the city will not need to borrow as much.
Perhaps the Mayor's most visible successes were luring the 1992 Democratic National Convention to the city, which he hopes will generate $100 million in revenue, and presiding over the visit of Nelson Mandela in June. He has also sought to expand affirmative-action programs for city employees, expand opportunities for small and minority-owned contractors, lure more foreign business, provide drug treatment on demand for pregnant women and make other changes.
"If all we were going to do was run a scaled-down version of the Koch government, I wouldn't be interested in staying," Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said. "The improvements will be smaller, but they'll be there."
David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society, a nonprofit social service organization, said: "I think everyone recognizes that we're all sort of riding this roller coaster downward. I think what we're hoping for out of the Dinkins administration is that it can lead an attack, on a Federal level, to get more support."
 
'You Can't Let People Despair'
 "To talk about further economies with disadvantaged populations is to make sure that you're going to set up a chain reaction of social pathologies that I think will have a hell of a lot more detrimental impact on New York than we can imagine."
"The next step has to be not only to inspire confidence in the financial markets, but also in the least among us," Mr. Jones said. "You can't let people despair, and that's going to be the critical issue for all of us."
Mr. Jones said other officials must join in the fight for more Federal aid. "I haven't seen anyone do anything but point the finger at David Dinkins, and that becomes unacceptable."
Mr. Dinkins said that much was expected of him, in part because his core supporters had felt largely alienated from the previous administration. But he rejected any suggestion that his term would not be worthwhile if there was no money to spend, and he set the challenge for himself.
"It takes a lot more skill and energy and hard work to move ahead in difficult times, so it is well worth it."

HEADLINE: Resales Of Homes Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes, helped by falling mortgage rates, edged up 3 percent in November for the first increase since August, a real estate trade group said today.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes climbed to a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.14 million units in November, following declines of 3.8 percent in October and 9.4 percent in September. 
 The sales rate in October was a weak 3.05 million units.
Analysts said the slight improvement was a result of declines in mortgage rates. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have fallen to 9.64 percent, the lowest in three years.
Rates had edged up after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. But in recent weeks, mortgage rates declined as the Federal Reserve moved aggressively to fight a stagnant economy with lower interest rates.
The median price for a home in November was $91,300, down 1.7 percent from the level in October and down 1.9 percent from the median price a year ago.
The November sales increase was led by strength in the South and West. Sales in the South jumped 7.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million units, while sales in the West were up 2 percent, to an annual rate of 500,000 units.
Sales continued to slump in the Northeast, however, falling 2 percent, to an annual rate of 490,000 units, down 17 percent from a year ago. Sales in the Midwest were unchanged in November from the October sales rate of 820,000 units.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Quiet Trading; Gold and Silver Prices Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower yesterday in quiet post-holiday trading.
Gold and silver prices rose, meanwhile, with gold for current delivery settling at $385.60 a troy ounce, up $3.10 from late Friday on the New York Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $384.20 an ounce, $2.95 higher than Friday. Silver settled at $4.095 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, up 7 cents from Friday. 
 New York precious metals markets were closed Monday and Tuesday in observance of the Christmas holiday.
Most financial markets in Europe, Hong Kong and Canada remained closed yesterday for an extended holiday.
Currency dealers said profit taking after Monday's rally was largely responsible for the dollar's decline. But they said market sentiment toward the dollar remained strong amid continued political and economic unrest overeas.
"Tensions in the Soviet Union and the Middle East continue to provide support for the dollar," said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president and trader for the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
Mr. Johnson said trading was sluggish, with most dollar brokers reluctant to do any major buying or selling since the overseas markets were closed.
In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed at 136.25 yen, up 0.30 yen from Tuesday's close. The dollar stood at 136.10 yen in New York, up from 136.00 yen Monday.
The dollar was down against the British pound, with sterling fetching $1.8815, vs. $1.8685 Monday.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.53475, from 1.5453 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's quotes, included: 1.30825 Swiss francs, down from 1.3160; 5.2080 French francs, down from 5.2515; 1,155.00 Italian lire, down from 1,164.00, and 1.15945 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1600.

HEADLINE: Suriname Coup Leaders Had Power Already

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
By seizing power in a bloodless coup on Monday, the Surinamese armed forces were merely formalizing their increasingly apparent control over the country, human rights advocates, Western diplomats and academics who follow the country's affairs say.
They say that after a civilian Government was elected in the former Dutch colony in 1987, ending the seven-year military Government of Comdr. Desi Bouterse, he used his military command, which he retained, to usurp civilian authority and regain dominance over the country's affairs. 
 In recent months, Commander Bouterse effectively vetoed Government initiatives in peace negotiations with leaders of a four-year old guerrilla insurgency, and publicly warned that his soldiers would do nothing to discourage looting if President Ramsewak Shankar carried out strong austerity measures to slow uncontrolled inflation and restore growth to an economy in steep decline.
Critics of the military have been mysteriously murdered or have simply disappeared, creating an atmosphere of fear in which few Surinamese have been willing to speak out about perceived army abuses.
"Our feeling is that he didn't have todo this because he has had power for some time now," a Western diplomat, reached by telephone in the Surinamese capital, Paramaribo, said of Commander Bouterse's seizure of power. "His ability to manipulate things was already near-complete. But by taking over formally, he has plunged the country into isolation."
The United States called for the immediate restoration of the civilian Government, while Suriname's former colonial master, the Netherlands, suspended all financial aid. Last year, the Netherlands provided about $50 million in aid.
Although he resigned his commandof the army on Sunday, saying he could no longer work for a Government that "exposes the dignity of the nation to ridicule," foreign diplomats and Surinamese observers said that Commander Bouterse remains firmly in charge of the military and was the clear mastermind of the coup.
Commander Bouterse, a 45-year-old former track star who led a coup by noncommissioned officers in 1980, resigned his command, but not his commission, shortly after returning to Suriname from a private trip to Ghana and Switzerland. His connecting flights passed through Amsterdam, and while he was on Dutch soil officials isolated him from the press and other visitors.
When he returned to Suriname, an indignant Commander Bouterse announced his resignation, castigating President Shankar, who coincidentallytraveled on the same flights to and from the Netherlands, as a "joker" for not having protested his treatment by Dutch authorities.
The next evening, with soldiers occupying radio and television stations, Comdr. Ivan Graanoogst, the leader of the military police and a close associate of Commander Bouterse, announced that the army had "taken over political power" and would hold new elections within 100 days.
A spokesman for the Surinamese Army, Borger Breefield, in an interview with Radio Netherlands denied that Commander Bouterse was now running the country, saying the former commander was "at home relaxing."
"It was not really a military coup," Mr. Breefield said of the army's seizure of power. "Within a week a caretaker government will be installed witha mission of organizing secret, free and fair elections."
But civic and human rights groups in Suriname have condemned the army's takeover and have urged Parliament not to cooperate with any militarily appointed Government.
"If they hold fair elections the results will be the same as in 1987, because the majority of the people are against the military," said Else Labadie, a banker who heads the Organization for Peace and Justice, a civic group that has called for the army to remove itself from politics. In the last elections, Commander Bouterse's party was badly defeated.
"When they took power in 1980 they promised elections right away and it took seven years," Mrs. Labadie said. "Now they have it back and nobody believes they will give it up soon."
