All the Presidents' Numbers

BYLINE:  By ANDREW KOHUT AND HARRY CAMPBELL; Andrew Kohut is director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. Harry Campbell is an illustrator.

 BODY:
By most measures prospects for George W. Bush's re-election look very good. No single indicator guarantees a second term, of course, but on balance the president's numbers are as good if not better than those of the three presidents who won second terms in recent times. 
 From a political standpoint, Mr. Bush is strong. His approval ratings are relatively high, as is the percentage of Americans who think the country is on the right track, and alone among recent presidents he saw his party gain seats in the midterm elections. 
 The economic numbers are also positive. Consumer confidence is high, disposable income is rising and the unemployment rate is lower than that of the three presidents who lost bids for re-election.
Yet the numbers, as always, don't tell the full story. The effects of partisan polarization, for example, are unpredictable, and it is near an all-time high; Democrats disapprove of Mr. Bush almost as much as Republicans disapproved of President Bill Clinton. What's more, news that seems to be good -- like rising approval ratings -- doesn't always lead to re-election, while news that seems to be bad -- like relatively high unemployment -- doesn't necessarily ruin an incumbent's chances. Just ask Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan.
These statistics have been culled from publicly available sources, including the Gallup Organization, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the University of Michigan, and Congressional Quarterly and other news organizations.

HEADLINE: What's Missing In the Recovery? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The article noted how many industrial jobs were being exported to China and how many service jobs were going to India. 
 A corporate tax rebate for companies, based on some amount of personal income tax they withhold on their workers employed in the United States, would go a long way toward addressing the issue in a sensible and effective way.
Right now, when jobs leave the United States, the Internal Revenue Service loses the personal income tax on them. But if jobs stayed here, the I.R.S. could keep collecting that tax, helping it offset a loss of corporate tax from lower company profits. And if more Americans were working, the I.R.S. and companies alike would benefit from a stronger economy. 
In short, such a rebate should make companies think twicebefore outsourcing jobs overseas.

HEADLINE: What's Missing In the Recovery? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The jobless recovery felt by so many communities across America is certainly distressing, but lamenting the loss of manufacturing jobs overseas will not solve the problem. 
What will? Perhaps a new outlook on energy use. 
 Imagine if we developed new energy systems -- if we built wind fields across the Great Plains and hydroelectric plants on major rivers coast to coast and invested in the development of ethanol and hydrogen as fuel sources. 
Such a brand-new power infrastructure would surely require thousands of new jobs, from blue-collar laborers to engineers to chief executives, giving our recovery what it desperately needs: jobs. Oh, by the way, it might just reduce our dependence on foreign oil, reduce Arab resentment toward the United States and cut terrorist funding, too.

A $1,000 Prize For Disagreeing

BYLINE:  By David Cay Johnston

 BODY:
Over the last eight years, housing prices have risen 35 percentage points more than the rate of inflation, on average. Such figures are prompting talk about whether the housing market is in a bubble like the one that inflated stock prices. 
 In New England, housing prices rose 59.6 percentage points above inflation from 1995 to 2003, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. (Its data may even understate the increase because they exclude housing with mortgages of $320,000 or more.) 
 But in some expensive housing markets, including San Francisco and Seattle, rental prices are now falling, which may be a sign of weak demand.
The Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonprofit group in Washington, has been sounding warnings about a housing bubble. But it wants to know what other people think, so it is holding an essay contest. A $1,000 prize will go to the person who, in 750 words or less, makes the best case that there is no housing bubble.
In announcing the contest, the center said that "it took nothing more than simple arithmetic to recognize the existence of the stock market bubble" in 1998 to 2000, because stock prices were rising far faster than corporate profits or dividends.
Those who say there is no housing bubble have argued that housing prices are up because of immigration, limited supplies of urban land, environmental rules that limit construction and the rising incomes of buyers. The center's economists say that they do not believe that, but that they want to see if anyone can persuade them otherwise.
Essays may be sent before the March 31 deadline to georges@cepr.net. The winning essay will be posted at www.cepr.net on April 6. David Cay Johnston

For Retirees, a Step Forward, a Step Back

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
For now, at least, many Americans no longer go into a cold sweat before ripping open their 401(k) statements. But, yes, if it isn't one thing it's another. 
Just as nest eggs plump up again, health costs chip away at them.
 According to a survey of 408 large companies by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 10 percent said they had scrapped subsidized benefits for future retirees in the past year, and 20 percent plan to do so within three years. 
 Even when coverage survives, it may be whittled back, as many companies vow to increase premiums, deductibles and co-payments. (The survey was conducted before the Medicare drug legislation was passed, but only time will tell how that works.) Often, changes apply mainly to new workers, so the message seems to be: Stay put.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL; 
Dungy, Fired by the Bucs, Was Inspired by His Faith

BYLINE:  By THOMAS GEORGE

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
He watched Super Bowl XXXVII as many Americans did, at a Super Bowl party at a friend's home, this one in Tampa with 35 people attending, "where some came for the food, some came for the football and others just came to mingle," he said.
 But unlike any other American, Tony Dungy followed that game disappointed that he was not coaching in it and remembering fond times with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, whom he had coached for six seasons. The Bucs won that championship last January without him. He had been fired as their coach the January before. 
 In the days preceding his firing, his mother died, his Bucs lost in the playoffs at Philadelphia and he had been left twisting in confusion over his status. After finally being pushed from the Bucs' plank, Dungy remembers his drive home. 
It was a time for faith.
"I got in the car and immediately began trying to figure out what I was going to do," Dungy said. "I do believe as a Christian that nothing happens arbitrarily. Maybe the Lord was directing me somewhere else, and I wasn't sure it was going to be football. I knew as an African-American coach that it was possible I might not get another chance quickly; I thought of Art Shell and how he didn't get hired again right away. In a couple of days when the phone did start ringing a couple of times, it was gratifying."
One of those calls came from Jim Irsay, the Colts' owner. Because of him, Dungy remained unemployed only eight days.
Dungy became the Colts' coach and led them to the playoffs last season. This season he has taken them deeper, to the American Football Conference championship game against New England on Sunday afternoon in Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mass. The winner snatches a trip to Super Bowl XXXVIII on Feb. 1 in Houston. Dungy could achieve in two seasons with the Colts what he could not in six with the Bucs.
He was fired, in part, because he could not fix the Bucs' offense. He moved to a team that basically had only offense.
A town and a team have blended with a coach and his new wrinkles to push the Colts this close to the Super Bowl. Dungy, the defensive whiz, is winning with offense and with quarterback Peyton Manning's spectacular postseason play. This son of two teachers who grew up in Jackson, Mich., who played quarterback at the University of Minnesota, played three years in the N.F.L. as a defensive back and coached 15 years in the league as an assistant, has modified his approach to accentuate what his team has (offense) and disguise what it does not (defense).
For Dungy, it has been like hopping off a camel onto a cheetah.
"I think some of the players here even thought that I wanted to come in and dump all of the offensive players, trade them off and get defensive guys," Dungy said, laughing. "I didn't see it that way at all. What I saw was an offense that could score, explode, run the no-huddle but at the risk of three interceptions and two fumbles and that was O.K. as long as it scored 35 points. I thought we could be sound and aggressive and mistake-free and do even more. All the while, we would try to build the defense to be fast and formidable.
"Now, when I get in games and it's 37-17 with a quarter to play, yeah, that's different for me. That still takes some adjusting. But basically, this is the way I looked at it when I took the job: This offense is like Niagara Falls. You want to give me the job of keeping the water running and you're going to pay me for that? I can do it."
And adapt along the way and coach offense the way he does defense. Bucs linebacker Derrick Brooks knows about the latter. 
"When I look at Indianapolis I see that Coach Dungy has grown a lot as a coach, that he's been through a lot, that he was hurt with the way he was let go here but went there and had that offense take on his personality in the way our defense took on his personality," Brooks said. "The Indianapolis offense basically keeps their plays simple, executes and doesn't make mistakes. They want to line up and outexecute you and outman you. That's what we did on defense.
"You can't be around Coach Dungy for any time and not take on some of his personality. He is a man of faith. When we went out for our first game without him, one of our guys stopped us beforehand and said, 'What about the prayer?' That's something we always did with Coach. We stopped and did it then. He leaves marks with people that last. He's going to the Super Bowl. It's his time."
Dungy's regular-season record is 76-52 and includes a payback 38-35 victory at Tampa Bay on Oct. 6. His Colts lost by 41-0 to the Jets in last year's playoffs but beat the Jets, 38-31, on Nov. 16. 
He has made the playoffs in six of his eight seasons as a head coach. His playoff record is 4-5. This is his second conference championship game: he lost the 1999 National Football Conference title game when St. Louis beat Tampa Bay, 11-6.
"Coach Dungy is humble and smiling, but at the same time, you know he's about his business," said Colts defensive back David Macklin, a fourth-year pro. "He wants us to let it loose, just use your talent. Have fun, but when you're on the field you're on your job. Take it seriously. Don't take a day for granted. Cherish each day in the N.F.L. and enjoy the moment. At the same time, know that tomorrow is not promised. He has a lot of impact on me, personally, how I should live, how I should treat this game and how I should respect this game."
Dungy's coaching mentor is Chuck Noll, the coach he played for at Pittsburgh and who won four Super Bowl championships with the Steelers. Dungy said it was during his stay in 1977 and 1978 as a player in Pittsburgh that he became a man of faith.
"My grandfather was a minister and I had two uncles who were ministers but it was when I went to Pittsburgh and changed positions from quarterback to defensive back, an undrafted guy trying to make it at a position where the team already had stars, that I was exposed to some players who had a strong belief," Dungy said. "These guys were different from the guys I had been hanging around. And I found that pro football had such highs and lows, that you could be close to a Super Bowl or no job, that you can make the Pro Bowl but lose everything as a player on one play if injured, that I had to have help to make it."
What about the mix of faith and football, he was asked. Some of his peers have said that he unrealistically wants all his players and assistant coaches to be Christians although football is a game that requires a few nasty, dirty dogs.
"That is not true," Dungy said. "I strike a balance. But I do expect my players and coaches to be a certain way, to be professional and disciplined. When it comes to Sharpies and cellphones used in celebrations, we won't have that. It doesn't help you win. And by the way, I've been around some Christians who were nasty, dirty dogs on the football field who you never wanted to mess with."
Dan Rooney, the Pittsburgh owner, said that not everyone in the league may have deep respect for Dungy but that those who truly know him do.
"There appears to be a big difference in this Indianapolis team since Tony Dungy went there and I think it's trust," Rooney said. "Players know what he is telling them is true and he means what he says. He does it without the yelling and screaming, but it works. He tells his players to do what they can, do what they do. He plays to his strengths. He says it like it is. He has brought them more stability."
Dungy said that he has sessions with Manning where Manning gives him his read on an offensive play and Dungy tells him how defenses are likely to respond. Manning's approach to his job is much like Dungy's was as a quarterback. Dungy enjoys the fact that Manning relishes having control to change plays at the line of scrimmage. Dungy calls Manning "a sponge."
A husband and father of five children, Dungy knows what it would mean historically to become the first black coach to reach a Super Bowl. He also knows that the Patriots will not easily crumble.
"They've been there and done it, been in big games and won them," Dungy said. "But we beat Tennessee when they hadn't lost a divisional game at their home. We just beat Kansas City when they had won 13 straight at home. We're 8-1 on the road. We've got to beat a team now that has a lot of confidence in close games. It's going to be a cat-and-mouse game."
One in frigid cold where more than once he will deliver this message to his players: Just keep the faith, in themselves and their Super Bowl dream.

HEADLINE: Coming Soon: School Budget Battle No. 11 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WITH just over one-fourth of the fiscal year left to go, voters in Regional School District 8 still have not approved a budget for R.H.A.M. High School and Middle School, rejecting 10 budget proposals by ratios of as much as 70-30 and raising fears that the budget year will draw to a close before the financial deliberations are finished.
 Two days before Christmas about 3,300 people from the three towns rejected, by a 65 to 35 percent ratio, the latest proposal of $17.14 million, down $52,000 from the last vote. The budget includes a $2.15 million debt payment for the new school complex, which is expected to be completed in February. 
 "I really think we've gotten to the point now where it's no longer about the dollars, it's just become an emotional issue," said First Selectwoman Nancy S. Bader of Marlborough. "It's going to be a question of getting the different groups to sit down together, understand each other, and build some trust." 
Mrs. Bader said another cause of the stalemate is that the state requires a vote every four weeks until the budget passes, which does not allow for a review of spending and enough time to explain it to the public. The next vote is Tuesday. 
"We've had to rush from one referendum to the next with having time to do the groundwork that we should be doing," Mrs. Bader said. District 8 has not set a record for budget battles. That distinction belongs to the Amity Regional School District, which comprises Bethany, Orange and Woodbridge. Amity turned down 17 budgets during the 2002-3 fiscal year. But in the three-town District 8 -- R.H.A.M. stands for Regional Hebron, Andover and Marlborough -- the difficulty stems from disputes over what constitutes legitimate budget growth. Those who favor passing the budget contend that the towns need the money to run the new middle and high schools that were approved in a referendum four years ago; opponents argue that there have been too many years of too-large increases in spending.
Some officials said R.H.A.M. could be a harbinger of taxpayer revolts against school budgets, which account for the bulk of spending in most towns. Thomas J. Hanley, a member and former chairman of the R.H.A.M. Board of Education, said the former school building was constructed almost 50 years ago and was outdated, and people have to realize that with new buildings come higher costs.
"Everybody's feeling the cost of government in their pocketbook, and where can you act on it? In the local budget referendum," Mr. Hanley said. "If you're upset about anything to do with government, you can vote 'No' and make your voice heard."
Lynn H. Archambault, another district board member, said she is also disappointed that fewer than one-third of voters have cast ballots in any of the referenda, and many of the no-shows have been parents of students. But she also said that the number of votes has been taking a toll.
"On one of the days I had to be reminded twice to go vote myself," Ms. Archambault said. "It's lost all meaning to most people."
People against the budget, however, are more committed to turning out, said Donna J. McCalla, a spokeswoman for Hebron Dollars and Sense, a taxpayers group, which has led the charge against the budgets.
"People are really waking up. You're starting to see these taxpayer revolts all over the state," said Ms. McCalla, a former member of the Hebron Board of Finance. "We're hearing from people all over about what they have to do to get something like this started in their own town."
Robert A. Wilcox of Marlborough said he has voted against the current school budget each time it has come up. He said he has lived in town 20 years, and for most of those years the budget was passed by a handful of people at a town meeting. But he said as the budget grew, the administration and school board did not take taxpayer concerns seriously.
"Every time the board lost a referendum they would say things that didn't make a lot of sense, like the 'yes' votes just didn't turn out, or people were on vacation," Mr. Wilcox said. "They were in denial. They thought each time that the next referendum, they would win."
"And the administration hasn't proposed any serious budget cuts until the last few days, hoping that the next one will pass, and now here we are on the 11th referendum," Mr. Wilcox said.
He said he hasn't made up his mind about the new budget and wants to see some analysis of how the cuts were made, but he said if the new spending plan passes it is not necessarily a vindication of the board.
"People are getting weary of this, but I think unless there's some turnover in the school administration we could be in for the same thing next year," Mr. Wilcox said. "I'm still mulling over how I might vote. It's not a slam dunk."
Patrice A. McCarthy, general counsel for the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education, said that while she isn't convinced most towns will need more than 10 tries to get a budget passed, "We definitely saw a more difficult budget year last year than we've seen in a long time."
"And next year is not going to be any better," said Dr. William M. Silver, the R.H.A.M. superintendent of schools. "Just moving current programs forward we would probably be in the range of a 6 to 8 percent increase, and that's not even accounting for any additional enrollment or new requirements of the federal No Child Left Behind Act."
The Hebron Board of Finance is already looking toward next fiscal year. It has voted to request that the district seek no more than a 3.5 to 4 percent increase for 2004-5, said Chairman Brendan T. Shea.
"We've got to slow the rate of spending increases," Mr. Shea said. "We can't sustain that kind of spending growth."
This fiscal year's $17.14 million budget proposal is a 9.5 percent increase over last year, which was up 7.5 percent from the year before. The first budget proposal for the fiscal year, which voters rejected, was 17.97 million, up 15.5 percent. Ms. McCalla said that the board has done little to really trim the budget. Four times, on budget votes six, seven, eight and nine, the package was virtually unchanged. She said based on the growth in the town's tax base, a budget of $16.4 million to $16.9 million is more appropriate.
Supporters of the higher figure said that would mean there would be less money for programs than the previous year because of the new expense for school construction.
Mr. Shea, head of the Hebron Board of Finance, is also the chairman of the Tri-Town Committee, a regional finance board created last year to supervise spending at R.H.A.M. High School and Middle School at least until a budget has passed. While the group has only been trying to improve management of the district's money, and has not rejected any spending requests, "we might have to start taking a more aggressive approach."
"We will not be setting any kind of policy -- we won't be saying, 'we think you should have so many teachers per student' -- but we may say, 'we think you can cut $100,000 out of the personnel account, then it's up to them to figure out how to do it," Mr. Shea said. "That's the fine line we have to walk, and it can be difficult at times."
Dr. Silver, the superintendent, said it's getting late in the year to achieve any kind of savings from the proposed budget. Even if the school lays off a teacher today, with the notice required and the unemployment benefits the district would owe, it would save no more than $10,000 to $12,000, and for aides and support personnel the savings would be even smaller.
And any cut to the annual budget now would have to be phased in over about four months, which means that a 4 percent cut now would have the effect of a 12 percent cut for the rest of the year.
Jeffrey P. Watt, who was elected chairman of the R.H.A.M. Board of Education after the November elections, said officials have to realize that the issue has polarized people into one camp that feels cutting money will harm the quality of the education, and another that thinks education has become too expensive.
"It's sheer economics," Mr. Watt said. "I don't think this has a thing to do with attitudes about education, it's about what people can afford. We need to convince the community that we have looked at the budget and cut as deeply as we possibly can.
"It is the board's responsibility to find the middle ground, to bring the two sides together and find a solution that satisfies everyone," Mr. Watt said. "And I wouldn't have taken this job if I didn't think that could be done."

HEADLINE: A Change of Scene? 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
JEAN-RIGARD LEESSE is a Haitian immigrant who has worked as a maintenance man at St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church in Garden City for two years.
 Officially he is a candidate for political asylum, which allows him to work legally in the United States, and he hopes to become a legal resident later this month after an immigration hearing. But before advocates at Catholic Charities, an agency of the Diocese of Rockville Centre, helped put his asylum case in motion, he lived nearly a year as an undocumented immigrant. He had strong praise for the immigration proposal presented by President Bush this month. 
 "It's a humane action," Mr. Leesse (pronounced lay-ESS) said last week as he waited to meet with his counselor at Catholic Charities' offices in Amityville. "America is a good country, but when you live as an illegal here, it is very hard. It's difficult to get a job or do something to even get an I.D. card or a driver's license." 
The president's plan would offer legal status to millions of illegal workers. He has stressed that it is not an amnesty program because immigrants would be required to have a job with a sponsoring employer and would be expected to return to their home countries after their work periods expired.
Many immigrant advocates have criticized the program for not going far enough, noting that it only provides temporary worker status for renewable three-year periods. But Mr. Leesse said: "It's still a good thing. It's better than nothing, because otherwise you're illegal with no hope at all."
The president's proposal has drawn mixed reviews on Long Island. Immigrants and their advocates praise it for finally recognizing the need to grant undocumented immigrants some form of legal status. Employers say they hope it will make it easier to fill jobs with legal workers. Advocates and employers say it might reduce the crowds of unemployed immigrant workers at informal streetcorner gathering places around the Island, where they wait for contractors to pull up and offer them a day's work.
But opponents of illegal immigration harshly criticize the president's plan and warn that it will only encourage more illegal immigration and leave less work for American citizens. The number of workers clamoring for day jobs in major "shape up" sites in Farmingville, Farmingdale and Freeport will just increase, they say, and the immigrants' overcrowded living conditions will continue to vex neighbors and ruin property values. Labor leaders add that they fear that the program would officially create a class of lower-paid workers that would depress wages for everyone.
Steve Levy, the new county executive in Suffolk County, which has been home to acts of anti-immigrant violence that have drawn national attention in recent years, gave it qualified praise. "I believe that we should be seeking immigrants through proper legal channels," he said, adding that the program could help "mitigate the exploitation of workers and put those businesses that are playing by the rules on a fairer playing field."
But he also criticized the president's proposal as an amnesty program and said, "I don't think preference should be given to those who have broken the law and wound up here on Long Island."
Even before he was elected county executive Mr. Levy said he wanted the county to go after contractors who hire illegal day workers and he opposed creating a hiring hall for undocumented workers in Farmingville, where protesters still march six days a week, carrying signs that read: "Deport Illegal Aliens."
Last week, Mr. Levy said he planned to gather interested parties from throughout the county to develop a plan for dealing with undocumented workers. Within a few months' time and probably long before the debate over Mr. Bush's proposal concludes, Mr. Levy said he hoped to have Suffolk County police officers conducting sting operations "against those employers who are cheating on sales tax, unemployment and workers compensation." When employers do business off the books, he said, "Our coffers suffer as aresult because taxes don't get paid and employers who do play by the rules are undercut and can't compete."
Robert Wieboldt, the executive director of the Long Island Builders Association, said that requiring employers to establish the credentials of their workers would be a tremendous burden. "The average contractor is not competent to determine if a green card is real or not," he said. "But if the president's proposal makes it easier to get certified workers and to establish legality, that's a good thing."
The construction industry on Long Island has long acknowledged that some contractors use undocumented workers, he said, adding that the president's program would finally recognize the fact that "there are legitimate labor shortages that cannot be filled with our local work force."
Mitchell H. Pally, the vice president for government affairs at the Long Island Association, said the broader business community would probably welcome the program. "Obviously we have a large number of immigrants who are here doing productive work for the people of Long Island, and I think any method in which they can become legal would be welcomed because it would ensure their continued employment." He said most employers would probably be willing to step forward and sponsor their undocumented workers as long as there was no penalty.
But local opponents of illegal immigration have already started contacting members of Congress to campaign against the president's plan. Sachem Quality of Life, a Farmingville group that has been outspoken against illegal immigration, has been riven by internal disputes, but the two factions of the group are united in their opposition to Mr. Bush's program.
"He says it would bring in workers as needed, but it's just going to enable corporations to fire American workers and replace them with foreign workers," said Ed Person, leader of one Sachem faction. "President Bush is encouraging lawbreaking, because illegal aliens will see that they're rewarded for breaking the law."
Ray Wysolmierski, a leader of the other faction, agreed that the proposed program would bring more illegal immigrants to the United States. 
"Everybody knows what's going to happen," he said. "After three years, they won't go back and the liberals will all say these people have been paying taxes and contributing to the economy so it would be a terrible thing to make them go back, and they'll wind up staying here."
Jack Kennedy, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, said he feared that the program would "open up the floodgates to immigration, and as far as I'm concerned and middle-class workers are concerned, that's a real heavy threat to middle America." He said that small employers who already operate in the underground economy of undocumented workers would probably not participate in the program, but he feared that large employers would, giving potential union jobs held by American citizens to guest workers from abroad.
Still, Mr. Kennedy said, "I don't think we're going to be able to stop it, so I think the next move for us is to take a real hard, serious look and try to organize these people, because if not, we're going to see a spiraling down of what we consider a livable wage." Immigrants may be happy to work for $7 or $10 an hour, he said, but middle-class Long Islanders simply can't afford to make that little.
Advocates for immigrants stressed that the vast majority of undocumented workers already have regular jobs and that the president's program would finally recognize them, put them on official payrolls, collect taxes from them and provide some job security for them.
Ed Hernandez, a spokesman for the Long Island Immigrant Alliance, a coalition of 24 service and advocacy groups, said that in Farmingville, where the number of undocumented workers is estimated at 900 to 1,500, only about 200 workers can be found on any given day rushing up to contractors' trucks looking for a days' work. "That means that most of them are steadily and gainfully employed," he said. "The streetcorners are really the unemployment line for undocumented workers."
Many of these people have come to Long Island because their fellow villagers have come here, Mr. Hernandez said, but if companies elsewhere in the country were encouraged to participate in the guest worker program, "maybe it will reroute some of the folks who are coming up here." He added, "it wouldn't eliminate all the issues around illegal hiring and labor practices, but it would certainly reduce them."
Mr. Hernandez and other immigrant advocates said, however, that there were aspects of the president's plan that needed refinement. They argued that an adequate grace period should be included for those workers who lose their jobs to remain in the country while looking for another job, and that safeguards should be included to prevent unscrupulous employers from using the threat of deportation as a way to intimidate their workers.
Carmen Maquilon, director of immigrant services for Catholic Charities, said she applauded President Bush for finally grappling with the issue of undocumented workers, but added, "His remedy is not good enough because it doesn't lead to any permanent status and it doesn't address the need for family unity." Once a person has been in this country for a few years and has established roots, she said, "if they proved they are taxpayers and good for the country, they should be allowed to get some type of permanent status and it should include their families."
Men are most likely to participate in a guest worker program, thus leading to the creation of de facto immigrant bachelor societies, she said. "A person who's here trying to make money only sees tomorrow, not next week or next year," she said. "So he will be happy to just have some type of legal status, but this program will keep families apart."
One much-sought-after service at Ms. Maquilon's offices is help navigating the system when an undocumented immigrant marries an American citizen and can then apply for legal status. Ms. Maquilon said she and her staff screen couples to make sure their unions aren't simply marriages of convenience.
Elizabeth, a 34-year-old immigrant from Bolivia who was meeting with a Catholic Charities counselor but declined to give her last name, said she would have welcomed President Bush's program when she first came to Long Island four years ago.
She said she worked two jobs when she first arrived, one making $5.15 an hour packing food for a lunch wagon and another making $7 an hour at a bakery. But first she had to buy a fake Social Security card that allowed her to work on the books, and every day she lived in fear of being discovered.
"Even if this is just temporary, at least you can renew the status and you can go home and visit," she said. "Otherwise you can't even go back if your parents die."
Her husband, Mike, is an American citizen. They met three years ago while he was working as a volunteer at an outreach program in Bay Shore and she stopped by in search of a donated couch. "I think it's fantastic if people who want to work here can do it legally and not have to lie about what they are anymore," he said. "The ideal for immigrants is living with their families in a nice house, not hiding and living in basements."
Elizabeth said that life in America has been much more difficult than she imagined. "It's totally different from what they say before you come," she said. "Only the hardest work is left for us and you have to be always afraid."
Then she turned to her husband, took his hand and said, "I told him, he is my angel."

Seeking Jobs and Hope

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA R. OLSEN

DATELINE: RED BANK 

 BODY:
AT noon on a recent Tuesday in the parlor of the First Presbyterian Church in Red Bank, Sally Schwartz was getting advice about job titles. 
 Ms. Schwartz, 56, a member of Workers in Transition, a group of unemployed residents who meet at the church, wants to manage an office. But when someone suggested that she look for a job as an executive assistant, she disagreed. That job title is too limiting, she insisted. Office manager or administrative assistant would be better, she said. 
 Ms. Schwartz, who was a secretary for a home health aide placement agency in Fair Haven for almost a year, was laid off in July, the second time in two years. Although her expression was hopeful, as she sat deeply in the couch, her patience was wearing thin. 
According to economists and the latest unemployment statistics, her disenchantment is not unusual. A projected nationwide increase of 150,000 jobs in December overshot the mark by 149,000.
Despite a strengthening economy, job growth came to a halt in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Most economists had forecast a better showing, but instead the unemployment rate dropped to 5.7 percent from 5.9 percent -- a negligible decrease -- primarily because so many people chose not to look for work, a requirement to be counted as unemployed. New Jersey has yet to report its numbers for December; in November, the state's unemployment rate was 5.5 percent. 
That said, New Jersey actually had a good year, said Joseph Seneca, an economics professor at Rutgers and chairman of the governor's Council of Economic Advisors. He said that from December 2002 through November 2003, New Jersey gained 41,200 jobs, a rate sixth highest among the states.
"Considering that 21 states lost jobs, including New Jersey neighbors New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, New Jersey stands out," he said. "But at the same time, that's a net number, and lots of jobs have been lost, too."
Experts note that although the economy is improving, jobs are either moving overseas or disappearing altogether. And, Mr. Seneca agreed, "there is a lingering sense that the last few years have been difficult and lots of people are still discouraged."
On any given day or evening, a scene similar to the one at the First Presbyterian Church takes place in any number of churches and synagogues around the state.
"Ad hoc groups reflect the difficult times we've been through," Mr. Seneca said. 
These groups provide job leads, suggestions and moral support to those who have been hit hard by the economic slowdown of the last few years. The groups, some of which began forming in the 1980's, vary in size, structure and composition. Many include visitors as well as congregants. Some have a spiritual bent -- opening and closing with a prayer -- while others merely use the religious institutions as meeting places. 
Whatever the message, experts and participants alike say these groups are helping to fulfill a need along with the state Department of Labor's One Stop Centers -- there is one in every county -- that offer job leads, counseling and information on benefits.
Some participants say the groups provide a service above and beyond those met by other organizations. "We're not just about finding a job," said Richard Bundy, an ordained minister from Eatontown who leads the Workers in Transition group each week. 
In 2001, an associate pastorat the church asked Mr. Bundy -- who is also a licensed therapist and worships at the Red Bank church -- to act as a facilitator for a group of unemployed parishioners. "These are real support groups for people going through a difficult time," he said. "The members are sharing at an intimate, emotional level. Any loss involves a grief response, but when you're dealing with a job loss, it doesn't get better. You might get an e-mail about a position that gives you hope, but then if you don't get the job, the hope dies."
At the First Baptist Church, also in Red Bank, the Jabez Business Networking Group meets at 7:30 a.m. on various weekdays. Mark Mendez, 41, who was laid off from an engineering job on Wall Street and is now selling cars, leads the group. Though the group is not affiliated with the church, Mr. Mendez said the founding members are Christian business people who named the group after an Old Testament figure.
In Princeton, the Career/Networking Group, which meets at St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church, has about 40 members and offers eight-week sessions with speakers on topics like understanding yourself, resume writing and targeting a job search. 
Steve McCarthy, a leader of the group who operates Today's Office Staffing, an employment placement business in Edison and Parsippany, said that members talk about themselves for a minute or two and share where they are in their job search and where they need help. Participants are asked to speak in a positive way, he said. "It works well, for us," he said, so "no one gets bogged down feeling sorry for himself."
At Princeton Trinity Church, a group called Jobseekers, which was formed in 1982 by Niels Nielson, a human resources consultant. "Being let go in the 80's had a sense of shame attached to it," Mr. Nielson said, describing how parishioners confided in him about their frustrations and fears. 
These days, 25 to 35 people -- primarily managers and other professionals -- show up once a week for instructional workshops and open forums for networking and support. Spouses and partners are encouraged to attend, he explained, to understand what the unemployed person is experiencing.
Job Seekers of Montclair, which is not affiliated with the Princeton group, meets at St. Luke's Episcopal Church and offers 12-week sessions with a variety of speakers. 
"We even had a high school junior come with his mother one week to get some job-hunting tips," said William Nikel, who leads the 15-year-old group.
At Christ Church in Short Hills, Sandra Johnson, a corporate banker who works in Manhattan, leads Careers in Transition, which meets two Saturdays a month. Last year, she said, members were primarily finding jobs that paid on a commission basis, though she added that "some serious employers are starting to hire."
And the group has started a tradition. If someone gets a job, that person has to bring doughnut holes to the next meeting. 
Judy Schnitzer, who helps lead the Career Networking Group at Temple Beth Shalom in Livingston, said she could relate to what many members were feeling. She said that in 2001 she was laid off from an investment banking firm in Morristown, only to find another job with a small manufacturing company and be laid off from that job too. 
"We've had 15 or 20 people pass through," Ms. Schnitzer said, adding that membership in the group, which meets every three weeks, had recently dwindled. 
Even when a group disbands, the need for networking does not necessarily disappear. In Caldwell, when Congregation Agudath Israel's networking group broke up, the synagoguerose to fill the gap, said Randi Brokman, the synagogue's program director, collecting information on job openings from congregants. Recently, the temple joined with 19 other synagogues in the state and Jewish Vocational Services Metrowest to develop a Web site with job leads. 
After a networking group at Temple Shalom in Succasunna died out nine months ago, Rabbi Joel E. Soffin announced from the pulpit that the entire congregation would be a networking group and promptly received dozens of job leads, he said.
"The most significant part of this is that we're learning about people we didn't know about who don't have jobs," the rabbi said. "We have created an environment in which people feel comfortable enough to tell us."

Controlling Sprawl

BYLINE:  By JAMES W. HUGHES and JOSEPH J. SENECA; James W. Hughes is dean, and Joseph J. Seneca is university professor, at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers.

 BODY:
AS prices soar and affordability plummets, new housing appears to be falling out of the reach of many New Jersey households. 
 Our recent report on home-price bubbles disclosed big increases in the state's shelter prices. From 1998 to 2003, house prices grew by 51.7 percent in New Jersey. While we concluded that this increase had not created an unsustainable bubble, it does represent a major price spike far in excess of income growth and inflation. 
 Certainly, one culprit is the increasing difficulty of building on the state's remaining greenfields, a result of growing efforts to preserve open space and increasing development constraints on the metropolitan edge. Smart-growth public policies aimed at reining in sprawl are likely to intensify and further constrain greenfield housing production. This will contribute to additional home price increases and declines in housing affordability. As mortgage rates move up from 40-year lows, shelter that is reasonably priced will be further reduced.
But there is a neglected upside to the affordability problem that is generating public and private benefits and creating both a need and an opportunity to address the high costs of housing.
A drive through any of New Jersey's older post-1950 tract-house suburbs shows considerable evidence of an upsurge in revitalization and reinvestment. This is occurring in many areas that a decade or two ago appeared to be increasingly shopworn places that households were rapidly trading up and away from. But spiraling new home prices have increased the demand for, and the prices of, the existing housing supply. 
As the price of trading up to new housing soars, existing homeowners experience a private windfall. They find the value of their homes increasing significantly. This gain provides homeowners with the economic incentive to reinvest and remodel and to remain in their community with significant public benefits for the municipality. Over the last five years, this process has intensified and is now a visible part of the state's housing landscape.
Similarly, new vitality is increasingly evident in new construction or rehabilitated housing in most of our more urbanized areas along with declining retail vacancies and the arrival of national retail chains. The rediscovery and resurgence of many older developed parts of the state that once appeared destined for a troubled future is a direct consequence of declining housing affordability and increasing anti-sprawl constraints on new housing production, as well as new demand stemming from substantial immigration.
For more than 50 years, the state was engulfed by a tidal wave of metropolitan expansion, with new development constantly pushing ever outward. In the 1950's and 1960's, for example, families moved into Levittown-style dwellings -- 900-square-foot tributes to modesty -- at a rate of 1,000 a week for more than 1,000 consecutive weeks. This yielded a million new housing units over 20 years, overwhelming such in-lying counties as Bergen, Essex and Union. 
Subsequently, it was the state's ever-expanding periphery where the newest and, with the exception of our older elite communities, most desirable housing proliferated. This process relentlessly drew the upwardly mobile from older in-lying suburbs and cities. Massive housing production on the ever-expanding metropolitan edge resulted in affordable homes and opportunities for new households, particularly immigrants, to acquire a first home by a filtering process that increased the availability of units at the bottom of the housing ladder first in urban areas and then in older suburbs. But this developmental process came with significant environmental and congestion costs, the loss of millions of acres of forest and farmland and deteriorating left-behind areas.
We are in the process of achieving the smart-growth planners' holy grail; namely, constraining sprawl and directing increased private reinvestment into older developed areas. But the old adage to be careful what you wish for has again come home to roost in the form of substantial decreases in housing affordability. We no longer can achieve, as we did for a half of a century, continued housing affordability by sustained large-scale housing production on an ever-receding undeveloped regional periphery. Direct public investment will be required to ensure housing opportunity and affordability in the future.
Where will such financial resources come from at a time of widespread fiscal constraint? Two sectors should be explored: significant resource (or tax) savings are being achieved by not having to develop infrastructure and service systems on the periphery, and new resources (taxable value) are being created when older areas are revitalized. Affordable housing needs should have some claim on both of these resource and tax benefits stemming from our new growth patterns.

Two Fronts: Promoting Marriage, Fighting Poverty

BYLINE:  By TOM ZELLER

 BODY:
NO sooner had the Bush administration heralded its initiative last week to spend $1.5 billion to promote marriage, particularly among low-income couples, than some social and religious conservatives began to worry. The gesture, they said, was a weak substitute for their larger goal: support from the White House for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. 
 But that $1.5 billion ($300 million to be spent annually over five years on counseling services, public awareness campaigns and marriage enrichment courses intended to foster "healthy marriages" among the poor) has been stirring debate at a more academic level since it first appeared in the welfare reauthorization bill two years ago. And while decades of research has shown that marriage is good for society, last week's news once again raised questions about what role the government should play in supporting it, and whether marriage should be seen as a cure for poverty. 
 Part of the concern stems from the language chosen by the administration -- "promoting marriage" -- which for the critics conjures everything from a draconian social experiment to simple big-government meddling. Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, has called the initiative "thinly disguised social engineering." Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute refers to it as "1965-style Great Society liberalism." 
"There was a time when conservatives were against big government," Mr. Tanner added, "but if you close your eyes, you just might think that Bill Clinton was president again."
Wade F. Horn, assistant secretary of health and human services for children and families, acknowledges that the term can generate confusion, but said the administration was not interested in creating converts to marriage. Rather, he said, the money will be aimed at programs to assist couples already contemplating marriage to learn skills that will help them stay together, or provide counseling and education for married couples who are having trouble sorting through conflicts. 
"This is not about influencing the decision-making process," Dr. Horn said, adding that the initiative is tied to changes in the welfare system because low-income people either don't have the money for counseling or such programs don't exist in the areas where they live. 
The federal government's promotion of marriage -- or support, or counseling, or whatever term ultimately proves appropriate -- represents the culmination of an effort that began 40 years ago, when researchers first began examining the social value of marriage. Since then an overwhelming body of statistical evidence has led to a conclusion that now sits at the bedrock of popular wisdom: two parents are better than one. 
"There's no question that controlling for income and holding race and other things constant, that children raised in two-parent families are better off than children in one-parent families," said James Q. Wilson, the social scientist and author of "The Marriage Problem: How Our Culture Has Weakened Families."
Few would argue with that point, but it raises questions. First, if healthy marriages and families are socially desirable, it remains unclear, given the high divorce rate, just what sorts of programs might help foster them. 
"We have to overcome an ignorance as to what works," Professor Wilson said. "There are no books you can read, no benchmarks to refer to. It's all untested." 
Judith Wallerstein, the author of "The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce," suggests that while the Bush administration's initiative is well-intentioned, it may be too little too late. It is better to start in early childhood, Ms. Wallerstein said, with instruction on choosing friends and forming stable relationships of any kind. 
"Young people as they grow up -- they want a good relationship, but they're terrified that they're not going to get it," she said. 
But what if they do get it? The drumbeat of the "promoting marriage" campaign, driven by statistical evidence, can make it easy for some advocates to overstate the ability of marriage to cure society's ills. 
The data show, for instance, that married people experience less poverty than single people, and that children of two-parent households tend to fare better overall than children of single-parent households. 
But does it follow that getting married is a ticket out of poverty or that children of single parents are doomed? 
"If you have a single mom making good choices and she marries a good man," said the Rev. Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, "then it's not long before they're driving a better car and living in a better home and the child is better off and they become an asset to society rather than a drain on society."
But some experts who generally support the Bush initiative say it is more complicated than that. In a study published last February in the journal Social Problems, Daniel T. Lichter, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University, found that while women from disadvantaged families reaped some economic benefits from marriage, those women who married and then divorced experienced higher poverty rates than those who never married at all.
"Marriage alone will not offset the long-term deleterious effects associated with unwed childbearing," the study asserted. 
Other researchers, like Leslie J. Brett, the executive director of the Connecticut's Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, have argued that other influences, like work hours, the availability of child care and access to health care, are set up to favor two-parent nuclear families, and that therefore families that don't fit that model have a harder time. 
"In order to improve the outcomes for families that do not fit the 'ideal' type," Ms. Brett wrote in a paper published last January, "we can seek to change and broaden the systems to support more types of families, rather than seeking to change the families themselves." 
STILL, most researchers concede that low-income people are no less interested in healthy, loving marriages than anyone else. As long as the marriage initiative is part of a constellation of programs that address other aspects of poverty, like jobs, education and proper health care, Professor Lichter said, "what's wrong with the government helping them reach those aspirations?" 
Dr. Horn said this is all the Bush administration is aiming to do. "Marriage is not the administration's antipoverty program," he said, pointing out that no money was diverted from any other program to pay for the new proposal. "It's an issue of addition, not subtraction. This will add options and opportunities, not take away from them." 
"I'm a conservative," Dr. Horn added, "And I think the government ought to be limited in what it does, even in the area of doing good."

HEADLINE: The World; 
A Foreign Policy Of Try, Try Again

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE American occupation in Iraq has been one of relentless trial and error.
 One early reversal occurred with the American administrators' dismissal of the Iraqi Army, followed by a decision to keep many soldiers on the payroll to avoid trouble. A promise to withdraw a large number of American forces quickly from Iraq was offered and then canceled. 
 Beyond these military shifts, the goal of transferring sovereignty to Iraq was first on a rapid timetable, then a slower one. It is now a fast track again, heading toward a target of June 30. Last week, in another shift, L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Baghdad, rushed home to press for the United Nations to play a role in the transition to self-rule -- not long after it was deliberately frozen out. 
Yet all these examples may not be so different from what has happened throughout American history, especially as administrations have sought to wage war or confront grave crises. 
"It's nice to think that when there is a challenge, the United States goes in with a well-formulated plan and sticks to it," said John Lewis Gaddis, a professor of history at Yale. But "there is no historical precedent for that happening. Germany and Japan after World War II were textbook examples of successful occupations, but they did not proceed according to a predetermined, consistently applied blueprint. Far from it."
Indeed, American rule in both Germany and Japan were bedeviled by a problem that now faces American authorities in Iraq. Both postwar occupations began with the idea of purging the leaders of the old regimes, just as the United States set out in Iraq with a plan to remove top members of the Baath Party of Saddam Hussein. The initial plan in both Japan and Germany was to prevent the re-emergence of an industrial state that could nurture a new generation of Nazis and militarists.
Quickly, however, American anxiety shifted from resurgent Nazism to the spread of Communism in Europe and Asia. Reversing themselves, American authorities began working with former Nazis, especially in the intelligence services, who knew where the Communists were lurking. Even more important, the plan envisioned by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau to turn Germany into a pastoral state was dropped, replaced by a decision to restore its economic strength to block Russian ambitions west of the Iron Curtain.
In Japan, the beginning of the Korean War "ushered in a new world," writes John W. Dower, a professor of history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in his book about the American occupation, "Embracing Defeat." Citing a popular movie about a man arrested for stealing who confesses by saying, "Oh, mistake!" Mr. Dower writes that "Oh, mistake!" became a famously sarcastic phrase applied to the occupation as it sought to remilitarize Japan, work with members of the old regime and re-establish its economic power.
In Iraq, the occupation administrators have had shifting policies about whether or not to block from power anyone associated with Mr. Hussein. There is now pressure to ease that stand and bring leaders of the Sunni minority back into power to help defuse the insurgency in Sunni areas.
Despite misgivings, the United States is also reconciled to having Islam play a role in the new Iraqi government. Last week, the United States sought to placate Iraq's leading Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who is demanding direct elections to choose an interim government, though many fear this will give too much power to religious leaders..
"At every stage in Iraq, ideological predispositions of those who advocated the war in Iraq have given way to pragmatism," said Noah Feldman, an assistant professor of law at New York University who served as a legal adviser to the American occupation in its first months. "The initial idea that Iraq was and must be made secular quickly is now being tempered by the reality of Islamic democratic politics."
The current problems mirror some of those faced by the United States during its occupation of the Philippines and Cuba, after the Spanish-American War of 1898. After that war, several American administrations proclaimed an intention to grant both nations independence, but events always stood in the way.
"We went in the Philippines in 1898 and decided to stay, while surrounding that decision with a lot of the same kind of rhetoric that surrounded the Iraqi invasion," said David M. Kennedy, a professor of history at Stanford. "We were going to lift them up and usher them into the family of nations. But as soon as we got there, it turned out the Filipinos had ideas of their own."
Instead of lifting the Philippines up, the Americans found themselves having to suppress an insurrection, at a cost of more than 4,000 lives. Subsequently, the United States convinced itself that it had to remain in the Philippines to protect its strategic interests in Asia, while in Cuba the desire was to stay to protect American investments.
Moreover, just as the United States is today debating the rationale of the Iraq war, it once debated the purpose of possessing colonies. "There was a lot of confusion about American objectives," said Bruce J. Schulman, a historian at Boston University. "Were we protecting our investments? Promoting democracy? Keeping other imperial powers away? Freeing the Cuba and the Philippines from Spain? There was a seat-of-the-pants approach to everything we did."
Still another example of chaotic planning that seems smooth only in retrospect related to the Marshall Plan, announced in 1948 as the American effort to rebuild Europe, including Germany. One of its twists and turns was how the United States could look evenhanded and offer aid to the Soviet Union and its satellites, while making the terms so strict that they would refuse the aid. The terms of the Marshall Plan were constantly shifting as a result. 
"If you read Dean Acheson's memoirs, or anything else that was contemporaneous and honest, you are always surprised to see how much was improvised," said William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard and supporter of the war in Iraq. "There have to be adjustments on anything on the scale of Iraq. The problem is that the Bush administration has an aversion to admitting that they are changing course."
Despite the temptation to see history as an inevitable chain of events, the course of decision-making never has run smooth. "If you look at American foreign policy day to day or week to week or year to year, it almost always looks terrible," said Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "But if you take the long view, we seem to do better at foreign policy than other people. And we tend to win. Historians and obviously pundits tend to focus on the mistakes. You could read a lot of history of the cold war, for example, and not realize that we won it."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the Bush administration's foreign policy planning misstated the date of the Marshall Plan. It was announced in 1947, not 1948. (It was approved in 1948.)

HEADLINE: Plagued by Drugs, Tribes Revive Ancient Penalty 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW and MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: BELLINGHAM, Wash. 

 BODY:
For generations the Noland family has led a troubled life on the Lummi Indian reservation here. The Nolands have struggled with alcohol, painkillers and, more recently, crack. Seven family members are now jailed, several for dealing drugs, on and off tribal land.
 Their experience has been repeated hundreds of times on this sprawling, desperately poor reservation of 2,000 Lummi, where addiction and crime have become pervasive. It is the reason that the Lummi tribe has turned as a last resort to a severe and bygone punishment, seeking to banish five of the young men in jail and another recently released. It is also the reason for evicting Yevonne Noland, 48, the matriarch of the Noland clan, from her modest blue house on the reservation, because her son, a convicted drug dealer, was listed on the lease. 
 Banishment once turned unwanted members of a tribe into a caste of the "walking dead," and some people criticize it as excessive and inhumane, more extreme than the punishments meted out by the world outside and a betrayal of an already fragile culture. 
But a growing number of tribes across the country, grappling with a rise in drug and alcohol abuse, gambling, poverty and violence, have used banishment in varying forms in the last decade. Tribal leaders see this ancient response, which reflects Indian respect for community, as a painful but necessary deterrent.
"We need to go back to our old ways," said Darrell Hillaire, chairman of the Lummi Tribal Council, shortly before an early morning meeting on the reservation recently about the tribe's new campaign against drugs. "We had to say enough is enough."
While the Lummi use banishment to root out drug dealers, other tribes, like the Chippewa of Grand Portage, Minn., are using it to rid the reservation of the worst troublemakers and to preserve what they say is a shared set of core values.
Being banished can mean losing health, housing and education benefits, tribal rights to fishing and hunting, burial rights, even the cash payments made to members of tribes earning hefty casino profits.
Recently, the Lummi have begun evicting the residents of households in which someone is charged with any drug-related crime. That is what happened to Ms. Noland, who said she had never been arrested yet was evicted from her home on the reservation because of her son's conviction for selling painkillers outside the reservation. She is now awaiting a ruling from the tribal court on her appeal of that decision. 
Although banishment was not being used when Ms. Noland's nephews and her son Robert Zamora committed their crimes, she acknowledged that the threat might have deterred them. Still, she said, the punishment is too brutal. "Spiritually, it's going to take your insides and turn them inside out."
She worries for her nephews and son. "They don't have an education," she said. "What are they going to do when they get out there? And what is the white man going to do, with the tribe kicking us all off our own reservation? Can't they see this is a catastrophe in waiting?"
Even within the Lummi Tribal Council, there is debate about how far the nation should go in its war on drugs, particularly around the eviction policy. 
"Would we propose taking someone's food or water?" said Perry Adams, vice chairman of the council. "It is a human right, and for us to turn housing into a form of policing, I think we've gone too far. I think we had good intentions, but does the tribe really have the right to take away membership in the nation?"
Tribal leaders estimate that at least 500 Indians on the reservation are addicted to painkillers or heroin and scores of others to alcohol. Guns and violence plague some neighborhoods. Babies are born addicted to drugs. Ms. Noland's 15-month-old grand-niece died two years ago of an overdose after eating an OxyContin pill that was dropped on the ground.
The loss of that baby was the turning point -- when the tribe hit rock-bottom, leaders said. It came as an exploding number of drug- and alcohol-related deaths were filling the Lummi cemetery, along a winding road that hugs Bellingham Bay and is lined with fliers and flowers marking the spots where drunken drivers crashed and died.
There had long been a severe alcohol problem on the reservation, a scourge throughout Indian country. But things took a terrible turn in the late 1990's, when OxyContin made its way to the reservation at a time when the tribe's long history of living well off the land and water had virtually come to an end.
Bellingham Bay and the surrounding waters once brimmed with salmon, holding the riches that made the Lummi, known as People of the Sea, one of the most successful fishing tribes. Many of those fishermen, with the salmon population shrinking and the unemployment rate on the reservation skyrocketing, have turned to dealing drugs.
Tribal leaders estimate the value of the annual drug trade on the reservation is now $2 million, easily surpassing fishing industry profits.
Mr. Hillaire, 49, and several others on the 11-member Lummi Tribal Council have made the fight against drugs and alcoholism a focus over the past few years. He emphasized that the battle involves not just punishment but also education, prevention programs and treatment, including intensely spiritual healing rituals for addicts.
Some Indians say banishment, while seemingly harsh, must be studied through the prism of tradition: It avoids bloodshed and reflects tribes' community values.
"It's out of desperation," said Doug George-Kanentiio, who is a journalist for News From Indian Country, a national newspaper, and a member of the six nations of Iroquois, some of which imposed banishments. "They could either reinforce the ancestral discipline, or they go the American route, which has proven to be a failure."
Even in places like Grand Portage, where violence and drugs are relatively rare, Chippewa leaders have turned to banishment. The tribal lands are policed by county law enforcement officers, but when a crowd got out of hand last summer, people on the reservation demanded more than an arrest by the sheriff, more than criminal charges from a county prosecutor.
"We see ourselves here as kind of a big family, and so we needed to be part of the solution," said Norman W. Deschampe, the tribal council chairman.
Just 350 members of this Chippewa band live on the banks of Lake Superior, in trailers and duplexes along roads rarely crossed in the winter except by tourists headed to the casino and truckers hauling loads south to Duluth. Life is mostly quiet. Front doors of homes are left unlocked, car keys are left in ignitions.
But one Saturday night in July, a group of people drove up to nearby Mount Maude and wound up talking and drinking and fighting. Along the way, some pulled knives, vandalized cars and made death threats. Within days, another crowd packed into the ordinarily empty tribal council meeting, demanding change. 
No banishment provision existed in Grand Portage, but that night the council unanimously voted to remove a mother, her two grown sons and a family friend in connection with the fight, and began writing a long resolution adding "exclusion" to the band's rules.
If the legendary version of the Indian punishment seemed simple and stark, this one was complicated: legalistic and 12 pages long. On the list of failings that can lead to banishment are being in a gang, selling drugs, harming the band's cultural items, disrupting a religious ceremony, unauthorized hunting or fishing and being banished from another reservation.
Still, the people of Grand Portage and Bellingham see banishment as a painful, last option. Both the Lummi and the Chippewa have tried or are considering other actions, including drug education and treatment, curfews for young people and seminars about gangs.
In Grand Portage, there have been no additional banishments since the tribe adopted the notion in October, and even Halloween on the reservation -- usually a time for egg-tossing and joy riding -- went by without its usual harmless mischief.
John Morrin, a member of the tribal council, said he struggled over the banishments. He had always leaned, he said, toward counseling and repair, not rejection. "This was a hard thing to do if you care about people," said Mr. Morrin, who ultimately voted to banish the woman and her family, even though he said he was related to them.
The woman, Jacquelyn Jackson, now lives wherever she can. She sometimes sleeps on a cot in an elderly friend's shabby apartment near downtown Duluth. Other times, she stays in a pile of blankets inside a tent in a dark basement of a relative's girlfriend's house.
Ms. Jackson, 43, acknowledged that she behaved terribly that summer night. She was drunk and violent and wrong, she said on a bitterly cold recent morning in Duluth.
But she said the punishment was too severe: losing her subsidized duplex on the reservation, losing her friends, losing her way of life in an isolated, quiet place. "That's my land, too," Ms. Jackson said. "I've never been homeless in my life. I'm never homeless. But I guess I am."
In her furious moments, she said tribal politics left her banished while others -- those with friends or family members on the tribal council -- did wrong but were not sent away.
In sadder moments, she wondered aloud about what was happening back in Grand Portage. What were her friends doing? What had become of the grill, microwave and fans she left in her house and was too afraid and embarrassed to go back for?
"I cry every night because I want to go home," she said. "I miss that place so bad."

HEADLINE: Bridgewater Land Trust And the Intent of Donors 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The article incorrectly framed the debate over the Town Line Farm as one borne of farm versus nonfarm interests and related socio-economic differences. 
A more objective investigation of this discussion would have revealed that the real issues in this debate are self interest and the Bridgewater Land Trust's obligation to honor the explicit and implicit commitments it made to the donors at the time it accepted our donations. 
 Many of the author's assertions were based on a document that did not reflect the donors' statement of donor intent that was submitted at the land trust's request on Nov. 3, 2003, which made several of the more substantive points raised in the article moot. Importantly, the author failed to speak to several of the parties that I believe to be relevant in this debate: the members of the land trust active in the negotiations at the time of the donation (the current president of the land trust became president in June). 
 Land preservation, land trusts and farming are all vital initiatives, which my family and I believe in fervently. Neither the land trust nor the donors have benefited from this controversy. In my opinion a more thorough and balanced investigation of the facts is essential to understanding the context, the origins and the drivers of this unfortunate controversy.

HEADLINE: THE CASES; 
The Reluctant Icons

BYLINE:  By Monica Davey; Monica Davey is a Chicago correspondent for The Times.

 BODY:
Though the court case bore the family's name, the Browns rarely discussed it back then around the dinner table in Topeka, Kan. So when the landmark decision was reached in May 1954, life went on for the Browns -- the Rev. Oliver L. Brown, his wife, Leola, and their three daughters, Linda, Terry and Cheryl.
 "For years, it didn't affect our family at all," says Leola Brown Montgomery, whose first husband had tried to enroll their eldest daughter, Linda, at an all-white elementary school, setting the stage for their part in the case. "The importance of it had not really hit people -- maybe not even us -- when it first came down." 
 The Browns made history more by happenstance than design. Oliver Brown was just one among 13 plaintiffs in the Kansas case -- and the Kansas case was just one of five from around the country clustered under the name Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that would ultimately answer the question of segregated schools. In the five decades since, the Browns have learned far more about the significance of their case, the mythology that surrounds it, and the complications and responsibilities that come with being perceived as an icon. 
In 1950 it seemed a small choice. 
Local leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People came forward with a strategy to fight segregation, and they were looking for elementary school parents to carry out the mission. The junior high schools and high schools in Topeka were already integrated, but elementary schools were not.
When the N.A.A.C.P. approached the Brownhousehold, Oliver Brown, a railroad welder by profession, agreed to take part. There was little debate over the matter at home.
As the association instructed, in the fall of 1950, he took Linda, then 7, over to Sumner Elementary School, an exclusively white school not far from the family's home. While she waited outside on a bench, he stepped inside the school and asked if he could register his daughter. When he was turned away, as 12 other black parents in Topeka would be in the end, he returned to the N.A.A.C.P. with the results they had expected and the documentation needed for a suit.
So began the case.
Oliver Brown's name took the lead plaintiff's position in the list of 13 parents when it came to the court case styling. (The others -- the "et alia" -- would be mostly overlooked.) Chronologically, he was the 10th parent to sign on to the lawsuit, and an alphabetical list would have put Darlene Brown, another plaintiff, first. His family suspects that the order may have revealed a gender bias: Oliver Brown was the only father in the bunch. Cheryl Brown Henderson, 53, the youngest daughter, says that the Brown case itself took the lead position because Kansas was a border state -- neither Southern nor Northern -- and thus separate from the politics of geography.
Over the years, myths arose, the Brown family says: that Oliver Brown had instigated the lawsuit, that Linda had pleaded not to have to walk all the way to her all-black school, the former Monroe Elementary School (which is being transformed into a historic site), and that the education was inferior there. "The truth is that Linda was a little kid," says Ms. Montgomery, now 82. "She was 7 years old and playing and she didn't think anything about any of it. At her age, she just wanted to play with her little neighbors -- they were Indian and Mexican and white -- and she did know that she couldn't go to school with her little friends." 
Ms. Montgomery does not remember the precise distance traveled -- only that the trip took Linda more than an hour. According to Richard Kluger's seminal history of Brown, "Simple Justice," Oliver Brown testified that Linda's trip began at 7:40 a.m. to reach school by 9. She had to walk a half-dozen blocks through the dangerous Rock Island switchyards to meet a bus that would take her to Monroe.
At the time, few people at school or within the community knew much about the case or Linda's role in it, Ms. Montgomery says. Her daughter faced little retribution, and little acknowledgment. 
Compared with the other school segregation cases -- from Delaware, Washington D.C., South Carolina and Virginia -- that were combined with the Kansas case when the Supreme Court took it up, Topeka was a mild environment, Cheryl Brown Henderson says. In Clarendon County, S.C., angry whites retaliated with an economic boycott against blacks, plaintiffs lost their jobs, and the home of the minister who was the main organizer of the lawsuit was burned to its foundation. 
In 1961, before the height of the civil rights movement, and only weeks after his eldest daughter graduated from high school, Oliver Brown died. He was interviewed only once for television before his death, his family says. 
In the years that followed, though, reporters began coming around. They came every anniversary, sometimes during Black History Month, sometimes with no time element at all. 
"It wasn't so bad until people started camping out on Linda's doorstep," says Ms. Montgomery, who remarried after her husband's death. 
Linda Brown Thompson, 60, a widow, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. Ms. Thompson attended Washburn University in Topeka, went on to teach in a Head Start program, and works with her sister Cheryl for the Brown Foundation for Educational Equity, Excellence and Research, a nonprofit group established in 1988 by the family and community leaders. Ms. Henderson runs the foundation, and as a member of the 50th Anniversary Commission, established by Congress to coordinate the commemoration of Brown v. Board of Education, she has been speaking around the country since the anniversary kickoff last year. Ms. Thompson is scheduled for several observances over the next few months.
"It wasn't until I was in college that it really hit me what the court decision meant, and that it had really done something that made a profound change," Ms. Henderson says. "By association, it hit me that this case bears our family name. The import of the case was the first revelation. Secondarily was our connection. It's a legacy, and you come to understand the responsibility that it bears."

HEADLINE: PARENT NOTEBOOK; 
Oops! One More Time

BYLINE:  By John Merrow; John Merrow, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, reports on education for "The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer."

 BODY:
That familiar incumbent chant of campaign seasons -- "four more years" -- takes on frightening new meaning when spoken by a freshly minted college graduate. "Four more years" is what my daughter Kelsey said one night nearly two years ago. I didn't understand.
 "Four more years," she repeated. "I need to go to college all over again." 
 "Don't you mean graduate school?" I asked hopefully.
"No," she said, "I need to start over. I should have majored in music."
Kelsey had just graduated in theater arts from Brown University. Several professors had suggested she study music. "Develop that instrument," one strongly advised after discovering her pure three-octave range. But overwhelmed by inertia, she stuck with theater.
After the shock wore off, I asked two professional singers for advice. Both suggested she take voice lessons and study on her own. I passed that along, but Kelsey wanted to learn to read, write and arrange music, and to do that she needed classes. "I don't want to be someone who just sings whatever's put in front of her," she said.
As far as financial support, I was a "one-term parent," I told her, but that didn't dissuade her. She researched music schools in New York and applied to the one reputed to have the best vocal jazz program. When the New School University (annual cost: $23,000) accepted her, she was ecstatic. She visited the financial aid office, told them she was on her own and asked for help. That night at dinner she was beaming. "They've offered me a $13,000 package."
Gently, I asked, "How much in grants and how much in loans?" It turned out that most was in loans, and the meal suddenly didn't taste so good.
Things took a turn for the worse; because she had already graduated from college, she was not eligible for a federal Pell grant. She would have to pay back just about every dollar in the aid package, and borrow more. "Four more years" was going to cost more than $100,000, a large sum for anyone and a truly staggering amount for an aspiring entertainer.
But Kelsey was determined. She spent the summer tutoring, baby-sitting, braiding horses at horse shows, and substitute teaching. She took care of her cousin's baby in trade for a place to live, her introduction to the barter economy. In September 2002, she became a "re-freshman," but this time she knew what she was in school for. "Dad, this is the best thing I've ever done," she enthused.
At my college reunion in the spring, friends were sympathetic. "Don't you remember how we used to beat ourselves up for not paying attention in college?" they would ask. "We used to wish we could go back again." Luckily, I have never said to Kelsey, "Why didn't you, when you had the chance?" because, like almost everyone who has gone to college, I have plenty of regrets about opportunities I missed. A statistically inclined friend noted that many students take six to eight years to finish their four years, so Kelsey was at the cutting edge of a trend. "Besides," he said, "look at how popular adult education has become; she's just doing now what we'll do later."
Soon Kelsey had dark circles under her eyes, because her new routine of study/go to class/rehearse/perform left little time for sleep. The summer before her second freshman year, she knew six songs. Eighteen months later, she reads, writes and arranges music and has a repertoire of 150, including many of the jazz standards that my parents grew up with.
One night I discovered that Kelsey Gillette Merrow was no longer. She had become Kelsey Jillette. "Everyone kept spelling it 'Marrow,"' she explained (and I know all about that). "What happened to the 'G,"' I asked. "People were mispronouncing it with a hard 'G,' and it sounded awful." So with a new name, Kelsey and her group recorded a CD, which she then hand-delivered to about 100 clubs and restaurants in search of gigs. Most of her gigs are in restaurants, where she has to sing over, around and through conversations, bustling waiters and other distractions.
Kelsey is hardly cavalier about what she's doing. She told me, "I wish I had known at Brown that I could get so much out of a college experience. If I had only known from the start what I was there for, but I didn't." I have come to admire my daughter for having the courage to go down a difficult path. No doubt the fact that she'll end up paying for most of the trip makes every moment valuable. 
She's already broke: even with help (including some from me this year), she will be at least $22,000 in debt by this June. So if you go hear her sing, that is not a tip jar on the piano. It's a tuition jar.

 BODY:
 Nat Gale, 17
Hartford Public High School
(61 percent Hispanic, 33 percent black, 4 percent white, 2 percent other)
 "I know that Sheff v. O'Neill says there is de facto segregation in the school system and they were pushing for students to be bused in and out of Hartford and the suburbs so schools would be integrated. I am the only American-born white person in my senior class at Hartford High. I don't pay it any mind. My circle of friends is so integrated -- Asian, African-Americans, Latino -- all the different colors of the rainbow. In seventh and eighth grade, race was more of a problem because people called me cracker and Saltine. Two weeks into freshman year, people stopped looking at race because there are so many different races at the high school. 
"The balance of race in Hartford schools has changed my education. I get more of a well-rounded view of matters. In my U.S. history class we discussed the shooting of Amadou Diallo. A lot of African-American students were very upset because they thought he was shot because he was black. It was good to get the other perspective; then different arguments are brought to the table.
"I don't think I agree with Sheff v. O'Neill that students in suburban settings have a better education. As soon as you convince students that they want to come to school, they'll learn. I attribute failure to a poor upbringing, where parents or guardians might not have stressed education. If you walk into any classroom where the students are willing to learn in Hartford High, you'll find teachers willing to teach and students immersed in a lesson. Your education is what you make of it."

Nakia Wright, 17
Glastonbury (Conn.) High School
(89 percent white, 4.7 percent Asian, 3 percent Hispanic, 3 percent black)
"My parents felt the school system in Hartford was racially segregated so they sent my brother to live with my aunt in Newington and go to school there. But a friend heard about Project Choice" -- a voluntary program that buses city children to suburban schools -- "so my brother could live at home and still go to Newington. I started in Glastonbury in kindergarten, and have always gone to Glastonbury schools. All the black kids came from my bus; we all grew up together.
"When I was younger I didn't feel different about color, I just felt, like, I went to school out of town. When I was older, people don't like to talk about race so when it came up it is like, wow, I realized people's idea of black people was pretty strange. A lot of people in Glastonbury have racist parents, I couldn't hang out with certain friends or go over to their houses or ride in the car with them and that was, like, wow.
"I catch a school bus at 6:30 in the morning. I spend most of my day in Glastonbury, I hang out with my friends in Glastonbury on the weekends or I'm here at the house because I don't really know anyone around here in Hartford. I got into an argument with a guy I was dating because he said me and my friends thought we were better than Hartford kids. But I told him, I'm from Hartford, too.
"Sometimes I think Hartford schools are underrated. Then I asked my cousin in Hartford what she got on her SAT's and she said she got a 400 combined and I said, 'What! On the whole thing?' Their scores are crazy. Project Choice gave me an opportunity to do something more with myself."

Michael Mitchell, 13
Dr. James H. Naylor School, Hartford
(59 percent Hispanic, 23 percent black, 16 percent white, 2 percent other)
"I don't think race is the problem. I think we need more access, to technology, to more and better books, to clubs, to sports. There was a homework club after school, but that isn't around anymore. I like volleyball, I would like a volleyball team here. There's student council, but it hasn't started yet, because the day it was supposed to start, there was a fight, so they canceled it.
"I like construction. I would like to be an architect. I want to go to college, my mother says get good grades, maybe play football to get some money -- my mother is unemployed right now."

Eliana Perez, 13
"A lot of parents want their kids to be enrolled in Glastonbury because it's so wonderful. They have drama, they have electives we don't have. They have advanced science, they have the chemicals and the dissecting frogs. We don't have leveled books, higher-level books, and we would really like art supplies that are more advanced than white paper and markers. I wish we had home ec. I want to be a chef when I get older.
"Most of my friends are Hispanic. I have African-American girlfriends, but they're not part of my tight crowd. My friends and I are close when we're at school, but we go our separate ways after school. We're very alone. My mother works at Wal-Mart, from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. When I get home from school, my mom is way tired and has a lot to do. So I spend a lot of time in my room, always alone, watching TV, doing homework."

Akeisha Nave, 17
Highland Park High School, Topeka, Kan. (33.8 percent white, 33.7 percent black, 20.5 percent Hispanic, 2.5 percent American Indian/Alaskan, 9.5 other)
"I work in North Topeka at China Inn, and there's not very many black people. They have questions. They see things on TV. Like what do we eat for Thanksgiving. Questions about really good hair or nappy hair. I eat the same thing other people eat for Thanksgiving -- turkey!
"So many people are biracial nowadays, half black, half white. I don't ever see race as a problem -- ever.
I feel like sometimes, just being a minority, I have so many more opportunities. And as part Indian, I get money from the tribe."

Hadley Beier-Green, 14
Topeka High School (56 percent white, 18 percent black, 12 percent Hispanic, 2 percent American Indian/Alaskan, 12 percent other)
"In honors English, there are Asian boys, blacks, whites. We have the same goals, to go to school. College is the next logical step. Economic class, that's almost more of a barrier than race is.
"We say they're wearing their bling. Fake diamond necklaces, cornrows, jumpsuit. P. Diddy clothing line. Or we say they're G -- they're gangster. But people look at me weird because of my clothing style. Stupid preppie blonde girl. I have experienced the same thing: Oh, you shop at the Gap. People get teased for being white, people get teased for being black."

Ashley Aguirre, 17
El Rancho High School, Pico Rivera, Calif. (94.8 percent Hispanic, 2.7 percent white, 2.5 percent other)
"My dad is from Guatemala, so I usually say I'm Latina. If I classified myself just as Mexican-American then I would be eliminating my dad's heritage. Most of my friends are second-generation Mexican-American. None of them are, like, 'I'm all proud of being a Latino.' I don't think anybody really puts a label on themselves anymore. Race isn't an issue.
"I think there are a lot of people at El Rancho who are illegal. They have a right to go to school, too. Everybody should have education available to them. I've heard people make fun of them, like saying, 'Oh, you're a real Mexican.' There's a difference of how Mexican you can be, funny as that may sound. Most of the people that recently came from other countries, they have their own cliques and they all talk to each other, whereas people who have been here and grew up here have their own friends. I guess they feel more comfortable being around the people who came to this country illegally because they can relate to them. They have the same struggles."

R.J. Johnson, 14
Topeka High School
"My great-grandfather was a Black Panther. He didn't teach me the bad things, just the good. Not the violent things. I grew up hearing that stuff. That I'm part of the N.F.L. -- Negro for Life.
"Martin Luther King, to me, is a freedom fighter. He did nonviolent things. I don't feel comfortable with people hitting at me and not hitting back. As a freedom marcher, maybe they should have fought back just a little bit so people would know that just because we're a different color doesn't mean we're not going to fight for our rights.
"In Arkansas, when I was little, my dad would ask for directions and they would just look at him like he was crazy. I said, 'Maybe they didn't hear you.'
I didn't really understand. But now I do. It still goes on, throughout your whole life. It makes me angry. If you don't like me, I'm not going to like you. We have to try a step harder. 
"But it's slowly fading away. I went to a primarily all-white middle school and had no problems there. I think it's more adults that need to work on it than us. They're the ones teaching it to us."

HEADLINE: A Poor Cousin of the Middle Class 

BYLINE:  By David K. Shipler; David K. Shipler is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and a former New York Times correspondent. This article is adapted from "The Working Poor: Invisible in America," copyright 2004 by David K. Shipler, to be published in February by Alfred A. Knopf.

 BODY:
Caroline Payne embraces the ethics of America. She works hard and has no patience with those who don't. She has owned a house, pursued an education and deferred to the needs of her child. Yet she can barely pay her bills. Her earnings have hovered in a twilight between poverty and minimal comfort, usually between $8,000 and $12,000 a year.
 She is the invisible American, unnoticed because she blends in. Like millions at the bottom of the labor force who contribute to the country's prosperity, Caroline's diligence is a camouflage. At the convenience store where she works, customers do not see that she struggles against destitution. 
 Others of the unseen sew clothes, clean offices and harvest fruit. They serve Big Macs and stack merchandise at Wal-Mart. In a California factory, they package lights for kids' bikes. In a New Hampshire plant, they assemble books of wallpaper samples. 
They cannot afford the wallpaper themselves, just as the man who washes cars does not own one. The assistant teacher cannot pay the fees to put her own children in the day-care center where she works. The clerk in the back room of a bank, filing canceled checks, may have $2.02 in her own account, as Caroline had when she briefly did that job. The clientele never saw her. She was out of sight, part of the hidden America.
Always in search of something better somewhere else, Caroline has moved from job to job, from place to place, from New England to Florida and back -- and now to Indiana -- without anchoring herself solidly in a community that can offer support. 
Just over a year after arriving in Muncie, where she lives in a small apartment in a public housing project, she remains unconnected. "I don't know many people here still," she told me recently. "I just get out to go to work and do errands." Her hours at the store provide only a trickle of cash. "I just can't get ahead," she declared. "There's no good jobs, and I'm just not happy here." She has spent her life in perpetual motion while standing still.
Futility has nagged at Caroline for a long time. Four years ago, at the dawn of the new millennium, she sat at her kitchen table in Claremont, N.H., and added up her life. It was the height of the economic boom. The nation wallowed in luxury, burst with microchips, consumed with abandon, swaggered globally. Everything grew larger: homes, vehicles, stock portfolios, life expectancy. Never before in the sweep of human history had so many people been so utterly comfortable.
Caroline was not one of them. She had achieved two of her three goals. She had earned a college diploma (a two-year associate's degree), and she had gone from a homeless shelter into her own house (owned mostly by a bank). The third objective, "a good paying job," as she put it, still eluded her. Back in the mid-70's, she earned $6 an hour in a Vermont factory that made plastic cigarette lighters and cases for Gillette razors. A quarter century later, she earned $6.80 an hour stocking shelves and working cash registers at a vast Wal-Mart superstore.
"And that's sad," she declared. "I'm only making 80 cents more than I did more than 20 years ago." Or less, taking into account the rise in the cost of living. 
She was not the victim of racial discrimination; she was white. She was not lazy; she was caustic about colleagues who were. She was punctual, rarely out sick, willing to do night shifts and assiduous in her work habits. The Wal-Mart manager, Mark Brown, called her "a nice lady" with lots of enthusiasm. "She's self-driven," he observed. "She's always willing to learn and better herself. She's got potential. She can definitely move up."
But she did not move up. She had never moved up. And that ceased to amaze her; it had been going on for so long, in job after job after job. She was astonished only by Mark Brown's praise. "I'm surprised," she remarked when I told her what he said. She was stacking blank videotapes on a shelf. "I didn't think they liked me here. People don't usually say nice things about me."
Somewhere along this track that leads nowhere, a good many Americans give up on the dream. They sink back onto welfare, or they stop imagining themselves as foremen or managers. Caroline was then 50, with so many years of disappointment that her bouts of depression, for which she was occasionally treated, seemed unsurprising.
Still, she kept striving. She called herself "luckylady" in her e-mail address. She said, "Have a wonderful day," on her answering machine. She did not have big thoughts about corporate profits or dark judgments about society's unfairness. She just tried for basic financial security. Her persistence played like a dissonant melody against the monotone of job stagnation.
Again and again, she applied to manage one sales department or another at Wal-Mart, and again and again she was passed over in favor of men -- or, she observed wryly, women who were younger and slimmer.
"I work my butt off, excuse my language," she said sharply. "I'm there most of the time, but that don't matter to them." She was paid a dollar an hour more during nighttime shifts, nothing close to what her flexibility was worth to a store that stayed open around the clock. Trying to get ahead, she always made herself available to change hours and fill in, even during evenings when she had to leave her 14-year-old daughter, Amber, home alone. Without a car, Caroline had a 20-minute walk each way, trekking back and forth at odd times of night in all kinds of weather. One cold February day, walking gingerly along icy streets, worried about her temperamental back, she trudged from her house to her job at her normal time of 10 a.m., only to be told to come for a shift beginning at 1 p.m. instead. So she made her way home and then returned to the store: three trips consuming one hour before earning her first dime of the day.
The people who received promotions tended to have something that Caroline did not. They had teeth. Caroline's teeth had succumbed to poverty, to the years when she could not afford a dentist. Most of them decayed and abscessed, and when she lived on welfare in Florida, she had them all pulled in a grueling two-hour session that left her looking bruised and beaten. Under the state's Medicaid rules as she understood them, a set of dentures would have been covered only if she had been without any teeth at all; while some of them could have been saved, she couldn't afford to do less than everything. In the end, the dentures paid for by Medicaid didn't fit and made her gag, so she couldn't wear them. An adjustment would have cost about $250, money she didn't have.
Probably no employer would ever admit to passing her over because she was missing that radiant, tooth-filled smile that Americans have been taught to prize as highly as their right to vote. Caroline had learned to smile with her whole face, a sweet look that didn't show her gums, yet it came across as wistful, something less than the thousand-watt beam of friendly delight that the culture requires. Where showing teeth was an unwritten part of the job description, she did not excel. She was turned down for a teller's position with the Claremont Savings Bank, which then hired her for back-room filing and eventually fired her from that. Wal-Mart considered her for customer-service manager and then promoted someone else, someone with teeth.
Caroline's is the face of the working poor, marked by a poverty-generated handicap more obvious than most deficiencies but no different, really, from the less visible deficits that reflect and reinforce destitution. If she were not poor, she would not have lost her teeth, and if she had not lost her teeth, perhaps she would not have remained poor. Poverty is a peculiar, insidious thing, not just one problem but a constellation of problems: not just inadequate wages but also inadequate education, not just dead-end jobs but also limited abilities, not just insufficient savings but also unwise spending, not just the lack of health insurance but also the lack of healthy households. The villains are not just exploitative employers but also incapable employees, not just overworked teachers but also defeated and unruly pupils, not just bureaucrats who cheat the poor but also the poor who cheat themselves.
Caroline has been caught in a web of childhood, marital and educational restraints that intertwined with the ruthless efficiencies of the free market. Her father, a school janitor, and her mother, an occasional factory worker, moved repeatedly around New England to find work. She was yanked from school to school like "nothing but a piece of furniture being shoved around in all directions," she once wrote in an essay. She didn't remember her mother ever reading to her.
When her father walked out, a seed of distrust was planted. "We didn't have a lot of love and security that kids need," she said. Nor was there material plenty, and long after that early void, neediness remained. "I always wanted things," she admitted. "I can get spending and overdo things sometimes."
Her mother remarried when Caroline was 12 or 13. "My stepdad drank a lot," she recalled. "He tried to touch me and French-kissed me, and I didn't like it," she said. "I was scared and never told my mom, you know? And I got to the point where I hit him."
Two months after graduating from high school -- the only one of three siblings to do so -- Caroline married. "Now there's times I wished I hadn't," she declared. "I think it was so easy for me to latch onto people because I haven't had lots of love and security and communication and things. It was almost like if a guy gave me affection, I'd latch onto almost like the first one that come along. And that's not good. I've learnt over the years, it's not good."
The marriage produced three children, lasted 14 years and finally sank into a swamp of suspicions that her husband was unfaithful. Because she could not afford a lawyer and just wanted out, she ended up with only $400 a month in child support and a modest amount for her share in their house. So she moved with her children into a small apartment and bounced between welfare and dead-end jobs, supplementing her income by scavenging for cans. "We'd go and watch a ballgame at school, and I'd take bags and stuff them in my pocketbook," she recalled. "After the ballgame I'd be going around poring through the garbage cans picking out 5-cent cans." Her first daughter would ride her bike as far ahead of her mother as possible to avoid any hint of association. "I figured that a few cents buys some milk, buys some bread, things that you need, you know what I'm saying? It all helps. But it embarrassed her. She hated it as she got older."
Alone with her children and scared, Caroline married again. This time, it was worse. Vernon Payne insulted her, hit her and flew into jealous rages. Her boys chose to live with their father, her girl with a family friend. The marriage lasted two years. "At times I hated men," she said. "Men were no good, they just lied, and you're not gonna tell me no different." Here she fell into a nationwide pattern. Half of all poor families in America are headed by single mothers, many of whom carry wounds inflicted by men -- and so crave but cannot create loving partnerships. Besides the emotional cost of failed relationships, the economic price is high -- for a single mother is also a single wage earner.
Determined to move up, Caroline applied for good office jobs and, when she failed to be hired, called to find out why. The answer was always the same: the winning candidate had a college degree. So she decided to get one, too. Gathering credits from community colleges in Vermont and Florida, she ended up with a two-year associate's degree in office technology and information processing. She also ran up a debt of $17,000 in student loans, a sum that rose to $20,000 as she deferred payments. It turned out to be a bad investment; she never landed a job in her field of training, never got one that required anything more than a high-school diploma. A full bachelor's degree would have been a door-opening credential, of course, but the associate's degree proved useless.
Perhaps if Caroline's personal life had been stable and content, she could have concentrated more intently on her work; perhaps she could have found the focus to stay in a job long enough to advance. But family turbulence can rarely be walled out of the workplace. An employer may tolerate a distracted employee who has crucial skills or a powerful position, but Caroline had no such capital to purchase a boss's patience.
As her life at home got tense, her life at work got perilous. That meant marginal performance, no promotions and a rolling career of short stays in jobs with no accumulation of seniority. "You're all nerved up, you're stressed, you don't know what somebody's gonna pull on you next," she said. Even at the factory in the middle of the night, she would cry and cry, "and people would know things were wrong."
Her fourth child, Amber, was born into the troubled second marriage. Except for a clubfoot, she seemed normal -- petite and dark-haired, sweet and cheerful. Only gradually did telltale signs point to the profound disability that was confirmed when she was tested in first grade: an I.Q. of 59. Her score was in the low range of mild mental retardation, a handicap more prevalent in lower-income households. Although the cause was unclear, Caroline's pregnancy had been marked by two factors known to affect brain development: she had not eaten nutritiously, and she had smoked.
If mild retardation is also caused partly by emotional assaults, as some scientists believe, then Amber may have been susceptible. As a toddler, she seemed upset by visits to her father. Caroline once saw redness around her genitals. She took her daughter to the hospital, where doctors confirmed that the girl had been penetrated. Police were called, a restraining order was issued against the father and Caroline escaped with her daughter from Vermont to Florida, where relatives lived.
There she repeated her parents' rootless syndrome. She moved from place to place in New Port Richey, Fla. -- a tiny apartment, a trailer with a woman friend, a filthy trailer of her own, a place with a male friend, another trailer -- then to a cousin's in Winter Haven, back to New Port Richey and finally back north to New Hampshire, where she moved a few times from one school district to another. Amber was thus deprived of consistent, special education that might have helped. By ninth grade, Caroline estimated, her daughter had been in seven or eight schools, "like this little rag doll that just got brought anywhere," said Brenda St. Laurence, a home visitor in a program to advise impoverished parents. Unless Caroline resisted her urge to keep moving, St. Laurence told her, teachers and counselors could never get to know Amber well enough to provide fruitful attention.
If Caroline had drawn up a resume, it would have been impressive only in its length, documenting the passage from one treadmill to another. She worked in a clothing factory in New Hampshire, sewing for $6 an hour. She was laid off. She worked a few hours a week at the homeless shelter where she had lived, helping people apply for a fuel-assistance program. When winter ended, she was out of a job, so she worked at Tambrands, a factory that made Tampax, for $6.50.
Sitting for hours at a time, she began to get acute pain in her legs and finally went to the emergency room. Her back was the cause. "And so the doctor says: 'I want you to take one night off and rest as much as you can. Stay off your feet. Stay off your legs."' She called Tambrands, owned by Procter & Gamble, to tell them she wouldn't be in on Sunday because of her back. Monday morning the temp agency called: she had lost her job. So she returned to the sewing factory and was laid off two or three times. Working at the edge of poverty means working on the coldest side of corporate America.
Her fondest dream, to own a house, shimmered elusively across an arid landscape of meager wages. Nothing in the numbers added up. Yet just by being in the working world, she was assembling an essential structure of attributes to open a door to a mortgage. They included a record of diligence on the job and connections with people of influence. Furthermore, because of Amber's disability, she had a reliable monthly check from Social Security -- a rare asset among low-wage workers.
The main person of influence, Caroline's employer at a thrift shop, was a friend of the president of the Sugar River Savings Bank, who met Caroline and told her boss, "She seems like the type of woman who would go hungry to pay the bill." Not quite. She had several outstanding bills and spent a year paying and burnishing her credit record while the house she wanted stayed unsold.
The snug, gray clapboard building, built in 1891, was nestled among others on a street in Claremont, N.H. In a different place at a different time, the house would have been considered quaint and charming enough to be worth plenty. But sitting in a sad, old neighborhood near the center of a New England town that had been left behind, it was worth just $37,000 when Caroline discovered it in 1997. With $1,000 from her income-tax refund to cover closing costs, she became the owner -- along with the Sugar River Savings Bank.
When the mortgage was approved, it didn't hurt that $514 a month was being deposited directly from Social Security into an account at Sugar River Savings, from which the mortgage payment would be automatically withdrawn, leaving a low balance but ensuring the bank its payment. Because Amber would eventually inherit the house, Caroline reasoned, it was a legitimate use of the funds. But it was also a terrible fact that a mortgage would not have been available without Amber's handicap.
Caroline had never felt such a satisfied sense of possession and autonomy. She proudly conducted a tour: the two beige couches in the living room, the flowery wallpaper, the yellow curtains, the old TV set and VCR, Fluffy the cat with a red collar and a bell, the pantry and storeroom behind the kitchen, her adult son's crossbow for deer hunting, the cellar with a washer and dryer and oil furnace, the upstairs where colorful afghans she had crocheted lay folded waiting to be given to Amber's teacher and school-bus driver and principal for Christmas.
It also needed improvements, for which she managed to get grants from a federal program that would install new siding, repaint the trim and remove lead paint inside. She needed a second mortgage for $19,000 as well to replace the windows, the doors and the roof. Somehow, she would have to move up the pay scale at Wal-Mart, where she was then working.
Anyone who walked all the way around the outside of the Wal-Mart superstore on Route 103 would walk a mile, Caroline said. The place was immense. But it didn't seem to have room for Caroline to progress. She bounced from one department to another, from one shift to another, while her pay stayed within a narrow range, beginning at $6.15 an hour, going to $6.80, sometimes up to $7.50 if she worked at night. So unpredictable were her hours that she couldn't work a second job to help her cash flow. She kept applying for higher positions and kept hearing that she needed a bit more experience. When asked to work odd shifts, "I never said no to them," she insisted. "But why couldn't they have the decency to pay me a little bit more?"
She won recognition. "I did make Cashier of the Month for November," she reported happily, for collecting more than $1,500 for the World War II veterans memorial in Washington. She also persuaded customers who checked out at her register to buy a total of 72 tickets to a Boston Bruins game to raise money for the Claremont Fire Department, and that won her a weekend getaway from Pepsi. She could take herself and three other people to a paid stay in any Marriott she chose, anywhere.
"But I have to get there," she said, and she had no money to travel. So Hawaii never entered her mind, not even New York; she considered only places in New Hampshire. "I think there's one up here in Lebanon," she said. "If I could get somebody to take me to Manchester, Amber likes to look at the malls. I've never been down there. Just to look at things." In the end, she and Amber rode with a friend north to a hotel in Bethlehem, N.H., where they visited a small shopping center in North Conway. For $31.99, Caroline bought a winter coat to replace a jacket that she had torn two years before.
Her anemic paycheck failed to improve. The Wal-Mart manager who liked her, Mark Brown, was transferred, and no promotion seemed in the offing. When a temp agency found her a $7.50-an-hour job assembling books of wallpaper samples, she took pleasure in telling Wal-Mart's assistant manager that she was leaving. "I'm just hoping they'll be sorry someday," Caroline said.
Unwittingly, Caroline then stepped into the vortex that drags numbers of low-wage single mothers down into the great chasm between decent work and decent parenting, a place where a child's safety has to be balanced against survival in the labor market.
After a month at the wallpaper plant, the temp agency offered Caroline a job back at the Tampax factory for $10 an hour, the most she had ever earned. She took it, but there was a problem: Procter & Gamble had organized the factory on rotating shifts. One week she left the house at 5:30 a.m. and got home at 2:30 p.m., the next week she was gone from 1:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., and the third from 9:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. Putting aside the question of sleep, stamina and the basic requirements of an orderly life, the swing shifts raised havoc with Caroline's arrangements for Amber. Unable to find care, she very reluctantly left the girl home alone during her evening and nighttime shifts.
While Caroline was running machines that put packages of tampons into boxes, she was worrying about Amber, and with good cause. At 14, Amber could barely read and write, could not easily tell time from clocks with hands, and was unable to understand that she had enough money if she gave a storekeeper $10 to buy something for $4. Yet she could play the flute if her mother wrote the letter for each note on the musical score. She took gymnastics lessons at a dance school, for which her mother paid by cleaning the school's studio once a week. She also had epilepsy, and the risk of a seizure prompted doctors to advise that she not be left alone for long. The logistical maze of arranging care for Amber around constantly shifting hours of work had Caroline tangled in anxiety.
Amber happened to tell her teacher how scary it was being home alone after dark. The teacher was alarmed and threatened to report Caroline for neglect. "She can't take care of herself," said Donald R. Hart, the principal of Claremont Middle School. "We have a legal obligation to report if neglect is going on." He raised the issue with his "wrap-around team," comprising a school psychologist, a local counseling agency representative, a juvenile protection worker and a guidance counselor. "I've asked them what is out there for services for Amber while Mom is working," he reported, "and there is just nothing out there."
Faced with the threat of being reported to the state's child protection agency, Caroline stopped going to work, started working the phones trying to find care for Amber and came up empty-handed. 
"I'm trying to do the best I can and get caught up on little bills," she said. "And now I don't have a job, and I'm gonna have to go apply for welfare. You pull yourself up, and then somebody has to knock you down. If I don't work, it's neglect: not feeding or clothing my child."
Perhaps the most curious and troubling facet of this confounding puzzle was everybody's failure to pursue the most obvious solution: if the factory had just let Caroline work day shifts, her problem would have disappeared. She asked a supervisor and got brushed off, but nobody else -- not the school principal, not the doctor, not the myriad agencies she contacted -- nobody in the profession of helping thought to pick up the phone and appeal to the factory manager or the foreman or anybody else in authority at her workplace.
Indeed, this solemn regard for the employer as untouchable and beyond the realm of persuasion unless in violation of the law permeates the culture of American antipoverty efforts, with only a few exceptions. The most socially minded physicians and psychologists who treat malnourished children, for example, will advocate vigorously with government agencies to provide food stamps, health insurance, housing and the like. But when they are asked if they ever urge the parents' employers to raise wages enough to pay for nutritious food, the doctors express surprise at the notion. First, it has never occurred to them, and second, it seems hopeless. Wages and hours are set by the marketplace, and you cannot expect magnanimity from the marketplace. It is the final arbiter from which there is no appeal.
Caroline faced a cruel choice. Amber was chafing against the limits of her schooling in Claremont, one of New Hampshire's poorest communities. She hungered to read, but the high school provided only one hour of tutoring a week. She craved more math than she could get. She yearned to be in the main part of the school, not in the vocational wing, where she felt students were stigmatized by teachers as stupid.
When a counselor at the community center appealed to school officials to give Amber intensive instruction, she said, "they laughed at me." Perhaps they wouldn't have laughed if Caroline had been able to afford a psychologist or a lawyer to bring pressure, as the affluent must often do.
Since she could not buy services, she tried her old pattern, her parents' pattern, of geographical escape. She sent Amber to live temporarily with her daughter-in-law in Muncie, Ind., where the schools were reputedly better. By September, Amber was in higher-level special-ed classes in Muncie; on the phone, she sounded ecstatic, so Caroline decided to follow.
To leave, however, she had to sell her precious house, for she could not comfortably rent it out from a distance. Tenants might do damage, and she had no money to travel back and forth to oversee repairs. It took a few months to find a buyer who would invest $79,000 in this struggling town, the minimum Caroline needed to break even. In the end, she made nothing, not a penny, she said sadly. "I gave it away."
She had maintained and improved the house sensibly for the long term, but she spent more on it than it was worth in the end. She still owed $34,000 on the first mortgage, and the second mortgage of $19,000 carried a prepayment penalty, which forced her to pay just over $20,000 to get out of it. The federal grants of $17,000 required prorated reimbursement of $16,000 because she hadn't lived in the house long enough. After adding the agent's fee, taxes and other closing costs, she ended up short $300, which the agent kindly absorbed. Five and a half years of mortgage and interest payments had yielded nothing, and one of her dreams was gone.
As the New Hampshire winter arrived after Thanksgiving, Caroline left with pockets nearly empty. To escape from $10,000 to $12,000 in credit-card debt, she had declared bankruptcy earlier that year, much to her shame. She could not even afford to rent a truck without a $700 loan from her older daughter. A couple of friends donated their vacation time to drive the truck and Caroline to Indiana, by way of a slashing blizzard in upstate New York. She was on the move again, as she had been since childhood, but she was happy to see a little of the country.
Muncie has not been gentle, though. She found her first, shabby apartment in a neighborhood riddled with drug dealers and prostitutes, her first job in a convenience store at $5.45 an hour, a downward slide from the Vermont plastics factory in the 1970's. In April she moved into a two-bedroom apartment in a newer, safer public housing project, but she can't get more than part-time work at the store, for about $10,000 a year.
She has a new set of dentures, courtesy of $400 from Medicaid, plus a $322 loan from her older daughter. She is still trying to get used to wearing them. She misses her house and her friends in New Hampshire. "I used to go out with some of the girls, you know," she recalled. In Muncie, "I don't get out much," she said. "I'm broke."
Furthermore, the reason for the move now seems less certain. Amber's courses are more challenging, but her big, urban school is tough and full of fights. And testing in Muncie confirmed the diagnosis in Claremont: Amber will never learn to read.
Money may not always cure, but it can often insulate one problem from another. Parents of means could have addressed Amber's handicaps without uprooting themselves and discarding their assets. They could have purchased services; brought their own skills to bear and walled off their house, their jobs and their lifestyle from the intrusion of hardship. In the house of the poor, however, the walls are thin and fragile, and troubles seep into one another.
Into Caroline's spirit, hopes also filter. Her latest is that WorkOne, a job-training agency, will pay $403 for a course to make her a certified nursing assistant. She knows she would do well in a nursing home. "I've got the personality," she said. "It's helping people, and I feel sorry for them."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Condo or Rental? Tough Call for Apartment Builders

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
FOR developers who build multifamily housing in New Jersey, there is one particularly dicey decision to be made before shovels hit dirt: condos or rentals? With the rental market still somewhat depressed -- even along the Hudson River Gold Coast -- and the condo market still buoyed by low interest rates, a logical assumption would be that for-sale units are the best way to go right now.
 Not necessarily, say a number of large developers. Some cite their particular company's need for a diverse portfolio. Others see a niche in providing whatever is least available in a given community. And some, alert to signs that the overall economy is improving, see rentals as the next wave. 
 Take the REMI Companies of Hoboken. It began by specializing in condos a decade ago when that was going against the tide in most communities, particularly along the Gold Coast, which was then rapidly developing, said REMI's principal, Erik A. Kaiser. But about 18 months ago, the company began planning a 100-unit apartment building on a waterfront site in Hudson County that its market analysts deemed particularly attractive to renters. 
Then, when rentals were suffering during the worst of the two-year economic downturn and the condo market became exceedingly hot, Mr. Kaiser said, the plan was switched to condos. Now, as the foundation is about to be laid, the project is being reconsidered as a rental building, he said.
"All of our current data says the rental market is starting to heat up," said Mr. Kaiser, who did not want to identify the site of the 100-unit project because REMI is renegotiating with lenders. "By next summer, I see an extremely hot rental market. The job market is heating up; Wall Street firms are hiring again. Bonuses are up. There is job growth throughout the market for the 20-to-30 age group, and they are the renters," said Mr. Kaiser, only 33 himself.
He predicted that as the members of the college class of 2005 graduate and are hired, rentals will surge. "Developers need to be preparing for that now, 18 months out," said Mr. Kaiser. "Some developers have always stuck with rental, because it's generally a reliable income producer, but during the last two years, the rental guys who got hurt have had to smarten up really fast."
Mr. Kaiser said his company "sat on the sideline" for about six months during the downturn and then decided to "put a lot of condos into the pipeline." REMI currently has $150 million in condominium projects planned, he said. But Mr. Kaiser said he worried about the downside to that. "My fear is that the stock market comes back and interest rates go up," he said, "and then, what happens to buyers?"
REMI has done well with a 19-unit, high-end condo called the Crossing that it built last year in Hoboken. There are only a handful of two- to four-bedroom units left to sell, although at $335,000 to $910,000, they are relatively pricey for Hoboken.
Mr. Kaiser said REMI designs all of its buildings for easy conversion from for-sale to rental or vice versa. "The main thing," he said, "is you need to be superlightning fast on your feet."
Other developers agreed with that, but said it led them to a variety of conclusions. 
The KOR Companies, a diversified builder, is about to open a preconstruction sales office for 113 upscale condominiums in Jersey City that were originally planned as rental apartments. Construction is to begin in March at the project, called Montgomery Greene, a 19-story building featuring lofts, studios and one- and two-bedroom units that will also include 4,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space and a parking garage.
Prices for the condos will range from the low $200,000's to the low $600,000's -- and higher for penthouses -- said KOR's president, Harry Kantor, whose firm is a partner with a private real estate company, Time Equities, on the project.
About two and a half years ago when planning began for Montgomery Greene, the rental market in Hoboken was sizzling, Mr. Kantor said, and it was designed as a rental building. "Quickly after 9/11 happened, a lot things changed," he said. "The paradigm shifted, as they say, and the rental market softened. There was a drop of between 15 and 20 percent in rentals. It became difficult to analyze how long it would take for vacancies to be absorbed, and difficult to finance construction of new rental units."
New Jersey's Gold Coast has been a developing center for high-rent apartments for about a decade, he observed. "But suddenly, there was a compelling vacuum created in the market," Mr. Kantor said. "Except for a few low-rise condo buildings, there was no product to own."
KOR moved quickly in late 2001 to have its architects, Lindemon Winckelmann Deupree Martin & Associates, begin redesigning Montgomery Greene, upgrading amenities, increasing ceiling heights and rearranging layouts for more open views of Manhattan. "We wanted the people who come in to really feel this is something superior," Mr. Kantor said, "something they want to own."
It has taken about 18 months to reconfigure the building plans and to refinance the project as condos, he said. But Mr. Kantor said it is still an excellent time for creating a new condo building in the Gold Coast area, with interest rates still at record lows, motivating people to buy rather than rent.
Another huge condo project -- 832 units -- is in the early stages of planning for Hoboken. Pinnacle Downtown, a subsidiary of the Pinnacle Group of Companies, which has a contract to purchase the former Maxwell House factory site on the waterfront off Frank Sinatra Boulevard, is proposing a $500 million mixed-use development with 210,000 square feet of retail and professional office space and 1,500 parking spaces, near the PATH train and ferry stations.
Meanwhile, the Applied Property Company, based in Hoboken, has a number of high-rise multifamily projects under way or in the planning stages -- some for-sale units, some rental units, and in some cases both types of units in the same project. 
"It's tricky," said Michael Barry, president of the concern, the homebuilding arm of the Applied Companies. "The more option time we can give ourselves with respect to deciding on condo or rental, the better. Once you decide, construction takes a year to two years, and a lot can happen. The crucial thing for us is to maintain a good balance between the two."
At its multiphase waterfront development in Hoboken, the Shipyard, Applied began construction of a new building called the Sovereign last spring -- and is still weighing its options. 
"We just finished a rental building, the Independence, at the Shipyard," Mr. Barry noted. "We have the two Constitution buildings -- one rental and one condo. We are now considering whether to go condo with the Sovereign or convert the Constitution rental to condo."
Because of the time that construction takes, Mr. Barry said he was leaning toward converting the existing Constitution to condo and building the Sovereign as rental. "The Constitution building is a known entity in a marketplace we are familiar with right now," he said. "We could, in a much shorter time frame than it will take to build the Sovereign, go to sale. Then, if the for-sale market continues strong relative to rental while the Sovereign is under construction, maybe we would switch."
One drawback to converting an existing rental building to condo, though, Mr. Barry said, is that property taxes typically rise sharply.
In Long Branch, an oceanfront community in southern New Jersey, Mr. Barry said, Applied has been marketing 280 town homes and condos that are being built in partnership with Matzel & Mumford, another large home developer. Two blocks away, Applied is putting up 320 rental units. Long Branch is in the midst of town-sponsored redevelopment, Mr. Barry said, and town authorities believe there is a need for both rental and condominium housing.
At its massive Port Liberte development in Jersey City, Mr. Barry said, "The market has plenty of rental, and we are continuing to build and sell town homes and condos."
MEANWHILE, Applied has nearly completed construction of 300 rental units in New Brunswick, in a joint venture with Matrix and Roseland, two other companies. "That particular market has a strong demand for rental," he said. "There is a lot of corporate presence and university presence that generate a good demand for rental units."
The Kushner Companies maintains rental properties as the core of its business, no matter what the economy is doing, said the managing partner, Jeffrey Freireich, because they provide reliable cash flow. Late last year, Kushner completed construction of the Mews at Annandale, an 18-unit complex of three-bedroom rental units in the historic section of Clinton Township in Hunterdon County -- the only rental project for miles around, according to Mr. Freireich.
On the other hand, Kushner recently began construction of the Horizons in East Brunswick, 148 units for "active adults" -- meaning tenants must be at least age 55 -- as condominiums. The project was first planned as rentals, and the switch was made just before construction began.
"In that situation, we find real strength in the condo market," Mr. Freireich said. "We also own other projects in the East Brunswick area -- we recently purchased Renaissance at Cranbury Crossing -- and we think the new project presents a good opportunity to balance our portfolio." Renaissance at Cranbury Crossing, with 182 units, including some town houses, is another condo project for tenants age 55 and over. 
"You have to take it case by case," he said. "There's no other way to do it."

HEADLINE: Remaking, or Preserving, the City's Face 

BYLINE:  By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
FLICKERING before Amanda M. Burden, the city planning commissioner, was a vision of New York City of the future. A computer animation showed the view from a car driving toward the Greenpoint waterfront in Brooklyn. The industrial buildings were gone, replaced by a stately procession of five- and six-story brick and stone apartment buildings, culminating in high-rise towers scattered along a wide landscaped promenade along the East River.
 Then she moved on to a cardboard and Lucite model showing a far West Side of offices and apartments in oddly shaped towers and spires rising along a midblock park between 10th and 11th Avenues stretching from 34th to 39th Streets, part of the Hudson Yards development. 
 In another room was a view of the High Line, the long-abandoned elevated freight railway in West Chelsea, with a description of a complex plan to turn it into a landscaped promenade that could link up with the planned park in Hudson Yards. As part of the plan, owners of nearby properties would be able to sell air rights -- enabling new structures to be larger than zoning would otherwise allow -- to developers of new buildings. 
Down the hall, she pointed out drawings and zoning maps for a planned office and residential center in section of Downtown Brooklyn where height limitations and design guidelines were choreographed, sometimes building by building, to create what she called "a sense of place, a great place."
These plans are among seven separate projects that are on display through Jan. 30 at the Center for Architecture at 536 La Guardia Place. They show a city transformed, but they are only a small fraction of the planning projects and zoning proposals under study or recently adopted across the city in a burst of activity not seen in many years, planners say. "We are creating the conditions for growth where the city can handle it," Commissioner Burden said, "while preserving the character of neighborhoods."
According to members of the small universe of people who follow the intricacies of city zoning policies, from representatives of the real estate industry to neighborhood advocates who sometimes oppose them, the Bloomberg administration has brought renewed energy to the planning process, working with communities across the city in drafting master plans and refining broadly drawn zoning maps, neighborhood by neighborhood, and sometimes block by block.
For better or worse, these proposals could shape the quality of life and economic vitality of the city for decades into the future. And though they are hugely ambitious, some planners worry that not enough broad thinking has been done about what is being created for future generations of New Yorkers.
In some neighborhoods -- the far West Side, Downtown Brooklyn, Long Island City -- planners looking decades ahead are creating development rights for new high-rise office buildings, despite a recent glut of office space. 
In others -- Staten Island, Throgs Neck in the Bronx, Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn and from College Point to Kew Gardens in Queens -- they are assuring that the city of the future looks pretty much as it does now. In these places, the department is celebrating the detached one- and two-family house and the surrounding low-rise neighborhoods, putting in place new restrictive rules that put limits on new apartment buildings and town houses, in the name of neighborhood preservation. 
"They have done more rezoning of the waterfront and made more efforts outside Manhattan to modernize and encourage the reuse of industrial property than has ever occurred," said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University.
And Michael Schill, a law professor and director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at N.Y.U., said: "You are seeing major planning for lots of areas. Every now and then you get to a period when you say the face of the city may be changed forever." 
The municipal archives are full of master plans that never produced a spoonful of mortar, and it could be many years before the final fate of some of the rezoning plans is known. For example, the Hudson Yards plan may require billions in public investment before a new office center goes up. The tall buildings with public promenades envisioned for the Greenpoint waterfront will be expensive, and such projects may be feasible only when market rents or sale prices are even higher than they are now.
Yet some planners worry that the New York City of the future envisioned by city planners and the Bloomberg administration has not embraced some issues critical to the city's future: integrating affordable housing in the new neighborhoods, for example, and preserving manufacturing zones with rents low enough to keep businesses in New York.
And builders who are in the midst of a boom in residential construction outside Manhattan complain that the administration has been too quick to downzone large sections of the city, reducing the size of buildings that can be built in many low-rise neighborhoods. This has the effect of making housing lots larger and more expensive and reducing the supply of housing that is unsubsidized but affordable, especially for members of minority groups seeking their first homes.
R. Randy Lee, a builder who is chairman of the Building Industry Association of New York City, a trade group, said that on Staten Island, builders had lost the ability to build any new town houses or apartments. "Right now the downzonings are rubber stamped -- good, bad or indifferent," he said. "It is hard to pinpoint this as racially motivated, but the effect is de facto segregation."

Zoning New York
A System Set Up in 1916
Zoning is a system to regulate land use that limits the right of landowners to do what they want with their property in order to protect public health, safety, morals and general welfare. It began in New York in 1916, a year after the 42-story Equitable Building went up on lower Broadway, raising objections from nearby owners.
The original regulations, as well as a major revision in 1961, divided the city into residential zones and manufacturing zones to keep busy warehouses and noisy, smelly factories away from homes, and set broad rules for each category in neighborhoods across the city.
Almost as soon as the zoning codes took effect, the major thrust of zoning policy shifted to deciding on requests for exceptions. The code was modified to provide more fine-grained distinctions within neighborhoods and to reflect changes across the city as well. 
During the Giuliani administration, the planning staff and its chairman, Joseph B. Rose, worked mightily on a vast third citywide revision of the zoning code, but the effort was eventually dropped by City Hall after the real estate industry objected.
Although Mr. Rose said that the department continued to work on many other major projects, some approved only in the last year, many in and outside the agency said that other projects, particularly outside Manhattan, made little progress. They said that under the Bloomberg administration, planning received a high priority, and planners returned to detailed neighborhood by neighborhood studies in all five boroughs, negotiating design guidelines and new zoning maps.
Now that approach has led to custom-tailored zoning regulations. In East Harlem zoning was increased last summer on the avenues to support a new generation of 12-story apartment houses, while the scale of the row houses on side streets was protected.
In Staten Island a plan proposed last month by the mayor would require off-street parking for two cars for each single-family house, and three spaces for a two-family house -- and give a space bonus for steeply peaked roofs. Planners are also working with community groups in the borough on plans for a vast new city park on the site of the Fresh Kills Landfill.
Although some crucial projects are in the works in Manhattan below 96th Street, from the huge Hudson Yards project to a fine-grained rezoning of West Chelsea, much of the new effort has followed the revitalization of the housing market in the boroughs outside Manhattan, where planners say they are laying the groundwork for the next generation of office development and tens of thousands of new jobs too.
Just as the Equitable Building led to the creation of the original zoning plan, new out-of-scale developments -- what planners sometimes call "sore thumb buildings" -- have led community leaders from Throgs Neck to Bay Ridge to ask for zoning help.
"We are seeing six- to seven-story apartment buildings where there is a lot of detached housing, and that is of concern to us," said Regina Meyer, the director of city planning for Brooklyn. "For the first time in decades neighborhoods like Bensonhurst have been asking us for rezonings."
Developers, however, say that much of the new construction is part of a decades-long process of change and some of the neighborhoods already contain a mix of single-family houses and apartments.
There are roughly four different types of projects working their way through the approval process, some in areas where zoning maps have not changed since the current system was established in 1961.

Manufacturing Zones
Offices and Homes To Replace Factories
The most sweeping changes involve the conversion of large tracts of manufacturing zones to offices and residential use, including large waterfront properties, prime locations for apartment houses. City zoning maps showing M for manufacturing are being redrawn to R for residential, or MX, a category that allows both manufacturing and residential.
In the Hudson Yards plan for the far West Side, the last vast frontier of the Manhattan office market, railyards and underused manufacturing areas are to be rezoned for 28 million square foot of office space and 12 million square feet of residential towers to rise in the next four decades around the new midblock Hudson Yards Park between 10th and 11th Avenues. 
The plan calls for an expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, a Jets football stadium that city officials have taken to calling a "multiuse facility" and an extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square. An environmental impact statement is being drafted, andaction on the plan is scheduled by the end of this year. The city and state will have to come up with $5 billion in development costs, but planners hope to recover the costs eventually with income from the projects that are built.
"The Bloomberg administration recognized a basic fact of the modern economy, the transition from a large significantly industrial economy to a postindustrial economy," said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development.
The West Chelsea plan drastically reshapes another manufacturing zone. On 10th and 11th Avenues in Chelsea and in some midblock areas, sites would be zoned for a mix of loftlike apartment and commercial buildings, along with a few high-rise towers opposite Chelsea Piers and near the Hudson Yards. 
Portions of the old manufacturing zoning would be kept to limit redevelopment of an art gallery district that has developed there. The remains of the High Line would be converted to a park and owners of adjacent buildings would be able to sell air rights to allow new buildings in the area to be built larger. Bonus space would be provided on some blocks if developers provide subsidized housing. 
In Queens, portions of Long Island City, just across the East River from Midtown Manhattan, were rezoned from manufacturing to office and residential in 2001, and there is a proposal pending to fine-tune the zoning map at Hunters Point. 
In Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, a mile and half of waterfront now occupied by factories and warehouses would be opened to the public with a waterfront park and promenade surrounded by a staggered band of apartment towers up to 35 stories high. The maximum height of each building would be set in design guidelines, to create variation in the skyline. Building heights would step down, with the tallest closest to the water, decreasing as they moved inland to the height of the existing low-rise neighborhoods.
The plan was worked out in meetings with Brooklyn's Community Board 1 and elected officials on one hand, and developers and owners of riverfront industrial properties on the other. Community leaders, including Councilman David Yassky, say they are open to the plan but want it to include a requirement that developers who convert manufacturing sites to apartments provide some below-market housing affordable to middle- and low-income families.
City officials say they are studying the housing proposal and other alternatives. But they say that in light of the high cost of construction on the waterfront, providing subsidized housing there might not make sense and if the numbers do not work out developers will not build.
But some planners, who applaud the energy and responsiveness of the Bloomberg development team, say the administration is not beginning with a broad vision -- asking what the city should be like 50 or 100 years from now. Instead, they say, planners are often responding to immediate pressures from developers and communities.
These observers want to preserve the diversity of city neighborhoods and assure the survival of manufacturing. "It is not enough to consider highest and best return per square foot," said Eva Hanhardt, a senior adviser to the Municipal Arts Society. "Owners should be able to get a fair return, but we also need to consider what is best for the health and welfare of the city."
Mr. Doctoroff said that the administration was committed to supporting the city's remaining manufacturing and that the Economic Development Corporation was conducting a major study of ways to support and strengthen industry in the city.
He said that after decades of declines in jobs, manufacturing had begun to stabilize. "The manufacturing businesses that remain have a competitive advantage here," he said.

Back-Office Space
Competition For New Jersey
Beyond manufacturing, the administration has been focused on creating an inventory of less expensive back-office space, to compete with 12 million square feet of office space built along the waterfront in New Jersey. The focus is on plans to strengthen Long Island City, across the river from Midtown, and Downtown Brooklyn, across from Lower Manhattan. 
In Jamaica, Queens, where a long-awaited new station providing train service to Kennedy International Airport has opened, planners are studying proposals to encourage the creation of offices, hotels, retail space and housing, serving airlines and businesses that need to be near the airports.
The study encompasses a 400-block area in and around Jamaica, both to create the new regional business district and to preserve the character of the nearby residential neighborhoods, like South Jamaica, Jamaica Hill and St. Albans.
The Downtown Brooklyn plan calls for as much as 5.4 million square feet of new office and commercial space and 1,000 apartments, in a minutely designed plan that would allow for tall towers, including some with height limits that would require them to step back from the brownstones of Boerum Hill to the south.
During the Giuliani administration, the plan stalled and was unable to catch the attention of City Hall, said Donald H. Elliot, a lawyer and the planning chairman in the Lindsay administration, who worked on the plan as vice chairman of the Downtown Brooklyn Council, a business group. 
"They didn't pay much attention to it," Mr. Elliot said. "The Bloomberg people came in and saw it as an exciting possibility and good for the long term. They went at it very energetically and professionally, harnessing all of the city agencies to participate and cooperate."

Contextual Zoning
Fine-Tuning Broad Categories
A third wave of zoning changes involves what planners call contextual zoning, the fine-tuning of broad zoning categories, to limit the size and appearance of new buildings on side streets, while allowing higher density on major avenues. First used to protect affluent Manhattan neighborhoods threatened with overdevelopment, it has since been used across the city as neighborhoods feel development pressure.
Last year, 100 blocks of East Harlem and in Central Harlem around Frederick Douglass Boulevard were rezoned to allow denser development on the avenues while requiring buildings to step back to preserve the scale and character of midblock streets of row houses and tenements. While the original zoning in the area allowed for tall narrow towers, height limits were established on avenues, setting a maximum of 120 feet, or about 12 stories, in many areas.
A similar study has begun in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. Fulton Street, a broad street with good subway access, would be rezoned for denser apartment buildings, while brownstone blocks would have new limits on building heights and design. 
In Park Slope, Jerry Armer, the chairman of the local community board, said community leaders had spent a dozen years trying to change the zoning in the southern part of the Slope to protect brownstone neighborhoods that were outside a historic district. The result was a compromise plan that reduced development on side streets, but allowed for bigger buildings on Fourth Avenue, where apartment houses now can be 12 stories tall. As part of thedeal, the city agreed to reserve several million dollars for Park Slope in city programs that offer subsidies to developers who produce below-market-rate housing. The plan was adopted last April.
The City Council must approve zoning map changes before they take effect, following a review by the local community board, the borough president and the City Planning Commission. The mayor has the right to veto the changes within five days of Council action. Maps and illustrations of many recent and proposed zoning changes can be found on the City Planning page of the New York City Web site, www.nyc.gov, under "projects/proposals."

Residential Areas
Downzoning Neighborhoods
Finally, there are the plans to downzone many leafy low-rise neighborhoods. Many of these areas are facing pressure from developers amid intense housing construction in the city More than 60,000 building permits were issued in the last 40 months, more than in 1990 through 1998, according to the planning department.
Much of the downzoning is proposed in neighborhoods that voted heavily for Mr. Bloomberg and where he is working hard to rebuild support after the city adopted an 18.5 percent property tax increase. But planning officials said their neighborhood preservation efforts are extending into other neighborhoods too.
Brad Lander, who works with community groups on planning issues, sees a contradiction in the city policy to downzone these neighborhoods. Groups he works with on the Greenpoint waterfront and in West Harlem want provision for housing for lower income people in new developments, and zoning to protect manufacturing. But when they put their alternatives forward, city officials say the market cannot support them, he said.
"They embrace using zoning in an anti-market way on Staten Island for neighborhood preservation, said Mr. Lander, the director of Pratt Institute's Center for Community and Environmental Development, "but they are not willing to use it for broader social and political purposes."
All parties in the discussions agree on one thing: the results of the current zoning initiatives will have lasting consequences. "Right now," Professor Schill said, "you are at a turning point for New York."

(Photo by Ting-Li Wang/The New York Times)(pg. 4) Chart/Map: "Changing the Rules for Growth, Neighborhood by Neighborhood"The tempo of zoning changes for neighborhoods around the city -- either put into force or proposed -- has increased in recent months. Maps show areas where changes have been made recently and where others are being proposed, with descriptions of some major initiatives. MANHATTAN 1. Harlem-East Harlem. 100 blocks rezoned to allow denser residential development on the avenues, while preserving the scale and character of midblock tenement and row house streets. Approved last year. 2. Far West Side. Proposals include 28 million square feet of office space and 12 million square feet of residential development, along with convention center expansion and a new stadium. 3. West Chelsea. Proposed rezoning of 10th and 11th Avenues and some midblock areas would allow office and apartment construction, including several high-rise apartment buildings. Remains of elevated rail line known as the High Line would be preserved as a park. BROOKLYN 4. Greenpoint Williamsburg. Proposals for a mile and half of the Brooklyn waterfront include park and promenade, as well as a band of apartment towers up to 35 stories high that would step down to the lower height of the existing low-rise neighborhoods, in which residential zoning would be expanded. 5. Downtown Brooklyn. Development plan calls for 5.4 million square feet of high-rise office space and more than 1,000 apartments. A city park built atop a new underground garage is planned. 6. Park Slope. Rezoned to limit the height and bulk of buildings in low-rise brownstone neighborhoods, and increase the size of apartment buildings along Fourth Avenue. Adopted last year. 7. Bedford-Stuyvesant. Proposed rezoning of Fulton Street would allow denser apartment buildings, while maintaining the character of nearby brownstone blocks. 8. Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst. Proposed downzoning would prohibit out-of-scale buildings in low-rise neighborhoods. BRONX 9. Throgs Neck. Downzoning was recommended in low-density areas to prohibit attached multi-family town houses. QUEENS 10. Bayside, College Point, Kew Gardens, Richmond Hill, Woodside and Maspeth. Proposed downzoning would protect the existing low- and medium-rise character of neighborhoods. 11. Jamaica. Zoning plan would encourage airport related offices, hotels, commercial and residential development near the Kennedy Airport light rail station while limiting development in nearby neighborhoods. STATEN ISLAND 12. Large swaths of the borough, including 40 percent of the island's development lots, were rezoned in December to largely bar the construction of attached town houses. New proposals would require larger lots in new developments, parking for two cars for every home, and a space bonus for homes with steeply pitched roofs.

Single, but Laying Down Roots

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
VIRGINIA WOOLF was wrong. Women don't need just a room of their own. They need an entire home.
 Many young single women are reaching that conclusion. As they earn higher wages and delay marriage, more of them are realizing that equity-building is not just smart but also essential -- and that real estate is often the wisest way to do it. 
 The National Association of Realtors in Washington reports that single women accounted for 21 percent of all home purchases in 2003, up from 18 percent in 1997. And more than three-quarters of the home-buying women in 2003 did not have children, compared with just more than half of the women buying homes six years ago. 
Steve Murray, the editor of Real Trends, a newsletter about the housing industry, says the trend is clear. "I've seen it all over the country, and not just in the big cities: more women are on career paths, and they see the value of owning a home," he said, noting the low level of interest rates. Paul Purcell, a partner at Braddock & Purcell, a residential real estate consulting firm in Manhattan, says that about half of his customers -- the highest share in his 25 years in the industry -- are single women who are first-time home buyers. "In the old days you stayed in your rental until you got married," he said.
"Increasingly, young people are realizing that residential real estate is a commodity, and that if they need a bigger space once they settle down, they can sell their home, make a sizable profit and buy again," he added. "Why put your life on hold while waiting for that special someone?"
That is what Jeanne Cook, 33, a pharmacist from Wurtsboro, N.Y., thought when she bought her own place about six years ago. She had just ended an eight-year relationship, so the decision was both economic and therapeutic.
"It was a fixer-upper, and I threw myself into it," she said of her home. "Women today have our own careers, and too many of us wait for the perfect guy and he doesn't come along. If he comes along eventually, great, but if he doesn't, set yourself up toward a goal. That way at least you've got half of what you wanted."
Of course, there are still hurdles. It's one thing to shell out money on, say, a pair of Manolo Blahniks or a trip to Brazil. It's quite another to drop hundreds of thousands of dollars on a permanent residence -- especially one that, as New Yorkers know, can be the size of an elevator.
And then there are nonfinancial issues. Despite the strides that young women have made professionally, some women still hope in the back of their minds that Romeo will whisk them off into financial stability. 
"I was the homecoming queen; isn't the homecoming queen supposed to be married by 22?" asked Jeanmarie Coates, 30, a nurse in New York City who is single. 
Ms. Coates recently had to decide between two job offers. One position was appealing but not lucrative, she said, while the other paid well but was less interesting. If she took the higher-paying job, she could save for a down payment on an apartment. "I have a fear of taking a job that enables me to realize my dream of buying a place of my own," she said before making her decision. "I always thought I'd meet someone and we'd do it together. But how long do you wait?"
Last week, after much deliberation, she chose the higher-paying job.
Fewer men seem to share those fears. Sam Mirkin, 33, a financial planner in Boston, said that when he bought a condominium six years ago, "I was very single, but I thought it was a good investment; my relationship status never entered the equation." 
FOR young single women, many forces are inspiring home-buying decisions. Clearly, such women are being recognized as a viable market segment: home-buying seminars for women have cropped up around the country; advertising by real estate companies often features single women, not just couples; and home improvement programs and magazines are acknowledging that women can actually hang curtains by themselves.
Few people -- men or women -- want to be alone, but finding love can be dicey. Building equity, on the other hand, is often within reach.
Ms. Coates is changing her thinking. "I can control my job, whether or not I have a child on my own, if I go back to school, but I can't control who I fall in love with," she said. "I've wasted too much time waiting for something that's beyond my control. It's time to move forward."
Virginia Woolf would have been proud.

HEADLINE: Father Imperfect 

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ

 BODY:
ON a cold night in mid-November, seven men sat in a tight circle in a spare classroom in East Harlem to learn about fatherhood. One was Javier Sanchez, a baby-faced Puerto Rican in an oversize white T-shirt.He had left his only child four years before, two and a half weeks after his birth, and now he wanted him back.
 "What qualities does a man have to have in order to be a good father?" asked the caseworker leading the session. The men called out answers, and the caseworker wrote them down on the white board at the front of the room: educated, decent job, clean, good heart, honest, wealthy, strong. 
 Wealth, it was decided, was an unrealistic thing to ask of a man. In fact, the list turned out to be largely theoretical, as most of the men were not speaking of their own fathers or even of themselves. They were speaking of an idea called Dad, recognizable from television and the movies, but rarely witnessed in their own living rooms. 
"How many of you grew up with your dad?" the caseworker asked.
Two of the seven raised their hands. Mr. Sanchez did not. 
The class is run by Strive, an East Harlem nonprofit group, with city money. Each man is allowed to miss one of the eight weekly sessions and is paid $125 if he completes the course, which has been held three times since August. Many of the students are ex-convicts, were drug users, or were on welfare or homeless. 
Mr. Sanchez, 33, has experience with all of the above. It was in prison that he decided he wanted to be a real father to his son, Javier Nikko Sanchez, known as Javi. "I said to myself, my son has went through enough," he said. "It is about time he knows who I am. It's time I take responsibility for my son." 
Mr. Sanchez's road to fatherhood will be long and rough. He is unemployed, he is struggling against his past, and his present affairs are dizzyingly tangled. Javi is in foster care, and a hearing is to be held Wednesday in a bitter custody battle involving Mr. Sanchez and the child's mother, Inette Baez. The two are not married, and just last month Mr. Sanchez married another woman, a longtime girlfriend named Sol Rodriguez. Both women have children by men other than Mr. Sanchez. Added to this long list of family members is a supporting cast of foster parents, parole officers, caseworkers and lawyers. 
Mr. Sanchez's weapon against the long odds: resolute optimism. "I'm feeling very confident," he said during a visit with Javi in early January. "Faith. Faith in Christ. That's what gives me confidence."

Father of the Man
Mr. Sanchez says his own father left their home on the Lower East Side when Mr. Sanchez was 4. He remembers his father as a man who liked to watch wrestling and drink Budweiser. 
"He abandoned me," Mr. Sanchez said. "My mother taught me a lot about being a male, what are our roles and responsibilities. She taught me manners, respect, hygiene, family values."
Those lessons, he said, did not stop him from making bad decisions. He dropped out of Seward Park High School in the 11th grade because, he said, "I only had maybe three pairs of jeans."
"I would see everybody stylin' and I wanted to style, too."
As Mr. Sanchez tells it, he started using cocaine and LSD when he was 14 and began dealing at 16. He sublet an apartment on Avenue D as a hangout. Once, after staying up all night doing cocaine, one of his friends pulled out a gun. "Then another person took out a gun," he continued. "They looked at each other. It was a chain reaction. There were nine of us pointing guns at each other. If one person would have shot, everyone would. It was a loving and crazy family."
He added: "I was always eager to find out what was on the dark side. My No. 1 movie was 'Scarface."' 
Since 1995, according to state records, Mr. Sanchez has been convicted of selling drugs three times, twice on school grounds, and of other, lesser offenses. Since his last sentence ended, in August 1999, he has violated parole several times.
He has held a series of low-level jobs -- mailroom clerk, messenger, host at a pizzeria restaurant -- but left most of them within a year. And although he lives with Ms. Rodriguez in her apartment in the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side, he recently spent two months in homeless shelters.

Becoming a Father
Mr. Sanchez met Ms. Baez in 1995. She was 17, her mother had recently died of AIDS, and she was in a tailspin.
Ms. Baez said Mr. Sanchez fed her, clothed her and took care of her. Both say that they did drugs together and sold drugs together. At one point in the mid-90's, she said, she was convicted of selling drugs. 
Their son, Javi, who has a round face, with his father's wide forehead and long lashes, was born on Dec. 22, 1999. But soon after he was born, Mr. Sanchez left him and Ms. Baez, and moved in with Ms. Rodriguez. 
"It was too dramatic for me," he said. "Dealing with the stress and anger, I probably would have found myself hurting her." 
At one point, Mr. Sanchez won the right to visit Javi, but, he said, he soon stopped visiting because he had violated parole and was on the run. He said he briefly paid $50 a month in child support, but stopped because he was jailed. (As of December, he said, he was about $1,450 behind in support payments.)
Javi lived with his mother until she tested positive for drugs a year ago, and the child was put in foster care. "I was in a party, and I end up sniffing some coke," Ms. Baez said. "I haven't sniffed coke since that party."
Now 25, Ms. Baez is a thin woman with a thick, asthmatic cough. She wants custody of Javi just as Mr. Sanchez does, but she, like him, faces complications and troubles. She has two other sons, each by a different man. One, Edwin, is in foster care, and the other lives with his father's family. Ms. Baez is unemployed, and in September she was sentenced to five years' probation for possession of a stolen vehicle. 
Why, she wondered aloud one day, does Mr. Sanchez want to be in his son's life at this moment? "You wasn't in his life for the other four years," she said. "Why now?"
She believes that Javi and Edwin belong with her. "No one is going to do for them like a mother is going to do for them," she said. "I need them and they need me."
Indeed, when foster children are involved, custody goes to the mother "almost automatically," said Luis Lopez, Javi's foster care caseworker from the Salvation Army. Mr. Sanchez is a rarity; of 31 foster children Mr. Lopez oversees, only 2 cases involve men.
"Most men don't own up to their responsibility," Mr. Lopez said. Of the city's nearly 190,000 single-parent households with incomes less than $20,000, only 9.4 percent are headed by men, according to an analysis of 2000 census data by the Queens College sociology department.

A Day at Daddy's
On Nov. 21, the day of Javi's first home visit with his father, Ms. Rodriguez's apartment was spotless. Mr. Sanchez had been freed from prison for a parole violation five weeks earlier. 
Like Javi's parents, Ms. Rodriguez, 41, has had her troubles. She has six children, and the two who live with her, preteen girls named Sol and Camila, were in foster care in 1999. "I messed up," explained Ms. Rodriguez, who receives Social Security disability payments for rheumatoid arthritis. "I started smoking crack."
Between February and April 2003, Ms. Rodriguez submitted to four random drug tests, all negative. "I fix my past," she said. "I just look forward to my future." 
The Rodriguez living room has white leather sofas, a 62-inch television set and a picture of a waterfall, which, when plugged in, seems to flow. On a dresser in the hallway are a thicket of Virgin Mary statuettes and a Bible. 
On the day of the visit, everyone gathered in Sol's room for a face-off between her and Javi on Gran Turismo, a PlayStation auto racing game.
"Wow!" Javi shouted. "Cool! I love playing games!" Although his father gently tried to help him steer, he kept running his car off the road, and Sol won the first round. She giggled, but no one paid attention. It was Javi's show. "I'm going to crash!" he shouted. When he won the next round, everyone applauded. 
Then Javi barreled down the hallway on his tricycle. The girls ran after him, yelling, "Daddy!" 
"See," Ms. Rodriguez said, smiling. "They call him Daddy."
But Javi's visit soon ended. At 10 after 5, after a two-hour stay, Mr. Sanchez buttoned the boy into his dark blue winter coat. They headed across Houston Street to the Lillian Wald Houses, the project where Mr. Sanchez grew up and where Javi's foster mother, Miladys Rojas, lives. 
Ms. Rojas's daughter, Jackie Ramirez, knows Mr. Sanchez from childhood. "He was a good kid," she said. But, she adds, "I just wish he wasn't here in this neighborhood." Drugs are all around, she explained. 
Mr. Sanchez scoffs at that concern. "They always say in programs in order to make a change in life, you have to stay away from people, places and things," he said. "Me, personally, I look at that as running away from your problems."

A Cloud Over Custody
On Nov. 25, Javi's foster mother was supposed to take him to the Salvation Army building on 14th Street for a visit with Mr. Sanchez. But she was running late, and as Mr. Lopez talked with his client, he shared a troubling thought. 
Mr. Lopez explained that unless a judge decided otherwise, a child was not sent into a home where there had been an incident involving the city's child welfare agency, the Administration for Children's Services. He was referring to the fact that Ms. Rodriguez's daughters had been put in foster care in 1999. Paradoxically, Mr. Sanchez's marriage to Ms. Rodriguez might make it harder for him to gain custody of Javi. 
Mr. Sanchez's face tightened when he learned this.
"Daddy!" Javi shouted when he arrived an hour and a half later with his foster mother. His father picked him up and kissed him, then took him downstairs to the "Sesame Street" playroom, where they started drawing. "Let's see you happy," Javi said to his father. Mr. Sanchez stretched his face into a huge smile. Javi drew a happy face on a sheet of paper. 
Despite Mr. Sanchez's prison record and lack of a job and the discouraging news from the foster care caseworker, Mr. Sanchez remained optimistic about his chances for winning custody.
"I definitely see where my battle with the legal system will take place," he said. "That's why I'm always constantly going to legal libraries and looking up cases. There's great hopes." If he doesn't win custody, he plans to seek broader visitation rights, "a lot of father-and-son time."

The 'Vations
The evening of Dec. 4, only two men showed up for the fatherhood seminar, an absenteeism rate that Strive managers attributed to the holidays. The topic was communication.
"When you first start dating a girl, everything is clear," said Colin Ransom, a caseworker. "But as the relationship goes on and on and on, what happens is the communication starts to break down."
Hecontinued: "I call it the 'vations. Aggravation. Frustration. Starvation. Humiliation." 
Mr. Sanchez, who said he was taking the class in part to strengthen his custody case, looked exhausted. "I was sitting here starting to think about a lot of difficulties in communication in my past," he said. "Communication. When that breaks down, a lot of things come tumbling down with it." 
It was the eve of Mr. Sanchez's wedding, and after class, Albert Felipe, the other caseworker, tried to teach Mr. Sanchez how to tie a tie. He wasn't much help. "My father only taught me how to tie a half knot," Mr. Felipe said.
"That's all my brother taught me," Mr. Sanchez replied. 
Mr. Ransom quickly knotted two ties, one red, one blue, for Mr. Sanchez, who folded them carefully into a bag. "I don't want to mess them up," he said. He didn't know which he would slip on the next day for his wedding. 
Mr. Sanchez and Ms. Rodriguez had spent much of that day running errands. The wedding was fast approaching, and she was jittery. "I don't know whether to laugh or cry," she said as she walked, in large lavender curlers, down Rivington Street with Mr. Sanchez. "It's like a tingling inside." 
While Mr. Sanchez bought cigarettes, Ms. Rodriguez stopped by Master Jewelry, a little shop on Clinton Street that is sheathed in bulletproof glass, only to learn that the rings weren't ready. "The wedding is tomorrow!" she cried out in despair.
Finally, the rings were secured, and the next day the couple, along with relatives and two witnesses, went to the city clerk's office at the Municipal Building to be married.

A White Wedding
Eight inches of snow would fall in Manhattan that day. Mr. Sanchez wore a baggy cream-color suit, and Ms. Rodriguez wore a long, sheer white dress and open-toe sandals with high silver heels. As one of the witnesses put it, "She looks like a Cinderella." The ceremony took 70 seconds.
Back in the lobby, a guard told the wedding party they couldn't wait inside, so they stepped into a vaulted courtyard. The snow was blowing sideways. Ms. Rodriguez let out an "Oh, my God!" as the wind hit her and she limped around, trying to avoid the rapidly growing puddles skimmed with ice. It was 30 minutes before an increasingly frustrated Mr. Sanchez, his cellphone in one hand and a wedding cake in the other, could find a cab for his new family. 
At home, Mr. Sanchez ordered takeout and acted as host, making sure everyone had enough fried chicken and egg rolls. He refused to sit, and later, as he cleaned up and took out the trash, he explained why. "Last night, when I went to lie down, I started thinking about all the memories," he said. "My past. I got a migraine."
He added: "Staying busy alleviates stress. I've got a little method. So far it's working fine." 
In mid-December, Mr. Sanchez said, he started skipping days at his drug rehab program, which meets for one hour five days a week. "It was taking too much of my time," he said. His cellphone service was cut off around Christmas. "We're behind on a lot of bills," he explained. Mostly, the family lives on Ms. Rodriguez's disability payments, food stamps and welfare payments for the children, which total about $1,200 a month. 
He also missed the last two sessions of the fatherhood program and did not graduate. Only 2 of the 12 men in the class graduated. Robert Sanchez (no relation to Javier Sanchez), who directs the fatherhood program at Strive, said fear of success can be great for people from his client's background. "Success means having to be more responsible," he said. "Success meanshaving to get up at 7 o'clock in the morning and prepare yourself for work every single day."
Will these forces trip up Javier Sanchez? It's hard to tell. 
Whatever happens, the new year has produced some good moments. Mr. Sanchez's last day of parole was Jan. 3. A week ago, Javi made another visit. There was money in the house on this day, and with money came optimism. Ms. Rodriguez baked a chicken, her two daughters drew on a large blackboard their mother had found, and Mr. Sanchez was getting excited about teaching his son things. "I want to teach him mathematics," he said. "I was so good at math."
As he walked Javi back to his foster mother's house, he pointed to a water tower on top of the building he grew up in. When he was younger, he used to hang out there with his friends, drinking beer and pina coladas, talking through the night, waiting for dawn. The hulking gray structure, lighted from below, looked deeply foreboding.
"Can we go up there?" Javi asked. "No," Mr. Sanchez replied. "Why?" Javi asked. "It's dangerous," his father said.

HEADLINE: Is China The Next Bubble? 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DONGGUAN, China 

 BODY:
THE prospectus for China Green Holdings Ltd. looks a little like a seed catalog. Color photographs show the corn, cabbage, pickled plums and other vegetables that the company exports, mostly to Japan. There is even a helpful list of the growing times for broccoli, cauliflower and sweet peas; it is tucked between tables showing that the company earned $14.1 million on sales of $31.2 million in its last fiscal year.
 Though China Green's business literally involves small potatoes -- cubed and shipped in plastic bags -- its initial public offering in Hong Kong was anything but. Retail investors put in bids to buy more than 1,600 times as many shares as were available for sale, making it the most oversubscribed I.P.O. ever in Hong Kong. The stock jumped 58 percent last Tuesday, its first day of trading. 
 Japan had its bubble in the late 1980's, when the Imperial Palace grounds in Tokyo became worth more than all the land in California. Thailand and Indonesia had their bubbles in the mid-1990's, when speculators and multinationals poured money into what seemed like a Southeast Asian miracle. The United States had its Internet and telecommunications bubble in the late 1990's, when stock prices looked as if they could rise indefinitely and unemployment kept hitting new lows. 
 Each of those bubbles ended badly, with millions of families losing their savings and many losing their jobs. 
 As 2004 begins, China's economy looks as invincible as the Japanese, Southeast Asian and American economies of those earlier times. But recent excesses -- from a frenzy of factory construction to speculative inflows of cash to soaring growth in bank loans -- suggest that China may be in a bubble now, especially on the investment side of the economy.
 Bubbles can last years before they pop, but they seldom deflate painlessly when they do. Nobody knows how harmful a sharp economic slowdown would be to China, a country undergoing huge social changes, like the migration of peasants to the cities. The Communist Party rests its legitimacy on delivering consistent annual increases in prosperity.
 The Chinese government is showing concern. In the last few weeks, the central bank has tried to dissuade banks from reckless lending while the government has bailed out two of the largest ones, to prepare them for possible hard times as well as planned stock sales. The State Council, China's cabinet, has warned that it will discourage further construction of new factories in industries like aluminum and steel, whose capacity has grown swiftly in the last three years.
 Because China is now so important to the global economy and to global political stability, the possibility of economic trouble is starting to draw serious attention among economists and China specialists.
 Huge billboards in Guangdong Province commemorate Deng Xiaoping's decision a quarter-century ago to allow capitalism to gain a foothold in a few cities here in southeastern China. Practically ever since, China's astounding economic growth has provoked warnings that the boom may not be sustainable. Year after year, China has proved the worriers wrong, although there have been a few missteps along the way, most notably when inflation surged temporarily and foreign exchange reserves withered in the early 1990's.
 But even by Chinese standards, things have been moving at a blistering pace of late. Official statistics, which the government tends to smooth so as not to indicate big booms or busts, show that the economy expanded 8.5 percent last year, despite the fact that growth came to a virtual halt during the second quarter because of an outbreak of SARS. According to independent economists, however, the Chinese economy actually expanded at an annual pace of 11 percent to 13 percent through the second half of last year.
 Strains are already showing. Blackouts have become a problem in a majority of China's provinces, as families with new air-conditioners and refrigerators compete with new factories for electricity. Auto sales soared 75 percent last year, as prices in a market protected from imports until 2001 drifted down toward global levels. Still, automakers are planning huge factory expansions in the hope that such growth will continue. 
 Most economists specializing in China now predict that sometime this year, growth will have to slow, at least for the investment side of the economy -- the building of new factories, for example. That could prove painful. The United States economy suffered severe weakness on the investment side in 2001 and 2002, when the market for telecommunications equipment became glutted. The upshot was tens of thousands of lost jobs in that industry, not to mention steep drops in the stock portfolios of millions of Americans.
 But consumer spending is now strengthening in China, while household savings rates are high. China, like the United States, is likely to rely on consumers to prevent any coming slowdown from becoming too severe. "We look for a hard landing in investment, a soft landing in overall economic growth and no landing in consumption," said Tao Dong, an economist in Hong Kong with Credit Suisse First Boston.
 The risks to China, and indirectly to the world, fall into four broad areas. Those categories follow, starting with the most likely, a cyclical bust in the investment sector, and ending with what appears the least likely but also the most serious: political turmoil or some other loss of social stability.

Business-Cycle Risk
 A quarter-century ago, Dongguan, in the Pearl River delta region of southern China, was an impoverished farming village where residents struggled to survive on limited rice rations. Today, its 14,000 foreign-controlled factories make it the world's largest single site for the production of microwave ovens, and it is a huge producer of everything from computer cables to furniture and computer displays.. The roads are jammed with freight trucks carrying boxes of components to assembly lines and the finished goods to ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
 Dongguan has formidable advantages as a place to do business, as Frank Jaeger, a German businessman, can attest. Eight years ago, he started a five-employee operation making computer cables here. He now has 1,000 employees, and is still expanding. And small wonder: factory floor space, built by municipal government contractors for businesses willing to locate here, costs 10 cents a square foot to rent each month excluding the installation of pipes and wiring, compared with $1 to $1.50 a square foot in some American factory towns and as much as $2.50 in Germany, Mr. Jaeger said.
 Wages are also low, thanks to a constant flow of semiskilled migrant workers from even poorer provinces in China's interior. Mr. Jaeger's company, TCA Ltd., offers base pay of $60 a month, and an additional $40 a month in overtime and free room and board in adjacent dormitories, where the workers sleep six or eight to a room.
 While the wages may sound low to Westerners, even with free room and board, they are high by local standards, holding down turnover and training costs. The workers, mostly young women who stay one to three years and then return to their home provinces to start small businesses or families, wear green and yellow company-issued windbreakers and sit in chairs at long metal tables under fluorescent lights, clipping wires, filing plastic and installing copper disks to make reliable electrical connections.
 Other domestic and foreign businesses have noticed the same attractions, too. In fact, so many factories have been built that in industry after industry, from washing machines to cellphones, production capacity far exceeds domestic demand. Exports have not entirely absorbed the difference, so prices have plunged.
 Business executives and economists often complain that factories are built with little attention to whether similar plants are being constructed elsewhere, or to how low prices will fall if all of them start churning out the same products at the same time. 
 Many former farmers in Dongguan have profited from land deals. Instead of putting the money in bank deposits paying negligible regulated interest rates or risking it in mainland China's tiny and fraud-riddled stock exchanges, they invest it in factories in their hometown.
 "In China, overcapacity is not an issue that stops a businessman, because they always think they can do better," Mr. Jaeger said.
 Domestic and foreign investors alike share that approach. Executives from multinational corporations see China as such an important market that they have little choice but to continue investing, in the pursuit of ever-greater slices of the market. "Good companies, be they local or be they global, can increase their market share," said Pekka Ala-Pietila, the president of the Nokia Corporation, the cellphone maker.
 The problem arises when too many companies make the same calculation and invest too much. Nearly half of China's economic growth is investment-related spending, an extraordinary figure that reflects public spending on highways and dams, as well as private-sector projects. Calculations by Smith Barney show that Japan in the 1980's, Southeast Asia in the mid-1990's and the United States in the late 1990's each had a few years of investment spending well above historical averages. In each case, overcapacity accumulated in many industries and, eventually, a bubble popped.
 China has developed a special disadvantage, in that its economy has become so ravenous for commodities that it is pushing up global prices for products like oil, for which China has become the second-largest market, after the United States. With very low wages and real estate costs, factory managers find that materials are their biggest cost by far, and a sudden jump in their cost can leave businesses with no competitive edge. 
 The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has reported an acceleration in wholesale price inflation this winter. The big question is how quickly this will feed into consumer price inflation, which could antagonize politically important urban residents. If consumer prices start rising significantly, the central bank will come under growing pressure to let interest rates climb, which could make more factories less competitive as loans become more costly. 
 China still has some advantages that, at least in the short term, may forestall a plunge in investment. One is a banking sector willing to lend heavily to even the most indebted companies, provided that they have political connections. But in postponing the final reckoning in the current business cycle, China may be making an eventual bust even worse.

Protectionism Risk
 China Green exports three-quarters of its fresh vegetables, and the prospectus for its I.P.O. warns that it relies heavily on sales to several Japanese companies. If there were a prospectus for China's economy, it would need to warn of a high dependence on sales to America.
China exported $125 billion worth of goods to the United States in the first 10 months of last year and imported just $22 billion. The resulting trade surplus equaled an extraordinary 9 percent of China's entire economic output during this period.
 Rapid growth and a persistent imbalance in China's trade with the United States have turned Chinese exports into obvious targets during an American election year. In the last few months, United States trade officials have begun to take the legal steps needed to impose steep tariffs on Chinese products as varied as color televisions, furniture and bras.
 To avoid a full-scale trade war, Beijing has followed Japan's example in sending official buying missions to the United States. Shopping for everything from soybeans to communications equipment, they have agreed in the last two months to buy $11 billion worth of goods, by Beijing's calculations. Some of these deals might have happened anyway, like the one to import General Motors auto parts for assembly into finished cars here.
 So far, American trade restrictions have covered a tiny percentage of Chinese shipments to the United States. But any significant broadening could slow the Chinese economy in a hurry, and with it the economies of many Asian neighbors that increasingly send components to China for final assembly and reshipment to the United States.

Financial Risk
 Lists of potential causes of a Chinese economic derailment tend to start, and sometime end, with a banking crisis. By plying borrowers with ever more loans, following lending criteria that credit ratings agencies contend are laced with corruption and political influence, Chinese banks have wound up with extremely high proportions -- as much as 45 percent -- of nonperforming loans.
 The banks rapidly stepped up their pace of fresh loans last year. Exporters, foreign investors and speculators were depositing large sums of dollars. The central bank then exchanged the dollars for China's currency, known as the yuan or renminbi, at a fixed exchange rate, so as to keep the holders of those dollars from bidding up the yuan's value. The banks lent heavily from their expanding deposits, with loans rising 21.4 percent last year.
 "The world economy is being kept afloat by the aggressive expansion of the U.S. budget deficit and Chinese loan growth," said Ajay Kapur, the chief Asian equity strategist at Smith Barney. "Any reversal in these two trends has pretty serious outcomes for the rest of the world."
 Most Chinese savers have few alternatives to the state-owned banks as places to park their cash, and the banks appear to have informal but total government guarantees of deposits. As a result, they have not experienced significant losses of depositors, although that could change as ever more businesses engage in trade deals that can be used to transfer money to safer banks overseas if hard times ever return to China. Lately, concern has gone beyond the stability of the banks themselves to the economic effects of all the extra money sloshing through the banking system.
 Chinese officials have said they would try to sterilize the effects of their purchases of dollars, by selling bonds to the public for yuan that the central bank then cancels or destroys. If the central bank actually sold extra bonds as fast as it bought dollars for yuan, it could theoretically leave domestic banks with no more cash on hand than they had before, and prevent the risks of faster loan growth, a rising money supply and, eventually, inflation.
 But financial experts say the central bank is no longer able to sterilize the effects of its currency activities. The problem is that the Ministry of Finance, a separate agency in charge of budget policy, has limited the interest rate that the government can pay on bonds, so as to hold down the cost of servicing China's national debt. With inflation starting to rise, the bonds have become less attractive and the central bank has been struggling to sell enough new bonds each month just to pay off old bonds falling due.
 The central bank has been able to soak up little if any of the billions of extra yuan it has been pumping into the economy lately to buy up dollars, said Liang Hong, a Goldman Sachs economist. At the same time, flows of "hot money" -- short-term investments being moved into China from overseas through a variety of channels despite China's capital controls -- appear to have accelerated.
 "I'm really worried about their losing control of the money supply," Ms. Liang said.

Political Risk
 To the West, the hallmark of the last quarter-century in China has been rapid economic growth. But for hundreds of millions of Chinese, it has meant something else: a respite from the wars and the domestic strife that had dogged the country for more than a century before, from the Taiping Rebellion of the 1850's to the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960's and early 1970's.
 In the years immediately after the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989, China became relatively placid, perhaps in part from fear. But that calm seems to be fading now.
 President Hu Jintao has gingerly tried to restrict some police powers -- like the ability to detain people without proper identity documents -- and is seeking slightly greater openness in Chinese society. Human-rights groups report a growing number of protests in China, mainly workers and retirees seeking unpaid salaries and benefits. At the same time, many on the mainland are acutely aware of the huge marches organized over the last seven months by democracy activists in Hong Kong, now an autonomous region of China.
 Whether any of these forces become significant enough to rattle China's stability is anybody's guess. Peaceful change toward a more democratic system may still be possible, especially if it is fairly gradual.
 But if the economy slows sharply, political instability could follow. That would be a serious problem, and not just for China, but also for the rest of the world.

The surges are often followed by sharp slumps as businesses seek efficient uses for all the new offices, factories and equipment they have accumulated. The Japanese economy in the late 1980's, Southeast Asian economies in the mid-1990's and the American economy during the Internet and telecommunications boom of the late 90's each had a surge in investment spending, followed by a bust.

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE; 
Does It Pay to Manage Your Own Care?

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
CONSUMER-DRIVEN health care, embraced by some employers as a way to contain medical costs, sounds so sensible: Educate workers about health care expenses and give them a financial stake in managing their own care, through individual cash accounts. Each year, employers deposit money in these accounts, which can be used for doctor's visits, prescription drugs and other medical expenses. Any remaining money may be rolled over to the next year.
 By making employees active participants in managing their own care, they will spend more cautiously, and medical costs will naturally come down. At least that's the theory. 
Only a tiny fraction of employers offer these plans, which typically also include a high-deductible insurance plan that kicks in once the fund is exhausted. So it is too soon to know whether costs will actually decline. But some health care experts are skeptical. 
 "They're just a way to make higher patient cost-sharing more attractive to employees," said Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health-System Change, a nonpartisan policy research group based in Washington.
 There is no question that employees are already paying more. In 2003, on average, they paid 58 percent of the premium for family coverage in preferred-provider organization plans, up from 53 percent the year before, and 57 percent of premiums for health maintenance organization plans, compared with 50 percent in 2002, according to survey results released last month by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. The median out-of-pocket maximum for P.P.O. care within the network climbed to $2,000 from $1,500, according to the survey, and a third of employers required a co-payment of $20 or more for H.M.O. office visits, up from just 22 percent the year before. 
 Some health care experts and consumer advocates worry that throwing a pot of money at people and telling them to go manage their health is no cure for the system's ills. Won't poorer, sicker employees, they ask, be paying much more for care? 
 "The pivot is going to be designing consumer-driven health plans such that if people make high-quality, efficient choices, they actually pay less," said Dr. Arnold Milstein, a consultant for Mercer Human Resource Consulting and the medical director for the Pacific Business Group on Health, an association of large California employers. 
 Health care experts say some employers and insurers are taking promising steps toward making the consumer-driven model work. A handful of companies began testing the waters about three years ago.
 Destiny Health of Oak Brook, Ill., offers a consumer-driven plan with a $600 personal medical account for singles, combined with a preferred-provider organization insurance plan that has a deductible of $1,000. To encourage people with chronic medical conditions to take the medications they need rather than hoard the money in their accounts, Destiny divides costs into "controllable" and "uncontrollable" buckets. If you have any of 110 or so chronic medical conditions that are deemed as having "uncontrollable" costs -- like diabetes, heart disease, asthma or high cholesterol -- the cost of medication for them comes out of insurance instead of your personal account.
 About a year ago, the Ferguson Financial Group in Pecatonica, Ill., began offering a Destiny Health plan. "It absolutely makes a difference," said Judy Meinders, 58, a customer service representative at the company, of the plan's chronic-medication benefit. Ms. Meinders says she has to take two pills a day to control her thyroid disease and high blood pressure.
 Destiny Health also offers incentives to help employees make healthy choices. Workers earn "points" for getting flu shots, taking exercise classes or discussing chronic conditions with a nurse. The points can be redeemed for airline tickets, hotel accommodations and health club memberships, among other things.
 Other companies also offer incentives. Plans designed by Lumenos of Alexandria, Va., an administrator of consumer-driven plans, might add $100 to someone's health account for filling out a health questionnaire or talking with a "health coach" to manage chronic conditions. At Anthem Blue Cross, which offers plans in nine states, employees can receive discounts on Jenny Craig weight-loss programs.
 Keeping costs within the reach of lower-paid workers is a concern. One relatively simple solution is to link what employees pay to their salaries. 
 Rockwell Automation, an industrial automation company based in Milwaukee, has 17,000 employees in the United States, from factory workers to senior executives. An employee earning $35,000 a year with family coverage who signs up for the company's consumer-driven health plan has a $1,700 deductible and a maximum annual out-of-pocket cost of $2,500. Someone who earns $85,000 and buys the same family coverage, however, faces a $3,100 deductible and a $5,000 out-of-pocket maximum. 
 "Initially, you do get some pushback from higher-paid employees when you implement this," said Roger Freitag, the company's director of global benefits.
 Tiered networks, in which providers are grouped into tiers based on cost or efficiency, are also being adopted by some employers and insurers. Consumers pay more or less depending on the tier they choose. 
 The tiered networks "have the potential to help direct consumers to more efficient and better providers through financial incentives that actually give people more choice," said Gary Claxton, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, based in Menlo Park, Calif.
 BUT most tiering has been rudimentary. Some plans, for example, lump all teaching hospitals into a high-cost tier and community hospitals into a low-cost tier, or base the distinctions on costs for specific procedures. These measures, however, do not really deal with the cost of treating a patient through the course of an illness.
 A few plans, like Premera Blue Cross in Seattle, are beginning to address this. Premera puts doctors into tiers based on their clinics' relative cost efficiency in treating particular conditions or diseases. That way, a doctor who charges more could still be in the preferred tier if he is better at avoiding complications or reducing unnecessary lab tests. Premera is developing ways to measure quality and patient satisfaction as well. 
 "They've realized it's a mistake to judge a doctor based on fees, because he may be more cost-effective," Dr. Milstein said.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Nissan Titan; 
From the Birthplace of Godzilla, Japan's First Monster Truck

BYLINE:  By BOB KNOLL

 BODY:
PICKUP trucks bearing Japanese nameplates are nothing new in the United States. Nissan started selling such a truck, the Datsun 1000, in 1959. 
 But for decades, while the Japan-based auto companies wedged a toe into the passenger car market -- followed by a foot, an arm and a couple of legs -- they confined their pickup efforts mostly to small, inexpensive, relatively economical models. Detroit's Big Three had the full-size truck market, with its remarkably loyal customers, locked up. 
 Toyota's first effort at making a larger truck, the T-100, wasn't enthusiastically received. Its second try, the Tundra, did better, but it was not quite full-size either, falling short of pickups from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors in physical dimensions, power, payload and towing capacity. 
While Toyota took a common-sense approach, reasoning that customers might appreciate a pickup that was a bit smaller, a little gentler and a tad more polished, Nissan is confronting the Big Three head-on. Its 2004 Titan is just as big as high-volume models from Chevrolet, Ford, GMC and Dodge, and it matches or exceeds those trucks in power, towing capability and payload.
Nissan concentrated on one basic truck with two types of cabins: the King Cab, with two rear-hinged back doors that interlock with the front doors, and the Crew Cab, with four regular doors hinged at the front. In testament to how strong demand for roomy cabins has become, Nissan will not build Titans with the conventional two-door, one-seat, regular-cab configuration.
Nissan also decided to forgo an 8-foot cargo box, offering instead a 6 1/2-foot box for the King Cab and a 5 1/2-foot box with the Crew Cab. With these configurations, Nissan avoids the very long versions that are awkward to maneuver and hard to park. 
All Titans share a very stiff, fully boxed steel frame with an independent coil spring front suspension and a solid rear axle with dual-rate leaf springs. The rear shock absorbers are positioned outside the frame for a better ride. Brakes are four-wheel discs with an antilock function and electronic brake-force distribution.
All Titans have a new 5.6-liter V-8 engine, a double-overhead-cam power plant that develops 305 horsepower and 379 pounds-feet of torque -- the pulling power that is crucial in hauling and towing. The engine matches up well against G.M.'s 5.3-liter V-8 (295 horsepower and 330 pounds-feet); Ford's 5.4-liter V-8 (300 horsepower, 365 pounds-feet); and Dodge's 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 (345 horsepower, 375 pounds-feet).
Nissan offers a choice of two- or four-wheel drive, but only one transmission, a five-speed, electronically controlled automatic. In this class, only Nissan and Dodge have five-speed automatics.
The shifter is mounted on the steering column on models with bench seats, and you can shift manually (or hold the transmission in a gear) by moving a small toggle switch on the lever. On versions with individual captains' chairs, the shifter is in a console between the seats.
Four-by-four versions can be shifted into four-wheel mode, or out of it, while moving ("on the fly"). But you must stop the truck to shift to low range for slow, heavy-duty operation. In one instance in which the Titan falls short, it has a part-time four-wheel-drive system that shouldn't be used on dry pavement. Dodge has joined G.M. in offering trucks with full-time four-wheel drive.
Nissan put a lot of thought into its cargo box. Standard on the LE and effectively $1,800 extra on the SE, the box is factory-coated with a spray-on liner, and there are tracks with adjustable tie-down cleats -- a boon to owners who carry odd-shaped cargo. A locking storage drawer, under the bed on the driver's side, holds small items. 
Unfortunately, Nissan's heavy tailgate is hard to close. Ford's tailgate, with torsion-bar assist, has the advantage here.
The Titan's safety equipment also sets a standard for pickups, with available front-seat side-impact and side-curtain air bags, an option that costs $850 plus an additional off-road package. (The Dodge Ram now offers side curtain bags, but not side-impact bags for the front seat.) 
In addition, the Titan's front air bags are dual-stage units that deploy with varying force, or not at all, based on safety-belt and occupant-position sensors. Nissan says the Titan, with its lowered front frame, complies with voluntary standards for crash compatibility with cars. 
Nissan has priced the Titan aggressively, about $2,000 less than the competition. But the Big Three's trucks currently come with rebates of up to $2,500 plus low- or no-interest financing.
My test truck was a two-wheel-drive SE Crew Cab with a base price of $26,700. The total sticker was $30,300, with a $900 package that included a split front bench seat and several audio and convenience features; a $950 off-road package; an $850 towing package with an electronic stability control; and the $900 cargo-bed upgrade.
If the aggressive styling doesn't convince you, a drive quickly makes it clear that Nissan has met the Big Three head-on, rather than dancing around them as Toyota did with its seven-eighths-scale Tundra. (However, the new, larger 2004 Tundra Double Cab is fully competitive.)
While Toyota aims for refinement, Nissan emphasizes machismo. Toyota, Chevy and Ford trucks are smoother, quieter and, well, slicker.
The Titan's engine roars while accelerating and drones while driving. That makes it more like the Dodge, and no doubt has just the effect that Nissan wanted -- to advertise the truck's considerable power.
Some of the Titan's good response, especially at low speed, can be attributed to the five-speed transmission, one of the smoothest-shifting gearboxes I have encountered in a car or a truck. The extra gear makes for strong pulling power at moderate speeds, yet allows a proper cruising gear that improves fuel economy on the highway. My test truck was rated at 14 m.p.g. in town and 19 on the highway, not very good but comparable to other trucks'. 
Despite my truck's off-road specifications, the ride was acceptable. There was some jiggling and nervousness on rough roads, but control over large undulations was excellent. In general, the ride was not as good as the Ford's but easily better than the Dodge's.
On washboard pavement, the stability control stepped in to prevent the rear axle from hopping around. A six-inch snowfall provided a test of winter traction, which proved very good for a two-wheel-drive pickup, with the stability control helping to keep the rear wheels from spinning.
The Titan has rack-and-pinion steering with variable power assistance. On the highway, the steering was nicely weighted and the response felt correct. But in low-speed maneuvers, the response seemed slow, requiring considerable winding of the steering wheel.
The cab is roomy, especially the rear seat of the Crew Cab. The front bench seat is comfortable, with a wide center armrest full of storage compartments. 
The rear seat is split into two sections, with both folding up against the rear wall to create a large, flat floor. This arrangement, also used by Ford and Dodge, is much better than the station-wagon system of the G.M. and Toyota pickups, whose back seat folds down onto the floor.
There are other thoughtful touches: the windows in the Crew Cab's rear doors roll down all the way. The King Cab's rear doors swing out nearly 180 degrees, making it easier to load packages in tight parking lots.
For most of the things a big pickup needs to do, the Titan performs just as well as the trucks from G.M., Ford and Dodge, but the Big Three need not worry too much right away. Nissan will build only 100,000 Titans this year, in a market of 2.3 million full-size trucks, at its new plant in Canton, Miss. 
How does the Titan fit into the mix? After a week with one, I'd say that truck buyers looking for smoothness might be happier with pickups from Toyota or Chevy/GMC, but those looking for a tough, macho-looking package would do better with the Nissan than the Dodge. Still, the new Ford F-150, which successfully blends slickness with toughness, remains my favorite full-size truck.

INSIDE TRACK: Just out of the box but already worth watching.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE POLL; 
Poll Bolsters Bush on Terrorism But Finds Doubts on Economy

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER and JANET ELDER

 BODY:
President Bush begins his campaign year with Americans voicing strong support for his handling of the war against terrorism, but many doubting his economic and domestic policies, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 Fewer than one in five people said their tax burden had been eased by Mr. Bush, who has made tax cuts the centerpiece of his economic program. His latest domestic initiatives, unveiled in the run-up to the State of the Union message on Tuesday, got only a lukewarm response, with 58 percent saying that building a permanent space station on the Moon was not worth the risks and costs. 
 Moreover, the support Mr. Bush gained after the capture of Saddam Hussein last month has largely dissipated. His overall approval rating now stands at 50 percent, comparable to President Bill Clinton's 47 percent in January 1996. Mr. Bush remains a polarizing figure in a sharply divided country, with 9 in 10 Republicans approving of his performance, and only 1 in 4 of the Democrats. 
Despite those vulnerabilities, which the Democratic presidential candidates are busily trying to exploit, Mr. Bush retains a powerful advantage on national security. Sixty-eight percent, including majorities of both Democrats and independents, gave him high marks for the campaign against terrorism, and 68 percent said the Bush administration's policies have made the United States safer from terrorist attacks. Sixty-four percent said they considered him a strong leader.
"He demonstrated a maturity after 9/11, responding in a positive and determined way to bring the country onto a steady keel," said George House, a 72-year-old Democrat in Sigourney, Iowa. Mr. House, who was reinterviewed after the poll, added that he still had doubts about the war with Iraq.
Such assessments could set a high bar for Mr. Bush's Democratic challengers, who are still largely unknown, even among Democratic primary voters, many strategists say. "People wonder whether the Democrats will be as aggressive as Bush in keeping the country safe," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster.
Already, credibility as commander in chief has emerged as a major issue in the battle for the Democratic nomination. Many Democrats in rival campaigns have argued that Howard Dean, who has led in the polls for most of the primary season, is unlikely to pass that test on national security, because of his opposition to the war in Iraq and his lack of foreign policy experience.
The Times/CBS News poll was conducted Monday through Thursday by telephone with 1,022 adults nationwide, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Other polls released last week and conducted earlier than the Times/CBS News poll found Mr. Bush's job approval rating to be higher. For instance, a Gallup Poll taken Jan. 9 to 11 had a 59 percent job approval rating for Mr. Bush, while an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken Jan. 10 to 12 had a 54 percent approval rating.
While the Times poll was a road map for an intensely divided electorate, it also highlighted Mr. Bush's strengths. His approval rating is highest among those ages 30 to 44; those younger and older are more divided. Whites approve of his performance by 56 to 41 percent; in contrast, 70 percent of blacks disapprove of the job he is doing, while just 17 percent approve, the poll found.
He also has a big edge among those who say religion is extremely or very important to them; 56 percent of that group say they approve of Mr. Bush and 39 percent say they disapprove.
His approval rating among men and women is about the same, suggesting he is addressing the historic Republican vulnerability of a gender gap. And he has a substantial edge among married women.
One of the president's signature accomplishments on the domestic front -- the passage of a Medicare overhaul with new coverage for prescription drugs -- has yet to register much with the voters, the poll suggests. Twenty-nine percent said they thought the administration had made "a lot" or "some" progress on prescription drug relief. Fifty-four percent said the administration had made little or no progress.
For all of Mr. Bush's strengths, the poll shows the potential for a competitive election. When asked whether Mr. Bush had done more to unite the country or divide it, the public was split -- 43 percent said he had brought Americans together, 44 percent said he had divided them.
When given a choice between an unnamed Democrat and Mr. Bush, 43 percent of the registered voters polled said they would vote for Mr. Bush, while 45 percent said they would vote for the Democrat.
The survey found the nation still in an anxious state economically, despite the recent rebound in economic growth and the improvement in the stock market. The economy, jobs and unemployment led the list of most important issues for voters, with health care and education not far behind.
Administration officials argue that by almost every major measure -- save jobs -- the economy is in a strong recovery, and that employment will soon catch up. In fact, more people now rate the state of the economy as "very" or "fairly" good -- 54 percent, compared with 41 percent who gave it that rating a year ago. Similarly, people are more optimistic about where the economy is headed -- 34 percent said they believed it was getting better and 26 percent worse, another sharp turnaround from last year.
But many in the poll still worried. "They say unemployment is down, but that's because a lot of people's unemployment ran out, so they're not listed anymore," said Ellen Diliello, a Republican retiree in Preble, N.Y. Thirty-nine percent said they remained worried that they or someone in their household would lose a job in the coming year.
Moreover, many Americans say their own economic circumstances have not improved much. A majority said they were having a hard time keeping up with their bills. Only 19 percent said their tax burden had been eased by the administration's policies, while 32 percent said their taxes had gone up and 44 percent said the policies had not affected them one way or the other.
Mr. Bush argues that the tax cuts are spurring economic growth and must be made permanent. But only 27 percent in the poll said they believed the tax cuts were good for the economy, while 17 percent said the tax cuts were bad and 51 percent said the cuts had not made much of a difference.
The perception that Mr. Bush's economic policies favor the affluent and big business remains; 64 percent said they thought "big business" had too much influence on the Bush administration, while 57 percent said the administration's policies favored the rich, as opposed to the middle class and the poor.
"It's a Republican theory that if you help large corporations, it should filter down to everyone else, but it takes too long, and sometimes it just doesn't," said Patricia Domingo, a 58-year-old Democrat in Byron, Calif.
In contrast, Ardis Barton, a Republican businessman in Earth, Texas, argued, "The tax cuts were needed and he got them through. The economy is improving, and that proves he made the right choice on the tax cuts."
Mr. Bush's proposal to overhaul immigration policies, announced this month, is getting a skeptical response. Two thirds of those polled said immigrants who entered the country illegally should not be allowed to stay and work in the United States for three years, as Mr. Bush proposes. There was little enthusiasm for increasing levels of immigration at all, with a plurality saying immigration should be decreased.
The survey also found divisions over Mr. Bush's proposal for returning to the Moon by 2020, and eventually using a lunar base as a launching pad to Mars. Forty percent said the nation was spending too much on space exploration programs, while 17 percent said the nation was spending too little. Forty-eight percent said they would favor the United States' sending astronauts to explore Mars, while 47 percent said they would oppose it.
And 58 percent said building a space station on the Moon was not worth the risks and costs, while 35 percent said it was.
Despite the widespread support for Mr. Bush's handling of terrorism, there are also doubts about his handling of foreign affairs in general. Forty-seven percent in the survey said they approved of the way he was handling foreign affairs, while 45 percent disapproved.
Moreover, half the public said the result of the war in Iraq was not worth the loss of life and other costs. Forty-nine percent said Mr. Bush was too quick to get the United States involved in a war there, while 35 percent said the timing had been about right and 13 percent said the administration was too slow to act.
The public is also divided over Mr. Bush's current handling of the situation in Iraq, with 48 percent approving and 46 percent disapproving. In addition, 6 in 10 of those polled said the Bush administration had been hiding information about the existence of weapons of mass destruction; only 27 percent said the administration had told the public most of what it knows.

How the Poll on the Presidency Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Monday through Thursday with 1,022 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger. For instance, for self-described Democratic primary voters it is plus or minus five points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.
The complete questionnaire and results are available online at www.nytimes .com/politics.

For Sales Growth, Companies Look to Asia

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
ARROW ELECTRONICS of Melville, the global distributor of electronic components, has seen the future, and it's Asia. William Mitchell, Arrow's president and chief executive, said: "Asia is about 10 percent of our business right now. In five years, it's going to be about one-quarter. Asia is our growth engine." 
 The refrain is much the same at CMP Media, the trade publishing giant in Manhasset. It announced last month that it was closing its flagship publication, EBN, originally Electronic Buyers' News. By March, CMP said, it will introduce a replacement, Electronics Supply & Manufacturing, with an emphasis on Asia. 
 At the Standard Microsystems Corporation, a semiconductor manufacturer in Hauppauge, sales in Asia now represent 88 percent of revenues, up from 67 percent four years ago. "The vast majority of our business we do in Asia," said Steven J. Bilodeau, the chairman and chief executive. 
With North America and Europe just beginning to show signs of recovering from the long information technology slump, executives in the United States are looking to India, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and especially China to replace withering American and European sales.
In 2002, the last full year for which data are available, the United States exported $43.1 billion worth of high-tech components to Asia, the largest Asian export category. Overall, components accounted for nearly a quarter of American exports Asia, which reached at total of $173.6 billion in 2002, according to federal trade data.
In addition to electronic components, a category that includes products like silicon chips, computer hard drives and connecting cables, Long Island's other major manufacturing categories also figure prominently in Asian sales. Exports of aviation equipment ranked third, at $15.4 billion, and exports of optical and medical equipment came in fourth, at $12.6 billion. 
On Long Island, where electronics and instruments historically lead the export parade, interest in doing business in Asia is perhaps at an all-time high, despite the weakness of the Japanese economy. 
"There has been an enormous shift in the supply chain over the past four years," said Mr. Mitchell of Arrow. "In 1999, the U.S. consumed about 40 percent of all electronic components. Japan consumed about 25 percent." Now, he said, the United States uses about 20 percent, Japan is under 20 percent, and Asia takes up the slack. "Asia has gone from purchasing maybe 15 percent of all components to purchasing about 40 percent," Mr. Mitchell said. "An industrial revolution has taken place in only four years."
After decades of treating Asia primarily as a source of inexpensive parts and cheap labor, Asia is now seen as a major customer, a view that reflects a boom in industrial production driven largely by a rise in American-style consumerism. Governments that have historically kept tight control over private business activities are loosening up.
Unsurprisingly, most eyes are on China.
"China is the fastest-growing market for component consumption in the world," said Paul Durando, a director of Nu Horizons, a components distributor in Hauppauge. "We believe you have to be in China in a big way."
Like Arrow and many other American companies, Nu Horizons has invested heavily in Asia in the last two years. In less than 18 months, Mr. Durando said, Nu Horizons has opened two branches in India, two in China and one each in Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. 
The company's investments are paying off, Mr. Durando said. Sales for the most recent nine months surpassed $37 million, up from $15 million in the same period in the prior year. The company has about 55 employees in Asia, most of them local residents rather than expatriated Americans.
While hiring native employees to staff foreign operations is politically expedient and often mandated by government contracts, the decision is also good management, Mr. Durando said. "It may sound trite, but when in Rome do as the Romans do," he added. 
At Arrow, the goal is to pull ahead of arch-rival Avnet to be the undisputed No. 1 electronics distributor in the world. "That means being the clear No. 1 in Asia," Mr. Mitchell said. "And to be No. 1 in Asia means being declared No. 1 in China."
To expand successfully in Asia, Mr. Mitchell said, Arrow is following a plan it calls scaffolding. "We have certain capabilities at Arrow, and we take those people who have those capabilities and transplant them to Asia," he said. "That's the scaffolding. Later we take it down," meaning that the American executives return home, and their proteges apply what they have learned. Arrow has about 1,000 employees in Asia and plans to triple that number in the next four years, Mr. Mitchell said. 
"The usual way American companies grow overseas is to send expats over to do key jobs for three years," Mr. Mitchell said. "I have seen mixed results from that. The practice leaves you open to the charge that you are reserving the big jobs for your own people. In Asia, Arrow is following the path of hiring local people."
Arrow executives emphasize passing along Arrow's corporate culture and knowledge base, Mr. Mitchell said, rather than simply doing the operational work themselves. For the company's Asian strategy to succeed, Mr. Mitchell said, "it has got to have an Arrow culture with an Asian face."
Savio Chan, the president of US China Partners, a trade consulting practice in Melville, said, "It isn't easy doing business in Asia, but it isn't as hard as you might think." Mr. Chan, a Hong Kong native who emigrated to the United States 20 years ago, said that the Chinese, long enthusiastic consumers of American culture, were more enthusiastic than ever and that the government was rapidly losing its anti-capitalist policies and attitudes.
"In China, people love Madonna, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Burger King, you name it," Mr. Chan said. "You want Starbucks, it's everywhere, and I mean everywhere."
Mr. Chan noted that Beijing, which in the past imposed restrictions on foreign companies hoping to do business in China, was increasingly less adversarial. China, a member of the World Trade Organization since 2001, is preparing for the Summer Olympics in 2008 and the World's Fair in 2010, so "the government is motivated to be more friendly," Mr. Chan said.
Successfully settingup operations in Asia poses unique challenges, including finding a cultural middle ground, several executives said. Patrick Moffett, the vice president for global logistics at the Audiovox Corporation in Hauppauge, a consumer electronics company specializing in audiovisual products, buys nearly all of its components in Asia. 
One problem is that Asian trading partners, particularly the Chinese, may lack Americans' preoccupation with security, Mr. Moffett said. "We're trying to secure the entire supply chain, which is what Customs is looking for," said Mr. Moffett, who is the chairman of the Long Island Import Export Association. "But the Chinese are not into the security as we are. Who is authorized to load the trucks? Were background checks done on those people? It's often hard to get answers out of the Chinese."
As Asian expansion continues, most American executives appear willing to find ways to make the partnerships work. "Yes, there are cultural differences," said Mr. Mitchell, Arrow's president. "But it's a two-way street."

Arrivederci, Jeans: The Suit Is Back, Caro; Put It On

BYLINE:  By GUY TREBAY

DATELINE: MILAN, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
If ever fashion needs to crank up the laugh track, it can always consult the program notes designers concoct to explain their inspirations. Assuming that consumers need stories before they can understand new clothing, designers tend to oblige with some pretty loopy flights of fantasy.
 For the fall 2004 men's wear collections shown in Milan, which ended on Thursday, there were Teutonic invitations from Jil Sander to join a New Order of gentlemen; from Ralph Lauren to fall in with the classic preppy styles characterizing an Old Order of same; and from Versace to indulge in the house's usual Rock Glam, this time with "a twinge of Anglomania" (ouch!). 
 The designer Neil Barrett invoked the ill-fated Antarctic explorations of Ernest Shackleton, explaining in an interview that "I always like a bit of snow." Ennio Capasa, the designer of Costume National, set aside his usual Mick Jagger fixation and spoke of the heroes of action films. At Pringle, there was a whiff of the Scottish Highlands (and kilts). At Etro the invitation was to discover the "right spirit" of the knight in a medieval Snakes and Ladders exercise called Il Gioco dell'Oca, or the Game of the Goose. 
And why not? Goose games sound sexier than the plain truth, which is that nearly everyone here is conspiring to bring back the suit. 
The notion may seem odd from a business standpoint, since earnings in the $55 billion men's wear industry have been deflating for years, with suit sales in particular down by 11 percent in the United States since 2002, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. And yet, despite the gloom, this proved to be an excellent season for Italian men's wear, one that buoyed retailers and also suggested that a separate underlying narrative may be driving a return to something like optimism about men's clothes. 
Much was made here of a sartorial revival, with an unspoken reference to the tailoring traditions in which Italy has long led the world. Ever since this country joined the European Union, a current of nostalgia has emerged here for an Italy that is swiftly passing out of existence, a mythical place amalgamated from local cultures that, however deep-rooted, may not prove strong enough to resist the global market juggernaut. "They have the mills, they have the looms, they have the craftsmen, they have the tailoring," said Robert Burke, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman. And yet, Mr. Burke pointed out, there is a move afoot to replace the treasured Made in Italy label with one that reads Made in Europe, so that manufacture can be cheaply outsourced throughout the European Union.
In reaction, Italian designers seem suddenly mobilized to reclaim their cradle culture. The most sincere example is provided by Dolce & Gabbana, whose collections for both men and women are consistently nourished by images from a vanishing past. The Fellini Rome invoked by a plaster backdrop of the Trevi Fountain used to showcase Dolce & Gabbana's fine men's wear collection is now basically a figment from late night TV. Most of the people in the audience were probably too young to know that Rie Rasmussen was impersonating Anita Ekberg when she stepped into the fountain and ruffled her platinum mane. 
But revivalism, well conceived, can result in showings like Dolce & Gabbana's, which paired natty suit jackets in jacquard wools, gigolo velvets, subtle tweeds and fur-front sweater jackets of Marcello Mastroianni vintage with the low-slung baggy trousers adapted from the hip-hop scene. Of all the designers at work now, this team seems best placed to exploit a formula of high/low dressing to establish themselves as an indispensable brand for a generation new to the work force and its constricting uniforms. 
Older men, of course, have already been broken to the suit and to ties knotted without irony around the neck. For those guys, the return of Jil Sander to her own house, after a dispute with the company's owner, Prada, is decidedly welcome news. "Art dealers can breathe a sigh of relief," said one buyer. In her heyday, she was the designer of choice in SoHo, Chelsea and along 57th Street. 
The art dealer demographic tends to skew older than the pubescent types on whom Ms. Sander likes to present her clothes. That does not mean that the subtly tailored slim suits are not for men who shave every day. 
Worn with the wing-tip shoes that were everywhere, Ms. Sanders's strong clothes deployed restraint in silhouette, in palette and in styling. There were postman-blue suits, olive drab coats, mouse-color pinwale corduroy jackets stiffened with canvas to keep them from looking like costumes for a revival of "Dead Poets Society." There were coats with epaulets, slender flannel jackets and a blue shearling coat as tidily shaped as a hand-rolled cigarette. It goes without saying that stuff of such economical effects is bound to cost a fortune, as, in Ms. Sanders's case, it always has. 
While it remains unclear whether Italian clothing exports can recover from their 2003 slump, when sales to the United States fell a drastic 10 percent, the week gave hope that the Italian fashion industry can regain lost drive and focus. Who knows? Perhaps the suit will actually catch on. "Suits are very strong for us now," said Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's. "Ties, too, believe it or not."
If it does, consumers will have an unusually fine array of choices, among them the chalk-stripe suits (with cuffs!) at Versace, intended, as the designer Donatella Versace said, to evoke "extreme elegance" and old-school tailoring "alla Milanese." The tone-on-tone shirts and nipped waists on ventless midnight blue jackets seemed more characteristic of a snappy Neapolitan than the sober gents of Milan. And the Anglophile twinge in the secondary Versus line seemed like nothing that two aspirins and a good night's sleep wouldn't cure. The collection reflected a serious effort by Versace to recapture the late Gianni Versace's small-town Calabrian ideas of glamour, notions persuasive enough that they actually transformed a personage as occupationally chic as Diana, Princess of Wales. 
At Valentino, the reference was Rome, whose tailors are probably second only to the Neapolitans in their ability to suit the man who sees himself as a dandy. There were wide collars and deep pocket flaps, narrow shirts with silk piping, wool jacquards and shaved shearling blousons and, somehow, a believable suit in red. The most unlikely comeback story of the past couple of seasons came last year with Valentino Garavani's R.E.D. collection, which discovered in southern Italian resorts inexhaustible mines of imagery. This season's R.E.D. collection continued the successes of the last, with sandblasted corduroys and low-riding velvet trousers and with blouson jackets that, against all odds, looked cool.
Despite the idiotic French braids and rattails woven into the models' hair, the collection telegraphed a belief in an evolving market for serious men's clothing, and a need that the urban wear designer Marc Ecko spoke about when he said in Florence last week that sooner or later a blazer must come into every man's life. Alexander McQueen expressed a similar sentiment with his first men's wear collection in years, shown against a backdrop of an erotic film about his friend Annabelle Neilson and a Danish model whose name Mr. McQueen could not recall.
"I had the experience of wanting the clothes and I couldn't find them," said the designer, who famously began his career as an apprentice on Savile Row. "I don't think subtlety is very much evident in men's wear right now," he added. "There's a little too much extra in the clothes." To remedy that, he presented a line of clothes inspired by, among others, Mick Jagger, the elegantly anachronistic Orthodox Jews of Antwerp, and Starsky and Hutch. Of these influences, the frock coats inspired by Belgium's Hasidim were best. 
Calvin Klein presented a show that shared Mr. McQueen's sensibility, the designer Italo Zucchelli showing trademen's jackets with quilted panels and emphasizing leather, lean shapes and fringed scarves that might be worn by creative types. 
What one might call a misguided level of extraness seemed to characterize the collections shown by Prada, Etro and Ralph Lauren, to name three designers not often mentioned in the same sentence. At Prada, unlined coats and jackets purposely creased to look as though their owners had lost the dry cleaner's number, seemed conceptually unresolved. At Etro, a presentation involving jesters, a game board and theatrical beards interfered with some lively offerings that included corduroy suits in pink, lilac and powder blue. At Ralph Lauren, the exploration of American upper class folkways came closer than ever to self-parody. 
The bulky tweeds, flashy socks, wool and leather camp moccasins and swallowtail coats tended to obscure a more appealing selection of fitted suits that reprised an earlier Milan show of Mr. Lauren's, at which he anticipated by a year the tailoring trend. The show's capper came when the lanky Mipam Thurman, Uma's brother, appeared wearing a floor-brushing shearling greatcoat for evening, which was accessorized with pumps and a silver-headed cane. "That is for your next pimp wedding," remarked the editor of one major men's magazine as the crowd made its exit. Kid Rock will officiate. 
Hokey archetypes, for once, made a scant showing at the collections, which may have added to the general air of relief among retailers who have sometimes had trouble figuring out how they were going to sell men on dressing like cowpokes or porn stars or Kurt Cobain. The response to Tom Ford's final men's wear show for Gucci, which drew on the image of a debonair hedonist wearing a body-molding suit and with a whiskey and cigarette in hand, was such general elation that his corporate bosses may want to reconsider and bring him back for a series of farewell shows. 
If there was one designer whose vision seemed wayward it was Giorgio Armani, whose refusal to bow to trends can be read as principled, or else as a sign of someone whom success has isolated from vital information. Unlike his near contemporary Calvin Klein, Mr. Armani evinces no particular aptitude for assessing a landscape in which ideas of masculinity seem to change by the hour. Mr. Armani's showing of soft cardigan jackets, flowing trousers and high-buttoned tunic coats were taken by one critic as a sign that the designer had cottoned to the new "metrosexual style." It happens that this discovery comes at a time when any right-thinking metrosexual seems best advised to take his inner woman over to Barneys and get her a crisply tailored suit, the better to frame all those complex masculine/feminine dualities.

HEADLINE: An Echo of Debate Over Commuter Tax 

BYLINE:  By DAVID WINZELBERG

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND'S largest business group has come out swinging against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's campaign for a property tax break in New York City. Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, is arguing that city taxpayers' gain may turn into an additional tax burden for the suburbs.
 Though a court has mandated that New York City schools be better funded by this summer, Mr. Bloomberg wants to give back 18.5 percent of the city's property tax revenue to city taxpayers. In a statement issued on Jan. 7, Mr. Crosson described the proposed $250 million one-time rebate as "highly inappropriate under the circumstances facing the city, the city's suburban neighbors and the state." 
 He was alluding to a ruling last June by the state's Court of Appeals, which found that New York City's public schools do not provide a "sound basic education" for city students and ordered the state to re-examine the formula by which it dispenses more than $14 billion a year to school districts across the state. The plaintiffs, a group of advocates for inner-city schools, have estimated the cost of compliance at an additional $2 billion a year.
Facing an April deadline for presentation of a new state budget, a commission appointed by Governor Pataki has been conducting hearings before producing a plan to bring the state into compliance. Now that Mayor Bloomberg has proposed the tax rebate, Mr. Crosson is arguing that the tax load will fall inordinately on the suburbs.
"The issue is who is going to pay for it," Mr. Crosson said in an interview. "This will put them $250 million deeper in the hole, and taxpayers outside of the city will have to pay." 
Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg's office, said: "The Long Island Association should focus on Long Island issues and not try to take money out of New York City taxpayers' pockets." 
Long Islanders foot the bill for the bulk of their own education costs, paying an average 72 percent of school funding, according to Mr. Crosson. He said residents of New York City currently pay 47 percent of their school costs, with the rest covered by the state and federal governments. The city spends about $11,500 per pupil, nearly $2,500 less than the amount spent on the average Long Island student.
"Long Islanders do not spend more money on education because New York State sends us the money," Mr. Crosson said. "They spend it because they have made a policy decision that the education of their children is worth taxing themselves. New York City has made a policy decision not to spend as much on education as Long Island does, and not to tax its residents for that purpose. That was the wrong choice, and the condition of the city's schools shows the result."
A recent study by the L.I.A.'s chief economist, Pearl Kamer, showed that middle-income families on Long Island pay much more in local taxes than families in the five boroughs. A Brooklyn family with an income of $36,000 would pay 43 percent less in property and local income taxes combined than if they moved to Hempstead, even thought there is no local income tax there, the study reported.
Mr. Crosson said he would not be complaining about the proposed city tax rebate had it not come on top of the court's findings on the city's failing schools. 
"It's going to cost a lot of money," Mr. Crosson said. "We think New York City taxpayers have not paid their fair share in the past, and Long Islanders shouldn't be asked to fix New York City's problem."
Mr. Bloomberg's proposed tax rebate, an average check of $400 to about 600,000 owners of co-ops, condominiums and one- to three-family homes, comes a year after a $1.8 billion property tax increase, and will have to be approved by the State Legislature as well as the City Council. "If there is any possibility that Long Island has to pay for this, we will urge legislators in the suburbs not to approve it," Mr. Crosson said.
The rebate is relatively small given the size of the city and state budgets, said William Johnson, superintendent of Rockville Centre schools, but it is more symbolic. "It makes no sense," said Dr. Johnson, a past president of the State Council of School Superintendents. "New York City is saying 'we don't have the money to educate our children,' but then they want to give this money back. How do they expect us to support that?"
Dr. Johnson said the Bloomberg proposal sets up another battle between the suburbs and the city, reminiscent of the debate over Mr. Bloomberg's campaign to renew the commuter tax on people who work in New York City but do not live there.
The tax was collected until 1999, when it was abolished by the State Legislature under prodding from Governor Pataki and suburban representatives. But with the city's economy in a slump after 9/11, the mayor proposed reinstating the tax in November 2002. Mr. Pataki refused to endorse the idea, and suburban legislators heaped scorn on it. Instead, the Legislature raised the city income and sales tax rates last May to produce an estimated $400 million a year in additional revenue. 
A supporter of the rebate proposal, State Senator Serphin R. Maltese of Glendale, Queens, said he didn't think there would be a big fight over the issue. "I think we can work out an agreement," he said. "There's no reason to pit one part of the state against another."
Mr. Maltese said that the rebate "won't come at the expense of school districts in other areas" and added that people outside of the city should be advocates for their own districts. 
As he put it: "Let them govern the suburbs. Let the mayor govern the city."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Get Ready for 2014; 
Investing in the Future, and Mortgaging It

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH prides himself on thinking big, whether it's a $1 trillion tax cut, a huge expansion of Medicare or, as this past week, sending Americans to Mars.
 But if there is a single consistent theme to the current White House and Congress, fiscal hawks say, it's buy now and pay later. 
 From Medicare and Mars to the expansion of tax-free retirement accounts, these critics say, the Bush administration and Congress are contemplating commitments that work like balloon mortgages: small costs up front and huge bills down the road.
Administration officials contend that the prospective problems are overblown and that the deficits will decline sharply as a result of spending restraint and faster economic growth, which will lead to higher tax revenues. 
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, who served as the domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan, says critics of Mr. Bush are misguided because long-term deficits are almost impossible to calculate and because so much depends on the pace of economic growth.
"If you want to do something that's really scary, go back four years and see what people were projecting then, or the four years before that," said Mr. Anderson, noting that forecasters failed to predict the flood of tax revenue that came during the boom of the late 1990's and failed to predict the economy's recent resurgence. 
"Did anyone predict the last 8.2 percent growth that we had in the third quarter?" Mr. Anderson asked.
Stronger economic growth is already lifting tax revenues. The Treasury Department noted that corporate tax revenues jumped by about one-third compared with a year ago in the three months from October through December.
But some government officials say they are growing nervous about looming bills. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, formerly the chief economist on President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and now director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the growing pile of unpaid bills could become a drag on future growth.
"Growth, in the end, is about giving up something now in order to invest it in the future," Mr. Holtz-Eakin remarked as Congress was struggling to pass the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. "If you look at the budget proposals, many of them are not about giving up stuff now. They are about getting stuff now."
The federal budget deficit this year is likely to approach $500 billion, a record. President Bush has vowed to cut that number in half over the next five years, a goal that many analysts say is unrealistic. But even if he succeeds, consider the bills that could come due after that.
The new space mission would cost only $1 billion in new money over the next five years -- $11 billion will come from other NASA programs. But that would be just a down payment. 
The cost of establishing a base on the moon by 2020, as President Bush proposed last week, could easily cost $150 billion or more, said John E. Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.com, a research group in Arlington, Va. The cost of a manned mission to Mars almost defies projection, but when the first President Bush proposed a Mars mission in 1989 the estimates were about $400 billion.
The virtue of the space mission is that Congress can abandon it long before the heaviest spending is required. But it will be harder to escape many other bills that start to come due about 10 years from now.
Consider the cost of eliminating the so-called inheritance tax, which is supposed to be phased out slowly. Richard Kogan, an economistat the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, estimates the Treasury would lose $26 billion in 2009, $60 billion when the tax is fully repealed in 2010, and more each year after that.
Likewise, most of Mr. Bush's tax cuts are scheduled to expire at some point over the next decade, but the president has vowed to make almost all of them permanent. Similarly, scores of small tax breaks are routinely extended by Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last summer that retaining all these tax provisions would increase the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion by 2013.
Then there is the alternative minimum tax, which was intended to prevent wealthy taxpayers from using deductions and tax shelters to shield much of their income.
The legislation creating the tax did not allow income to be adjusted for inflation, meaning that millions of additional nonwealthy families will fall under its requirements and face sharply higher taxes in the years ahead. 
Republican and Democratic lawmakers all want to stop that from happening, but the cost in lost tax revenue through 2014 would be more than $400 billion.
The next big bills to come due will be those for the new Medicare prescription drug program, which Congress passed late last year. The program is expected to cost $400 billion through 2013, but that is just the start. Given the rapidly growing numbers of retirees, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will cost more than $1 trillion over the decade that begins in 2014.
Prescription drug costs are just one piece of the biggest bill of all coming due: the cost of health care and retirement benefits for some 75 million baby boomers who will start to reach retirement age early in the next decade.
"There is a fundamental disconnect between these big sweeping agendas and the limited-government tax policies that the administration is pursuing," said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, an advocacy group that lobbies for tighter fiscal discipline. "In any particular year, this is something you can afford. But in order to be manageable, you have to have somebody managing. And right now, there is nobody managing."
Conservative Republican lawmakers are starting to rebel.
"We've got to change our whole mind-set," said Representative Sue Myrick, Republican of North Carolina and chairwoman of the House Republican Study Committee. "I come from an area where people are real supportive of space exploration, but they are saying we ought to deal with the problems at home first. We cannot afford to keep spending the way we have and expect to get away with it."

HEADLINE: Business; 
Analyze This: Blodget's New Act

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
DURING the height of the dot-com boom, Henry Blodget, then an analyst for Merrill Lynch, shouted from the rooftops -- and the studios of CNBC -- to herald the unparalleled power of the Internet. So it is perhaps fitting that after the Securities and Exchange Commission decided that his exuberance had gotten the best of him and barred him from the industry for life, he chose the Web for his second act.
 Mr. Blodget, a celebrity stock picker who made as much as $12 million a year, is now working as a freelance writer for Slate, an online magazine owned by Microsoft, where he has been writing about the Martha Stewart trial. When Ms. Stewart enters the courtroom to answer charges that she misled investigators and the public about her reasons for the sale of her ImClone Systems stock, Mr. Blodget will serve as a Boswell on the proceedings, filtering her travails through his own recent public abasement. 
 Mr. Blodget may be choosing to step back into a spotlight that once left him deeply seared, but he does so gingerly. After the bottom fell out, he made a very quick media trip from pundit to pinata, and he was very chaste and careful during a recent interview at a cafe in the West Village in Manhattan. 
Given Mr. Blodget's iconic status, it is a bit jarring to sit across from an actual person who belongs to the name. At 37, he still manages to be boyish, with a mop of blond hair, and he has a solicitous manner. But there is no evidence of the unalloyed optimism that so endeared him -- for a time -- to the media and the investing public. 
Mr. Blodget, however, can discern a bright side when he sees one. "All things considered, I prefer writing about an investigation to being the subject of one," he said, taking a bite of salad. 
Having been escorted out of an industry where he once moved markets with his pronouncements, Mr. Blodget knows a thing or two about comeuppance. "Martha Stewart is sitting at the intersection of the stock market, law, politics, celebrity and the economic cycle," he said. "A year ago, in a less visible way, I was sitting at the same intersection."
In a culture of seemingly endless forgiveness, Mr. Blodget is testing some limits. Many average Americans who threw their college savings down a new-economy rat hole have not forgotten that he was one of the digital evangelists who pointed the way while his firm made millions doing the banking for iffy initial public offerings. A graduate of Yale with a degree in history and no training in finance, Mr. Blodget was seen by some as the biggest bubblehead in the bubble economy.
Jacob H. Zamansky, a Manhattan lawyer, won a $400,000 settlement from Merrill Lynch on behalf of Dr. Debases Kanjilal, a Queens pediatrician, after arguing that Mr. Blodget's advice was deeply compromised. Mr. Blodget's research was "misleading because it failed to disclose his conflict of interest," Mr. Zamansky said. "He was being paid based on the banking business he generated and did not believe what he was writing in his reports."
Mr. Blodget sprang from the relative obscurity of CIBC Oppenheimer, where had worked as an analyst. In 1998, he boldly suggested that Amazon.com, then trading at about $240, would surpass $400 a share. When the prophecy was quickly fulfilled, he was hired by Merrill Lynch, which had been left out of most of the lucrative underwriting business in the boom and was looking to raise its visibility.
THE assignment came with an explicit conflict -- analysis and banking, supposedly distinct, had blurred in an overheated era -- and Mr. Blodget was handed a very big megaphone at a very tender age. He was perfectly cast. Self-effacing and whip-smart, the camera loved him and so did the viewing public. He made a lot of money for many newly hatched investors, not by picking good companies but by picking stocks that would go up -- and up and up. It was a great strategy until the bubble burst.
But after agreeing to pay $4 million to settle his case with the S.E.C. last year, Mr. Blodget was not willing to wear the hair shirt forever. Early in his career, he worked in journalism, at junior levels, at CNN, Harper's magazine and Audubon magazine, so his current assignment represents something of a return. And there are echoes of his time as an analyst.
Last Monday night, he was in a familiar chair at the CNBC studio, spouting opinions and making pronouncements to news anchor Maria Bartiromo, this time about Martha Stewart. He may not get the kind of attention he once received, but he is hardly keeping his light under a bushel.
Given how badly his last trip through the crucible of public opinion ended, why would Mr. Blodget again submit his analysis for public scrutiny? "I actually liked working in the public eye," he said. "You couldn't do your job if you weren't willing to wake up in the morning, open your mouth and get hit in the head with a two-by-four. What I wasn't wild about was becoming a symbol. Hopefully, someone else can play that role next time."
An examination of his stock recommendations at Merrill suggests that his stint there has been rendered in cartoonish ways. Even as he fanned the flames of the digital revolution, Mr. Blodget reminded investors that they should not put more than 10 percent of their portfolio in volatile Internet stocks and that 75 percent of Web-based companies would eventually come to naught. But those cautionary notes were remembered less than his relentless suggestion that the biggest risk was to remain on the sidelines of a paradigm shift in technology and investing.
Mr. Blodget ended up in the cross hairs of both the legal system and the court of public opinion precisely because of his occasional candor. Caught, like a bug in amber, in a stock rating system where up was down and buy meant sell, he played along. 
He said he did so in part because he truly believed that the Internet had changed everything. Perhaps, as some have said, he also did so because he was well compensated for waving the pompoms on behalf of Web-based companies that Merrill Lynch was hoping to do banking business with. He never once issued a "sell" recommendation on Internet stocks he followed. In the summer of 2000, while he publicly recommended the stock of InfoSpace -- a company that was interested in buying Go2Net, a Merrill Lynch client -- he privately confided in e-mail messages to colleagues that he thought it was a "piece of junk." 
When the market cratered, the hosannas stopped and the e-mailed death threats began. After he left his job at the end of 2001, he ended up with time on his hands. "I followed the Martha Stewart case extremely closely, because as it developed, I was in the middle of some regulatory proceedings of my own," he said. "I found myself scrutinizing the indictments in several cases, including Martha Stewart's, and at some point, I though it would be interesting to write about."
A friend recommended that he call Jacob Weisberg, the editor of Slate. Mr. Weisberg met with Mr. Blodget and decided that it was worth a shot. "Henry has a rare understanding of the legal issues in the case, and he also has a unique access to the psychological issues," Mr. Weisberg said. "I think that already his analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the case is the best that anyone has done."
THE disclosure statement he wrote for Slate that accompanies his coverage is a classic of the genre, basking in some of the parallels of the situation.
"Like Stewart, I was, for a while, bathed in the golden glow of prosperity, a symbol of American capitalism and the optimism of the Internet age, and, now, like Stewart, in the harsh light of the bust, I am seen by some as a symbol of 'excess,' a 'fallen star,' a 'disgrace,"' he wrote. "Like Stewart, I have been charged with securities fraud. Like Stewart, I have been the object of adulatory and venomous press coverage."
Undoubtedly, some will suggest that Mr. Blodget's coverage is stunt journalism, akin to having Tonya Harding report on figure skating. "I don't know that Tonya Harding has anything interesting to say," Mr. Weisberg said. "Henry is very committed, and I think that at this point, he owns the story."
Taking the trip through the swinging doors of the courtroom and coming out with something interesting each day is a very different matter, one that has Mr. Blodget nervous, but excited.
Michael Lewis, the author of "Moneyball" and "The New New Thing," who covered the Microsoft antitrust trial for Slate, said he thought that Mr. Blodget had some assets as a reporter.
"The problem with this sort of reporting is how little most reporters know," Mr. Lewis said. "I think it's wonderful to have someone who knows this world intimately writing about it." 
"I don't think you are dealing with a fundamentally dishonest character here," Mr. Lewis said. "His vice was his gift for enthusiasm at a time when enthusiasm was toxic."
WITHIN the industry, the inflated recommendations were accepted by some with a wink. But many small investors who flocked to the markets when it seemed money was there for the taking, were not in on the code. They took Mr. Blodget's ratings as gospel and, in the process, made and then lost a great deal of money. 
David Denby, a film critic and staff writer at The New Yorker, was one of them. He was romanced by Mr. Blodget's optimism and intelligence, so they began to have lunch occasionally. He has since written a book about his own adventures in the stock market called "American Sucker" (Little Brown). He credits Mr. Blodget as a good writer, but says his choice of subjects is revealing.
"There is an enormous displacement going on here," said Mr. Denby. "His obsession with Martha Stewart is a way of denying his own legal difficulties and his own ethical problems."
But like many who know Mr. Blodget personally, he cannot bring himself to wish him ill. "I am rooting for him," said Mr. Denby. "But now he is a writer, which is my turf, and I would advise him to come clean, as soon as he can."
That won't be happening. One of the requirements of his deal with the S.E.C. is that he not characterize his own guilt or innocence, an issue that he is likely to have strong opinions about. The closest he can come is the following:
"I take responsibility for everything I said," Mr. Blodget stated. "Some of it I am proud of and some of it I now regard as moronic."
In explaining why he ended up in the public stockades, Mr. Blodget is willing to point to a favored quotation, in "A Short History of Financial Euphoria," by John Kenneth Galbraith: "The final and common feature of the speculative episode -- in stock markets, real estate, art or junk bonds -- is what happens after the inevitable crash. This, invariably, will be a time of anger and recrimination and also of profoundly unsubtle introspection. The anger will fix upon the individuals who were previously most admired for their financial imagination and acuity."
Others take a little less historical view of Mr. Blodget's rise and fall.
"Blodget's role at Merrill might be compared at least partially to William Hurt's role in 'Broadcast News,"' said Eric Von der Porten, a manager at Leeward Investments, a hedge fund based in the San Carlos, Calif. " I don't think he was ever a great analyst, but he knows how to tell a good story, he's very personable, and he comes across well on television. He was also willing to play the game of backing Merrill's I.P.O.'s and supporting investment banking."
William Fleckenstein, a money manager in Seattle who took a dim view of Mr. Blodget's research during the boom, said his role had been inflated. "If I were going to make a list of corporate and Wall Street war criminals, he wouldn't make my top 20," Mr. Fleckenstein said. "I think he had a conscience, unlike a lot of these guys."
Gary Lutin, an investment banker in New York, said that while Mr. Blodget had plenty of competition in frothy analysis, he did not serve investors well. "He knew what he was doing," Mr. Lutin said. "He could have kept himself in shoes and food without misleading the public."
A part of Mr. Blodget seems to envy Ms. Stewart, who although quite bloodied, will get her day in court. "In the court of public opinion, one is guilty until proven innocent and, in the court of law, one is innocent until proven guilty," he said.
Mr. Blodget was less surprised than many others by Ms. Stewart's rapid trip from America's most admired homemaker into a tar baby of suspected corporate malfeasance.
"I am not amazed, because I have seen it before," he said. "It is startling how quickly what one is a symbol of can change."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
O'Neill SaysBush Was Set On Cutting Taxes, Too

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IF there is a phrase that summarizes Paul H. O'Neill's view of the White House during his two years as President Bush's first Treasury secretary, it is his apparent remark that cabinet debates were exercises in "incestuous amplification."
 The comment is made in "The Price of Loyalty," a new book by Ron Suskind about Mr. O'Neill's tumultuous tenure before being fired in December 2002. Rather than encouraging policy debates, Mr. O'Neill contended that big decisions were made with almost no discussion and even less debate. 
 Mr. O'Neill has provoked a political firestorm with his contention that President Bush tilted toward war with Iraq almost as soon as he took office; the administration has vigorously denied that. But the former Treasury secretary described a similar pattern in Mr. Bush's push to cut taxes by at least $1.7 trillion over 10 years.
Mr. O'Neill was openly skeptical about the need for big tax cuts and expressed concern about frittering away what were then huge budget surpluses.
In hindsight, he may have been too sanguine about the economy's prospects in early 2001 and too dismissive of the value in cutting taxes as a way to soften the downturn. But Mr. O'Neill may also prove to have been prescient about other issues that are likely to have long-lasting significance. One was the idea of building "triggers" into Mr. Bush's tax cuts, provisions that would prevent some of the cuts from becoming effective if budget surpluses evaporated.
Behind the scenes, Mr. O'Neill described how he quietly collaborated with Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to press for such triggers.
As recounted by Mr. O'Neill, the president and his top advisers wanted no part in such precautions.
Though the Treasury secretary had one-on-one meetings with Mr. Bush almost once a week, Mr. O'Neill said the president listened to him in stony silence. And when Mr. Greenspan testified in favor of making future tax cuts conditional on the government's fiscal health, the White House balked.
There were questions about whether the triggers would have done any good. Congress, in theory, operated under "pay-as-you-go" rules in the last years of the Clinton administration, under which any spending growth above the rate of inflation was supposed to be offset by budget cuts or tax increases. But tax revenue soared so quickly as a result of the stock market bubble and the booming economy that spending increased much faster than inflation.
Tax-cut advocates like R.Glenn Hubbard, then chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, argued that the tax cuts had to be predictable and permanent to achieve their intended impact. If people thought the cuts would expire, he and others argued, they would have less confidence about spending their extra cash.
Shortly after the tax cuts, the government's seemingly inexhaustible surpluses evaporated. Revenues plunged as the economy slid into a recession and the stock market endured a three-year plunge that wiped out investment profits. Then came the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, followed by huge increases in spending on domestic security and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Projections by Congress and the Bush administration of surpluses of $5.6 trillion over 10 years, the outlook in 2001, have turned into estimated deficits of at least $1.4 trillion and possibly as much as $5 trillion.
Mr. O'Neill strongly suggests that Mr. Bush worried little about budget deficits and did not want advice about them.
EVEN when the government was flush with money, Mr. O'Neill recounted in the book, White House officials surprised him by unilaterally reducing the goal of paying down the national debt. Instead of proposing to cut it from $3.2 trillion to $500 billion, as Mr. O'Neill favored, the Office of Management and Budget said it would be impractical to reduce it below $1.2 trillion.
Mr. O'Neill also pushed the president to set aside $1 trillion of the projected surpluses to fund one of Mr. Bush's big ideas during the campaign: the privatization of Social Security. Allowing people to invest Social Security contributions into private retirement accounts would reduce the government's future retirement liabilities, but the government would need to cover obligations to existing retirees without the money coming in from existing workers.
Mr. O'Neill said that both he and Mr. Greenspan had estimated that $1 trillion over the next decade or so would be enough to finance the transition for everybody then under the age of 37. 
But Mr. Bush "seemed to shrug it off," according to the book. 
Today, three years later, the idea is no longer an option.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: CASUALTIES; 
A Suicide Bombing Spreads Anguish Through the Working-Class Families of Baghdad

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
After the deafening blast that killed 20 or more people on Sunday, quiet washed over the places where the survivors gathered.
 At Al Karama Hospital, the wounded lay silent, or talking in softly throttled voices to friends and relatives. In the yard of the city morgue itself, one old man sat collapsed on the ground, his clothes muddied, and mourned the son-in-law whose body lay inside. 
 "Why, why did they take him?" sobbed Qasim Salman, wiping wide circles in the dust with his palms. 
Hundreds of families have asked that question since suicide bombers began shaking Iraq in August, and no doubt it will be whispered again and again this week, in places like the simple home where Mr. Salman's son-in-law, Hassan Jasem, lived in the poor district of Sadr City.
The Iraqi dead seem to mirror, in some ways, the American soldiers who die here: mostly men, many of them working class, just doing their jobs. But the landscape of grief in Iraq seems denser than in the United States, as the insurgents mount their most spectacular attacks against the Iraqis themselves.
Sunday is a work day here, and about 200 Iraqis had lined up by 8 a.m. to enter the American-led coalition headquarters when the attacker detonated his car bomb nearby. Working for the Americans makes an Iraqi a traitor in the eyes of insurgents, and a viable target. But in this ravaged economy, the Americans are among the few sources of steady pay, and those employed at the coalition headquarters thought they were safer than most because they worked inside the walled compound.
The dozens of wounded, most of them also men, poured into hospitals like Yarmouk and Al Karama, tattooed with blood. Those who could walk roamed about, crudely bandaged and dazed. Families raced in looking for a face they could still recognize. Police officers loaded the dead, bundled in plaid hospital blankets, into the beds of their white pickup trucks to take to the morgue, and raged against how routine such tasks had become over the last few months.
Often, several members of the same family find work at the coalition headquarters, sharing the little bit of prosperity found there. Jasem Salman was waiting in line with his 25-year-old son, Hassan, on Sunday as he did every day, and so was there to see his son die from a neck wound, and to take his body to Al Karama. A lean, craggy man whose blue coveralls were ripped and whose face was caked in blood and dirt, Mr. Salman paced between the room where Hassan lay under a blanket and the outer hall, waiting for the hospital to give him permission to take his son to the morgue.
Mr. Salman and his family are Kurds, and Hassan had been a Kurdish fighter -- a member of the pesh merga -- before the war, family friends said. But his father persuaded him to take a job as a welder a few weeks ago at the coalition headquarters, in order to support his new wife and the baby they expected soon. Around noon, Hassan's body was lifted into the back of a police pickup for transport to the city morgue.
At the morgue, men squatted on the ground with Hassan's father-in-law, who is also his uncle, while his father went to take care of the paperwork needed to take the body home.
Two police pickups arrived with more bodies, one of them an Iraqi policeman named Mahdi Abbas. His colleagues pulled the body onto a blood-swirled gurney that a rubber-booted attendant had brought outside.
Sgt. Hesham Ibrahim, one of the police officers, brimmed with fury at having to bring friend after friend to this place. "If I captured the person who did this under Saddam, you know they would have tortured such people in an expert way," Sergeant Ibrahim said. "If I had him alive, I would keep him alive and slice off a piece of his body every day."
The men unloaded a second body onto a gurney, and one of the blankets fell away, revealing the barrel chest of a big man. Just then, Hassan's older brother, Habib Jasem, arrived. He, too, worked at the headquarters, driving Iraqis into the sprawling compound. Habib had seen the blast from his car. He had raced toward the line where his father and brother had been waiting. But American soldiers stopped and detained him, fearing he was another suicide bomber. Only at the hospital did Habib learn that his brother had died.
Hassan's younger brother, Haider, squatted against a wall, and slapped his own head. The three brothers were best friends, and Hassan had been the lively jokester in the middle, a neighbor who had come to the morgue said.
"I just talked to him this morning," Haider shouted. "I was with him all the time. If an hour went by without my seeing him, I would miss him."
Habib sat crumpled in a corner by the morgue's doors, sobbing and shaking. Then he wailed, and wailed again and again, like a wounded animal. "Hassan is gone," he wept. "Oh my God, oh God.
"When will I find you?" he asked a brother who could no longer answer. "I can't find you any more."

HEADLINE: North Korea Eases Stormy Ties With Japan 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Facing a choice of Japanese sanctions or Japanese aid, North Korea is quietly taking steps to unblock its longstanding political logjam with the government in Tokyo.
 After 15 months of unremitting hostility, North Korea last week sent a series of signals that suggest a desire for warmer relations with Japan. 
 First, six adult children of Japanese hijackers from the Red Army faction, an extinct left-wing terror group, unexpectedly arrived here on Tuesday from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. 
Then, North Korea floated a March 20 deadline for sending to Japan the children of five Japanese who had been kidnapped by North Korea years ago. The parents came here from North Korea in October 2002.
On Saturday, four Japanese diplomats completed a visit to Pyongyang, the first by Japanese officials since relations between the countries soured in the fall of 2002. That was when North Korea first admitted that it had kidnapped Japanese citizens in the 1970's and 80's, who were forced to teach Japanese to North Korean intelligence agents.
By clarifying the fates of as many as 100 kidnapped Japanese, North Korea could win Japan's full participation in a second round of six-country talks, tentatively set for next month, that are intended to defuse North Korea's nuclear threat. 
Normalization of relations could also mean the beginning of the payments, to total $10 billion, that Japan agreed to make in reparations for its colonial occupation of northern Korea in the first half of 20th century.
"The North Koreans have come to an understanding that the Japanese can't become a participant in nuclear talks with the abductee issue outstanding," Frank Jannuzi, a Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide, said here on Thursday, after a week of meetings in Pyongyang.
If the issue of the kidnappings is not resolved to Japanese satisfaction, it is likely to strengthen support here for economic sanctions. On Friday, leaders of Japan's governing coalition and the main opposition party agreed that soon after the Parliament reconvenes on Monday, they would submit legislation to empower Japan's government to restrict trade and financial remittances to North Korea. 
"They now realize that without having the settlement of the abduction cases, Japan will not give anything to them, and this is why they are approaching us," Hatsuhisa Takashima, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in an interview on Friday. "If they really want sincere direct talks with us, that is a good sign." 
An American diplomat agreed in a separate interview, saying: "You have to have Japan squeezing the money. That's how you get motion out of them." 
A similar view came last week from Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, who is sponsoring the North Korea Freedom Act, a bill that would tie all American aid to North Korea to improvement of its human rights record.
"Japan has a strong hand to play on the issue of financial support of North Korea," Senator Brownback said in a speech here on Jan. 7, referring to annual remittances of tens of millions of dollars by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea. "It needs to play its hand." 
Japanese concern also extends to the plight of people who flee North Korea. Last week, Japanese human rights groups and editorial writers protested after China disclosed that it had arrested a Japanese human rights advocate and two North Korean refugees a month ago. The activist, Takayuki Noguchi, worked with Life Funds for North Korean Refugees, the largest group here that aims to help North Koreans who escape their country.

HEADLINE: State Of the Speech 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Iowa, despite record hype, won't be dispositive; the major campaign event this week is the president's State of the Union address. A dozen points to watch:
 1. Salutation: For two centuries, "My Countrymen" was traditional; now it's sexist. "Fellow Americans" works best. 
 2. Defining adjective: The State of the Union is -- what? "Strong" is popular; J.F.K. used "good"; Jerry Ford, in his first S.O.U., dared to judge it "not good." If Bush chooses an unfamiliar adjective, that word will reverberate.
3. Interruptions by applause: Congress in joint session will clap on cue any time a president looks around. But watch how Democratic leaders Tom Daschle and Nancy Pelosi (who have already issued "prebuttals") grimly sit on their hands. Observe calibrated reactions by candidates Kerry, Lieberman, Edwards and Gephardt, if they can spare the time to be there.
4. Overarching theme: "War on Terror" has been overdone, though "Age of Liberty" has not yet sunk in. "Opportunity society" too domestic-only. Because an S.O.U. must touch so many different bases, we'll be lucky if three thematic puddings can be interrelated.
5. Pointing with pride: He should first assure us we are in a new economic boom, and then take credit for it by showing how his tax cuts turned around the post-bubble recession he inherited from a "previous administration" whose name never passes his lips. Look for him to torpedo the current Democratic mantra by pointing to a quarter-million new jobs created since August, with deficits now beginning to head downward. An effective end to the prosperity comeback section would be: Hey, middle class, don't let them take away your tax cuts. 
6. Buttering the ethnic hot potato previewed last week: He'll welcome the 10 million "illegals" now living here in the shadows. Though denying it's an amnesty, a word that scrapes the conservative chalkboard, he should dramatically repeat and refine his offer to hard-working, undocumented Hispanics with a way to earn citizenship. See if he puts heat on Congress to do its duty, as cameras pan the California and Florida delegations.
7. Follow up the Kennedyesque idealism also heralded in the unprecedented publicity run-up to this address: Hopscotch from the Moon to Mars. Let aging Democrats bemoan expense to presidency after next; this is Bush's challenging appeal to youth who yearn for uplifting liftoff. 
8. Theft of more opposition clothes: Geezerdrugs paid by Medicare is not enough. Expectations are that he will propose making health expenses tax-deductible for all but the wealthy, with an eye toward one day giving taxpayers a tax credit -- in effect, reimbursement -- for all medical payments. He could surprise by doubling the budget for scientific research over the next four years, especially in preventive medicine, which is not a huge expense but would save a bundle long-term. 
9. Creative compassion: This may be the time to put people more in charge of their futures, with expanded tax-deferred savings accounts for education and housing, and self-directed portions of Social Security accounts. He may finesse the anti-gay-marriage amendment idea by concentrating on incentives to poor straights to stay married.
10. A last-minute news lead: Something positive may come out of Paul Bremer's meetings this week with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Governing Council members, showing that Bush has found a "vital role" the U.N. should play in nation-building. Results count; he can say he had this sort of multinational diplomacy in mind all along.
11. The moral rightness and historic reach of combining homeland defense with pre-emptive offense: Bush's decision to carry the war to the enemy is the centerpiece of his presidency; he is obliged tomorrow to reassert his purpose eloquently and his intent to "stay the course" no matter how stridently denounced. At the same time, the commander in chief must not flinch from recognizing the human cost to Americans; a moment of silence for coalition and Iraqi casualties would be in order.
12. Energizing the faith-base: President Lincoln had to be reminded at the last minute to slip a reference to Divine Providence into his Emancipation Proclamation. Will Bush, in tomorrow night's secular and political setting, somehow invoke God's blessing? Count on it.

Suicide Bomb in Iraq Kills 20 and Wounds 60
A suicide truck bomb exploded at the main gate of the American occupation headquarters in Baghdad, killing at least 20 people and wounding at least 60 others. The attack came one day before a critical meeting at the United Nations on the future of Iraq. At least 18 of the dead were Iraqi civilians. A1

Kurdish demands for political rights and reparations have emerged as one of the most pressing issues confronting American officials, who are trying to create an Iraqi transitional government. A9

Israel May Alter Barrier Route
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon indicated that Israel might alter the route of its separation barrier in the West Bank,and he acknowledged that the barrier had caused difficulties for ordinary Palestinians. A8

Ex-Taliban Fighters to Be Freed
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, left, ordered that all Afghans detained at the Sheberghan prison and not considered dangerous should be set free, a symbolic move that could bolster his standing and undermine Taliban holdouts. Local officials said the jail held more than 400 Afghans said to be members of the Taliban. A6

Pakistani Nuclear Investigation
Authorities in Pakistan are now questioning eight officials from its nuclear weapons program regarding accusations that nuclear weapons technology was shared with Iran. A3

Muslim Appointee Is a Target
Aissa Dermouche's car was destroyed by a bomb near his home only four days after France appointed him as its only foreign-born and Muslim prefect. No one took responsibility for the explosion, which caused no injuries. A3

Bomb Scare Forces Down Plane
A Delta Air Lines plane was forced to make an emergency landing at Shannon Airport, on the west coast of Ireland, after a note was found in the bathroom saying there was a bomb on board. The Irish police searched the plane and passengers' baggage, but nothing suspicious was found. A4

Defining Prostitution in Spain
The decision by a regional court in Spain to force the owner of a so-called alternative club to make social security payments for women who worked there as prostitutes is part of a nationwide struggle to define the status of prostitution, which is neither prohibited nor regulated under Spanish law. A6

Warming North Korea Relations
North Korea, facing a choice of Japanese sanctions or Japanese aid, is quietly taking steps to unblock its longstanding political logjam with the government in Tokyo. After 15 months of unremitting hostility, North Korea sent a series of signals that suggest a desire for warmer relations with Japan. A2

Democrats Give Their All On Last Push in Iowa
Democratic presidential candidates closed their caucus campaigns with broad denunciations of President Bush and snipes at one another afterflooding Iowa homes with last-minute mailings and phone calls. A1

The Iowa caucus does not produce a single convention delegate, but only begins the county and state selection process. Still, the contest looms all the larger this year because the primary schedule is now so compressed. A1

HEADLINE: Job Losses Slow in Silicon Valley, Report Says 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley is apparently still losing jobs, but more slowly than in recent years, according to the latest annual report from Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a nonprofit organization. And if and when job growth returns, the biomedical industry may play a bigger role than in the past, the report indicates. 
 According to the most recent federal data available, Silicon Valley lost jobs from the second quarter of 2002 through the second quarter of 2003 at only half the rate -- 5 percent -- of the year-earlier period. 
 Since mid-2003, anecdotal evidence suggests that the rate of loss has continued to slow, giving Silicon Valley's economic leaders reason to hope that the rebound in spending for technology that is becoming evident may soon translate to renewed job growth. 
 "The trend has continued; we see a continued slowing of job loss," said Doug Henton, the president of Collaborative Economics, a research company in Mountain View, Calif., that conducted the study. 
 Notably, Silicon Valley biomedical companies, which include many of the nation's biotechnology leaders, lost the fewest jobs. And the survey showed that for the first time, venture capital investment in biotechnology in Silicon Valley equaled investment in software companies.
"We are now seeing the early signs of yet another Silicon Valley reinvention," according to the report, which is called "The 2004 Index of Silicon Valley" and is to be released Monday. 
 Mr. Henton said the challenge for Silicon Valley was to provide the training and education necessary to ensure that workers were prepared for the new jobs.
 Through last year's second quarter, Silicon Valley had lost approximately 202,000 jobs from the peak of employment in the second quarter 2001, when the region's work force was 1.38 million.
 For the third year in a row, average pay declined in Silicon Valley, but by a smaller margin than the previous year. In the 2003 period, average pay in the area declined 1.5 percent, to $62,400. That is in contrast to a 6 percent decline the year before, after accounting for inflation. The area's average pay peak was $81,700 in 2000.
 Even with the declines, average pay in Silicon Valley is 60 percent higher than the average for the rest of country, which is $37,300. The valley's cost of living, though, is 47 percent higher than the national average.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Adds to Hiring Goal 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
I.B.M. will hire 15,000 employees this year -- 5,000 more than originally planned -- because of an improving economy, a human-resources executive said over the weekend.
 The company, which has faced criticism for its plans to shift some United States jobs to cheaper locations overseas like India and China, is planning to add about 30 percent of the new hires, or 4,500 jobs, in the United States, said Randy MacDonald, I.B.M.'s senior vice president for human resources. 
 "We are going to hire more in the U.S. than we shift" overseas, Mr. MacDonald said in an interview.
 The jobs will increase I.B.M.'s work force by nearly 5 percent. 
 I.B.M. said on Thursday that customers started buying more technology in the fourth quarter.
 Last fall, the company's chief executive, Samuel J. Palmisano, said I.B.M. would hire 10,000 employees in 2004. The decision to add another 5,000 jobs was made in the last few weeks, Mr. MacDonald said.

By correcting inaccuracies, a professor tries to deliver a fuller picture of the lives of African-American inventors.

BYLINE:  By Teresa Riordan

 BODY:
IN 1993, when Rayvon Fouche was a graduate student in history at Cornell University, he happened upon an article in The Amsterdam News, a black weekly in New York City, about African-American inventors.
 "I saw something that didn't quite seem right to me," Professor Fouche, now an assistant professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., recalled in a telephone interview last week. "I started doing a little research and found out that there were actually several mistakes in the article." The mistakes ranged from inaccurate patent numbers to faulty interpretations of the larger cultural meaning of the inventions. 
 For example, Professor Fouche said, Garrett A. Morgan, a black, is often credited with inventing the traffic light. "It does appear that he did receive the first patent for this type of traffic regulating device, but it was not the only device to regulate traffic," Professor Fouche said. 
 A patent document viewed only by itself can be misleading, Professor Fouche said, and does "not convey any meaning about the significance of the patent or the person." 
 So began his quest to document the experience of black inventors and correct what he said is often an inaccurate record. In October, Johns Hopkins University Press published his book, "Black Inventors in the Age of Segregation," which is possibly the first full-fledged scholarly examination of black inventors in America.
 In his book, Professor Fouche, 34, examines three African-American inventors: Shelby J. Davidson (1868-1930), Lewis H. Latimer (1848-1928) and Granville T. Woods (1856-1910). 
 These inventors "are brought out every year during Black History Month as representatives of black greatness and then reduced to their names, a patent number and some kind of artifact," Professor Fouche said.
 Though they were all important figures, Professor Fouche said that his goal was not to solidify their status as icons but, rather, to present them as three-dimensional human beings.
 "We must rescue the complexity -- the greatness and imperfection -- of black inventors to understand more fully their relevance in America today," he writes in his introduction.
 Tracking down what slim documentary evidence does exist about black inventors required much creative sleuthing on Professor Fouche's part. And he discovered that the experience of each of the three inventors was vastly different. 
 Shelby Davidson, whose papers are at Howard University, was perhaps the easiest of the three to document. A Treasury Department employee and a black leader in Washington, Mr. Davidson invented improvements to the adding machine but also designed office tables and lamps to create efficient work space. "He really was an early practitioner of scientific management," Professor Fouche said.
 Lewis Latimer -- whose father, George, was a fugitive slave championed by Frederick Douglass -- struggled before he found financial security as a corporate engineer with Thomas Edison.
 Mr. Latimer patented or co-patented a train-car lavatory and several improvements to electric lamp design but his main historic importance was as an adviser to Mr. Edison.
"He knew all the players, all the competitors in the incandescent bulb business," Professor Fouche said. "He was an important internal consultant for Edison." Professor Fouche learned much about Mr. Latimer from reading depositions he gave during Mr. Edison's patent battles as well as from papers that Mr. Latimer's granddaughter donated to the Queens Borough Public Library.
 Mr. Latimer prospered. He and his wife and children, for example, were one of the first black families to move into Flushing. But, he did so, Professor Fouche argues, by diminishing the role of race in his life.
 "Several times he was asked to speak out on racial issues and each time he said no," Professor Fouche said. "He was a conservative black man. It would have been hard for him to maintain his economic status and also be outspoken."
 Unlike Mr. Davidson and Mr. Latimer, Granville Woods was an independent inventor. "His was the most tragic story," Professor Fouche said.
 In researching Mr. Woods at the National Archives, Professor Fouche hit primary document pay dirt: a 2,000-page trove of depositions and documents detailing legal wrangling over invention claims. In one deposition, Mr. Woods -- who patented a steam boiler furnace and an electric incubator for chicken eggs -- referred to a trunk stored in Monsey, N.Y., that was filled with correspondence covering 25 years. 
 Armed with the name of the storage company, the address, and the storage lot number, Professor Fouche drove to Monsey. But he could not find it or anyone who recalled Mr. Woods. "It's pretty clear that he couldn't pay the rental fee," Professor Fouche said. "They probably dumped out his papers and sold the trunk."
 Though he died before he could reap financial gain from his inventions, Mr. Woods should be regarded as a successful inventor, Professor Fouche contends.
 "When we look at black inventors, most did not have the same opportunity white ones did," he said. "We have to create a new metric of what success is. We can still consider them as African-American heroes or champions. But it's most important that we develop a deeper, more nuanced understanding of what their lives were like and what their relationships were to the larger world."

Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

Your Web surfing is being interrupted to bring you a paid video commercial. Advertisers think you will stick around.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
TELEVISION commercials, in all their big, loud glory, are coming to the Web.
 Beginning tomorrow, more than a dozen Web sites, including MSN, ESPN, Lycos and iVillage, will run full-motion video commercials from Pepsi, AT&T, Honda, Vonage and Warner Brothers, in a six-week test that some analysts and online executives say could herald the start of a new era of Internet advertising. 
 "It's TV, without the television," said John Vail, director for digital media and marketing for Pepsi-Cola North America, a unit of PepsiCo.
 Video advertisements from major marketers have dotted the online landscape sporadically in recent years, but the new ads differ from their precursors in one critical respect: until now, none have run at 30 frames a second, the speed of TV video. As a result, most multimedia ads are less sharp than TV images, even for people with fast connections. 
 The new ad technology, from Unicast, an advertising company based in New York, invisibly loads the commercial while unwitting users read a Web page, then displays the ad across the entire browser area when users click to a new page. The resulting ad is identical to TV, whether the user has a high- or low-speed connection. The company says the technology evades pop-up blockers, but the person can skip the ad by clicking a box.
 Unlike TV viewers, Internet users will not be deluged with these ads, at least in the short term. According to Unicast, 100 million ads will be served to individual PC's beginning tomorrow through the end of February. That may sound like a lot, but publishers, who can track a user's repeat trips to a Web site, say they will generally limit a person's exposure to the ads to one a day.
 Unicast says it hopes 50 million to 75 million ads will be viewed. Pepsi plans to distribute two ads, which have run on TV in the last few months. In one, titled "Just Lunch," a dog steals its owner's sandwich and Pepsi, and replaces them with a cat. In the other, "Vacuum," a vacuum cleaner hunts a Pepsi drinker and eats his pants. At the end of each, users will be shown links to more ads, on the Pepsi Web site. (Those ads use so-called streaming video technology of an older vintage, and are less than TV quality.)
 Mr. Vail, of Pepsi, said he would monitor online viewers' reactions through a tracking study conducted by the research firm Dynamic Logic, to determine how much use Pepsi will make of such ads in the future. "Yes, it's intrusive," he said. "But I think customers will like it, because it will be so far superior to anything they've seen online."
 James Nail, an analyst with the technology consulting firm Forrester Research, agreed. "This is the best full-motion, full-video TV ad technology that I've seen," he said. "I expect big demand from advertisers for this."
 Among other features, Mr. Nail says he appreciates the fact that the ads do not slow Web surfing. The commercials load into a computer's temporary memory, and only when a page is idle. If a user clicks to a new page within the site before the ad is fully loaded, the process is merely paused until the browser is again idle. The ads run on Windows Media Player software, which an estimated 8 of 10 Internet users have on their computers.
 Mr. Nail predicts that Internet users will react well to the ads, both because they can click away if they choose and because the advertisers involved have brands that "people have positive reactions to," he said, adding, "So I think they'll get a little more leeway, at least initially."
 If users are annoyed at this development, they can blame high-speed connections. Richard V. Hopple, Unicast's chief executive, said he decided to release the company's "video commercial" technology now because high-speed connections -- known as broadband -- have reached significant numbers. The number of United States households with broadband connections reached 49.5 million late last year, or 38 percent of all households, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, an Internet research firm. Of the 50 million people who surf the Web at work, 94 percent have broadband connections, according to comScore Networks, another Internet research firm.
With so many people surfing with broadband connections already, and with many more expected to switch to high-speed connections this year, publishers may be tempted to run video ads with much greater frequency, Mr. Nail, of Forrester, said. "The question is, do they understand the need to exercise some restraint, or will they just see this is as the way to make money, and just grab all the cash they can?"
 Indeed, the new commercials are expected to earn publishers considerably more money than most existing ads. Publishers like Disney's ESPN.com expect to charge as much as $35 for every thousand ads displayed. That is about twice what TV networks charge advertisers for some prime-time programs, and well more than the average of $10 per 1,000 viewers charged by some of the Web's most successful publishers, like MSN.
 ESPN has helped establish a beachhead for TV-quality video ads online, with its Motion service, which made its debut early last year for broadband users. With that, users must download software that allows them to play highlights and other short programs from ESPN's video library. Between programs, users are shown 15- or 30-second ads that, like Unicast's commercials, reach TV's 30-frames-per-second speed. The screen display for Motion is less than half the size of the Unicast display, though, and ads cannot be turned off.
 Riley McDonough, ESPN.com's vice president for sales, said Motion had attracted 2.5 million users -- more than 700,000 of whom view video and ad clips daily. Advertisers include Lexus, McDonald's and I.B.M., which have together created "greater demand than we've been able to satisfy," he said.
 Both with Motion and the Unicast commercials, "advertisers can reach people during the day, when they typically don't watch television, and continue delivering that brand message in the same creative format," Mr. McDonough said, adding, "It's a wonderful way to surround the consumer."
 Joanne Bradford, a vice president and the chief media revenue officer for Microsoft's MSN, said her site would not show users more than one video commercial in a 24-hour period. Furthermore, she said if users complained about any advertisement, MSN would pull it. "But we've not had to do that yet," she said, referring to earlier video ads using streaming technology. "If it's done well, advertising is entertainment."
 Not all online publishing executives agree, of course. Scot McLernon, executive vice president for sales and marketing at the financial news site CBS Marketwatch, said he considered joining the Unicast rollout, but declined, for fear of alienating users. "Thirty seconds strikes me as three times too long," he said. "And there's a lot of Web use in open air workplace environments, so we're looking for a more subtle sound experience."
 Elise Brahmer, a media supervisor for RPA, an ad agency in Santa Monica, Calif., that manages Honda's online campaigns, among others, said she thought audible ads "will slowly become more acceptable over time." In the interim, Ms. Brahmer said, she will still buy "massive amounts" of the Unicast ads. "Our expectations for this are huge," she said.
 Such words are welcome news for publishers, who have waited impatiently since the birth of the Web for large so-called brand marketers to bring more of their ad dollars online. Although Ms. Brahmer predicted that the new video ads alone would not "make Honda dump money into online, it will definitely be a giant step in helping us prove online's effectiveness."
 "When we run a spot on TV, we don't really know how many people saw it, or were affected by it, or wanted to know more information," Ms. Brahmer added. "By putting the spots online, you can find out a ton of information," by tracking what the user clicked on after the ad. Such information, she said, makes an online video commercial "potentially more valuable than one on TV."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 22, 2004

 CORRECTION:
The E-Commerce Report column in Business Day on Monday about plans by Web sites to run video commercials referred incorrectly to a recent report by Nielsen/NetRatings on the percentage of Internet users with high-speed connections in the United States. They make up 38 percent of the people who use the Internet at home -- not 38 percent of all households in the country.

Woes at Two Pillars of GermanJournalism

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
The parking lot next to the headquarters of Frankfurt's largest newspaper could be mistaken for that of a Silicon Valley software firm in the late1990's. Mercedes-Benzes, BMW's, and the odd Volkswagen sit in rows, although, unlike their California counterparts, they all bear license plates with the letters "F-AZ."
 That is an abbreviation for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, perhaps Germany's most august paper, and certainly one of its most generous employers. Until this year, a job at the paper came with a company car: entry-level reporters got a VW Golf, senior editors a top-of-the-line BMW. 
 Now, though, the cars are limited to senior editors, and they must pay a monthly fee for them. Like most German newspapers, including its Munich rival, Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung suffered mightily in the recent recession. Its lush perks, and nearly a quarter of its staff, have vanished with its ad revenue. 
 While Germany's economy rumbles back to life, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and the country's other newspapers have enjoyed little of the recovery. With ad revenue down nearly 40 percent since its peak in 2000, and once-lucrative help-wanted ads off by 75 percent, the leading publishers are being forced to confront fundamental questions about the viability of their business.
 Nowhere has the pain been more acute than at Germany's two most celebrated dailies, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and the Suddeutsche Zeitung. Both expanded pell-mell during the Internet boom. At the Suddeutsche, the reversal in ad sales was so severe that it brought the paper to the brink of bankruptcy in October 2002.
 With national distribution, far-flung foreign bureaus, and well-honed political positions -- the Allgemeine tilts right, the Suddeutsche left -- these papers are the twin pillars of Germany's fourth estate.
 "It would be the equivalent of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times being in critical financial trouble at the same time," said Adam Bird, leader of the media practice at Booz Allen Hamilton in Munich.
 More than respected editorial voices, the two papers are quintessentially German institutions, with complex ownership structures, consensus-driven management, and business philosophies -- particularly at the Allgemeine Zeitung -- that emphasize long-term values over short-term profits.
 They exemplify what economists sometimes describe as Rhenish capitalism, a German style of business that is more socially conscious and less Darwinian than the Anglo-Saxon version. In Germany's brutal media marketplace, such a model may no longer be sustainable.
 "These papers were isolated from normal market forces," said Josef Joffe, editor of the weekly paper Die Zeit and a former foreign editor at Suddeutsche Zeitung. "They went on a spending spree while the guillotine was coming down. They need to cut back to where they were before."
 In the last three years, Hans Werner Kilz, editor in chief of Suddeutsche Zeitung, has presided over a reduction in his staff to 307, from 425, the closing of a regional edition in Dusseldorf, and the scrapping of a section devoted to news from Berlin. He has preserved the paper's 22 overseas news bureaus, but has slashed travel budgets.
 Ask Mr. Kilz whether his paper can preserve its editorial quality, and he shrugs. "I'm an optimist by nature, but ..." he said, the words trailing off.
 The Suddeutsche survived a scrape with insolvency in late 2002 through a 150 million euro investment by a new shareholder. The investor, a regional newspaper chain called Sudwestdeutsche Medien, joined the five Bavarian families that started the paper in October 1945.
 Although the new investor has only an 18.75 percent stakein the parent company, Suddeutscher Verlag, several insiders said it was determined to extract a higher return on investment, even if that meant deep cuts.
 Suddeutsche Verlag, which also publishes professional books, lost 76.6 million euros in 2002. The company estimates that it broke even last year, though the final figures, which will not be published until summer, may show a small loss.
 Hanswilli Jenke, one of two relatively new managing directors, said the paper was still in the midst of a two-year turnaround.
 "The boulder was rolling down the mountain," said Mr. Jenke, a former television executive. "We stopped it in the middle of the slope, and now we have to push it back up the mountain."
 Advertising is showing the first glimmerings of a recovery, he said. As in the United States, the rebound in Germany's media business has been led by broadcasting, with magazines and newspapers behind.
 To grab its share, Mr. Jenke said, the company had strengthened its advertising sales staff. He hopes eventually to sell ancillary products, like books, CD's, and digital video discs, to Suddeutsche's 310,000 subscribers. Adding single-copy sales, the paper's total circulation is 437,000 copies.
Mr. Jenke said Suddeutsche had also streamlined its management, once known for its slow pace because all major decisions were subject to the approval of the five founding families. It now has a three-member operating committee that represents the owners. 
 Mr. Jenke denied that the company, or its new co-owner, would sacrifice quality in a rush for profits. "The challenge is to maintain the quality," he said. "Editorial quality is the basis of our economic model."
 The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which is majority-owned by a nonprofit foundation, does not face quite the same pressures. But its parent, F.A.Z. group, suffered a loss of 60.6 million euros in 2002 and is expected to report another loss for 2003 (the paper's circulation is 388,000).
 At the peak of the Internet boom in 1999 and early 2000, when companies bought half-page ads to recruit executives, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung turned away advertising. On Saturdays, when it carries help-wanted ads, it had 234 pages at its peak. On a recent Saturday, it ran 44 pages.
 "My question was: did our whole business model work anymore?" said Frank Schirrmacher, one of the five publishers, who oversees the culture and ideas section.
 Like the Suddeutsche, the Frankfurter Allgemeine had expanded aggressively, with customized sections for Berlin and Munich, and a six-day-a-week English-language edition distributed as an insert in The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.
 The customized sections were scrapped. The English edition shrank to a tabloid published once a week. The paper curtailed its benefits -- not just the company cars, but also its generous pensions.
 The ownership structure of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung insulates its publishers -- who function more like American top editors -- from pressure. Because of the structure of the business, it is difficult for the managers of the parent company to dismiss these five men. Still, Mr. Schirrmacher said he and his colleagues recognized that unless they stabilized the paper's finances, they risked losing their independence.
 Despite his questions about the paper's viability, Mr. Schirrmacher said he believed there was a place for a high-quality, nationally distributed paper in Germany. The preliminary results for 2003 do not look as grim as in earlier years. And the paper, whichhad been losing readers since 2001, picked up a few in the most recent industry survey, while the Suddeutsche lost some.
 In Munich, Hans Werner Kilz is also trying to look on the bright side. He noted that the Suddeutsche had widened its circulation lead over the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in recent years. 
 Both papers, and most of their competitors, are fighting a long downward trend in readers, as the population in Germany ages and newspapers fail to replace older readers with young ones. 
 A courtly 60-year-old, Mr. Kilz knows about the vagaries of journalism. He edited Germany's top news magazine, Der Spiegel, for eight years, leaving after a clash with its publisher, Rudolf Augstein. 
 Now, as he faces a new owner and an uncertain future, Mr. Kilz can only hope his paper's values will prevail.
 "We publish this paper with a piece of our hearts," he said, as the last rays of the afternoon sun flickered outside his window. "The people here love this paper. One must not do anything to take away this love."

 HIGHLIGHTS

MARIAH CAREY: MENACE TO MALAYSIA? -- Mariah Carey's impending performance in Malaysia has upset some of that country's Muslims. "Everyone knows Mariah Carey presents herself in a sexy, unacceptable and almost vulgar manner," Ahmad Sabki Yusof, the leader of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party's youth wing, wrote to the government, the BBC reported. Muslims account for 60 percent of Malaysia's 24.5 million population. Ms. Carey, below, has received permission to perform on Feb. 22 in a 50,000-seat stadium in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, but has been warned that her costumes should not be offensive. Mr. Ahmad Sabki, who called upon the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Tourism to rescind its authorization, argued that Ms. Carey was "not an appropriate role model for young Malaysians." He said, "Allowing such concerts promotes and condones values that are totally contrary to our way of life and our culture." Although Western entertainment is popular in Malaysia, officials have been concerned about its influence. Linkin Park was allowed onstage only after agreeing not to go bare-chested or to scream too loudly.

BRITISH AWARD CONTENDERS -- "Cold Mountain," its stars and director appeared poised to dominate the nominees for the British Academy's film awards to be announced today in London, Reuters reports. On the longlist of candidates for the awards, the British equivalent of the Oscars, "Cold Mountain" was a contender for best picture, best director (Anthony Minghella), best actor (Jude Law), best actress (Nicole Kidman), best supporting actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and best supporting actress (Renee Zellweger). Scarlett Johansson's name appeared twice on the longlist for best actress, for her performances in "Lost in Translation" and "Girl With a Pearl Earring." Among 15 contenders for best picture are "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," "Kill Bill," "Mystic River" and "The Station Agent," as well as the British films "Calendar Girls" and "Love Actually." Tom Cruise was nominated for best actor for "The Last Samurai," but that film did not make the longlist of candidates for best picture.

RUSSIAN FILM-PRIZE DISPUTE -- The omission of one of last year's most popular films from the nominees for the Golden Eagles, Russia's version of the Oscars, has prompted young critics to attack the old guard of the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The dispute focuses on Pyotr Buslov's hit "Bumer," a teenage crime adventure, the BBC reported. Besides their anger over the omission of "Bumer," the critics asked why the academy had included television films in the feature category. The second annual Golden Eagle awards ceremony is scheduled for Jan. 31 in Moscow.

PARIS: FRANCE AND FILM -- What has happened to France's love affair with movies? Box office sales of 174.2 million tickets last year represented a decline of roughly 5.6 percent from the total for 2002, according to national film board figures reported by Agence France-Presse. In addition French television viewers are watching fewer movies on the small screen. Only one film made the list of the 20 most popular shows of 2003, the weekly Film Francais reported on Friday. Last year four made the list. The national film board attributed the box office decline to the poor economy and international events rather than to competition from DVD's.

KING TRIBUTE IN BROOKLYN -- Wynton Marsalis (below), the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, is to deliver the keynote address today at the 18th annual "Brooklyn Tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- Come Share the Dream" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Participating in the event, beginning at 10:30 a.m. at the Howard Gilman Opera House, will be the Boys Choir of Harlem, the a cappella group the Persuasions and the Lafayette Inspirational Ensemble. After the tribute, whose hosts are the academy, the Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz and Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York, the BAM Rose Cinemas, in association with the National Black Programming Consortium, will present screenings of the new documentary "Citizen King." The tribute and the screenings are free with seating on a first-come, first-seated basis.

FOOTNOTES

If the Paul Taylor Dance Company ever needs a home away from home, it will be welcome in Britain, where it has been named best foreign dance company of 2003 in the National Dance Awards given by a critics circle of more than 50 writers who represent mainly national newspapers as well as arts publications. In addition the critically acclaimed "Promethean Fire" has earned the company a nomination for a 2004 Laurence Olivier Award. The awards are to be announced on Feb. 22. The company returns to City Center in Manhattan from March 2 through 14. . . . For the eighth time Billy Crystal will be the host of the Academy Awards broadcast because he felt the itch when he sat out the show in 2003, The Associated Press reported. "Last year I felt the itch to do it," he said. "The war had hit. I wanted to be in the limelight. I wanted to feel that extra pressure." This year's show will be on Feb. 29 on ABC. . . . Gerard Schwarz, music director of the Seattle Symphony, has been nominated by President Bush for the National Council on the Arts. Mr. Schwarz is a founder and former music director of the New York Chamber Symphony and was the music director of the Mostly Mozart Festival from 1982 to 2001. The nomination is subject to Senate confirmation.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: NEW HAMPSHIRE; 
Who's That at the Next Table? Ho-Hum, It's a Candidate

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H. 

 BODY:
At 8:30 a.m. on a recent Thursday, Leo Valliot was in his usual wooden booth at Roland's diner here looking forward to his usual breakfast of eggs and bacon, which, as usual, he intended to eat in quiet and peace. But instead of his coffee, he ended up drinking a "Cup of Joe," caught up in Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's political tempest.
 At 8:45, the Lieberman entourage swept through the glass front door, unannounced, taking captive three dozen bewildered diners, most of them middle-aged. As aides worked their cellphones and cameras flashed, the candidate moved deftly from booth to booth, tousling kids' hair and soliciting questions. 
 "You get resigned to this happening in primary season," said Mr. Valliot, hunkering down over his eggs with great concentration and mumbling that he planned to vote for George W. Bush or John Kerry.
At the neighboring booth, Dennis Bastille, recently unemployed, said he was glad for the unexpected opportunity to ask Mr. Lieberman about jobs and health coverage. "He made a good impression, but it was just a couple of minutes, and to make a judgment you need hours."
Voters here are sometimes unwitting actors in a political sideshow whose raucous magnitude often seems to dwarf this tiny, quiet state, as the Democratic candidates come a-courting for the Jan. 27 primary.
Maeve Sheehan, 23, a volunteer for Senator John Edwards, said he was on the sidewalk holding an Edwards for President sign "when Joe Lieberman pulled up in his town car, jumped out and shook my hand." 
"Now, that wouldn't happen in New Jersey," he said.
Residents agree that the campaigning this year is particularly intense, but are divided about whether the lavish attention constitutes an opportunity or a nuisance.
Nearly every morning, some diner in the state holds a Cup of Joe session, introducing Senator Lieberman as the breakfast special of the day. Lunch often includes a Conversation With Clark, a Town Hall Meeting with John Edwards or a Meet the Candidate session with Howard Dean. And dinner time provides a wide selection of house parties for the various candidates -- and probably a chili supper somewhere with John Kerry.
Campaign signs are scattered along snow-lined roads like red, white and blue bread crumbs, marking the candidates' frantic paths from Manchester to Portsmouth to Concord. At one of two house parties he attended on a recent Wednesday night, Senator Lieberman joked, "I used to travel all over the world; now I travel all over New Hampshire."
Geneva Bliss, a retiree with a long woolen coat and a cane, said she now received several phone calls a day from the campaigns. "You do hate to be called so much, but it's part of our culture in New Hampshire to do this job and to give everyone a chance," she said. After screening the candidates, Mrs. Bliss and her husband, John, traveled to Peterborough to meet Gen. Wesley K. Clark. She is now a supporter, noting that he seemed charming in person and also "much more well rounded" than the last general she considered: Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Perhaps because this is such a quiet place most of the time, many residents regard the onslaught as an almost exciting quadrennial sport, something like the Olympics.
"For me, this is very personal and passionate: I mean where else in America do you get presidential candidates hanging out in your neighbor's living room?" said Lisa Haswell, who says she will probably vote for Dr. Dean. Even so, she continues to attend parties for other candidates, because she is not certain. 
"You get to ask one on one about issues you care about," Ms. Haswell said. "You see body language, inflection, and get a sense of what they're like as a person. And through your vote you transmit that to the American people."
At a stately Tudor house in Nashua last week, a last-minute reception for Dennis J. Kucinich was crowded with young Democrats performing due diligence on him -- firing questions on topics like drugs and Native American rights -- though few of the guests expressed interest in voting for him. Even the party's host, Steve Thurber, a teacher, admitted that he was not a Kucinich supporter.
"I didn't seek out Dennis; this is a favor to a friend," Mr. Thurber said. "But it is important that he has the opportunity, and I'm extremely pleased that he's here."
Colleen and Matt Meyers, wearing Clark buttons and carrying a yard sign, said they recently pulled their two children out of high school for the day so that they could hear General Clark. The previous week they had skipped school to hear Dr. Dean and Mr. Kucinich. Ms. Meyers, a retired foreign service officer-turned saddle fitter, says she is leaning toward General Clark, while her husband is inclined to vote for Dr. Dean.
As they discussed their commitments on the sidewalk in front of a clapboard realty office, Walt Sterling, 66, weighed in with his view, though nobody asked. "I thought there was an arrogance about Dean, and that made Clark much more appealing."
He added: "We observe things from up here in the hills and then once every four years we come down to say what we think. We stand taller on election day; this is very important to us."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: NORTHERN IRAQ; 
Back From Exile, Kurds Demand Political Power and Reparations for Seized Property

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: KIRKUK, Iraq 

 BODY:
For 130 Kurdish families just returned from exile, purgatory is a muddy field of green canvas tents propped up on this city's edge, the floors damp with rainwater, the interiors warmed by small kerosene heaters.
 It is not the homecoming they expected. Driven from Kirkuk more than a decade ago by Saddam Hussein's government, they eke out their days waiting for what they say is their due. 
 "We lost years of our lives, so we need compensation," Lukman Abdul-Rahman, 39, said as he stood surrounded by a dozen men, all nodding vigorously. "The Kurds have suffered much more than others, and we should be the government's top priority." 
Kurdish demands for political rights and reparations have suddenly emerged as one of the most pressing issues confronting American officials, who are trying to create an Iraqi transitional government. Kirkuk, an oil-rich city just outside the northern Kurdish region, is the linchpin of the Kurds' drive to retain their autonomy. 
In Kirkuk, the campaign by Kurdish leaders for broad governing powers and claims by families for property restoration are feeding ethnic tensions that could explode. That prospect seems even more likely if Kirkuk's political future is put to a vote in the area, an idea that Kurdish leaders and some members of the Iraqi Governing Council are now supporting. 
Recent protests by Arab and Turkmen residents against such Kurdish claims have already ended in gunfire and death. American soldiers have stepped up street patrols, and their searches of the headquarters of various political parties have uncovered illegal weapons. A bomb exploded near the headquarters of one of the two main Kurdish parties on Jan. 11.
Thousands of Kurdish and a few Turkmen families have flooded the city to demand land stripped from them under Mr. Hussein. Many live in squalor, some in tent villages, others in ramshackle public buildings. Arabs paid to move here under the former government's campaign to make the region Arab fear that Kurds will exact vengeance, and many have fled. 
For the two main Kurdish parties, this change in demographics bolsters their claim that the Kurdish autonomous region should envelop Kirkuk.
Kurdish leaders believe they need the oil fields and rich agricultural land nearby to keep the Kurdish region economically independent. But no political group is willing to cede control of Kirkuk to the Kurds.
The Americans are trying to control the situation, said Joost R. Hiltermann, a Middle East expert with the International Crisis Group, a conflict prevention organization, but "it could really get out of hand." 
Mr. Hiltermann said: "The Kurds have to make a basic decision -- to go with the Americans or not. If they go with the Americans, they'll get support, but not everything they want, namely Kirkuk." 
L. Paul Bremer III, the top American administrator in Iraq, has met twice recently with Kurdish leaders to ask them to back down from their demands, including from their claims to Kirkuk, only to be rebuffed. 
Fatal clashes have flared up, with Arabs, Kurds and Turkmens each claiming the city as their own. 
"The ambition of the Kurds is not a new ambition," said Esmail al-Hadidi, a deputy mayor of Kirkuk and a member of one of the city's oldest Arab families. "But we need Kirkuk for everyone. The Arabs here are not willing to let Kirkuk go to the Turkmen and the Kurds." 
At a nearby youth and sports center for Turkmens, a banner proclaims that "Kirkuk is a Turkmen city and will stay a Turkmen city forever." Powder-blue flags with a crescent moon and stars, similar to the Turkish flag, are displayed inside. Muhammad Arga Oglo, 30, the director of the Turkmen Student and Youth Union, greeted a visitor while sitting beneath a poster of Ottoman horsemen slaughtering their enemies in a river of blood. 
"We have the right to express ourselves by any means," he said. "If it's necessary to defend ourselves, we will."
Thousands of Arabs and Turkmens held a rally at the end of December against the Kurdish demand for autonomy, and it ended in gunfire between protesters and Kurdish guerrilla fighters. Four protesters were killed and 24 wounded; other killings have followed.
Officers with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, which controls the city, have asked leaders of the main ethnic groups to stop the violence. But during a sweep of the offices of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, American soldiers found a cache of weapons that included 17 Kalashnikov rifles and three rocket-propelled grenade launchers, said Maj. Douglas Vincent, a spokesman for the American-led forces. Major Vincent said soldiers also found Kalashnikovs at the headquarters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the other main Kurdish party, and at the Iraqi Turkmen Front. 
Najat Hassan, the local head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, denied that American soldiers had found illegal weapons. He also defended what he called the right of Kurds to govern the city. "Kirkuk is a historical and geographical part of the Kurdish region," he said.
Mr. Hassan explained his own claim, dating back a half-century, to a one-story home in the city center. In 1986, he said, Mr. Hussein's government seized his home and handed it to an Arab woman. Mr. Hassan moved north to the Kurdish city of Erbil and lived there until the American-led forces took power last spring. He said he was now waiting for the Governing Council to repeal a law that allowed the confiscations.
"I am a patient man," Mr. Hassan said. "But what about the others?"
A local government office has received 3,000 property claims, said Hassib Rozbayani, an assistant mayor.
A mile from the tent village where the returning Kurds live lies the neighborhood of Qadisiya, where over the decades many Arab migrants have built concrete homes. Ahmed Abdullah, 27, an Arab, said his family was paid $33,000 to move here from Diyala 25 years ago. 
Standing by his vegetable stand, he pointed to a residence across the street, which he said Arab owners recently sold to move south to Basra, fearing the house would be seized. In the last months, Mr. Abdullah said, graffiti had appeared on several houses saying, "Your homes will be your graves."

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Apple's success with iPod may presage the ascendance of hardware over software.

BYLINE:  By John Markoff

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
LEAVE it to Steven P. Jobs to sell the razors and give away the blades. 
 Common Silicon Valley wisdom has hewed for decades to the business adage that to establish a successful business in consumer products, you must be willing to lose money on the razors and look for profits from selling the blades. A notable example has been Microsoft's money-losing Xbox video game business. By hemorrhaging money on each video game console (razor) sold and hoping someday to make it up on game software (razor blades), Microsoft's home and entertainment division reported losses of almost $1 billion last year. 
 Now, along comes Mr. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple Computer, who once again is standing the common wisdom on its head. For its fiscal first quarter of 2004, Apple sold nearly 750,000 of its palm-sized iPod digital music players (razors) for an average price of $400, while selling 30 million songs (blades) for about 99 cents each. While Mr. Jobs has repeatedly said that Apple makes little or no profit from each song downloaded, the company said last week that its iPod sales were crucial to Apple's financial resurgence.
 Mr. Jobs has already received widespread credit for breaking the digital impasse between the recording industry and music consumers with Apple's iTunes store of downloadable songs. But the sales success of the iPod player indicates he may be onto something even bigger for Apple.
 Mr. Jobs's next big thing is buttressed by mounting evidence of a post-PC era in which silicon, not software, will be king. That is likely to bring wrenching changes in the technology world, largely dominated by Microsoft for the last decade. Under Microsoft's hegemony, hardware became a low-cost commodity. Now it may be software's turn.
 Richard Wallace, a columnist for Electronic Engineering Times, a trade publication, captured the shift in an article he wrote from the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. "The irony is that while software gets the glory," Mr. Wallace wrote, "it's silicon that's at the heart of the industry's next darling: pervasive media."
 That the iPod is more than just another hand-held gizmo was evident in Apple's recently announced surprise alliance with Hewlett-Packard, which plans to offer a version of the iPod, giving the device even broader distribution and marketing support. Hewlett, which in the fourth quarter was the world leader in unit sales of personal computers, also plans to place Apple's iTunes software, and some other Apple technology, on every consumer PC it sells. 
 The deal was a strategic coup for Mr. Jobs, as was evident in the reaction from Dave Fester, general manager of the Windows digital media division at Microsoft, who accused Hewlett of limiting consumer choice by including Apple music software instead of Microsoft software on its PC's. Many in the industry found irony in the remark: Microsoft is typically the one accused of limiting the public's choice with its industry-dominant Windows operating system.
 For Microsoft, the issue transcends online music. The foundation of Microsoft's power and leverage in the computing industry is based almost entirely on a set of software sockets known as application programmers' interfaces, or A.P.I.'s. It is those A.P.I.'s that other software publishers must adapt to in writing programs for use on Windows machines. By controlling the shape of the sockets, and what can fit into them, Microsoft has a powerful advantage against its competitors.
 The Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit in the 1990's was about Silicon Valley's quarrel with Microsoft over control of the A.P.I.'s. During the trial in 1998, Apple's lead software designer, Avi Tevanian, described his company's efforts to persuade PC makers to bundle Apple's QuickTime media software with their machines and how Microsoft demanded that Apple "knife the baby" -- in other words, drop the QuickTime bundling effort. 
 Now, with the new Apple-Hewlett alliance, Mr. Jobs finally has a QuickTime bundling arrangement. The program, which allows for the playing of video clips on a PC, will be a standard feature of every Hewlett-Packard computer. So will another Apple software technology, Rendezvous, which is an A.P.I. designed to let the computer identify and create links to any printer, camera, music player or other digital device without complicated configuration procedures on the user's part. 
 Simply put, Mr. Jobs has managed to inject Apple's DNA into the PC world, meaning that it will be increasingly easy for his company to offer PC users any kind of iPod-style device -- whether for music or other media -- the company may create in the future.
 Don't be surprised, in other words, if Mr. Jobs and Apple have many razors in the works.

HEADLINE: Pataki Budget Reducing Aid To Disabled 

BYLINE:  By MARC SANTORA and AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Thousands of low-income households with a disabled family member stand to lose part of their public assistance benefits because of a proposed change in state regulations intended to save New York State $9 million, according to Pataki administration officials.
 In his budget address on Tuesday, Gov. George E. Pataki plans to include those savings along with other cuts to help deal with the state's estimated $5.1 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year that starts April 1, an administration budget official said. 
 "There will be cuts in the budget," said the official, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. "The economy is starting to come back, but make no mistake, the state faces a $5.1 billion deficit. You have to cut spending to close that gap." 
The change does not require legislative approval, but because Governor Pataki plans to include the $9 million savings in his budget, legislators will have a chance to address the issue and perhaps to restore the money.
The proposal came as a surprise to many legislators, as well as advocates for the disabled and independent experts, who said that only a handful of states had tried a similar change.
In addition to the $9 million in state savings, local governments across the state would also save a total of $9 million, the administration said in its proposal, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times by an opponent of the change.
In a state budget of more than $90 billion, the total savings would be minimal but at least 26,700 families, many in New York City, could be affected, according to an "impact statement" included with the proposal that was confirmed with an administration official. 
"For many families, a cut like this can be devastating," said Mark Greenberg, the director of policy for the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonpartisan research and policy organization based in Washington. "It's only a small number of states where this has come up, and it has been very controversial when it was proposed."
Under the Pataki administration's plan, those households affected by this change would lose $90 per month on average, according to an estimate provided in the proposal. For a family with a fixed monthly income of only several hundred dollars, that loss could have a significant impact, advocates for the poor said.
"One of the many reasons we think it is illegal is that the state has always recognized that households with disabled families have higher needs and this would undercut them," said Susan Antos, a staff lawyer for the Greater Upstate Law Project, a statewide support center and advocacy group for the disadvantaged.
The new rules would change what has been New York's policy since the federal government made sweeping changes to the welfare program in 1996, eliminating the guarantee of federal aid and giving states lump sums of money and vast discretion over how to spend it.
The change would affect elderly, blind or otherwise disabled people in roughly 40,000 households in the state that get Supplemental Security Income, or S.S.I., as well as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, according to the impact statement written by the administration and attached to the proposed regulatory change.
The change, actually a complicated series of accounting shifts, would reduce TANF benefits by varying amounts, depending on the size of a disabled person's household.
As an example, advocates pointed to a hypothetical case of a poor single mother with a disabled child. In the past, the family would have been considered a household of one, and the mother would have received a monthly TANF payment of $414, while the child would have gotten an S.S.I. payment.
Under the new proposal, the family would be considered a household of two. If no one were receiving an S.S.I. payment, the TANF payment would rise to $501. But because the child received an S.S.I. payment, the state would now pro-rate the TANF payment. For the hypothetical household, it would cut the payment in half, to $250, so that the mother and child would lose $164 a month. 
"It clearly doesn't make any sense to give assistance to a recipient twice for the same needs," said Jack Madden, a spokesman for the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, which oversees how aid is distributed.
"New York has always provided generous assistance, but this kind of double counting is not only inappropriate, it also adds as a disincentive for people to seek employment and enter the work force." 
Assembly Democrats said the Pataki administration was trying to effect the rule change with little public scrutiny.
Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairwoman of the Assembly's Social Services Committee, said she was notified of the change in a Jan. 6 letter from John E. Robitzek, an official in the state's Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. For such a change to take effect, she said, it needs only to be entered in the State Register after a period of public comment.
"Within the context of trying to deal with budgetary shortfalls and the impact of rising costs around education, the governor and the office of the budget are looking very carefully for every opportunity to ratchet down state expenses," Ms. Glick said. 
A fiscal analyst for the Assembly said that since the savings from the change would be included in the governor's budget, "we could try to get the amount of state appropriations bumped up or we could try and address it through budget negotiations."
Along with other Democratic Assembly members, Ms. Glick was sharply critical of the administration's move.
"I think that they have never quite understood the direct impact to families," she said, "nor have they demonstrated a particular concern for struggling families."

HEADLINE: Rent Control as an Urban Elixir 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "'Unstable and Out of Control," by Maria L. Sachs (Op-Ed, Jan. 13): 
 My husband and I lovingly restored the small house in Manhattan where we raised our children. 
We have a good relationship with our rent-controlled tenant, who was here when we bought the house. She pays less than $300 a month for a third of the house. 
 Here's the hardest rub: Her children, who are our age and our economic peers, can inherit her apartment. Our children, now out of college and living in Manhattan, must struggle to pay high rents in order to remain here. Each would certainly have used the apartment, and likely would want to in the future. Does this make sense?

HEADLINE: Immigrants and Democracy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Temporary Immigration" (editorial, Jan. 12) identifies potential abuses of workers under the Bush administration's proposed temporary worker program but doesn't discuss the danger it poses to American democracy. 
 We are rightly concerned when citizens fail to vote. How can we create a class of permanently disfranchised residents? As Lincoln taught us, government by the people is the very heart of our national life. We would jeopardize what we hold most dear by inviting "guest workers" to pick our crops and clean our streets without hope of citizenship or participation in our democratic processes.
Our nation was born in a fight against taxation without representation. It would betray our origins to establish a lawfully resident caste of laborers to pay taxes, serve our economic interests and do our dirty work but not share in the work of self-governance.
America's self-interest requires that legalization of undocumented immigrants includes a path to citizenship.

HEADLINE: A New Chapter At City Hall: No Shake-Ups For Bloomberg 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
In his book "Bloomberg by Bloomberg," Michael R. Bloomberg, businessman, boasted that the company he founded had enjoyed "phenomenally low turnover." Two years into his term, Mr. Bloomberg, mayor, can say much the same of his administration.
 The announcement last week that Mr. Bloomberg's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, Jerilyn Perine, is resigning for personal reasons served as a reminder of just how rare high-level departures from the Bloomberg administration have been. 
It has not always been so for New York City mayors at midterm. 
Edward I. Koch was just 74 days into his mayoralty when he lost one deputy mayor, and he forced out three more during a shake-up in his second year in office. By midterm David N. Dinkins had lost a press secretary, a corporation counsel, a health commissioner, a labor relations commissioner and a sanitation commissioner. And a deputy mayor had announced her desire for another job within the administration. 
And by the middle of his first term Rudolph W. Giuliani was already on his third budget director, had purged several agencies of midlevel managers, and had lost his buildings commissioner, correction commissioner, commissioner of youth services and the head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation.
Mr. Bloomberg, by contrast, still has all of his deputy mayors in place and most of his commissioners. All told he has lost four commissioners -- of housing, correction, emergency management and design and construction -- and a few advisers. But his team is still largely the one that he put together after his election in 2001. 
"Far fewer top people are exiting this administration," said William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia. "It is atypical."
Asked why, people inside and outside the administration offered several theories.
Some said Mr. Bloomberg's lack of political debts had enabled him to pick the administration he wanted, rather than one dictated in part by political paybacks.
Others credited his ability to pick good people and, rather than micromanaging them, give them wide leeway to do their jobs. Others speculated that his nonconfrontational style and belief in continuity might have led him to work around people who are not working out, instead of getting rid of them. And some suggested that his great wealth -- and the way he rewarded his top campaign aides with six-figure bonuses after the election -- had not hurt in attracting loyal followers.
But many officials who work for Mr. Bloomberg say he has simply been a good, loyal boss. He is, after all, a mayor who recently assembled all of his agency heads at Gracie Mansion and told them, in a reversal of normal political protocol that made some of his staff members wince, "You're there to take the credit and I'm here to take the blame."
Government officials past and present said that the administration's high retention rate has enabled it to conduct the business of government without distracting upheavals.
But some questioned whether that was an unalloyed good.
"It is good and bad," Mr. Koch said. "The good is, it shows great team spirit and it shows that he's pleased and that, in his judgment, people are doing what they should be doing. The bad is, it's never that way, at least in my experience. At some point, whether it's in two years, or later, or earlier, there has to be a shake-out, an attempt to evaluate, to promote, to remove."
Mayor Bloomberg's chief of staff, Peter Madonia, said that continuity would be crucial if the administration were to accomplish its goals. 
"You have a mayor who let them put forward an agenda, and have a vision for their agencies, and they haven't finished it yet," he said. "It's a big behemoth, government, and if you have a vision, it takes a while to move it. And you have commissioners who are still in the middle of their own agendas. They're not finished, so they're not prepared to leave."
Mr. Madonia said that the mayor's style had been vital to staff retention: pick good people, do not micromanage them and back them up.
"He allows you to do your job," he said. "He'll support you, he'll be behind you. Even if you make a mistake -- obviously you can't make too many in any business -- but it allows you to take some risks in a business where people tend to be risk-averse."
Mr. Bloomberg appears unthreatened by his commissioners, allowing them to speak in public and backing them up when they are the subject of criticism.
Consider his relationship with his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. The mayor often allows Mr. Kelly to take center stage, and seems unfazed when, say, the commissioner out-bats him at a charity stickball game or receives considerably higher approval ratings than Mr. Bloomberg does in public opinion polls.
It is quite a departure from the relationship between past mayors and police commissioners. William J. Bratton, for one, said he had been forced out of the Giuliani administration in part because the mayor was jealous of the publicity he got.
Then there is the mayor's loyalty. His commissioner for homeless services, Linda Gibbs, came under fire from advocates for the homeless, who sought a contempt of court order against her personally. Mr. Bloomberg was ferocious in his defense of her and rarely missed an opportunity to publicly praise her while the controversy raged.
"It proved to me that he was good to his word," Ms. Gibbs said. "When the commissioners started, the message he gave to us was: 'Figure out your agencies, find out what's working, find out what doesn't, and use this time we have to make it better, even if it includes fights.' He was really saying, 'I will back you up.' That fact that he was there 100 percent, it was proof that he was good to the challenge that he had given us."
Most people who have left Mr. Bloomberg's administration had worked in the Giuliani administration as well. William J. Fraser, who was kept on as correction commissioner, resigned after 11 months when he and others within the department came under investigation. Mr. Bloomberg backed him publicly but accepted his resignation. 
Other commissioners to leave included John T. Odermatt, the commissioner of the Office of Emergency Management, who had worked as deputy there in the Giuliani administration; Kenneth R. Holden, the commissioner of the Department of Design and Construction, who held the post during the Giuliani administration, and Ms. Perine, who was appointed commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development in 2000 by Mayor Giuliani and retained by Mayor Bloomberg. 
Michael Carey, who was president of the city's Economic Development Corporation in the Giuliani administration, lasted eight months as a special assistant to Mr. Bloomberg before leaving. His stewardship at the corporation was later questioned in an audit by the city comptroller's office. 
One of the closest members of the mayor's inner circle to leave was Vincent LaPadula, an aide to Mr. Giuliani who joined the Bloomberg campaign and became a senior adviser to Mayor Bloomberg. He recently left to work for J.P. Morgan Chase. 
Mr. LaPadula was Mr. Bloomberg's point man in setting up the city's 311 hotline, and served as an unofficial liaison to the city's Republicans. His name surfaced in the investigation of Russell Harding, a former housing official in the Giuliani administration who was indicted on embezzlement charges, for taking a trip with Mr. Harding at the city's expense, but no charges were ever made against him. 
Another top aide, Kevin Sheekey, left his post as a special adviser to Mr. Bloomberg to serve on the host committee for the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled to be held in New York City from Aug. 30 to Sept. 2. But he is widely expected to rejoin Mr. Bloomberg either in his administration or on his re-election campaign.
The relatively small amount of turnover has left Nathan Leventhal, who led Mr. Bloomberg's transition team and is now in charge of filling appointments, not as busy as he might have been. "I do have to fill commissions and boards," he offered. 
Mr. Eimicke, of Columbia, said that most administrations see an exodus at about the halfway point. 
"We're sort of right now at the time that you would see some outflow of people," he said. "From your own selfish career point of view, this is probably the best time to leave because your guy is still in."

HEADLINE: Transition in Pakistan 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "The Musharraf Mysteries" (editorial, Dec. 27) says that "Pakistani politics are difficult to decode" and that the immediate challenge is to "discover what is really going on there." 
 What is going on should be plain enough. The country is undergoing a transition from an unstable, corrupt and personality-centered "kleptocracy" to a more sustainable, transparent and institutionalized democracy. 
President Pervez Musharraf has accepted these challenges on behalf of the longer-term interest of Pakistan. As a result, very significant successes have been achieved in the war on terror, in economic reform, in overcoming the impasse in Parliament, in securing borders, in combating domestic extremists and in reducing tensions along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. 
The price, of course, has been the elevated risk to the president, as the recent attacks on him demonstrate. These attacks have only reinforced the determination of the president, the prime minister and the people of Pakistan to root out extremism and violence.

HEADLINE: A Governor's Hard Sell: Higher Taxes in Virginia 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: VIRGINIA BEACH, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Gov. Mark Warner, jacket off and microphone on, was pacing the front of the conference room, preaching his gospel of tax reform, again.
 Waving at PowerPoint slides detailing Virginia's fiscalproblems, he pressed, prodded and practically begged 100 Chamber of Commerce members to do what he said he could not do alone: persuade the Republican lawmakers who dominate the state legislature to support his plan, which includes a $1 billion tax increase over the next two years. 
 "I hope you are all Republicans," Mr. Warner, the state's first Democratic governor in a decade, told the group. "If this makes sense, your elected officials need to hear from you." 
Since his election in 2001, Mr. Warner has cut a beleaguered figure in Richmond, struggling to close a $6 billion budget shortfall that drained money from nearly every state program and made ambitious programs all but unthinkable.
But he has taken the offensive this year, proposing an overhaul of the tax system that he says will cut taxes for 65 percent of Virginians while raising them for the rich, preserve the state's triple-A bond rating and close a projected $1.2 billion budget shortfall in the next two years. 
His proposal comes at what seems an unpropitious time for raising taxes. Last fall, voters in Alabama overwhelmingly rejected a similar tax overhaul, while Californians overwhelmingly elected an anti-tax governor in October. In 2002, voters in Northern Virginia and in the Hampton Roads area rejected sales-tax increases intended to raise revenue for transportation projects.
Undaunted, Mr. Warner has taken his proposal -- easily the most ambitious and risky of his term -- on the road with the same genial verve that marked his campaign for governor, crisscrossing the state each week to meet Rotarians and retirees. 
But in a shift from 2001, when he proclaimed himself a friend of rural voters -- sponsoring a Nascar team, commissioning a bluegrass campaign song, supporting gun-owners' rights -- he has emphasized a different part of his resume this year: that of Mark Warner, the multimillionaire businessman. 
"I spent 20 years in business, two in politics," he tells audiences, referring to the entrepreneurial endeavors that earned him more than $100 million in the cellphone industry.
"I like speaking to business groups because they get it," he said in Virginia Beach before explaining why the state's "fiscal meltdown" would hurt industry. "My strategy is simple; my strategy is you."
There is evidence his strategy is paying dividends. Though the National Federation of Independent Businesses sharply criticized the plan, the Chamber of Commerce is expected to endorse its broad outlines sometime soon, group officials said. In addition to raising taxes on the wealthy, it would increase sales taxes and some corporate taxes.
"We give him high marks for coming up with a plan that tries to strengthen the Commonwealth's financial condition," said Hugh Keogh, president of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce. "There is concern that without investments in education and infrastructure, Virginia runs the risk of withering on the vine."
Still, the Republican Party's powerful anti-tax wing, sensing the chance to stop both a tax increase and an up-and-coming Democrat, has pledged to fight the plan. Led by Senator George Allen; Attorney General Jerry W. Kilgore, a prospect for governor in 2005; and Speaker William J. Howell of the House of Delegates, they contend that Mr. Warner's plan will stifle growth and cause a loss of up to 28,000 jobs. Privatizing services and cutting waste are the answer, they say. 
"You can't tax your way to prosperity," Mr. Howell said in an interview. "The message is clear: we've got to get a handle on our costs." 
But while Republicans control bothhouses of the legislature, Mr. Warner has one advantage: a schism between the party's moderate wing, which supports tax increases, and its staunchly anti-tax conservatives. 
The rift opened in the 1990's during budget battles between the moderates and Gov. James S. Gilmore III, an anti-tax stalwart. It widened this month when the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator John H. Chichester, a Republican, proposed a tax increase twice as large as Mr. Warner's, much to the chagrin of Mr. Howell and Mr. Kilgore. Conservatives believe that Mr. Chichester is trying to help the governor by making Mr. Warner's plan seem modest in comparison, staking out the most aggressive position as a starting point for negotiations.
"In Virginia, there are two parts of the party," said Mayor Dana Dickens of Suffolk, a Republican who has praised the Warner plan. "There are a lot of anti-taxers, but there are also a lot of moderates who understand we need to strengthen infrastructure to attract business. And the Republican Party is the party of business."
For Mr. Warner, 49, the plan is a big gamble. Tall, toothy and telegenic, he is widely considered a rising star in the Democratic firmament. A rich-man populist with a regular-guy amiability, he is the kind of Southern moderate many Democrats say their party needs to regain support outside the liberal Northeast.
But his political future is constrained by Virginia law, which limits governors to one term. Some speculate that Mr. Warner would like to be on the presidential ticket this fall. More commonly, analysts expect him to challenge one of the state's Republican senators, Mr. Allen in 2006 or John W. Warner in 2008. (Mr. Warner narrowly lost to Senator Warner, no relation, in 1996.)
To do that, analysts say, he will need a more ambitious record than the cautious budget-cutting one he has established in his first two years.
"He wants a legacy," said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. "And this is his first opportunity to make one, because the economy has been so bad."
Everywhere he goes, Mr. Warner tells voters that the Republicans oppose his plan at their peril. More budget cuts will weaken the state's universities, leave roads and schools in disrepair and bring overcrowding to prisons and nursing homes. His plan calls for increased spending on schools, higher education, transportation and other programs.
He contends his plan makes the antiquated tax code fairer. It would cut taxes on food and eliminate them on cars and estates worth less than $10 million. The nearly flat income tax would rise for people earning more than $100,000 but fall for most others. He would increase the sales tax by a penny, to 5.5 cents, and raise cigarette taxes to 25 cents a pack, from 2.5 cents. He would close special deductions for the high-income elderly and certain corporations.
Mr. Howell said he was willing to raise some taxes, including those on cigarettes and gasoline, but he is adamantly against raising the general sales tax or income tax. Mr. Warner's dire predictions of service disruptions and infrastructure decay are exaggerated, he argues.
Born in Connecticut and educated at George Washington University and Harvard Law, Mr. Warner does not sound like a Virginian. But he has appropriated the courtly Virginia political style and its centrist politics. He does not talk about abortion rights, though he says he supports them, and incessantly promotes himself as a fiscal conservative. 
Now, with some Senate Republicans supporting a larger tax hike thanhis own, he finds himself right where he wants to be: in the middle. 
"The need is so obvious and my fix is so conservative," he said in an interview. "It's not as if I'm trying to create some grand new entitlement program."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE MILITARY; 
G.I.'s Headed for Iraq Train For Peace as Well as War

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: FORT HOOD, Tex., Jan. 15 

 BODY:
When Lt. Gen. Thomas F. Metz arrives in Iraq in the coming days to take command of day-to-day military operations there, he will be battling insurgents as much as ill will, and his troops will be engaged in everything from firefights to fixing sewers.
 That is why General Metz, commander of the Army's III Corps, ordered up training for the mission that went far beyond the usual tabletop war games and field exercises. 
 He dispatched senior officers to Jordan for lessons on Middle Eastern history and culture. Combat maneuvers in the deserts of California and muggy Louisiana included 200 Arabic-speaking civilians, under contract with the military, whose job it was to complicate the work of soldiers training to operate checkpoints and raid homes. 
The headquarters staff of III Corps, which will form thecore of the coalition joint task force running the entire Iraq mission, drilled with scenarios castwell into June for weather and religious holidays and local politics.
And he assigned his commanders and senior noncommissioned officers a reading list on Islam because "we have to understand their culture through a different set of eyes," General Metz said in an interview. 
"Regardless of your academic background, whether you've come through a public or a private school system in the United States, you're going to get a good dose of American history, West European history and a little world history," said General Metz, a soft-spoken three-star officer who has commanded mechanized infantry units and taught engineering at West Point. 
"That world history is going to be written through the eyes of a Westerner, and we have to understand that the Islamic culture was a dominant power in the world for hundreds and hundreds of years." 
Study of what he called "the cultural piece" led to new procedures that may allow the military to conduct muscular missions while minimizing bruised relations with the Iraqi population. 
"Example: What a squad leader must do when he enters someone's home," he said. "If you have to break the door down to get in to do the search, then have an engineer team standing by that, when you leave, will repair the door. After you've thought of it and done it once, it seems real simple."
For years, III Corps trained to command divisions readied for a specific high-intensity conflict -- the fight to defend South Korea from invasion by the Communist North. Since receiving his orders for Iraq, General Metz has guided III Corps in preparing instead for an operation that presents troops with lower-intensity challenges of stability and security operations. 
Lessons observed are only learned once they are incorporated into future action, and General Metz will be drawing on experience gained from America's first front against terror. From October 2002 to January 2003, he served as chief of staff to the Central Command under Gen. Tommy R. Franks, dealing hands-on with the complicated postwar period in Afghanistan. 
That experience, he said, taught him the importance of analyzing a range of influence that any government may exert, what he called DIME, for diplomacy, information, military and economy. 
"I learned in Afghanistan that you can't build the security tower all the way to its top and then expect everything else to come up," he said. "You can't build any one to its finished production and then start on the next one. They have to come together."
General Metz will arrive in Iraq as deputy to Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, commander of the coalition's joint task force. Pentagon officials say General Sanchez will then focus his energies less on tactics and daily operations and more on strategic-level, military-political issues in the critical months as control passes to a new Iraqi government, which is planned by July 1. 
Those changes are part of the largest movement of American troops since World War II, with almost a quarter million rotating in and out of Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, which presents opportunities for creative missions -- and increased opportunities for insurgents to attack. 
The complexity of that rotation can be seen here at Fort Hood, one of the Army's largest and most important bases. One of its divisions, the Fourth Infantry, will return from Iraq this spring; another, the First Cavalry, will go to Iraq, to be responsible for the security of Baghdad. 
Members of a National Guard brigade, the 39th, from Arkansas, are here for accelerated training for their role in the deployment of large numbers of citizen-soldiers to join active-duty forces in Iraq. 
Maj. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, commander of the First Cavalry Division, said he worked with community leaders in nearby Killeen to arrange training very different from that usually given to troops heading overseas. 
Soldiers are being teamed with the chief of Killeen's water and sewer district, the supervisor of the electricity grid and the manager of the local landfill "to get an idea how the whole thing works, and what 'right' looks like," General Chiarelli said. 
In Iraq, "The soldier is the guy down in the neighborhood on a day-to-day basis, and if something is not going right, he's the first person who is going to hear about it," General Chiarelli added. "We're going to make life better for the Iraqi people in those areas." 
Brig. Gen. Thomas P. Bostick, an assistant division commander for the First Cavalry, said, "The overarching theme is, we want to turn over in a progressive manner to the Iraqi people control of their country."

HEADLINE: Cairo Journal; 
Symphony in Motion? Ancient Tradition? Or Just Tacky?

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Madame Rakia Hassan adopts a look of extreme indignity when asked why women from as far afield as the United States and Australia flock to her belly-dancing studio for lessons despite her utter lack of formal training.
 "I am Egyptian!" she exclaims. "Oriental dancing is something inside every Egyptian. Before, when I was a classical dancer, nothing emerged. But as soon as I started to teach, all the moves came out." 
 It has long been a conceit among Egyptians that they, in fact, invented Oriental dance, or belly dancing, as it is more commonly known, and remain its only true practitioners. 
But what had been mere tradition became law on Jan. 1: Foreigners are now barred from working as the headline dancers in the cabarets of Cairo and tourist resorts. 
The announced reason is that foreigners were stealing jobs from Egyptian women. Officials will not come right out and admit it, but many in the dance world also say the government suspected that women from Russia and elsewhere were claiming to be dancers while plying an older profession. 
Yet Egypt's attitude toward its dancers has always been tinged with ambivalence. In the abstract, there is pride in the dance, but no respectable family wants its daughter to pursue the profession. 
"The Egyptians don't want it to die out, but they don't want to nurture it either because of the stigma," says Jane Bolinowsky, an Australian flutist studying Oriental dance. "It's a minefield. There is a powerful female sexuality here, but there is also a deep mistrust in it."
The origins of belly dancing remain obscure, but Egyptians claim it because Pharaonic friezes show scantily clad girls with bands of men playing drums and tambourines. 
Although Cairo remains the center for women seeking to learn the dance, the profession has suffered a certain slump at home, with far fewer upscale hotels featuring dancers. Given the conservative religious times, not to mention the general economic malaise, spending up to $50 a person to watch scantily clad women wiggle across the stage has lost some appeal. 
No one is sure how many women the new law has affected, but promotors calculate that of 100 regular dancers in Cairo, maybe one-third were foreigners. Dancers and their fans describe the main difference as a question of soul. 
"The Russians are very disciplined; they put in hours and hours perfecting their motor skills," noted Ms. Bolinowsky. "There is a softness about the Egyptian physique, though, a fluidity to their movement."
Madame Rakia added, "They feel the melody."
But foreigners had virtually taken over high-end spots like Maxim, a floating cabaret outside the Cairo Marriott that slips quietly along the Nile for several hours each night. 
Sami Saad, the director of operations, makes no secret of his preference for foreigners. "The foreigners were creative, looking at old Egyptian movies to come up with new routines," he said. "They are not like the Egyptians, who think they just know how to dance and because they are Egyptian, everyone will love them automatically."
The seamier side of belly dancing unrolls in what passes for fleshpots in Cairo's old downtown. Ear-splitting music bursts forth around midnight, and the dancing improves as the night drifts toward dawn. During one recent evening at the Palmyra Club, where the dusty red decor seems unchanged since the 1960's, the first hefty dancers resembled the Michelin man poured into a slightly different mold. They did not so much gyrate as jiggle. 
The patrons, slumped over small tables, nursing beers and hookah pipes, did not seem to mind, lurching on stage periodically to shower the performers with five-pound notes (worth 75 cents) and to attempt the occasional grope.
Such clubs are evidently not the prime dancers' lifeblood. Few upper-class Egyptian weddings are complete without a performance, and the prestige factor weighs heavily. A top dancer can command $2,000 for a 45-minute performance. 
The most celebrated is Dina, who presents herself as a dancer of a different caliber, stressing her master's degree in philosophy. 
But her performances really sealed her notoriety. Regulations require that a dancer's midriff be covered with fine netting at a minimum, and that her dress cover her legs when not in motion. Dina performed in costumes as skimpy as bikinis, with pelvic thrusts and other moves outside the repetory. 
It all came crashing down last year, after the police raided a home of Hossam Aboul Fotouh, the country's BMW agent, and seized a videotape showing Mr. Fatouh, portly and married, with the shapely dancer in flagrante delicto. The tape soon leaked out onto the Internet. 
Dina stopped dancing for a time but has now resumed, in relatively prudish dress. 
This constant hint of the unsavory leaves many Egyptians of two minds about Oriental dance. 
"It is like striptease in your country," said Mohammed al-Qadi, a 28-year-old engineer celebrating his marriage with dinner at Maxim with a few friends. His bride, Farida Said, a veiled, 22-year-old pharmacist, chimed in: "I don't like it. It is something you should only do at home, not in front of strangers." 
Yet other women on board, also veiled, suggested there was nothing quite like watching an accomplished dancer to make them feel happy. 
Such timeless scenes have elicited excitement and shock from visitors for centuries. Auguste Flaubert wrote a rapt description of a striptease performed for him by a dancer whose musicians were blindfolded. Edward Lane, another 19th-century traveller, called Cairo's dancers both the "most abandoned courtesans" and the "finest women in Egypt."
Madame Rakia disapproves of the new law banning foreigners, seeing in it the demise of yet another aspect of Egypt's cosmopolitan past. There have long been foreigners here -- Greeks, Armenians and others -- who added richness to the dance without unseating the reigning Egyptian queens, she notes. 
"If this dance was from any other country, you might find better dancers than there are in Egypt," she said. "You don't. It's impossible."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 2, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 20 about belly dancing in Egypt and a new law that bans foreign women from working as headline dancers in Cairo clubs and tourist resorts misstated the given name of the 19th-century French novelist Flaubert, who was among the first foreigners to write about Egyptian belly dancers. It was Gustave, not Auguste.

The Whole Cowand Nothing but the Whole Cow

BYLINE:  By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
In the mid-1990's, British officials had been trying for almost a decade to respond to the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in a herd near Ashford, England. At first, they simply dismissed public concern or proclaimed their faith in British beef. Even when humans began dying of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- the human equivalent of B.S.E. -- government officials found it hard to act coherently. They had the one excuse that we lack: they didn't know what they were confronting. In time, the British government put in place a set of prohibitions against the use of meat and bone meal as food for cattle and against the sale of certain kinds of offal for human consumption. Those steps have seriously reduced the incidence of mad cow disease. 
 The British government also introduced a strict system for tracking every cow in the country, something we are only now edging toward. By the mid-1990's in England, you could follow a cow's paper trail right up to the slaughterhouse door. But what then? Live cattle almost certainly can't spread mad cow disease. Dead cattle can, if the wrong things are done with them. After a decade of wrangling, the British decided to create an system to track cow parts. 
 It sounded like a good idea, but it was never completed. The reason is that the parts of a slaughtered cow go everywhere. The official British B.S.E. Inquiry Report put it this way: "It has been said, and not altogether facetiously, that the only industry in which some part of the cow is not used is concrete production." The problem isn't just global meat. It's global cow.
Here's the scale of the question. In 2002, commercial slaughterhouses in the United States killed 36,780,000 cattle and calves. How much of a cow carcass becomes meat depends on whom you talk to. The United States Department of Agriculture says 70 percent, some knowledgeable cattle buyers say 63 percent, and the British government's studies say 53 percent. Even the U.S.D.A.'s figure means that if you add up the non-meat remains of the cattle slaughtered annually in this country, you would have a herd of 11 million whole animals. You can begin to see why it seemed like a smart idea to feed bovine meat and bone meal to other cows -- the practice, now banned, that transmitted mad cow disease in the first place. There's just so much of the stuff. 
What isn't meat leaves the slaughterhouse for the rendering plant. There it is converted into basic raw materials that are processed all around the world into a thousand different forms, most broken down all the way to their molecular components, into proteins and fats and fatty acids. Just how widely these are dispersed industrially can be gauged from a letter sent out from an office of the Food and Drug Administration in 1992, asking manufacturers of dietary supplements to check the sources of bovine "neural and glandular tissue(s) or tissues extracts" to make sure they were not contaminated. Letters also went out to the manufacturers of "drugs, biological drugs, medical devices and biological device products," to the manufacturers of veterinary drugs and animal feed, and to the makers and importers of cosmetics. 
In fact, the list is nearly endless. Vaccines are often prepared in media that may contain byproducts from slaughtered cattle. Until recently, heparin, a widely prescribed anticoagulant, was made from bovine mucosa and lung, and steroids come from adrenal glands. Chemicals derived from bovine tissue appear in plastics, paper coatings, rubber and asphalt. Glycerin appears in countless products. Collagen is a bovine byproduct.
Some of these products -- vaccines, for instance -- are strictly regulated, and many of the industrial uses of cattle parts derive from cow parts that are not associated with mad cow disease. In fact, it is possible to stand back and marvel at the industrial ingenuity that has found so many uses for what looks utterly useless as it comes out of the slaughterhouse. The logic behind this ingenuity is blunt. The F.D.A., explaining why vaccines are prepared with cattle byproducts, said: "Cow components are often used simply because cows are very large animals, and thus much material is available." 
It isn't clear whether we would be better off, environmentally and economically, if other raw materials, not from animals, were used for products made from cow parts. But the inventiveness that converts cattle tissue into thousands and thousands of apparently nonagricultural products -- like gelatin capsules and jet engine lubricants -- also provides part of the economic rationale for expanding the global cattle herd, regardless of the consequences. It's easy to grasp the problem of feeding bovine blood and bone meal to cows. But economic pressure forces the use of cow parts further downstream, until blood and bone meal are fed to farmed fish.
Without the industrial market for bovine byproducts, the size of the cattle herd in the world could never have grown as large as it has. When people talk about industrial farming, they usually refer to the often deplorable conditions in which livestock is raised these days, usually confined in close quarters, often indoors. But you might also call the capacity to turn a cow into fabric softener a kind of industrial farming as well, a kind we all participate in, whether we know it or not, whether we choose it or not.

HEADLINE: College Endowments Make Happy Discovery: Black Ink 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
Profits from university endowments rebounded in the 2003 fiscal year, but not by enough to erase the losses of earlier years, according to the latest annual survey by the National Association of College and University Business Officers. 
 Endowments, so critical to a university's financial health, typically yielded a 2.9 percent return last year, a considerable improvement over the previous two fiscal years. In 2001, university investments actually lost money at a median rate of 3.7 percent. Then in 2002, they lost an additional 6.4 percent, prompting universities to raise tuition and aggressively solicit donations in hopes of making up for declining returns. 
 Still, last year's returns did not necessarily mean that endowments got any bigger, according to the survey, although there were gains at some of the wealthiest universities. 
At 2.2 percent, inflation almost outpaced the profits universities earned from their investments. Beyond that, universities typically spent 5.4 percent of their endowments to run their campuses, offsetting any of the gains they might have experienced. 
As a result, the average endowment fell to $321.5 million last year, down more than 5 percent from the 2002 fiscal year and more than 23 percent since 2000, statistics from the business officers show. The median endowment also dropped during that period, to $70 million last year from $80 million the year before and $109 million in 2000. 
"The good news is, we've turned the corner," said David J. Lyons, senior fellow at the business officers association. "But the state budgets are in terrible condition, so at the publics, at least, this is definitely going to put pressure on tuition, and fund-raising will be pretty essential for everyone. I think the alumni will be getting a lot of letters." 
Not that all endowments are suffering. The three biggest, at Harvard, Yale and Princeton, all got bigger. The same was true at some of the other wealthiest private institutions, like Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University, as well as for some large public institutions, including the Universities of California and Virginia. 
At the other end of the scale, several institutions experienced declines in their endowments, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dartmouth College and Emory University. 
"When nearly 20 percent of our revenue comes from endowment and trusts, it certainly makes a difference and has a belt-tightening effect," said James W. Wagner, president of Emory. 
Emory's endowment, for example, shrank by more than $500 million, or 11.7 percent, in a single year, the survey found. Nonetheless, Mr. Wagner said, income from research grants grew enough so that he expects no layoffs, salary freezes or large tuition increases. 
"It's affecting us but not distracting us," he said.
Most universities count on their endowments to cover 5 percent to 20 percent of their annual costs, said Mr. Lyons of the business officers association. 
That may not make endowments an institution's primary source of revenue, but they are hardly insignificant, especially since state support of higher education has decreased in the current fiscal year by 2.2 percent, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
"The endowment is very important to us, but it's not a substitute for loss of state funds," said William J. Shkurti, senior vice president for business and finance at Ohio State University. 
According to the survey, Ohio State's endowment rose 12.7 percent last year, although Mr. Shkurti described the increase as the function of an accounting change, not exceptional returns. "Two years ago, as part of state budget cuts, we lost $20 million with the stroke of a pen," Mr. Shkurti said, noting that it was "the equivalent of a $400 million endowment" in terms of revenue.
Most institutions would have liked an 8 percent or 9 percent return, at least last year, experts on college finance said. The goal each year is to generate enough of a return to cover inflation, spend about 5 percent of total assets and cover fees without depleting the endowment. 
But the fact that their returns fell short of that does not mean universities will end up throttling their endowment spending, officials said. 
"Once universities get used to a certain amount of money coming from the endowment, it's really hard to squeeze that back," said Richard A. Raffetto, managing director of endowments and foundations at the Bank of New York. "It's very painful on campus."

Air Traffic Estimate For Decade's End
 In 2000, as air travel was surging, the Federal Aviation Administration estimated that 931 million passengers would board commercial airplanes in the United States in 2010, compared with 624 million in 1999. 
 By mid-2001, when business travel slowed in a souring economy, aviation analysts said those projections already seemed exaggerated. And after Sept. 11, passenger growth projections were anyone's guess. 
Now the Boyd Group, the Colorado-based aviation consulting company, has published a new forecast that predicts the number of passengers boarding planes in the United States will total just over 740 million in 2009, far from the 2000 F.A.A. estimate, which had helped prompt many airports to undertake expensive expansion projects. 
The Boyd outlook also estimates that barring catastrophic events like a major terrorist attack or a sharp rise in oil prices, passenger traffic will grow from 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent this year. 

Northwest Data Issue Stirring Some Concern
Corporate travel managers are not happy with Northwest Airlines for secretly providing personal passenger information to the government for a security study, according to an overnight survey conducted Sunday and yesterday by the Business Travel Coalition. Nor are they happy about the way the airline explained its actions when questions about it arose last week.
Travel and purchasing managers from 45 big corporations participated in the survey. Nearly half said they were "extremely concerned" about Northwest's handling of the matter. Another 20 percent described themselves as "very concerned" or "concerned."
Northwest said Sunday that its chief executive, Richard Anderson, and a spokesman, Kurt Ebenhoch, were misinformed when they denied in September that the airline had provided passenger records to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for a security study. Northwest said Sunday that neither Mr. Anderson nor Mr. Ebenhoch had been aware when they denied it that the airline's security department had shared millions of passenger records. 
Much of the criticism from corporate travel managers centered on Northwest's response to the controversy, according to the Business Travel Coalition.

Delta to Begin Using Zone Boarding System
Delta Air Lines will begin boarding passengers by staggered zones tomorrow in domestic airports. In the coach section, passengers will get boarding passes with a zone number corresponding to one of six sections of the cabin. Coach cabin boarding will be called by zone, in contrast to the previous procedure of boarding the plane "from the rear of the aircraft forward," said Rob Maruster, Delta's director for airport customer service.
First-class passengers will continue to be the first to board. But there is a change for coach passengers with Medallion elite status in Delta's frequent-flier program, who used to be boarded in one group, right after first class. Now they will be boarded by two zones, depending on whether they are seated toward the front or the rear of the plane, Mr. Maruster said.
The new boarding procedure -- which was tested on Delta's low-fare subsidiary Song and is already used by several other airlines -- is part of a drive by Delta to reduce on-ground turnaround time for aircraft and get them "flying more," Mr. Maruster said. 
Over all, "boarding is going to be a lot more efficient, and it's going to be a lot less hassle," he said.
The new procedure "saves us between 7 to 10 minutes" in boarding a fully booked airplane, he said.

International Meetings Expected to Increase
The growing demand for international travel is being reflected in the meetings and conventions industry. United States meetings planners expect an 11 percent rise in the number of international meetings this year over last year, according to Future Watch 2004, a report by Meeting Professionals International and American Express that will be issued this week.
In a survey for the annual report, corporate and professional meetings planners projected an average 3 percent increase in spending this year over last year, when spending decreased 1 percent over 2002.

Another Chance to Pass Through Metal Detectors
Now you get a second chance to fish out those overlooked coins in your pocket when you go through airport checkpoint metal detectors. Under a new policy by the Transportation Security Administration, passengers who set off metal detectorsare invited to try one more time, after depositing metal objects in a tray. 
Previously, setting off the metal detector meant an automatic secondary screening.

Only 3 U.S. Airports Show Rise in Capacity
Only 3 of the 31 largest domestic airports had increases in scheduled air service capacity as of last month over December 2002, according to a report by the Office of Inspector General in the Transportation Department. 
The three with increases in available seats were Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International (up 16 percent); Kennedy International in New York (up 7 percent); and McCarran International in Las Vegas (up 1 percent).
At the bottom of the list, three airports showed decreases of more than 25 percent in available seats: San Francisco International (down 28 percent); Pittsburgh International (down 34 percent); and Lambert-St. Louis International (down 59 percent). JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Advertising; 
Concern about U.S. foreign policy has some re-evaluating ad tactics.

BYLINE:  By Eric Pfanner

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
AN American businessman returns home to the suburbs, where his wife has prepared dinner for the family. He watches as his wife and family eat, drink and break into song. But after starting "Take Me Out to the Ball Game," they switch to a traditional Turkish number. 
 The befuddled husband, played by Chevy Chase, takes a sip of cola, and, lo and behold, he sheds his American reserve and joins in the revelry. By the end of the 30-second TV spot, he sprouts a Turkish-style mustache. 
 The ad was created by the Istanbul affiliate of Young & Rubicam, part of the WPP Group, for Cola Turka, one of several would-be rivals to Coca-Cola and Pepsi that have sprung up in Europe and the Middle East. It suggests that for real Turks, Cola Turka is now the real thing. 
For many consumer advertisers, politics and nationalism have traditionally been touchy areas. But with widespread international concern about United States foreign policy, that may be changing. 
A radio spot running in Britain for Opodo, an Internet travel site owned by a group of European airlines, provides "language lessons" for Britons preparing to visit America. A British voice politely provides useful phrases like "I would like a cup of coffee, please." An American with a grating, exaggerated New York accent provides the translation: "Can I get a regular full-caf semi-latte with 2 percent milk to go?"
The spot, by Leagas Delaney, concludes with the British "You've really annoyed me" translated as "Have a nice day."
A survey by Edelman Public Relations to be presented this week at the World Economic Forum, found that 66 percent of consumers polled in Germany said they were less likely to buy American products as a result of their opposition to the United States-led war in Iraq. In France, the figure was 64 percent. While 66 percent of American consumers polled said they trusted the Coca-Cola brand, only 40 percent said so in Europe, the poll showed.
"American companies have to do a better job of disabusing Europeans of the notion that they are the font of all environmental problems, obesity and wars," said Richard Edelman, chief executive of Edelman.
Some American marketers have been trying to turn the tables, picking up on local sensibilities in their own commercials. Happily for American multinational marketers, what consumers say and what they do often seem very different. Europeans may express frustration over United States foreign policy when asked about their perception of American companies, but when it is time to spend, they apparently tend to stick with the brands they know.
A recent survey of "cool brands" by Research International of London shows that in France, the "least cool celebrity" is President Bush. The coolest fashion brand is Levi's.
"People may criticize the Bush administration, but they make a big distinction between politics and consumption," said Valerie Accary, managing director for multinational clients at BBDO Europe.
In places where sensitivity to American foreign policy may run closer to home, there are some signs that the national origin of a brand can make a difference, particularly if it is backed by an advertising campaign. Ulker Group, a Turkish food company, started selling Cola Turka last summer. By December, the company says, it had about 20 percent of Turkish cola sales.
Americans, meanwhile, may have discarded some French wines, but there appears to be a failure to connect their anger over French opposition to the Iraq war and their attitude toward brands from France.
According to the Edelman survey, only 34 percent of Americans say they trust French brands. Yet when asked about French company names like Danone, which sells Dannon yogurt in the United States, or Michelin, the tire maker, Americans gave them trust ratings as high as or higher than they received at home.
But that is at least in part because they have long been positioning themselves as American brands. Some United States multinationals have taken a similar tack. Levi's long ago abandoned overtly American imagery in its European advertising. McDonald's emphasizes the local sourcing of its products and its employees in Europe, trying to sidestep its image as a symbol of American-led globalization.
To some, anti-American brand sentiments express a more general cynicism about bland marketing. "Consumers respond to being treated as individuals rather than as part of some global community," said William Eccleshare, head of Young & Rubicam/Wunderman Europe.

HEADLINE: Chicago to Lose 2 Historic Candy Brands 

BYLINE:  By JO NAPOLITANO

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Chicago's reputation as the capital of the nation's candy industry suffered another blow last week when the maker of two candy brands based here, Fannie May and Fanny Farmer, said their factory and retail stores would be closed and the brands sold to an out-of-state company. 
 The departure of the two brands follows those of E.J. Brach and Frango in recent years. Though well-known manufacturers like Tootsie Roll Industries, the William Wrigley Jr. Company and the Willie Wonka Candy Factory are still here, Chicagoans have begun to wonder which confectioner will be the next to go. 
 "The closing of Fannie May isn't only about jobs lost," said Mayor Richard M. Daley. "Chicago has lost one of its most identifiable and beloved cultural icons." 
The city's candy industry, which by a trade group's reckoning employed 13,600 workers here in 1995, will be down to about 7,000 when the sprawling, antiquated plant on West Jackson Boulevard is shut down over the next few weeks by the 84-year-old Archibald Candy Corporation, eliminating 625 jobs. The company's 242 Fannie May and Fanny Farmer retail stores will be shuttered by Feb. 15, the day after Valentine's Day.
Archibald Candy had been struggling for some time, and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002. It reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy last October, but continued to suffer from falling sales, rising costs, stiff competition and an uncertain economy. Terms of the sale of the two brands to Alpine Confections of Alpine, Utah, were not disclosed when the deal was announced on Jan. 14; both companies are privately held. Archibald will continue to operate its 170-store Laura Secord retail chain in Canada.
Believing that Fannie May candies were about to disappear entirely, many Chicagoans reacted by rushing to stock up one last time on Pixies, Trinidads, Mint Meltaways and the company's other treats. Alpine has said little about its plans for the two brands, but both are expected to remain available through retail outlets such as supermarkets, supplied from Alpine's four plants in Utah, Ohio and British Columbia. 
Still, Fannie May devotees expressed sadness, saying that no grocery store could offer the aroma, the ambience, the service or the selection they enjoyed for decades in the dozens of Fannie May candy shops around the city. 
Anne Marie Nalley, tears gathering in her eyes, said she and her 13 brothers and sisters had enjoyed the candies since childhood. Ms. Nalley, now in her 40's, said buying Fannie May candies at Christmas and Easter was a family tradition. 
"I just get all choked up about it," she said, standing inside a Fannie May store on Michigan Avenue. "What am I going to do for gifts? I can't talk about it. I'll get too emotional."
Sharon Reum, 60, who works as a consultant, said she had been a Fannie May customer as long and she could remember. "My husband used to buy them for me when we were teenagers," she said. 
Frank Rzepka, a 61-year-old graphic artist, said that though sweets were no longer part of his diet because of diabetes, he still shopped in the stores for relatives and friends. 
Italian and German immigrants got Chicago's candy industry started toward the end of the 19th century, taking advantage of the city's location at the hub of the Midwest railroad network. The city embraced the industry and fought to keep it intact here in recent years despite wages, sugar prices and environmental regulations that combine to put American candy factories at a sharp cost disadvantage. 
"No one wants to get a passport to visit their factory," said Bill H. Kelley, vice chairman of the Jelly Belly Candy Company and chairman of the National Confectioners Association. "But when you're fighting sugar, labor and other incidental costs, you can't fight a three-headed monster." 
Sugar prices are the biggest of the three problems, candy makers say, because of the federal government's longtime policy of protecting domestic sugar producers from competition by sharply restricting imports. As a result, American candy makers must pay twice the world price for sugar, they say, giving hard-candy makers, especially, a strong incentive to relocate to Canada or Mexico. 
Jack Roney, director for economics and policy analysis at the sugar producers' lobbying group, the American Sugar Alliance, said sugar had been made a scapegoat by companies whose true aim was to take advantage of cheaper foreign labor. He said the average wage for American candy-industry workers was about $14 an hour, while in Mexico, candy factories paid less than $1 an hour. Energy, employee benefits and compliance with environmental rules also cost less overseas, he said.

HEADLINE: Canada Is Expected to Lower Interest Rate Today 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
The Bank of Canada is widely expected to lower its main interest rate on Tuesday, seeking to ease the pain of the strong Canadian dollar on exporters and link its economy to the recovery in the United States.
 The Canadian currency has soared from a record low of 62 cents in January 2002 to almost 79 cents last week, an increase of 27 percent. On Monday, it traded at approximately 77 cents. While much of the appreciation reflects the weak United States dollar, the Canadian currency has also been enhanced by relatively lofty domestic interest rates and a strong advance in the prices of metals and other commodities that make up a sizable portion of Canada's exports. 
 Analysts cite the buoyant currency as the chief reason for the recent slip in Canada's economic performance. After several years of growth stronger than that of the United States, the Canadian economy contracted in the second quarter as the American economy grew. In the third quarter, Canada's output rose by an annualized 1.1 percent adjusted for inflation, while in the United States the economy zipped along at an 8.2 percent clip. 
The strong currency "is starting to cut into us," said Gerald B. Fedchun, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association in Toronto, whose members export two-thirds of their production, almost all of it to the United States. 
Until recently, the Bank of Canada was optimistic that the erosion in export profits caused by the strengthening currency would be more than offset by growing demand from the United States, and that the revival there would pull Canada's economy along with it.
But David Longworth, a deputy governor at the Bank of Canada, cautioned in a speech two weeks ago that growth in the final quarter of 2003 "may be somewhat lower than we expected." He added, "We had been looking for economic growth during the last quarter of 2003 to be well above 4 percent, on an annualized basis." 
Adding weight to the calls for a rate cut, Statistics Canada reported last week that the country's trade surplus narrowed to 4.3 billion Canadian dollars in November from 5.1 billion Canadian dollars the previous month. Exports to the United States, which account for more than four-fifths of the total, shrank by 4.4 percent.
According to a poll by Reuters, 9 of Canada's 13 primary currency dealers expect the central bank to cut its overnight rate to 2.5 percent from 2.75 percent on Tuesday. Several expect a further easing at the next policy review in March. The bank last eased rates in September, and before that, in July. 
Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, a lobbying group, said in a speech in Toronto last Thursday that "the degree of confidence international investors now have in our currency and fiscal management means that the Bank of Canada has room to reduce the gap between Canadian and American interest rates." The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate is 1 percent.
But Daniel Racette, an economics professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales, part of the University of Montreal, took the view that the central bank should wait longer before easing monetary policy. The American economy "seems to be roaring," Mr. Racette said. "If it goes on roaring, it might compensate for the effect that the dollar seems to have had."
Mr. Racette cited recent strong jobs growth in Canada, with almost a quarter of a million jobs created in the final four months of 2003. The unemployment rate has dipped to 7.4 percent from 8 percent. 
Some analysts have also argued that a strong currency would help Canadian businesses become more competitive internationally by holding down the cost of imported machinery and technology.
But Mr. Fedchun of the automotive parts association noted that such benefits would not be felt for some time, while the rise in the Canadian dollar was having an immediate impact, especially on small manufacturers that have not hedged their currency exposure.
"We want interest rates to go down," Mr. Fedchun said. "We feel the Canadian dollar is stronger than it should be."
Executives in other sectors echo that sentiment. Timminco, a maker of specialty alloys based in Toronto, said last week that it was closing a plant in Ontario and laying off 50 workers because of the rise in the Canadian dollar and intensifying competition from Chinese suppliers.
Almost all of Timminco's products are exported and denominated in American dollars, said Halina B. McGregor, Timminco's chief financial officer. Illustrating the impact of the buoyant Canadian dollar on the bottom line, Ms. McGregor said that instead of getting 155 Canadian dollars for every $100 of sales, the company now received less than 130 Canadian dollars. 
"It's not just the extent of it, it's the speed," she said.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MISSOURI CONGRESSMAN; 
Gephardt's Poignant Echo at the Site of His 1988 Victory

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
On Monday night, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri came back to the Starlite Ballroom, where it all began.
 Mr. Gephardt was 47 and strawberry blond when he stood in the ballroom in 1988 and celebrated his victory in the Iowa caucuses before a delirious crowd in his first presidential campaign. He dropped out of that race later, but his victory here propelled him to the leadership of the Democratic Party in the House. 
 This time around, the ballroom was again full of friends, relatives and supporters, many of them veterans of that first campaign.
 But the magic he hoped to recreate was gone.
 Mr. Gephardt, now 62 and with silver-tinged hair, conceded his defeat in Iowa, and three campaign aides said he would drop out of the race. Mr. Gephardt implied that he was abandoning his presidential bid after a fourth-place showing in the caucuses here, and acknowledged that someone else would be the nominee. "I will support that candidate in any way that I can," he said.
 "My campaign to fight for working people may be ending tonight, but our fight will never end," he said. 
 "This didn't come out the way we wanted," he said, his voice quavering. "But I've been through tougher fights in my life."
 As he spoke, almost everyone understood that they were witnessing the likely end of the career of a man who had served as the Democratic leader in the House for 13 years, leading some of the most important legislative battles over trade, Medicare and the economy.
 Instead of heading to rallies in New Hampshire and South Carolina on Tuesday, he was scheduled to fly on Monday night to St. Louis, the city where his political career was born.
 Bob Dole, the former Senate Republican leader, said in an interview on CNN: "I feel bad for Dick Gephardt. His campaign is likely over."
 Republican leaders had described Mr. Gephardt as one of the most formidable Democratic contenders in the race. And Mr. Gephardt had hoped to repeat history by recreating the coalition of the elderly, union members and farmers who swept him to victory in Iowa in 1988. He developed a broad plan to provide universal health care to all Americans, garnered the support of 21 unions and reassembled much of his former campaign team.
 But he struggled to raise money, falling short of his goals. He repeatedly battled the perception among voters, friends and supporters that his time had come and gone. He lost one prominent endorsement after another and fought a campaign that some voters believed was too negative and that other voters believed lacked passion.
 "Dick Gephardt was one of the strongest possible contenders, not only because of his Midwestern roots, his experience in Washington, D.C., and his integrity," said Donna Brazile, who worked for his 1988 campaign and managed the Gore-Lieberman campaign in 2000. "He also had the army of organized labor, the muscle of the Democratic Party.
 "But Dick's support, in many ways, was frozen in time. He has tremendous, strong and loyal supporters. But they're the same people who embraced him in 1988, and they didn't bring their neighbors with them this time."
 Mr. Gephardt recognized early on that his 27 years in Congress might seem a disadvantage to Democratic voters. In his speech announcing his candidacy in February 2002, he acknowledged that he might not appeal to voters looking for a fresh face or "the flavor of the month."
 And on the campaign trail, he took pains not to look and sound like a Washington bureaucrat. He shed the sober business suits he typically wore on Capitol Hill in favor of V-neck sweaters and khaki trousers. He talked about growing up in the Baptist Church, about his son's battle to overcome cancer and about his own hardships growing up in an impoverished family in St. Louis.
 But he also believed that after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, his long years of experience would appeal to an electorate looking for steady hands. And so he darted through rusting industrial towns and farming communities here describing how he had fought to pass President Bill Clinton's economic plan in 1993 and to prevent Republicans from cutting Medicare in 1995.
 It was a gamble, particularly with rivals like Howard Dean, who galvanized support as a self-proclaimed outsider. But it was the only card he had to play.
 Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and an expert on Congress, said Mr. Gephardt knew, going into this race, that "he wouldn't emerge as the slam-dunk guy here." Mr. Ornstein also said that Mr. Gephardt believed he had done what he could in Congress and that it was time for him to give up the comfort of his House seat to reach for higher office.
 Brenda Thies, a 44-year-old pharmacist who attended one of Mr. Gephardt's rallies this month, said she was concerned that he was "seen as the old guard." 
 Ms. Thies said she liked his promise to provide universal health insurance and his commitment to renegotiating trade deals. But she said she worried about the viability of his candidacy. "It's not the issues this time," she said. "This time, I want someone who's going to win."
 It was a question that haunted his campaign, even in a state he had cultivated for more than a decade. 
 "He's put in so much time and effort here," said Laura Nichols, who worked for Mr. Gephardt's campaign in 1988 and served as his spokeswoman for years. "It's heartbreaking."
 In recent days, Mr. Gephardt seemed at times to sense what was coming. On Sunday, he told a crowd of supporters that he had been thinking about his life.
 "A flood of memories comes back to me now," Mr. Gephardt said as he stood on a stage flanked by his wife, Jane, his son, Matt, and his daughters, Kate and Chrissy. "I've tried to shut my eyes and just reflect on what I've done through the years."

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD; 
Navigating Berlin's Past and Its Future

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
"It's by the big balloon, not more than 500 yards from the Ritz-Carlton, but there's really nothing to see," Richard Campbell said with a discernible lack of enthusiasm. 
 At lunch in the new Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Potsdamer Platz one day last week, I had to cajole Mr. Campbell, a former United States Army intelligence officer from the cold war period who now gives historical tours of Berlin, into giving up even that sketchy detail. 
 No one in Berlin really wants to discuss the dark past these days, and who in the world can blame them? Here's a traveler who has come to town for the first time as Berlin struggles to put itself back on the map as a major destination for business travelers and tourists, and the first thing he wants to do is find the site of the bunker where Hitler killed himself in 1945 as Russian troops bore down? 
At this stage of history, Berliners are understandably reluctant to continue confronting the past. I was aware of the potential for cultural faux pas I presented in insisting on finding that one awful place.
Raffeale Sorrentino, the chief concierge at the Hotel Adlon near the Brandenburg Gate, actually pinpointed the bunker site exactly on a map for me when I stopped in for a tour of the hotel later that day. I trudged over in a gloomy drizzle and found the unmarked site just past a muddy lot on which a giant facsimile of a multicolored hot-air balloon towers over a small recreation field for children. 
The government officials and developers who want to reposition Berlin as the cultural and economic hub for middle Europe understandably cringe at these things. Berlin, they say with justification, is an exciting world capital vibrating with creative energy and economic potential just 13 years after the fall of the wall and the difficult, breathtakingly expensive reunification of Germany that ensued.
Yet I think that those who grew up in the postwar and cold war eras come here, as first timers, with a deep compulsion to experience a past that Berlin has gratefully relegated to the history books. 
One drizzly evening, for example, I walked along Friedrichstrasse to the famous Checkpoint Charlie site where American and East German forces once stared down one another at the Berlin Wall, initially feeling very John le Carre in my drab olive trench coat, vintage Macy's 1985. But by the time I reached the sandbags on an island in the middle of the street at the recreated checkpoint guardhouse, I was feeling more like an ill-dressed rube wandering past the high-fashion boutiques and flashy restaurants that now dominate the once-forlorn East German neighborhood. 
This underscored the new reality for me. While the city struggles with 18 percent unemployment, tourism officials are seeking recognition among potential visitors that Berlin, at staggering economic expense since unification, has emerged from the past to claim its place among the great global capitals. The opening of the luxury 302-room Ritz-Carlton Hotel last week with a black-tie reception was seen as merely the most recent evidence of that.
Berlin now has 70,000 hotel rooms, twice the number of a decade ago, said Hanns P. Nerger, the president of Berlin Tourism Marketing, the city's tourism agency. Another 10,000 rooms are "in the pipeline," he said. Many of those new rooms, like the Ritz-Carlton's, are concentrated in the top echelon of hotels, he added. From the local hoteliers' perspective, "the biggest problem is the tough competition" for customers among the luxury hotels like the Adlon, the Ritz-Carlton and the Four Seasons.
One consequence is you can find a great hotel here at a very good price. In 2002, for example, the average room rate for four-star and five-star hotels in Berlin was about $140, well below that in London (about $350) and in other cities including Paris, Milan, Rome, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Madrid, according to a survey cited by the tourist board.
The past, meanwhile, continues fading into the mist. In October, Tempelhof Airport, a haunting example of colossal Nazi architecture in the middle of the city and a relic of the cold war Berlin airlift, will close forever, said Burkhard Kieker, the director for information and marketing for Berlin International Airports.
A vast expansion of the outlying Schonefeld Airport is about to begin. When the new Schonefeld -- rechristened as Berlin Brandenburg International Airport -- opens in about six years, Tegel Airport, which is now Berlin's main international airport, will also be shut. Now a center for short-haul holiday flights among the low-cost carriers, Schonefeld is being rebuilt as a major hub - with high-speed train links as alternatives to flying for trips of three hours and less.
The airport project will bring in 20,000 jobs, Mr. Kieker said. Just the news that such an effort is under way, he added, would probably attract renewed interest among world airlines in re-establishing Berlin as a major destination for overseas business and leisure travelers.
Astonishingly, the capital of Germany does not offer nonstop fights to and from the United States, not even on Lufthansa. 
"No one can believe it," Mr. Kieker said. "Lufthansa canceled its daily nonstop Berlin-Washington-Berlin service the day after Sept. 11." American carriers, which then had been reconsidering opening nonstop routes that were abandoned in the early 1990's, "postponed their plans," he said.
"We are quite confident, however, that there will be American carriers flying nonstop routes" to and from Berlin by next year, Mr. Kieker said.

HEADLINE: Going For Broke 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
According to advance reports, George Bush will use tonight's State of the Union speech to portray himself as a visionary leader who stands above the political fray. But that act is losing its effectiveness. Mr. Bush's relentless partisanship has depleted much of the immense good will he enjoyed after 9/11. He is still adored by his base, but he is deeply distrusted by much of the nation.
 Mr. Bush may not understand this; indeed, he still seems to think that he's another Lincoln or F.D.R. "No president has done more for human rights than I have," he told Ken Auletta. 
 But his political handlers seem to have decided on a go-for-broke strategy: confuse the middle one last time, energize the base and grab enough power that the consequences don't matter. 
What do I mean by confusing the middle? The striking thing about the "visionary" proposals floated in advance of the State of the Union is their transparent cynicism and lack of realism. Mr. Bush has, of course, literally promised us the Moon -- and Mars, too. And the ever-deferential media have managed to keep a straight face.
But that's just the most dramatic example of an array of policy proposals that don't withstand even minimal scrutiny. Mr. Bush has already pushed through an expensive new Medicare benefit -- without any visible source of financing. Reports say that tonight he'll propose additional, and even more expensive, new initiatives, like partial Social Security privatization -- which all by itself would require at least $1 trillion in extra funds over the next decade. Where is all this money going to come from? 
Judging from the latest CBS/New York Times Poll, these promises of something for nothing aren't likely to convince many people. It's not just that the bounce from Saddam's capture has already gone away. Unfavorable views of Mr. Bush as a person have reached record levels for his presidency. It seems fair to say that many Americans, like most of the rest of the world, simply don't trust him anymore. 
But some Americans will respond to upbeat messages, no matter how unrealistic. And that may be enough for Mr. Bush, because while he poses as someone above the fray, he is continuing to solidify his base.
The most sinister example was the recess appointment of Charles Pickering Sr., with his segregationist past and questionable record on voting rights, to the federal appeals court -- the day after Martin Luther King's actual birthday. Was this careless timing? Don't be silly: it was a deliberate, if subtle, gesture of sympathy with a part of the Republican coalition that never gets mentioned in public.
A less objectionable but equally calculated gesture will be Mr. Bush's demand that his tax cuts be made permanent. Realistically, this can't make any difference to the economy now, and it makes no sense, given the array of new spending plans he will simultaneously unveil. But it's a signal to the base that any seeming moderation needn't be taken seriously, and that the administration's hard-right turn will continue. 
Meanwhile, the lying has already begun, with the Republican National Committee's willful misrepresentation of Wesley Clark's prewar statements. (Why are news organizations letting them get away with this?)
The question we should ask is, Where is all this leading?
Some cynical pundits think that Mr. Bush's advisers plan to leave the hard work of dealing with the mess he's made to future presidents. But I don't think that's right. I can't see how the budget can continue along its current path through a second Bush term -- financial markets won't stand for it.
And what about the growing military crisis? The mess in Iraq has placed our volunteer military, a magnificent but fragile institution, under immense strain. National Guard and Reserve members find themselves effectively drafted as full-time soldiers. More than 40,000 soldiers whose enlistment terms have expired have been kept from leaving under "stop loss" orders. This can't go on for four more years.
Karl Rove and other insiders must know all this. So they must figure that once they have won the election, they will have such a complete lock on power that they can break many of their promises with impunity.
What will they do with that lock on power? Their election strategy -- confuse the middle, but feed the base -- suggests the answer.

HEADLINE: Banker Faces German Court Over Pay Issue 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
The gavel is not falling just on executives in the United States.
 On Wednesday, as jury selection in the trial of Martha Stewart begins in New York, a German court will open proceedings against Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, and three other former directors of a telecommunications conglomerate, on charges that they approved the payment of improper bonuses to its executives. 
 Germans are likely to watch Mr. Ackermann's legal battle every bit as avidly as Americans track Ms. Stewart's securities fraud trial. In some ways, the stakes for German industry are higher. 
Mr. Ackermann is, by dint of his position, the most powerful banker in Germany. Unlike several American executives who face trial in the coming weeks, he remains on the job and in charge.
Deutsche Bank, which has backed him to the hilt, is fitting out an office near the court in Dusseldorf, so Mr. Ackermann can work between the twice-weekly hearings. On Thursday, after court adjourns, he will fly to Davos, Switzerland, to attend the annual World Economic Forum.
Behind this show of confidence lie grave risks for Mr. Ackermann and Deutsche Bank. A guilty verdict would almost certainly force him to step down, not to mention expose him to fines and a jail sentence of as much as 10 years. It would also leave Germany's flagship bank leaderless at the very moment that the banking industry is entering a period of likely consolidation.
The trial, which grew out of the takeover of the conglomerate, Mannesmann, by Vodafone of Britain in 2000, has become something of a referendum on whether executive pay in Germany has spun out of control. The political backdrop could add to the uncertainty of the proceedings.
"Germans have to decide, 'What kind of a system do we want in our country?"' said Marcus Lutter, a professor of law and an expert in corporate governance at the University of Bonn. "It's unfortunate that we have to decide this social question in a criminal court."
At issue is whether Mr. Ackermann and other directors of Mannesmann violated the trust of shareholders by awarding 57 million euros ($70 million) in severance and bonuses to Klaus Esser, Mannesmann's chief executive, and other senior managers. Mr. Esser and the former personnel manager of Mannesmann are also on trial.
Such payments would not raise eyebrows in the United States. But in Germany, where as recently as the mid-1990's, few chief executives made more than $500,000 a year, they have become a scandal. 
The timing of the payments also raised questions, because they came soon after Mannesmann accepted a $183 billion bid by Vodafone. Prosecutors initially tried to claim that Mr. Esser and his team received the payments in return for dropping their resistance to Vodafone.
But prosecutors later shelved the idea of a conspiracy for a more straightforward argument that the payments violated the trust of shareholders because they enriched the recipients and did not help Mannesmann.
For all the talk about the 57 million euros, legal experts said the amount of the compensation will not be at the heart of the case. Rather, the panel of judges, led by Judge Brigitte Koppenhofer, is expected to question the motives and competence of the board members.
"This is a question of business judgment," said Theodor Baums, an expert in corporate governance at Goethe University in Frankfurt. "The judges will ask, 'Was the board competent? Was this a self-interested decision? Can they show reasonable grounds for making this decision?"'
Professor Baums, who acted as a legal adviser to Vodafone, said the provisions in German corporate law about executive compensation were vague, stipulating only that it be "adequate" to the tasks performed. He predicted it would be difficult to find the board members guilty.
Mr. Ackermann's lawyer, Eberhard Kempf, said he would argue that his client approved the payout to Mr. Esser and other managers because they had sharply increased the value of Mannesmann.
"Esser achieved an extraordinary success for the company, and therefore, Esser deserved an extraordinary reward," Mr. Kempf said in an interview. "Actually, I think it's a fairly simple case."
Mr. Kempf has been in the middle of many prominent cases. In 1995, he defended Nicholas W. Leeson, the rogue trader who helped bring down the British merchant bank Barings, when he tried to avoid extradition to Singapore. He also represented the von Metzler banking family, whose 11-year-old son was kidnapped and murdered here in 2002.
For Deutsche Bank, the legal bills are worth the money. Losing Mr. Ackermann, a 55-year-old Swiss-born investment banker, could leave the bank adrift at an awkward time, analysts said.
After the deepest downturn since World War II, German banks are positioning themselves for a wave of consolidation. Speculation about mergers, as well as takeovers by foreign giants like Citigroup or the Royal Bank of Scotland, surface daily in Frankfurt's banking circles.
Executives at Deutsche Bank dispute the suggestion that Mr. Ackermann's legal troubles would leave the bank flat-footed. "He has a very capable management team, with 11 executive board members," a spokesman, Detlev Rahmsdorf, said. "We're a very big institution, so we don't depend on one person."
But Deutsche Bank has had to devote resources to another legal battle, involving Mr. Ackermann's predecessor, Rolf E. Breuer. The fallen German media tycoon, Leo Kirch, sued Mr. Breuer last week in a New York State court, contending that Mr. Kirch had conspired with John C. Malone, the American cable television magnate, to destroy Mr. Kirch's media empire.
The goal, Mr. Kirch's lawyers say, was to carve up the Kirch Group's cable assets, giving Mr. Malone's Liberty Media control of the German cable market, and Deutsche Bank investment banking fees.
Mr. Rahmsdorf dismissed the charges as "totally absurd." 
"Dr. Breuer and Mr. Malone have never met and never talked to each other," he said. "There is no relationship whatsoever."
While the legal squabble with Mr. Kirch is a distraction, Mr. Ackermann's trial goes to the heart of German corporate culture -- and to the kind of globally competitive bank he is trying to build.
At a Deutsche Bank presentation last February, Mr. Ackermann put his case in a national context -- arguing that it was less about ethics than about a destructive bias against corporate executives in Germany. He said it could jeopardize the country's place in the global economy. 
"The best Germans don't want to work here," Mr. Ackermann said. "They want to work in London or New York."
But some reject the argument that the Mannesmann case is that much of a litmus test. Jurgen Kurz, a spokesman for one of Germany's largest shareholder-rights associations, said many of the issues raised had already been thoroughly debated. 
The case, Mr. Kurz said, also lacks an obvious victim. "The shareholders earned a lot of money out of Mannesmann," he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 21, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the opening of court proceedings in Germany against Josef Ackermann, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, referred incorrectly to a lawsuit brought byLeo Kirch, the fallen German media baron, against Mr. Ackermann's predecessor, Rolf E. Breuer. It contends that Mr. Breuer, not Mr. Kirch, conspired to destroy Mr. Kirch's media empire.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Is It the Sale of a Media Empire, Or a Desperate Negotiating Ploy?

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Is this a sale, or is it a final negotiating ploy from a man who never thought he could lose control of his press empire but ran into a buzz saw of opposition that culminated in an American court's stripping him of the right to use his controlling stake for his own purposes?
 Rarely has an announced sale of control of a company seemed more dubious than the one announced Sunday by Conrad M. Black to bring in David and Frederick Barclay, twin brothers who control their own privately held media empire. 
 The "irrevocable agreement" would give the Barclays control of the holding company. A United States court on Friday, however, blocked Lord Black from exercising the fruits of that control, and the company the Barclays agreed to buy is a defendant in a case that could cost them more than they have already agreed to pay. 
If that deal goes through as planned, the Barclay brothers would wind up with ownership of Hollinger Inc., the Canadian company that, through super-majority voting rights, had control of Hollinger International, the American company that owns The Daily Telegraph of London, as well as The Chicago Sun-Times and The Jerusalem Post.
The deal calls for the Barclays to pay the equivalent of $326 million to buy the controlling stake in Hollinger Inc. held by the Ravelston Corporation, a holding company controlled by Lord Black and his associates, and to buy the public shares of the Canadian company. Yesterday, the shares of Hollinger Inc. that trade in Toronto rose 3.79 Canadian dollars, to 7.69. The Barclays are offering 8.55 Canadian dollars for each of them. 
The lawsuit from Hollinger International seeks more than $200 million, plus interest over 10 years that could double the amount, and names the Canadian company among the defendants. A claim is not a verdict, of course, but the Barclays must know that to complete the deal without a settlement of that suit would be to take substantial risks.
The sale can be seen as Lord Black's playing of his final card: his willingness to go away and leave the company he founded and ran with an imperial will even as his own economic stake in the enterprise was diluted through a pyramidlike control structure.
He may hope the prospect of his departure will be so tantalizing that the company's directors will be willing to negotiate a quick and favorable settlement. Alternatively, he may hope that the directors will fear that he will be out of their reach and the court's jurisdiction once the deal is completed and, for that reason, will settle. Or he may hope to grab the money before the United States courts can act. 
Yesterday, he asked a Canadian court to declare that the deal with the Barclays was effective and binding. He may now regret having made Hollinger International a Delaware company, subject to United States law. But he did not do that to Hollinger Inc., and it is through selling that stake that he hopes to cash out.
The Web site of the company Lord Black founded still bears a slogan that no longer sounds as pretentious as it might have: "Hollinger. Making News." But the news on the Web site is of the deal with the Barclays and the lawsuit filed by the company against Lord Black.
That suit contends that so-called noncompete payments made to Lord Black and his associates after the company sold subsidiaries were illegal even when they were approved by the board, arguing that under Delaware law a controlling shareholder has a fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of the company. Similarly, it argues that Lord Black and his associates were drastically overpaid through a complicated management arrangement and asks for the return of a substantial part of that money.
That lawsuit includes an excerpt from an e-mail message that Lord Black sent to an associate in the summer of 2002, when the company was under attack but he never thought he could lose control involuntarily. "There has not been an occasion for many months when I got on our plane without wondering whether it was really affordable," the excerpt reads.
"But I'm not prepared to re-enact the French Revolutionary renunciation of the rights of nobility. We have to find a balance between an unfair taxation on the company and a reasonable treatment of the founder-builders-managers. We are proprietors, after all, beleaguered though we may be."
Lord Black owns a 65 percent stake in Ravelston, whose other shares were owned by colleagues. Ravelston in turn owns 78 percent of Hollinger Inc., the Canadian company. It owns 30 percent of Hollinger International, but it has 73 percent of the voting power because of super-voting shares.
Cut through all that, and Lord Black's stake in Hollinger International was just 15 percent. But he did not view that as limiting his rights.
"These companies have always been run in the Argus tradition of proprietary businesses where the controlling shareholders take reasonable steps to ensure their comfortable enjoyment of the position they (we, in fact) have created for themselves," Lord Black wrote in a letter to fellow Ravelston owners in the fall of 2002 referring to one of his previous companies, as disclosed in the Hollinger suit.
"Care must be taken not to allow this to degenerate into decadence," he added. But things have slid from Lord Black's control. A board committee of Hollinger International was allowed to investigate, and it named Richard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to do the investigation. On Friday, aware of behind-the-scenes maneuvers, the S.E.C. persuaded a federal judge in Chicago to rule that Mr. Breeden would take control of the company if Lord Black did anything to alter the power of the existing board.
Thus there is a real question whether the Barclays will get the control of Hollinger International that they bargained for, if and when the deal is completed.
Mr. Breeden and his colleagues might even try to sell Hollinger's assets, giving the Barclays their share of the proceeds after deducting any damages the company could win.
In any case, the divine right of proprietors, as Black's management theory might be known, seems unlikely to pass to his chosen buyers.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE NORTH CAROLINA SENATOR; 
In Iowa, Edwards Counts The Reasons to Be Upbeat

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
He came in second, but it may as well have been first.
 John Edwards bounded into a hotel ballroom, charging down an elevated runway and crouching to slap every hand he could with a grin. 
 "I came here a year ago with a belief we could change the country," Senator Edwards said, his voice hoarse from days of relentless campaigning, "with a belief in the possibility, with a belief the politics of hope could overcome the politics of cynicism. The people of Iowa confirmed their belief in this positive, uplifting vision of America." 
Barely 10 minutes later, after an abbreviated stump speech and a confetti drop, Mr. Edwards worked his way through the crowd toward a plane waiting to whisk him to New Hampshire.
A couple of hours earlier, in his suite at the Savery Hotel here, Mr. Edwards sat with his wife, Elizabeth, at his side and spoke with reporters eager to know how he would use his strong showing in the Iowa caucuses in the races ahead.
The North Carolina senator seemed to serve notice on Gen. Wesley K. Clark, a native of Arkansas who is enjoying his own surge in New Hampshire, that he would challenge him in his home region of the South. 
 "I grew up in the South," Mr. Edwards said. "I grew up in the rural South, I was elected in a tough Southern state and have spent my time in the Senate dealing every single day with the problems of a Southern state, with job loss, with the rural economy, all of the problems that affect people in Southern states." 
"General Clark," he added, "comes from a different place."
 Asked whether he and General Clark were headed for a showdown in Southern primaries, Mr. Edwards responded, "If I'm not mistaken, he has never had a vote cast for him."
 At another point, he took on both General Clark and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut for skipping Iowa to focus on New Hampshire.
"General Clark and Joe Lieberman decided they couldn't compete here," Mr. Edwards said. "Remember when they withdrew from here they were both at about the same place I was. I didn't walk away. I stayed here and fought."
 But much of theevening was devoted to celebration. Mr. Edwards ate fast-food as he watched the results come in on television. 
 For months, Mr. Edwards had been far behind in the polls, and even before the results were known, his campaign was proclaiming the caucuses a victory of sorts. His 11th-hour surge and an endorsement by the state's largest newspaper, The Des Moines Register, surprised even Mr. Edwards and drew fresh attention to a candidate often given short shrift by his competitors.
With Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, and other top contenders attacking one another on the stump and in television commercials, Mr. Edwards, a first-term senator, stressed the positive, warning last month in a speech in San Francisco, "If all we are in 2004 is a party of anger, we can't win."
As the campaign here turned harsher, he stayed above the fray. The positive tone drew voters who said they were fed up with the vitriol and helped win The Register endorsement, which gave his campaign a lift when it needed it most. The resulting surge raised the morale of staff members and, his aides anticipate, will loosen the wallets of contributors to a campaign that is at a serious financial disadvantage to Dr. Dean, Mr. Kerry and General Clark.
"No matter the outcome of the voting tonight in Iowa, my campaign is a winner, and we have come this distance because of your support," Mr. Edwards said in an e-mail message to supporters asking them to contribute again or, if they have reached the $2,000 donation limit, to ask friends and family members to give. "We need to keep that momentum going as I head into New Hampshire and South Carolina."
Mr. Edwards, who had issued a plea for contributions in the final hours before the caucuses, said his surge had already helped boost his coffers in the past few days.
 "Whereas a month ago I would make calls -- people were nice and friendly and some people would raise money -- now they call us back multiple times," he said. "They're excited about being on board. It's a different response."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW; 
KERRY WINS THE IOWA CAUCUSES; DEAN 3RD, FAR BEHIND EDWARDS

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts won the Iowa caucuses here Monday, brushing aside the insurgent anti-war candidacy of Howard Dean by presenting himself as the strongest Democrat his party had to send up against President Bush next year.
 Senator John Edwards of North Carolina came in second, catapulting him into the first tier of presidential contenders. In the process, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry pushed Dr. Dean -- who just a week ago was confidently preparing for a victory celebration here -- into third place. 
 Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri finished fourth, a devastating showing that led him to end his second bid for the presidency. Mr. Gephardt's aides said that on Tuesday morning he was flying not to New Hampshire, where he had been scheduled to hold a Countdown to Victory Kickoff Rally in Manchester, but home to St. Louis. 
It was a much happier night for Mr. Kerry, who only weeks ago was battling the perception among many of his own supporters that his campaign might not even make it to New Hampshire.
"We came from behind and we came for the fight," Mr. Kerry said, after his fellow Massachusetts senator, Edward M. Kennedy, had, inevitably, proclaimed him the Comeback Kid of 2004.
"And now," Mr. Kerry said, "I have a special message for the special interests that have a home in the Bush White House: We're coming, you're going, and don't let the door hit you on the way out."
With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Kerry had nearly 38 percent of the delegate support awarded in the caucuses; Mr. Edwards, 32 percent; Dr. Dean, 18 percent; Mr. Gephardt, 10 percent; and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, 1 percent. 
More than 120,000 people participated, approaching the record of roughly 125,000 reported for the 1988 caucuses.
Dr. Dean conceded even as Iowans were voting, and when less than half the vote had been reported.
"I'm delighted to finish in the top three," Dr. Dean said in an interview with Larry King on CNN. "On to New Hampshire."
At a rally later Monday evening, Dr. Dean -- his sleeves rolled up, bellowing to the crowd and smiling as if had in fact won the race -- celebrated his showing.
"If you had told us one year ago that we were going to come in third in Iowa, we would have given everything to that," he said.
Still, by any measure, the result was a serious setback for Dr. Dean, who had campaigned intensely across this state for more than a year. It was a clear disappointment to a candidate whose aides were talking openly about rolling up back-to-back victories in New Hampshire and Iowa, and wrapping up the nomination before Valentine's Day. 
A survey of voters entering the caucus sites Monday suggested that what had been Dr. Dean's central appeal -- his opposition to the war in Iraq -- did him little good on Monday night. Just 14 percent said the war in Iraq had shaped their final decision, even though 75 percent said they opposed the war.
Dr. Dean's showing also raised questions about what had been one of the most intriguing elements of the Dean candidacy: that he had recruited thousands of first-time voters who could transform the nature of American presidential politics. Although half the voters on Monday were attending their first Iowa caucuses, 36 percent voted for Mr. Kerry, compared with 22 percent for Dr. Dean and 24 percent for Mr. Edwards.
Mr. Kerry's victory would seem to validate the thoroughly unconventional campaign tack he took: to come to Iowa to reinvigorate a candidacy that had been languishing in New Hampshire, and use an unexpected victory to power him back to life in his neighboring state.
His showing here gave him a huge lift as he headed back to New Hampshire to confront the candidacy of Gen. Wesley K. Clark and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
The day also delivered a big and unexpected victory for Mr. Edwards, who seemed delighted if a bit surprised by the outcome Monday. He said he believed that voters had responded to what he described as his relentlessly cheerful message, drawing an unstated but obvious contrast with Dr. Dean.
"The people of Iowa tonight confirmed that they believe in a positive, uplifting vision to change America," Mr. Edwards said. "We have started a movement to change this country that will sweep across America."
The vote here served to do what Iowa caucuses traditionally do: reduce the size of a large field. In this case, three candidates -- Mr. Kerry, Mr. Edwards and Dr. Dean -- flew out of Des Moines for New Hampshire, in what looms as an extremely competitive and pivotal fight.
Waiting for them there were General Clark and Mr. Lieberman, both of whom decided to skip Iowa, where they expected to lose. General Clark had planned for a two-way contest with Dr. Dean, and seemed surprised by the way Iowa had reshaped the fight in New Hampshire.
"I don't know what to call it now," he said.
The race now includes four or five potentially viable candidate, including two -- Mr. Kerry and Dr. Dean -- who live in neighboring states. What is more, both Mr. Kerry and Dr. Dean have decided to opt out of the federal campaign financing system, meaning they will not fall under the spending limits that are imposed on candidates who stayed in the system.
Iowans who voted in the caucuses were far more likely to cite health care and the economy than the war in Iraq as their most pressing concerns in this election, even after a year in which the war significantly shaped the Democratic presidential contest, according to the surveys of voters entering caucus sites.
Dr. Dean won barely half the support of voters who called the war their top priority. And Mr. Kerry did better than Dr. Dean even among opponents of the war, even though in Congress Mr. Kerry voted for the resolution authorizing the war.
The survey found that the caucuses, the most competitive Democratic contest this state has had in at least 16 years, produced a spike of new interest, with about half of caucusgoers saying they were attending their first. At the same time, the survey confirmed what voters here and in New Hampshire have repeatedly said from the start: that defeating President Bush is a top priority for Democratic voters this year.
More than a quarter described electability -- the issue that was at the heart of Mr. Kerry's campaign in Iowa and is at the heart of General Clark's appeal in New Hampshire -- as a crucial consideration in their vote. Among those voters, Mr. Kerry drew 37 percent, compared with 21 percent for Dr. Dean. Mr. Edwards drew the support of 30 percent of those voters.
The survey also suggested that the central theme of Mr. Gephardt's appeal -- pledging to fight against overly liberal trade agreements -- did not fare well. Barely five percent of voters named that as their top issue; and he won the support of less than a quarter of union households.
In a speech Monday night, Mr. Gephardt seemed resigned to his loss. 
"Life will go on because this campaign was never about me, it was about all of us," he said as his wife, Jane, gazed sadly on her husband.
Among elderly voters, a critical contingent in Iowa and another constituency sought by Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Kerry won the support of about one-third, compared with about one-quarter for Mr. Gephardt. The elderly made up one-third of the electorate.
The survey also reflected the extent to which the election shifted in the final week: almost half of Mr. Kerry's supporters and half of Mr. Edwards's said they decided to support their candidate in the last week. By contrast, just a third of Dr. Dean's supporters made their decision in the final days of the campaign, suggesting the extent to which Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry won the undecided vote.
The survey of 1,659 participants as they arrived Monday night for the caucuses in 50 precincts throughout the state was conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool of the networks and The Associated Press. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
As the caucuses opened, some of the sites were packed, with some voters saying they had not quite made up their minds about what to do, reflecting what many Democrats have said was the extraordinary volatility of this contest.
In Waukee, a Des Moines suburb, Terry Meyer, a retired computer systems analyst, said as he walked into his caucus site that he was leaning toward Mr. Kerry, that he thought Mr. Kerry had the best chance of defeating President Bush.
"Really, the man whose ideas I really like and who I was torn between is Kucinich," he said. "But now that he's not really so much of a factor, I think I might go over to Kerry."
"I just think that Kerry has more experience and the better chance," he said.
In Indianola, Larry Buttrey, 62, a retired machinist, said he was leaning toward Mr. Edwards, citing the very thing that Mr. Edwards had emphasized to differentiate himself: that he was trying to avoid attacking his opponents.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Kerry canceled appearances at several rallies around Des Moines so he could rest a voice that was almost gone after a week of campaigning, though he fit in one appearance at Ames High School.
"We in Iowa are marking the beginning of the end of the Bush presidency," he said to a loud ovation. "That's what this is about."
Leaving Ames, where he addressed 500 people jammed into a high school cafeteria, he told an aide, "Ifeel like a new man."

How the Poll Was Conducted
The caucus day poll was based on questionnaires completed by voters on Monday evening as they entered Democratic caucus locations throughout Iowa.
The poll was conducted by Edison Media Research of Somerville, N.J. and Mitofsky International of New York City for the National Election Pool which consists of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, and NBC News.
The results are based on 1,660 voters in 50 randomly selected caucus sites, interviewed as they were entering each site. 
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus 4 percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who participated in the Iowa Democratic caucuses.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on caucus day, like some voters changing their minds after they enter the caucus, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

 Jury Selection to Begin In Martha Stewart Trial
Jury selection begins today in the federal trial of Martha Stewart, who is charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice and securities fraud, all stemming from a 2001 stock trade.
 At one point last fall, jury experts and public relations advisers convened focus groups in Manhattan on Ms. Stewart's behalf to assess reactions to the allegations against her while her lawyer looked on. The focus groups were part of a million-dollar campaign that also includes polling, a Web site devoted to her side of the story and two carefully planned television interviews that allowed Ms. Stewart to assert her innocence to large audiences.

The Widening of America, or How Size 4 Became a Size 0

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
Last fall, I was thrilled to find a pair of size 0 cotton stretch slacks that fit perfectly. Now, I have never been a 0, not since puberty anyway. I am, at best, a size 4, which is two sizes smaller than what I wore at the same weight in the 1970's. What has happened? Size inflation, that's what.
 Women -- and men -- who have packed on the pounds want to be able to wear the same sizes they wore in their trimmer days years ago. So the fashion industry accommodated, with today's size 4 fitting like former size 8, 8 like 12, 12 like 16 and so forth. 
 Men's slacks once labeled "regular" are now "slim cut," and for those who cannot squeeze into those, there are easy fit, loose fit and baggy fit. Greg Critser, in his illuminating book "Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World" (Mariner Books paperback, $13), points out, "The new cuts were in reality simply bigger sizes, without the bigger numbers." 
New Yorkers complain that the subway cars, many of them made in Japan, can seat one-third fewer people than they were meant to. Why? Because the typical seated American covers a lot more bench than a Japanese commuter. In response to a complaint from an oversize customer, the president of the Olive Garden restaurant chain ordered bigger chairs, lest the biggest eaters decide to dine elsewhere.
Americans live in a land of abundance where supersizing can be a necessity if you want to stay in business, be it movie theater popcorn, fast food, soft drinks or automobiles. A McDonald's meal that once had 540 calories now packs in 1,550. The items are the same, but the portions have tripled. And studies have shown that even if people are satisfied with less, they will eat more if portions are larger.
Even dieters, it seems, want to eat as much as they can without having to pay a caloric price for their indulgence. How else can anyone explain the enormous popularity of Atkins-like diets that promise weight loss without deprivation as long as the dieter sticks to a low-carbohydrate regimen -- as many cheeseburgers as wanted, but without buns or ketchup; bacon and sausage with the cheese omelet but no toast; and gobs of fatty dressing on the salad but no croutons.
People do lose weight on these diets. How? Because they eat less than they did before (as one lapsed Atkins dieter remarked, "What's a burger without a bun?"). Because they cannot indulge in 400-calorie bagels, 600-calorie muffins, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Haagen-Dazs ice cream, pies, cakes, cookies or even rice, pasta, bread or potatoes. Nor can they grab a candy bar or down a sugary soda when the snack bug bites.
A healthy body does not waste calories. If you eat them, they count, and if you eat more calories than you use, you gain weight, not lose it, no matter what the contents of the diet.

Children at Risk
With each consecutive survey, the number of overweight Americans increases. More than 60 percent of adults and 20 percent of children are now overweight or obese. When will it end? Not soon, if dietary habits and sedentary trends continue.
In a national study of 6,212 children and adolescents published in the current issue of the journal Pediatrics, researchers at the Agriculture Department and the Harvard Medical School found that on a typical day 30.3 percent of the people surveyed reported eating fast food. The people who ate fast food that day consumed 187 more calories, 9 more grams of fat, 26 more grams of added sugars, 228 more grams of sugar-sweetened drinks and less fiber, milk, fruits and nonstarchy vegetables than youngsters who did not eat fast food that day.
 Not only did the fast-food eaters consume more calories, but they also ate fewer health-sustaining nutrients.
As Mr. Critser points out, schools from kindergarten through college are complicit in the galloping epidemic of obesity. Overburdened and underfinanced school systems throughout the country have invited fast-food purveyors and soft-drink vending machines to their premises, often with monetary or equipment kickbacks from the producers.
The push to raise academic scores has squeezed out many physical education programs and athletic activities, not to mention art and music. After school outdoor activities have yielded to computers, video games and television, the modern-day baby sitters. A result is increasing numbers of youngsters who are eating more and moving less -- and putting on fat cells that will be with them for life.
I am often asked why the food industry produces so many products that can undermine health. The answer is simple. Because people buy them. Any food item that does not sell soon disappears from the marketplace. The industry supplies what consumers demand. If more people eating fast food choose salads over fries, the salad choices in those establishments will increase.
If parents unite and demand a change in school lunch offerings or if more children take lunch from home, childhood nutrition will improve. Parents must remind school authorities that a sound mind has to reside in a sound body; children's physical development should not be sacrificed to academic scores.

After-School Answers
With both parents working outside the home, children are often confined indoors after school for safety reasons. How about getting together with a number of parents to form an after-school group supervised by a jointly hired attendant who will keep the kids moving, indoors or out? Communities might also unite to press for construction of safe activity centers, exercise tracks, hiking and biking trails and community pools.
Many revisions may also be needed in the home. Cupboards, refrigerators and freezers stocked with high-calorie treats do no one any favors. 
My sons grew up without sodas, cookies, candy, cake or chips as household staples, and to this day rarely consume them. Better to save such purchases for special occasions and buy only enough to suit those occasions. If necessary, divvy up leftovers among the guests or donate them to a local shelter or feeding station for the homeless. 
If ice cream is a household necessity, choose a store brand "light" ice cream or, better yet, frozen yogurt, which has less fat and about half the calories of the high-fat ice creams. Check the nutrition label before buying and note that the calorie count applies to a half-cup serving, not a soup bowl full.
Start putting pressure on the big food companies and fast food chains. Write to corporate headquarters about nutrition concerns and, if possible, offer suggestions for alternative products and urge a reduction in portion sizes. You might also voice your support for a tax on snack items and a ban on television advertising on children's programs for nutritionally questionable foods, for example, those that exceed a certain fat or sugar ratio to healthful nutrients.
The recent suits by obese youngsters against McDonald's may sound laughable, because no one forced the youngsters to eat that fattening fare. But the negative publicity that the suits attract to the company's high-calorie offerings may help others stop eating them before they, too, balloon into obesity. Look what citizens' suits against tobacco companies have wrought. 
An end result may be legislation that requires food companies to advertise healthy eating plans. Currently, Mr. Critser points out, "the soft drink industry alone spends upward of $600 million annually to promote its trash, compared with the National Cancer Institute's paltry $1 million budget for promoting fruit and vegetable consumption."

HEADLINE: Japan Deems Beef Standards Lax in Canada and U.S. 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
A Japanese team that returned on Monday from a mission to investigate the first confirmed case of mad cow disease in the United States warned that American and Canadian cows continued to be vulnerable to an outbreak of the illness.
 Japan, the world's largest buyer of American beef, banned imports from the United States last month after a cow infected with the disease was found in Washington State. Canadian beef was banned seven months earlier, when an infected cow was found there. 
 American and Canadian officials, as well as industry representatives, are pressing Japan to drop the prohibition, saying their beef products are safe. 
The cow found with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or B.S.E., was imported from Canada.
"It cannot be guaranteed that there will not be a recurrence of B.S.E. in the United States," the five-member Japanese team said in its report.
The report cited the close links between the American and Canadian beef industries. Washington restricted Canadian cattle and beef after the case there in May.
Mad cow disease is a public health concern because scientists theorize that people who eat brain or spinal material from infected cattle can develop variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The incurable disease was faulted for 143 deaths in the 1980's in Britain during an outbreak of mad cow disease.
More than 30 countries closed their borders to American beef last month. Japan had been the top importer of American beef, buying $1 billion a year. It also imported $55 million worth of Canadian beef in 2002 before halting trade in May.
The sharp drop in beef supplies has sent domestic and imported beef prices soaring in Japan. The Agriculture Ministry said on Monday that retail prices reached a record last week since it began monitoring prices in August.
Tokyo has scrambled to make up for the shortfalls, sending delegations to try to obtain additional beef from Australia and New Zealand. 
Japan tests all the 1.3 million head of cattle that it slaughters every year, and it presses beef-exporters to adopt similar safeguards.
While acknowledging the new safety measures, the traveling team said the threat of further infections remained, according to Shukichi Kugita, a representative of the Agriculture Ministry. 
"U.S. safety measures compared to those of Japan are inadequate," Mr. Kugita said, citing the continued use of feed containing protein or bone meal.
Mad cow disease is believed to spread by recycling meat and bones from infected animals back into cattle feed. The United States banned the use of so-called downer cows, animals too ill to walk, to be used as meat. The government allows many bones and tissue to be fed to other livestock.
"The threat of cross-contamination remains," Mr. Kugita said, "because such feed can inadvertently get mixed up on farms."

Mets Seem to Pay Price No Matter Their Choice

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
OTHER owners, those in Oakland and Pittsburgh, for example, do not feel sorry for Fred Wilpon, but they do not envy him either. Trying to keep up with George Steinbrenner cannot be fun for anyone.
 That is one of the Mets' two tasks, probably the more troublesome of the two because of the city they share. 
 The other chore is keeping up with the rest of the National League East, not to mention the entire National League. 
The Mets have sporadically done a good job of the latter, most recently in 2000, but they have encountered such deep potholes since then that the 2000 World Series is a distant, almost forgotten, memory. As a result, the Mets generally and Wilpon specifically have faced severe criticism for their way of operating.
The Mets, on an off-season basis, will try to dilute that criticism with their winter fan caravan, beginning today in Manhattan. Friendly words, however, will not match results on the field, beginning in April. 
Most recently, the Mets' lukewarm pursuit of Vladimir Guerrero roused the negative passions of their fans. Here was one of the best players in major league baseball available to any team that desired him, and the Mets, seriously needing a right fielder, which Guerrero just happens to be, made him an offer he could easily refuse.
Had the Yankees needed a right fielder and a hitter of Guerrero's stature, the Mets' critics believe, Steinbrenner would have smothered him with money and he would be modeling pinstripes now. But the Mets offered only $30 million in guaranteed money for three years, considerably less valuable than the five-year, $70 million he accepted from the Anaheim Angels. In limiting their offer to three years, the Mets said they acted under medical advice that raised concern about Guerrero's back, which reduced his 2003 season by two months.
The Mets also acted under the influence of their Mo Vaughn experience, for which they can thank their former manager Bobby Valentine. Vaughn is Valentine's legacy to the Mets because he implored the Mets to trade for Vaughn even after the burly first baseman missed an entire season.
After they acquired Vaughn, the Mets watched helplessly as the considerable amount of money they owed him reached him on the disabled list. Now Vaughn is finished, but the Mets' payments are not, even though some of the burden will be lightened by insurance.
It is only speculation -- unverifiable speculation at that -- but the feeling here is had the Mets not been experiencing the costly Vaughn fiasco, they would have been willing to gamble more than three years on Guerrero. But stung badly already with an injured player, can they really be blamed for being gun shy? 
O.K., the Mets' critics reply, but the Yankees would not have let a Vaughn-type experience discourage them from pursuing a player of Guerrero's ability. True, although that is the sort of act that enrages other teams. The Yankees have so much money and are so willing to spend it, they can afford to make mistakes. If they had signed Guerrero for five or six years and he had been unable to play more than two or three, so be it. It is only money.
Other teams, including the Mets, either do not take, or cannot afford to take, that approach. As much money as Wilpon has, he does not have enough to keep up with Steinbrenner. Nor does he have the economic inclination to keep up with Steinbrenner. 
Throughout his ownership of the Mets, Wilpon has demonstrated reluctance to spend extravagantly. When he shared the team's ownership with Nelson Doubleday, it was Doubleday who usually was more eager or more willing to spend. 
The Mets' 2003 payroll, according to players association figures, was $91 million, seventh highest in the major leagues, almost $50 million short of the Yankees' $140.6 million. This year, the Mets are shooting for a smaller figure, $80 million.
In plotting his expenditures for this season, Wilpon not only had the Vaughn experience to ponder but also the misguided acquisitions of Roberto Alomar, Jeromy Burnitz and Roger Cedeno. Those players have cost the Mets considerable dollars, for which they have received nothing in return.
Those decisions raise another issue with the Mets: the way they run the club. Wilpon is no Steinbrenner, but he has been involved in the decision-making process on players. That function is understandable when large sums of money are involved, but clubs generally do better when they let their general managers choose the players to pursue.
In the Mets' case, Jeff Wilpon, the owner's son and the team's chief operating officer, also is involved in personnel decisions, leaving General Manager Jim Duquette with a more limited responsibility of contacting clubs and player agents. Atlanta, with John Schuerholz; Oakland, with Billy Beane; San Francisco, with Brian Sabean; and Minnesota, with Terry Ryan, have fared consistently well letting their general managers do the job they were hired to do.
Maybe the Wilpons figured that the Mets did not do well under General Manager Steve Phillips the last couple of years so they would try it their way. Perhaps their way will yet work, so it should be given a chance. But experience suggests it will not. The Yankees, with Steinbrenner making some, but not all, of the player decisions in recent years, have been an exception to what has become the general manager rule.
But some baseball people expect that even the Yankees could begin to fail soon. They cite this winter's questionable moves, many of them done at the behest of Steinbrenner, and compare them to the unhappy 1980's, when he also ignored his baseball experts in deciding which players he wanted. 
But just as Wilpon does not want to match Steinbrenner dollar for dollar, he would not want to match him failure for failure. The Mets have had enough of that.

HEADLINE: Is Bigger Better For Nation's Banks? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "When Banks Go National" (editorial, Jan. 16):
 What is "healthy" about banks getting bigger? For whom is it healthy, the banks? Individuals or corporate clients? The national banking system? Hardly. 
In some cases, sure, it may be much more convenient. But healthy? Not at all. 
 Considering the corporate scandals of recent years, and the complicity of some large banks in helping companies like Enron in their scams, making banks larger is not likely to reverse such behavior.
Will giving larger entities greater control of the credit card market be better for consumers and prod issuers to lower interest rates? Fat chance.
It took me nine days to resolve a mistake made at a national bank, in which another bank customer withdrew funds from my checking account. Bigger is not more responsive, nor more responsible -- just bigger! Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, who were wary of national banks, were not completely wrong.

HEADLINE: Casino Deals Are Stalled by State, U.S. and Tribal Hurdles 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, N.Y. 

 BODY:
New York State approved the construction of three Indian casinos for the old resort areas here in the Catskills more than two years ago, and people in the area practically began to count the money they expected to get from gamblers and construction projects and new jobs.
 But little has happened since then. 
 The Catskills casinos are bogged down in the same legal and cultural quagmire that has bedeviled the state's relations with Indian tribes for generations: land ownership, taxes and sovereignty.
"There's been a lot of talk and a lot of hype, but no action," said William Darwak, the Ulster County administrator. "No money, either." 
Still, the state and the tribes are continuing to negotiate, and officials concede that even some of the most promising projects now being discussed still face many hurdles. Some of those hurdles are being put up by the state, some by the tribes, and others by the federal government. Part of the delay may be related to the potential richness of the prize. Experts say a major casino in the Atlantic City style about 90 miles from Times Square would probably do about $1 billion a year in business. Since all the interested tribes must agree to revenue-sharing plans before they can get state approval, casinos that rich would mean hundreds of millions of dollars a year for state and local governments.
With that kind of money at stake, seven tribes, including ones from Canada and Wisconsin, are in the running to build a casino in the Catskills, and five have already bought land, or have options to do so in Sullivan and Ulster Counties, the only two counties in eastern New York authorized to have casinos. Although Indian casinos are unpopular in many places -- the horse racing industry in Saratoga is involved in a suit to block casino gambling in the state -- the tribes have found a warm welcome from Catskills businesses hoping that casinos would mean a return to the glory days of the Borscht Belt resorts, and then some.
"We'd like to see which tribes are going to be the winners," said Jacqui Leventoff, president of the Sullivan County Chamber of Commerce. "We stand squarely behind them. We have helped every single one that has asked. We don't care who gets here as long as someone breaks the ice and comes in with a casino."
Gov. George E. Pataki has made it clear that he does not want to repeat the mistake he says his predecessor, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, made in granting a license to the Oneidas for a casino in Verona, without first making the tribes settle their claims to tens of thousands of acres in upstate New York, claims that have already been upheld by the courts.
The Pataki administration maintains that getting the land claims out of the way is critical to getting the Department of the Interior to agree to let the tribes create mini-reservations for gambling purposes far from their ancestral lands.
"These are complex negotiations," said Todd Alhart, a spokesman for the governor, "but the key to any of the three Catskills casinos being approved by the Department of the Interior will be contingent upon them being part of a land claim settlement."
In fact, Mr. Pataki wants more than just an end to land claims, according to the tribes negotiating with his lawyers. He also wants them to give up the price advantage Indian businesses get from not having to collect sales taxes on the gas and cigarettes they sell to non-Indians. The tax issue has become a political headache in upstate New York because Indian businesses are underselling local shops and service stations, forcing them out of business and, town managers say, pushing up local taxes. The Indians are pushing back. The Seneca Nation began an advertising campaign last year to protest the state's plan.
Since states are not allowed to collect taxes on Indian businesses, the governor wants a "price parity" solution to bring their prices in line with those at non-Indian businesses. Doing that would open up issues of sovereignty, a status the tribes jealously guard.
Still, the governor has made it plain that the tax issue is part of the package, said Barbara Lazore, a chief of the St. Regis Mohawk Indians at Hogansburg, N.Y. 
"As of today, the land claims are still part of it and price parity is still part of it," Chief Lazore said of her tribe's negotiations with the state. "We're moving forward, but these things seem to take a lot of time, and things can change."
In May 2003, in fact, the Mohawks became the first tribe to reach a comprehensive settlement on claims and taxes and were granted a Catskills casino. A new tribal government was elected, and it rejected the agreement and reopened negotiations.
Tribal leaders complain that the state administration lawyers tend to see solutions in terms of dollars whereas the tribes put value elsewhere. They are prickly about solutions that infringe on their sovereignty, even though gambling has made their members millionaires in recent years after generations of poverty and discrimination. 
"It's very difficult to negotiate with a government with respect to business issues," said Ray Halbritter, leader of the Oneida Nation and the force behind the establishment of its Turning Stone Casino in Verona. "What we have here is a business opportunity in the Catskills used as bait to settle other complicated issues, involving our sovereignty and our land, which are very sensitive to us."
In any case, Mr. Pataki does not have a lot of time. A new law passed over his objections in 2003 requires him to start collecting taxes on Indian businesses by March 1. The last time the state tried to collect Indian taxes, tribal members shut down the New York State Thruway with burning trash, and the state backed down.
While all this is going on, several lawsuits by casino opponents have won some early successes by negating a 1993 compact between the state and the Mohawks, and by raising doubts about the legality of existing and planned expansion of casino gambling in a state with a constitutional provision barring anything but charity games.
"Our contention is that the Congress allows states to enter into a compact with a tribe if they allow gaming for other purposes, but it doesn't require it," said Cornelius D. Murray of Albany, the lawyer for an anti-casino coalition in the state. "Our contention is that Congress can't give state legislatures authority they don't have under their own constitution."
The Pataki administration maintains that the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 requires states to undertake gambling agreement negotiations with tribes in good faith, with the intention of agreeing to the necessary compact. For New York tribes, that has meant agreeing to share revenues from slot machines with the state and local governments.
Earlier this year, the state got the first fruits of such an agreement, $38 million, from the Seneca Niagara Casino. Six were authorized in 2001, three in the Catskills and three in western New York, but this is the only one to open so far.
But administration officials said on the condition of anonymity that the three tribes that were closest to winning a Catskills casino were the Mohawks, the Cayuga of western New York, and the Stockbridge-Munsee band of Mohicans, of Wisconsin, a tribe with no presence in the state, although they have a land claim against the state upheld by the courts.
All three have already bought or optioned land and have begun the required environmental assessments and planning, officials said. The St. Regis Mohawks have an option to buy Kutsher's Country Club here in Monticello, the Cayuga have an agreement to put a $500 million casino at the Monticello Raceway, and the Stockbridge-Munsee have bought land in Thompson. 
"We're moving ahead," said Mark Kutsher, president of the resort. He said he would stay on as a manager if the Mohawks get the green light.
State officials say the St. Regis Mohawks may be ready to hold a tribal referendum on a new settlement by April, but two hurdles remain even for tribes that win tribal acceptance of a deal. One, Washington would have to share in the multimillion-dollar cash settlements any land claim is likely to involve. And two, the Interior Department would have to approve taking land in trust for gambling purposes far from the tribe's historical lands. 
The creation of such mini-gambling reservations has been approved by Washington, notably in Detroit, but it is still a rare event and one the Bush administration has criticized.
One of the richest prizes still unspoken for in the Catskills is the Concord resort near Monticello. Among the tribes that have visited it are the Oneida and even the Seneca, who already have three casino approvals in the western part of the state.
"The Senecas have as much right as any nation to apply for a Catskills casino," said G. Michael Brown, president of the Seneca Gaming Corporation, who has examined the Concord and found much to recommend it as a future casino. "What's not to like about two championship golf courses and a sewer system already in place?"

HEADLINE: At Ground Zero, Rebuilding With Nature in Mind 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DEPALMA

 BODY:
While most of the anguished debate about ground zero has focused on recreating and remembering what was once there, another effort has been moving forward to create on the site something that never existed, an environmentally sensitive city within a city that is attuned to nature as well as the real estate market.
 Over the last year, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the commercial lease on the World Trade Center, aided by environmentalists and builders, have put together development guidelines. Those guidelines will help shape how the office buildings and retail space, including the Freedom Tower, manage their energy consumption while minimizing their impact on the city's environment. 
 The guidelines set a new standard for New York. The roofs of buildings will be designed to catch rainwater for flushing toilets and boosting cooling systems. Developers will be encouraged to reuse pilings and other materials already on site and to specify that recycled material and products made from renewable resources, like fast-growing trees and sunflower seed husks, be used for interior and insulating materials. 
The guidelines are not limited to the buildings but extend to the period of construction, requiring all large diesel engines on the building site to use ultra-low-sulfur fuel to reduce emissions. Half of all the waste wood, cardboard and metal generated during construction will be recycled, and construction crews will be encouraged to substitute corn oil or other natural substances for petroleum-based oils to keep concrete from sticking to wooden forms. 
Although individual buildings in New York and other cities have been built to exacting environmental standards in recent years, such "green" goals have never been applied to anything as large as the trade center site, which when complete will contain about as much commercial space as the city of Indianapolis. 
"We're talking about building an environmentally sensitive city. That's never been done before," said Daniel R. Tishman, chairman of Tishman Construction Corp., which is overseeing construction of the first building at ground zero, the new 7 World Trade Center, as well as the Freedom Tower.
Mr. Tishman, who holds degrees in environmental studies, helped devise the sustainable development guidelines.
Environmental groups in New York generally support the effort, though they expect to continue to push for even higher standards. 
"This 16-acre site should not result in very good buildings, because very good is not enough," said Ashok Gupta, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council air and energy program, and an adviser to the group that drew up the guidelines. "These buildings should be the best that can be built."
The guidelines are an appendix to a draft environmental impact statement for the trade center site that is expected to be released for public comment today. But hints of how the new standards may be applied are already evident in the construction of 7 World Trade Center. 
Located just to the north of the main trade center redevelopment site, the originalbuilding was destroyed in the attack on Sept. 11, 2001. So was the Consolidated Edison substation on which it stood. 
Mr. Silverstein and Gov. George E. Pataki announced the start of construction at 7 World Trade Center in November 2002, disappointing critics who thought nothing should happen until planning for the trade center site was complete. 
Although the design guidelines were not yet compiled, the project followed an environmentally sensitive course that added roughly $10.3 million to the cost, company officials said. In most instances, energy savings will not offset the added costs in the three to four years by which developers generally expect their payback, but meeting strict environmental standards can bring other rewards.
Janno Lieber, director of the trade center project for the Silverstein organization, said that building an office tower that uses less energy, recycles water and triple-filters inside air enhanced the marketability of the project, but that was not the only reason for taking the extra steps. He said Mr. Silverstein considered the trade center redevelopment a personal mission. 
"This was a down payment on the broader commitment that Larry has made to having the trade center redevelopment be state of the art from an environmental standpoint," Mr. Lieber said. 
The first bows to the environment came as construction began. Diesel engines at construction sites are largely unregulated sources of air pollution. To lower emissions, large diesel engines were fitted with powerful filters and switched to ultra-low-sulfur fuel. Bulldozers and backhoes used to clear the site were also converted. Now that steel is going up, the crane that hauls girders into place uses the new filters and fuel. 
The success of the program helped lead to the adoption of a city law mandating the use of low-sulfur fuel and high-efficiency filters in all public construction. 
At 52 stories, the building will be taller than its predecessor but will have a smaller footprint and less space. It will harvest natural sunlight through floor-to-ceiling windows specially coated to reflect heat and allow plenty of natural light into the building. Rainwater collected on the roof and stored in tanks in the building will be reused in toilets or will flow into the drip irrigation system for a small park that will be built next to the site. The architect designing the park will select hardy plants and trees that need little water. 
Computers will control heating and lighting throughout the office building. Power to commercial tenants will be metered, which is expected to encourage conservation. A system to use some of the heating steam to generate electricity will produce about 150 kilowatts, reducing the building's reliance on the energy grid by about 3 percent. 
Mr. Lieber, the project manager, said the environmental features accounted for 3 to 5 percent of the cost of constructing 7 World Trade Center. The total cost of the project, comprising direct and indirect costs, was given in Liberty Bond filings at $540 million. Commercial tenants, not the building's owners, will realize most energy savings, Mr. Lieber said. 
The Freedom Tower, which the Tishman company will also build for the Silverstein organization, will incorporate many of the same environmental features as 7 World Trade Center, and a few not put in effect there. For instance, the tower, a much larger building, will be more energy independent because it will have propeller-driven wind turbines proposed by David M. Childs, a partner in the firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill who wasdesign architect for 7 World Trade Center. Wind power is to furnish up to 10 percent of the tower's electricity.
Not every proposal made it into the guidelines. One that was abandoned as impractical called for all the steel and other construction material to be delivered to the site aboard a specially designated PATH train. Mr. Tishman said such a plan would not work because suppliers are too dispersed. 
Meeting the guidelines will make it possible for developers to win rankings under a system known as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, a national standard. No building in New York City has won a LEED award. But as environmental efficiency becomes more expected, New York builders have felt compelled to respond with greener buildings.
The Tishman company, which has developed a reputation for environmental awareness, has built several such buildings in recent years, including the Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square and the Westin New York at Times Square.
The Hearst Corporation is putting up a tower above its headquarters at Eighth Avenue and 56th Street that may receive national energy efficiency certification.

Hey Cabby, The Fare Rise Is in the Mail

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
AMONG the many great lies that keep the world spinning -- "The check is in the mail," "This won't hurt a bit," "Sure, I'll respect you in the morning" -- is the one about New Yorkers' being able to put up with anything.
 That loving myth has comforted the people of this city for generations. But there is one thing that many of them absolutely cannot handle. It is called reality. 
 One reality is that the prices of certain essential services, like subway fares and college tuition charges, enjoyed the Zamboni treatment for many years; they were kept as artificially frozen as the hockey ice at Madison Square Garden. When they inevitably rose some months ago, cries of betrayal rang from Bay Ridge to Baychester.
Something similar is almost surely about to happen with taxi fares. In fact, it has already begun.
City officials leave no doubt that fares will soon go up, possibly by as much as 25 percent. Even though no action has yet been taken by the Taxi and Limousine Commission, the grumbling is in chorus.
Some of it comes from frequent taxi riders who, often enough, belong to the city's more privileged classes. They seem to have trouble grasping why a Bangladeshi immigrant behind the wheel of a yellow cab might possibly seek more than the $11 an hour that officials say the average driver earns.
A reality ignored by many New Yorkers is that fares have not risen in eight years, not since March 1996. "Friends" was still a fairly new television series, that's how long ago it was.
One result is that the cost of a typical cab ride is a Zambonied $6.85. (The average trip is said to be 2.8 miles, which also happens to be the approximate distance from home to office for your typical newspaper editor. A coincidence, no doubt.)
Bruce Schaller, a Brooklyn researcher whose specialty is the taxi industry, finds that New York has lower fares than at least 13 other major American cities. A 2.8-mile journey runs to $10.85 in San Francisco, or 58 percent more than in New York. When adjusted for inflation, Mr. Schaller said, the fare here is the lowest it has been since 1965.
In a separate study prepared for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for pedestrians and bicycle riders, Mr. Schaller concludes that a fare increase may improve taxi safety. Analyzing data from the 1990's, he discovered "a strong relationship" between cabbies' incomes and their accident rates.
"Drivers who are under greater financial pressure tend to work longer hours," making them more tired and more error-prone, he said. "Financial strains," he added, "may also pressure drivers to exceed the speed limit, run red lights and take other risks."
From conversations with city officials, it is not clear that they buy Mr. Schaller's safety arguments. All the same, they suggest that a fare increase is on the way, probably soon.
BUT in this politically charged city, how do you make passengers feel they are getting something for their money? That is the question vexing the Bloomberg administration, said a senior official who spoke only if given the standard (if irritating) guarantee of anonymity.
Some ideas under discussion are technophilic, like global positioning devices to help fleets track their cabs. Forgive us a certain skepticism. Technology has hardly been the cab rider's constant friend. You need only recall those pointless television screens behind the driver, not to mention the shrieking Elmo and his buddies urging riders to "buckle up."
More important for most New Yorkers, City Hall recognizes, is putting more cabs on the streets, especially during rush periods. At 4:30 p.m. on a workday, you stand a better a chance of stumbling upon a weapon of mass destruction in Iraq than finding an empty taxi in Midtown.
So besides planning to add 900 cabs, the senior official said, the city is thinking about scrapping the basically useless night surcharge of 50 cents and replacing it with a rush-hour surcharge of a dollar. The hope is that, with a lure of extra money, cabbies will keep cruising at 5 p.m. rather than doing their usual vanishing routine.
Now if only something can be done to improve passenger leg room, to install clear partitions so that you can actually read the driver's name and to get cabbies to pay mild attention to riders, instead of gabbing on their cellphones the entire time, true progress can be proclaimed.
Not that any of this is said as a complaint, mind you. Don't you know that New Yorkers can put up with anything?

HEADLINE: Subconsciously, Athletes May Play Like Statisticians 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
When Justine Henin-Hardenne rips a cross-court forehand at the Australian Open or Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, dodges an onrushing defender, each looks like the very definition of living in the moment. Like other great athletes, they often appear to rely on speed, strength and lightning-fast reactions.
 There seems to be little time for highly advanced quantitative analysis that weighs current observations against past experiences to suggest a plan of attack. 
 But this kind of analysis is precisely what the human brain does when facing a physical challenge, according to a study by two European scientists published in the current issue of Nature. The more uncertainty that people face -- be it caused by wind on a tennis court, snow on a football field or darkness on a country highway -- the more they make decisions based on their subconscious memory and the less they depend on what they see. 
Among researchers, the combining of new information with conventional wisdom is known as Bayesian analysis, and it has become increasingly popular in recent years. Once controversial, because it muddies supposedly pure scientific data with subjective opinion about which prior research is relevant to a particular study, it has gained adherents as the explosion of computing power has allowed the method's complex formulas to be performed on a basic laptop computer.
With the encouragement of the Food and Drug Administration, medical-device makers use the method to test new devices that are only slightly different from their predecessors. Computer companies use Bayesian methods to build spam filters for e-mail, said Dr. Michael Lynch, the chief executive of Autonomy, a British software company, and governments use it to try to prevent terrorism, combining data from security cameras and X-ray machines with criminal profiles.
"In academia, the Bayesian revolution is on the verge of becoming the majority viewpoint, which would have been unthinkable 10 years ago," said Bradley P. Carlin, a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota and a Bayesian specialist.
Stephen M. Stigler, a professor of statistics at the University of Chicago who considers himself to be roughly in the middle of the spectrum in the Bayesian debate, added: "It's not a controversial subject. Twenty years ago, it was."
In everyday life, of course, people have been using the ideas underlying Bayesian analysis since well before it became the vogue in science labs, or even before Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century British minister and mathematician, formalized the method in a paper that was published two years after he died. When crossing a street, people rely on both what they see and what they remember about the speed of cars on similar roads. When deciding whether to take a sick child to a doctor, parents consider the current symptoms as well as the child's history and their general knowledge of illness.
"The human brain knows about Bayes's rule," said Konrad P. Kording, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Neurology in London, who conducted the study published in Nature along with Daniel M. Wolpert, a professor at the institute.
The new research stands out because it offers a detailed window into how the Bayesian thought process works, showing the point when uncertainty becomes great enough to give past experience an edge over current observation. 
Each participant in the experiment sat down and placed a hand on a tabletop. A projection of a computer screen blocked their view of the hand. The goal was to guide a cursor, which followed the movement of the hand, from one side of the screen to a target on the other side.
Adding to the uncertainty, the cursor usually appeared slightly to the right of the hand, and the participants caught at most a quick glimpse of it when it was halfway across the screen. Sometimes, the cursor appeared as a discrete point; other times, it was an ill-defined cloud.
The researchers found that when no cursor flashed, people relied on what they had learned during 1,000 practice runs before the experiment: namely that the cursor was, on average, one centimeter to the right of the hand. When a cloud flashed, they considered it, but only somewhat, in a pattern that followed what Bayes's formula predicted. When a distinct cursor flashed, they relied on it and not past experience.
"Most decisions in our lives are done in the presence of uncertainty," Dr. Kording said. "In all these cases, the prior knowledge we have can be very helpful. If the brain works in the Bayesian way, it would optimally use the prior knowledge." 
The researchers drew the analogy to tennis in their paper, and it is not the first study to suggest that athletes have a more sophisticated understanding of mathematics than even they may realize. 
Mark A. Walker and John C. Wooders, economists at the University of Arizona, recently studied old videotapes of tennis matches involving stars like Bjorn Borg, Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras. The economists looked at the serves in each match to see how well players randomly altered playing the ball to an opponent's forehand or backhand.
Many people do poorly on similar tests when they are conducted in a laboratory. Ask somebody to write down a list of hypothetical coin-flip outcomes, for example, and the result will probably contain too few streaks of heads or tails. Because people know that the overall odds are 50-50, they underestimate how often three straight tails or four straight heads turn up.
But professional tennis players realize, on some level, that their opponent will have an advantage if he knows that a serve to the forehand is likely to be followed by one to the backhand. They do a relatively good job of mixing serves, though still not as randomly as a computer program would, Professors Walker and Wooders reported in a 2001 paper.
Some researchers remain skeptical that the human mind works like the coldly rational Bayesian machine suggested by the Nature paper. Consider the self-destructive mistakes drivers make in their behavior, from turning a steering wheel the wrong way on a patch of ice to buying sport-utility vehicles that are less safe than their owners believe.
"I'm quite comfortable with the idea that people use probability," said Dr. Stigler, the Chicago statistician. "The idea that it's associated with a Bayesian approach is not quite clear."
The most likely explanation may be that some people are quite good at subconsciously using statistical techniques and others are far less so. As the Super Bowl and Australian Open play out over the next two weeks, the athletes holding trophies at the end might be the Bayesians.

HEADLINE: Chief Quits Canadian Car Parts Maker toBe a Politician 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Belinda Stronach resigned Tuesday as president and chief executive of Magna International, the auto parts company her father founded almost a half-century ago, to seek the leadership of the Conservative Party in Canada. 
 In announcing Ms. Stronach's departure from Magna, the company said that her father, Frank Stronach, would take the title of president for the time being. Mr. Stronach, 71, is the company's chairman and controlling shareholder. 
 One analyst said that Ms. Stronach's most likely successor would be Siegfried Wolf, an executive vice chairman and head of Magna's European operations. 
With 72,000 employees and over 200 factories, mostly in Canada, the United States and Europe, Magna produces an array of parts and assembles vehicles. It reported net income of $384 million in the first nine months of last year on sales of $10.7 billion.
Sean McAlinden, chief economist at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., described the company as one of the automotive industry's "most widely admired firms, except by the unions."
Even without Ms. Stronach at the helm, "I think they'll be fine," said Nicholas D. Morton, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Shares of Magna, which have risen by almost two-thirds over the last year, fell 10 cents, to $81.89. 
Several analysts said that Ms. Stronach's role as chief executive was a limited one. According to Mr. McAlinden, she was most involved in "policy, show-the-flag and being at government meetings." 
Magna's operating units have a high degree of autonomy and their senior managers include two former chief executives of the parent company, including Donald Walker, one of Ms. Stronach's two ex-husbands. 
Mr. McAlinden said that one factor behind Magna's success had been its ability to secure government backing for many of its projects in the United States and Canada. The directors of the parent company and its listed subsidiaries include three former premiers of Ontario, a former Canadian industry minister and a former chancellor of Austria, where Frank Stronach was born and raised. 
As Mr. McAlinden sees it, Ms. Stronach's new political career, if successful, "will not harm the company." Among her responsibilities at Magna was a scholarship program for students who write the best essay on the topic: "If I were prime minister "
Two hours after announcing her resignation, Ms. Stronach told a group of cheering supporters at a veterans' hall in suburban Toronto that she was seeking the currently vacant leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. 
"From time to time I will make mistakes," Ms. Stronach acknowledged in her first stump speech. "I'm not a professional politician. I'm a mother, a business person and a second-generation Canadian." 
But noting that some people thought she was not up to the task when she was named to the top job at Magna three years ago, Ms. Stronach, 37, said, "I rose to that challenge as I will rise to the challenge of leading the new Conservative Party."
The party, formed late last year through the merger of two right-of-center groups, has 58 of the 301 seats in the House of Commons, a third the number held by the ruling Liberals, led by Paul Martin, the prime minister.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo and Bank One Report Increases in Profit 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Wells Fargo and Bank One reported double-digit growth in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday on higher fees from credit cards and money management and a decline in loan losses.
 As a group, bank profits from lending to individuals may slow as mortgage financing ebbs. Corporate lending lagged as companies delayed building plants or buying equipment. Wells Fargo reported relatively flat corporate and commercial loan growth. 
 "The big challenge is corporate loan demand," said Wayne Bopp, who helps manage about $35 billion of investments at Fifth Third Investment Advisors, including 2.3 million shares of Wells Fargo.
The Mortgage Bankers Association predicts that mortgage activity will fall by more than half in 2004.
"It's a tougher environment for the industry," said Lisa Welch, who helps manage about $25 billion at John Hancock Advisers in Boston. Mortgages are declining, deposits are slowing and "commercial loans really haven't picked up," Ms. Welch said.
At Wells Fargo, net income increased 10 percent, to $1.62 billion, or 95 cents a share, from $1.47 billion, or 86 cents, a year earlier. That met the average forecast of analysts in a Thomson First Call survey.
Revenue from mortgage banking increased 23 percent, to $636 million, as the value of the bank's mortgage servicing unit increased. Rising interest rates increased the unit's value because a decline in refinancing makes it likely that the bank will bring in fees from handling mortgage paperwork for a longer period.
Revenue from fees like mortgages, investment management and insurance rose 18 percent, to $3.4 billion. Revenue from taking in deposits and making loans grew 7 percent, to $3.58 billion.
Wells Fargo set aside 1.54 percent of $253 billion in loans outstanding as of Dec. 31, a decline from 1.98 percent of $192 billion outstanding at the end of 2002.
Bank One, which has agreed to be acquired by J.P. Morgan Chase, said fourth-quarter net income rose 16 percent, to $978 million, or 87 cents a share, compared with $842 million, or 72 cents, a year earlier.
Retail banking climbed 12 percent, to $398 million; commercial banking jumped 150 percent, to $370 million; credit card income rose 8 percent, to $347 million; and investment management rose 75 percent, to $105 million.
The bank, which controls the largest bank-held family of mutual funds, faces regulatory investigations into an improper trading relationship with the Canary Capital Partners hedge fund. It said it would make restitution to any shareholders who lost money because of the trading.
Bank One's fourth-quarter provision for credit losses rose to $672 million, from $628 million in the comparable period a year ago.

HEADLINE: Economic Memo; 
Even for Financial Experts, Analyzing the Job Market Is an Adventure

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Is the job market improving more quickly than most people realize?
 Even though the government recently ignited new talk of a jobless recovery by reporting a measly gain of 1,000 jobs in December, nearly every other measure of the labor market offers a more encouraging picture. The gap suggests that President Bush may be running for re-election with a stronger economy than is widely understood and that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more rapidly than many investors now expect, economists say. 
 Since September, the number of people receiving state jobless benefits has fallen by almost 500,000, or over 13 percent. A survey of executives suggests that companies in the service sector are increasing their employment at the fastest rate since 2000. 
The amount of help-wanted advertising being placed across the country has risen more than 10 percent since May, according to an index compiled by the Conference Board, a research company in New York. In early January, Americans reported being more confident about the economy than they had been in more than three years, according to a University of Michigan survey that often moves in tandem with job-market changes.
"We've seen a clear pickup," said Linda S. Paulk, the president of Snelling Personnel Service, a national employment agency based in Dallas that is placing about 19 percent more workers in jobs than it was a year ago. "And we've seen consistency in the pickup, which we hadn't seen in the three years prior."
The Labor Department's survey of tens of thousands of businesses, which showed the gain of 1,000 jobs, is one of the most widely respected economic indicators, and few analysts are willing to dismiss it. It could prove correct, while the other signs ultimately look ephemeral. Even if the job market is improving, it remains well short of healthy by almost any measure.
But for all of the payroll survey's strengths, it often underestimates job growth at economic turning points because it misses numerous start-up businesses, many economists say. 
When the economy was emerging from a recession and a jobless recovery in the early 1990's, the Labor Department initially reported weak employment gains, only to revise the numbers when more complete data became available. For the last three months of 1992, for example, the department initially reported average monthly gains of 65,000 jobs; it now says the economy was adding 177,000 jobs a month at the time, based on jobless-claims records and other information.
"I'm not saying there's going to be an upward revision" again, said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of ITG/Hoenig, an investment firm, "but it's a reasonable notion." Mr. Barbera said he thought the economy was creating in the range of 50,000 jobs each month that were not being captured in the government's survey of businesses.
Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said he thought the gap could be closer to 100,000. "It is striking in the last couple of months how far apart the payroll numbers have been" from other indicators, like jobless claims and consumer confidence, he added.
The government has reported that the economy added an average of about 55,000 jobs a month between August and December.
At that pace, the job market appears to be improving at only a slightly better rate than it was in late 1991 and early 1992, when Bill Clinton and other Democrats used the economy's weakness as a bludgeon against the first President Bush. If the economy is in fact adding 100,000 to 200,000 jobs each month, it would still be limper than it was when Mr. Clinton or Ronald Reagan ran for re-election, but considerably better than it was a dozen years ago for the current president's father.
The uncertainty over the job market also seems to be one factor causing Fed officials to suggest that they plan to keep their benchmark interest rate at a 45-year low despite the brisk economic growth of recent months. "An accommodative monetary policy is needed, in my view, to support the ongoing recovery, particularly in the labor market," Ben S. Bernanke, a Fed governor, said in a speech in San Diego this month.
Investors expect the Fed to raise the benchmark rate, now at 1 percent, in August, based on the price of a futures contract tied to Fed policy.
Unless the government reports accelerating job gains in the coming months and revises the numbers for late 2003, making them look better than they now do, the Fed is unlikely to act sooner, analysts say. The Fed typically raises the rate when officials are worried that inflation is rising. 
The Labor Department's other main measure of the job market -- a survey of households, the results of which create the unemployment rate -- also offers a rosier picture than the business survey. Since June, the jobless rate has fallen to 5.7 percent, from 6.2 percent.
But most economists consider the unemployment rate flawed in the other direction. Even N. Gregory Mankiw, who as the chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers has obvious motivation to look on the bright side, has said the rate understates the job market's current problems.
The recent disappearance of millions of jobs, replaced by technology or relocated to other countries, appears to have led many workers to stop looking for new jobs and instead to rely on a spouse's salary or government benefits like disability pay. The Labor Department does not consider people unemployed if they are not seeking new work.
"I would love to believe the household survey" and the optimistic view it offers, Mr. Shepherdson said. "But, hand on heart, I can't say that I do."
Many economists say they believe that the truth probably lies somewhere between the surveys' results. But they also acknowledge that if hiring and wage increases remain as tepid as the business survey now suggests, households are unlikely to spend enough to keep the economy humming.
"Either the employment data improves," Mr. Barbera said, "or the widespread consensus of 4.5 percent growth this year is wrong."

 Together, father and son operate the 500,000-square-foot Bal Harbour Shops, an open-air luxury mall lined with palm trees and fountains in a narrow enclave just north of Miami Beach. Founded by the elder Mr. Whitman in 1965, the shopping center, one of only a handful of family-owned malls across the country, is considered a retailing phenomenon. 
 Sales per square foot in 2003 (excluding the anchor stores, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue) were not what they were before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but were still nearly four times the national average, the Whitmans say. Even on weeknights, the restaurants at Bal Harbour are jammed with fashionably dressed patrons, many of them foreign tourists carrying shopping bags with designer logos. 
For nearly four decades, the Whitmans, who own no other retail property, have had the luxury market in Miami-Dade County virtually to themselves. But the mall is facing a challenge from a new 700,000-square-foot shopping center that opened in September 2002 in Coral Gables, about 14 miles south of Bal Harbour. 
The new mall was built on a former industrial site by the Rouse Company, a real estate developer based in Columbia, Md., as part of the Village of Merrick Park, a $275 million project. The mixed-use Mediterranean-style development has the county's second Neiman Marcus (130,000 square feet, compared with 90,000 square feet at Bal Harbour), a 200,000-square-foot Nordstrom that is the chain's first store in either Miami-Dade or Broward County, and about 100 stores, 39 of them luxury, including several, like Gucci, Roberto Cavalli and Tiffany, that are also represented at Bal Harbour.
Rouse officials say the high-end stores, which occupy the first of three levels, are doing well, but they acknowledge that over all, the mall is off to a slower start than anticipated. Duke S. Kassolis, an executive vice president, blamed a decline in tourism, the economic slowdown and the fact that two of the major restaurants had not yet opened. The mall, expected to earn an 11.2 percent return on investment, has been yielding in the range of 7 percent, he said.
The Whitmans are tough-minded executives who are known for casting out underperforming retailers, among them Chico's, the clothing store chain that caters to women over 35, which now has a store at Merrick Park. But the Whitmans say their family pride was wounded when the Rouse Company filed an antitrust lawsuit against them. The suit sought to overturn Bal Harbour Shops' unusually far-reaching radius restriction, which allowed the shopping center to impose a financial penalty on tenants that opened a second store in either Miami-Dade or Broward County.
"We've had competition before," the elder Mr. Whitman said. "The only significant difference with Merrick Park is that they announced they were coming in to take over our position. No one else has done that." In a settlement reached in 2002, which both sides are barred from discussing, Bal Harbour Shops agreed not to apply its clause to prospective tenants at Merrick Park.
Mr. Kassolis, however, said that the Miami area, with a population of more than 2.2 million, was now big enough to support more than one luxury mall. "Bal Harbour is a great project," he said, "and no less of a great project than it was before we came to Coral Gables. We have the utmost respect for the Whitmans and what they've accomplished." He said Merrick Park saw itself as "a little more fashion-forward" and was aiming for a younger customer than Bal Harbour's.
James J. Walsh, a retail specialist in Miami for Cushman & Wakefield, said that despite Merrick Park's slow start, it would probably take some customers away from Bal Harbour, particularly those who live in downtown Miami or farther south. "It's going to impact them to some degree," he said. "Some people will say, 'Why should I drive all the way up to Bal Harbour when I'm so much closer to Merrick Park?"'
When Stanley Whitman decided in the 1950's to build a mall on the site of a former Army barracks on Collins Avenue, within a block of both the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay, Miami Beach was deteriorating badly and upscale department stores like Bonwit Teller had fled the main shopping street, Lincoln Road. 
Mr. Whitman, whose family owned the art deco Whitman Hotel, now closed, had ideas that seemed outlandish, like charging a parking fee. In a period when enclosed malls were popular, he placed his shopping center in a gardenlike setting and even planted palm trees in the parking lot, to the irritation of some tenants. "Everybody, including my own family, wanted to put me in a nuthouse," Mr. Whitman recalled.
Mr. Whitman took several other steps that were risky for the 1960's. He opened a fashion-oriented mall without anchor stores or even a supermarket or drugstore, and he charged much higher rent than other mall operators. He said it took him years to persuade Neiman Marcus to open its first store outside Texas at Bal Harbour; it was quickly expanded by 30,000 square feet. In 1983, the Whitmans opened a second level, but they say they will never add a third.
"Stanley Whitman," said Steven B. Greenberg, the president of the Greenberg Group, a retail real estate consulting company based in Hewlett, N.Y., "was light-years ahead of his time. He envisioned a Madison Avenue lineup. He went out and got the best tenants. They know quality when they see it, and they are entrepreneurial enough that when the next Prada comes along, they respond." 
Recent additions to Bal Harbour include Lalique, Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, Gianfranco Ferre, Paul&Shark, Francesca Romana and Cole Haan. 
Bal Harbour charges modest annual rents by Madison Avenue standards -- roughly $100 a square foot for ground-floor space and $70 on the second level, where the tenants include some decidedly nonluxury retailers like Banana Republic and the Gap. (The average mall tenant pays $30 a square foot, said Greg Andrews, a retail REIT analyst for Green Street Advisers, an independent investment research company in Newport Beach, Calif.) But retailers also pay a percentage of their sales, a sum that tends to be much higher than the base rent, Mr. Greenberg said. (Leases at Merrick Park range from $40 to $80, depending on the shop size and when the tenant signed up, and include a percentage of sales, said Mr. Greenberg, who has placed tenants there.)
Sales at Bal Harbour Shops have declined since 2000, when they reached $1,350 a square foot, the Whitmans say. Even so, the mall's sales per square foot were the highest in the nation in 2002, according to the Greenberg Group's annual survey of the top 25 malls, and in 2003 reached $1,170, Randall Whitman said. The national average for 2002, the latest available, was $330, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group.
Real estate specialists say that the mall's private ownership enables the Whitmans to act in ways that would be unheard-of for public companies, which are under constant pressure from stockholders. For example, one tenant, Bonwit Teller, went out of business more than a decade ago, but some of its 60,000 square feet was unoccupied until recently because the younger Mr. Whitman hoped -- vainly, as it turned out -- to lure Barneys New York to Bal Harbour.
The Whitmans attribute their success to their stable, hands-on management and long-term employees and say they were never tempted to try to clone Bal Harbour elsewhere. "I didn't see any thrill in doing it over and over," Stanley Whitman said.
These days, he said, he devotes his time mainly to strategic planning. Recently, he tried to bring a movie theater to the mall but said that he abandoned the idea because the construction costs would have been too high.
But Randall Whitman said there was no question about who was actually in charge. Recently, the son said, his father rejected a suggestion from him in no uncertain terms. "I laughed," the younger Mr. Whitman said, "and that was the end of that. It's not easy working for your dad."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET --Stamford; 
New Visions of Big-Box Retailers Downtown

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Jan. 20 

 BODY:
After a seemingly endless run of false starts, retail development is picking up momentum in downtown Stamford. 
 Target, after first expressing interest in the area more than five years ago, finally broke ground on a 164,0000-square-foot store on Broad Street last May. In September, another large discount retailer, Burlington Coat Factory, began renovating the old Caldor building that is also on Broad Street. And in October, local officials announced that Wal-Mart was coming to the 4.2-acre parcel of land at the corner of Greyrock Place and Tresser Boulevard. Known locally as the "hole in the ground," it has been vacant for about 20 years. 
 The 15-block area that makes up downtown Stamford now seems to be attractive to big-box retailers, a mood far different from that eight years ago. That was when zoning changes were made to the area -- to force large retailers to go downtown, rather than taking space closer to Interstate 95, especially on the side of the highway away from downtown.
"You have to let things percolate a bit, which is what happened here, but we think that all the new space that is coming to our area is very exciting," said Sandra Goldstein, executive director for the Stamford Downtown Special Services District, a business improvement group. 
Although certain retailers like Safavieh Rugs and Home are continuing to take on more space downtown, some local real estate executives suspect that most smaller retailers will wait until stores like Target and Wal-Mart have actually opened.
Still, some brokers who represent smaller tenants say that interest has picked up notably since ground was broken for Target's store. "We've seen a considerable increase in activity," said Penny P. Wickey, president of Harbor Commercial Real Estate, a Southport, Conn., brokerage company.
Ms. Wickey said that her company is representing five tenants who are negotiating for space of up to 6,500 square feet in the downtown area. Several of them, she said, are pursuing opportunities on the ground floor of Target's development project, where 16,000 square feet of space are expected to come to market soon. 
But Ms. Wickey says she has also noticed considerable interest lately in another downtown development project, also called Greyrock Place, which she is representing. The 280,000-square-foot, multi-use project has been proposed for the corner of Broad Street and Greyrock, across the street from Macy's department store. While plans for Greyrock Place still need approval by Stamford's zoning authorities, it is now scheduled to offer about 70,000 square feet of retail space on its first two floors. 
Wal-Mart also still needs to go through Stamford's approval process before proceeding with its plans. But according to Richard Baker, president of National Realty and Development in Purchase, N.Y., a longstanding developer for Wal-Mart, it has already signed commitments, though not actual leases, for 300,000 square feet of space at Stamford Place, a project his company is developing with Milstein Brothers Capital Partners of New York. It is projected to open in 2006. 
Mr. Baker said that about 35 floors, with 550 apartments and 450,000 square feet of retail space, are envisioned at Stamford Place. In a departure from its usual stores, current plans call for Wal-Mart to open a 150,000-square-foot Sam's Club warehouse store in the basement of the building, while the seventh floor will house a 150,000-square-foot Wal-Mart, Mr. Baker said. In between, he said, there are to be four floors of other stores and two of parking. 
Burlington Coat Factory is also planning a different kind of store in Stamford. According to Robert Grapski, Burlington's vice president for real estate, the 120,000-square-foot store will be both more lavish than a typical outlet and about 40,000 square feet larger. "We're spending a lot of money on this," he said. "It's going to be a trophy piece." 
Norman Lotstein, vice president of the Pyramid Real Estate Group in Stamford, said that rents for retail space in downtown Stamford five years ago were typically in the mid-to-low $20 range a square foot annually. By contrast, he said, they are now $27 to $33 a square foot. 
As for the appropriate mixture of retailers in the area, some local officials and real estate executives continue to have a long wish list. Ms. Goldstein would like to see boutiques on Bedford Street, but she would particularly welcome the arrival of a specialty food retailer like Fresh Fields, Wild Oats or Trader Joe's. 
She is encouraged, though. "I guarantee you that in five years, you will see my wish list come true," she said. 
Mr. Baker is also optimistic. "Downtown Stamford," he said, "is going to look a lot different six months from now, just as it did six months ago."

HEADLINE: THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PLAN: OVERVIEW; 
PATAKI PROPOSES RISE IN SPENDING

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Saying New York had turned the corner economically, Gov. George E. Pataki on Tuesday proposed a $99.8 billion budget that would significantly increase state spending and change the way the state pays for education and health care for the poor.
 At the same time, under court order to address the state's chronic shortchanging of New York City's schools, the third-term Republican governor proposed expanding video gambling to create a new fund that will be used to educate the neediest children around the state. 
 If passed by the State Legislature, the budget would increase spending by $1.5 billion over last year's final tally, bringing it close to a benchmark of $100 billion. 
But the budget also calls for $600 million in belt-tightening by state agencies; $283 million in borrowing; the use of one-time revenues; and $972 million in new fees and targeted taxes, including extension of the tax on clothing and shoes under $110, to close a projected budget shortfall of $5.1 billion. It includes no broad-based tax increases on income or property, which the governor has in the past labeled job-killing taxes. 
The governor's proposal, which is his plan for the budget to take effect on April 1, contains something for everyone, leading some legislators and budget watchdogs to predict that it will have an easier time passing the Legislature this year than in the past; it has been late for 19 straight years. 
Some, however, said it is too good to be true. "In the end, I think it is fantasy to a certain degree," said State Senator David Patterson, a Manhattan Democrat. Although he said it was workable, he added: "It is almost as if there has to be an incredible synchronization of events, and the most speculative optimism, for all of these elements to come to fruition, for this budget to be successful." For New York City, the budget would provide much of the aid Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg requested in his budget proposal last week, though not in all the areas he wanted.
More than $160 million worth of Mr. Bloomberg's $400 million request, for instance, would come from extending the sales tax on clothing, a tax that the mayor had promised -- and the City Council had insisted -- would be phased out in June. 
The proposal also includes pension reforms that the governor said would save the state $500 million next year and satisfy a request by localities to curb their shared costs as well. However, the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, has already labeled the actions unconstitutional, something the governor disputes.
Supporters of more money for New York City's schools lauded the proposal to create a separate fund for enhancing the education of poor children. But critics of the governor said that counting on revenues from video lottery terminals at eight horse racing tracks and at eight new sites, including up to five in New York City, could be financially risky.
But even as critics found fault with portions of the budget, many legislators said they detected a conciliatory note in the governor's tone. Last year's budget was crafted by the Legislature, vetoed by the governor and then passed in a bipartisan override for the first time in a generation. After that embarrassing political defeat, Mr. Pataki presented a far less contentious budget, one that satisfies a broad array of interests, budget watchdogs said.
Indeed, while the governor condemned the Legislature's $92.8 billion budget last year, calling it a fiscal train wreck, this year he built that amount into his proposal. He also built in $5.4 billion more in spending and revenues that quietly drove up the actual budget during the current year. He then added $1.5 billion in additional spending. 
The governor acknowledged his new mood this year, but attributed it to a strengthening economy. 
"New York's economy is coming back," Mr. Pataki told legislators in a 50-minute speech on Tuesday morning. He finished the speech by saying: "It is not in our character to look backward. We have endured tough economic times, but we are working our way forward, not back to our successes of the past, but straight ahead to a future of opportunities we have yet to discover."
The budget reflected the state's improving fiscal picture. While New York faced an $11.5 billion budget deficit last year, set off a surcharge on income taxes for the state's highest earners and an increase in the sales tax, this year's deficit was $5.1 billion, about $1 billion less than had been predicted earlier in the year. Mr. Pataki, like Mr. Bloomberg last week, said revenues were rising thanks to improvements on Wall Street and the financial services sector. However, he predicted deficits of $2.85 billion and $4.34 billion in the next two years.
During his address, the governor repeatedly spoke of the need to grow New York's economy and, several times, cited his goal of creating one million new private jobs in the next decade. Some of the loudest applause greeted his proposal to relieve local governments of the cost of Albany's mandates -- an issue that has become politically charged since a study last fall concluded that New Yorkers pay more of their income in local taxes than anywhere in the nation.
Mr. Pataki proposed that the state take over the local governments' share of Medicaid costs for long-term care. He said it would save localities $1.8 billion a year in the next 10 years.
Assembly Democrats, however, were quick to point out that savings to localities next year amount to little -- $173 million in New York City's fiscal year and $24 million worth of counties' $1 billion annual long-term care costs.
The governor proposed to increase education aidby $147 million, to $14.6 billion, including $56 million for New York City schools. As he did in 2001, he called for scrapping the current system of school financing formulas in the state and put forward a Flex Aid program, essentially consolidating seven separate categories of aid totaling $10 billion into a single fund.
But aides to the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, said that by applying the new formula in this budget, Mr. Pataki actually reduced, by $250 million, the amount of education aid more than 700 school districts would have received this year under the current education aid formulas.
What the governor did was set aside revenues from video lottery terminals at eight horse racing tracks as a special pot of money to address the court mandate. He said $325 million of that money would be available during next school year. Up to eight other sites with the terminals would be established around the state, and the combined revenue of the 16 would amount to $2 billion annually over the next five years, he expects. Michael Rebell, the executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, which brought the lawsuit that led to the Court of Appeals decision, said he was encouraged.
"We wanted at least $2 billion. We think that setting up a sound basic education fund is a good step forward, but it is a wobbly baby step when we need a giant leap," he said.
On the cost-cutting side, the governor likely faces some battles and the possibility that this budget could ultimately pass the $100 billion mark.
For instance, he faces resistance to a plan to have college students forgo a third of their scholarships until they graduate, though he proposes no tuition hikes for city university or state university students. Also, he has included a new assessment on hospitals and nursing homes, to raise $323 million next year, that many in the Capitol said would not be well received. He is also proposing to cut $186 million out of money for trade schools, school construction and school buses that will anger lawmakers, especially upstate.
"Very quickly, this adds up to serious money," one fiscal analyst said. 
In not allowing the sales tax exemption on clothing and shoe purchases of under $110 to sunset in June, the governor hoped to raise $440 million next year. The governor proposed instead allowing for four tax-free weeks during the year. Assembly Democrats called it the most regressive tax available and said it would drive customers out of the state.
"It is clear that the reality of this proposal does not move this state on to better things," Mr. Silver said, adding, however, that he was committed to working with Mr. Pataki "to craft a better budget for New Yorkers."

PILOTS AND MANAGERS TO DISCUSS FINANCES AT US AIRWAYS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The US Airways Group and its pilots union said yesterday that they would discuss ways to help the airline meet payment terms on a $1 billion loan that permitted it to leave bankruptcy protection last year. The US Airways Air Line Pilots Association said it would send a group to meet with company executives to extend a discussion begun last Thursday about the airline's finances and options. 
US Airways said earlier this month that it was considering the sale of some assets like its shuttle in the Northeast to help meet the terms of the loan, $900 million of which is guaranteed by the federal government. Theunion said it would not drop its demand that David N. Siegel, the chief executive, and Neal S. Cohen, the chief financial officer, step down.

 BODY:
When the president delivers his State of the Union address, we like to listen respectfully and respond politely. It is always easy to find things worth applauding. Last night, for instance, President Bush mentioned job retraining, immigration law reform and programs to help newly released prisoners re-enter society. The impulse is always to split the difference -- to decry the ideas we disagree with and then note the ones we like. This time, such evenhandedness seems impossible. The president's domestic policy comes down to one disastrous fact: his insistence on huge tax cuts for the wealthy has robbed the country of the money it needs to address its problems and has threatened its long-term economic security. Everything else is beside the point. 
 Mindful that American voters seem more concerned about their personal fortunes than Iraq's, Mr. Bush highlighted the domestic side of his agenda. His only look backward at the fiscal mess he created was to call on Congress to make his $1.7 trillion in tax cuts permanent. The cuts have been wedged into the budget temporarily to give the illusion that the books will come somewhere near balance over the long run. Chiseling them into stone will do nothing to spark the current economy, and if some future president feels the need to stimulate business, he or she will find precious few ways left to do it. 
 The idea that the cuts are a rough tool to shrink the federal government seems increasingly ludicrous, given the Republican Congress's determination to pork up every bill with new spending plans. There are only two reasons why Mr. Bush could be so determined to do the wrong thing: because his Congressional majorities mean that he probably can, and because the wealthy donors helping to underwrite his campaign expect that he will.
President Bill Clinton always pleased the public when he stuffed his State of the Union address with lots and lots of proposals, many small and symbolic. Mr. Bush, who devoted an entire paragraph to decrying the use of steroids in sports, stands second to nobody when it comes to tiny symbolic gestures. Many of his larger thoughts, meanwhile, were vague to the point of meaninglessness. (His references to energy and the environment took up less time than the anti-steroid agenda.) Among his proposals aimed at social conservatives, the bow to a constitutional amendment against gay marriage was the most disheartening. 
It is actually a cruel hoax to pretend that Washington can afford to do anything new, even with the modest grab bag of small new initiatives and familiar retreads suggested by the president. In that context, his decision last night to re-endorse the Social Security overhaul plan from his last campaign was terrifying.
Mr. Bush has long advocated that younger workers be allowed to set aside part of their Social Security tax payments for private investments in stocks or bonds. He has never explained how he would pay for such a plan. The Social Security taxes that come in are used to pay for the benefits of those already retired. If part of the current workers' money is redirected without corresponding tax increases, the difference would have to be made up through budget cuts or -- far more likely -- a disastrous addition to the amount of debt the government continues to roll up every day.
With such ideas floating in the speech, the prospect of community college tuition grants or computer training for the unemployed rings hollow.

HEADLINE: State of the Union; 
Abroad

 BODY:
Last night President Bush surveyed the state of his foreign policy over the past year and, unsurprisingly, gave himself high marks. In truth, while there have been achievements, the last year of war in Iraq and stubborn unilateralism on issues ranging from the use of military force to environmental policy and trade have dominated and strained America's relationships with most of the rest of the world. 
 While it is too early to draw final conclusions about the ultimate success of military operations in Iraq, the fact is that Mr. Bush's decision to engage American forces so heavily without reliable intelligence, real international backing, legitimate United Nations authority or serious postwar planning has exacted a high price, for which he did not account in the rather glossy assessment in his State of the Union address. In last year's speech, Mr. Bush made frightening allusions to Iraqi unconventional weapons presumably available for immediate use, almost all of them subsequently discredited. A pale echo of those inflated claims appeared last night as cryptic references to Iraqi "weapons of mass destruction-related program activities." 
 Itwas fitting that Iraq figured prominently in Mr. Bush's speech. No decent person regrets the toppling of a heinous dictator who murdered hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, and Mr. Bush can claim credit for his capture. Libya's decision to end its nuclear and other weapons programs and allow inspections was welcome. And Afghanistan is showing the first buds of a democratic government.
But at this point, Mr. Bush's optimistic talk of a "new Iraq" that is free and stable is anything but assured. Iraq's Shiite majority and Sunni and Kurdish minorities are grappling for advantage against an essentially arbitrary American deadline for turning over sovereignty to an interim government. American war deaths now stand at over 500, and combat is continuing. Washington is finally asking the U.N. to help smooth the transition to democracy and ensure international legitimacy. But that decision, however welcome it was, followed nearly a year of rudely ignoring U.N. procedures, undermining the authority of the U.N. and ignoring some of America's most important allies.
The burdens of occupying Iraq for what looks certain to be many months to come have severely strained the long-term capacity of American ground forces, both regular Army and reserves. And while the White House has focused its attention on Iraq, other compelling and dangerous crises have been more or less put on hold, at potentially grave risk. By abruptly shifting its attention to Saddam Hussein before fully consolidating peace in Afghanistan, Washington has contributed to a situation where the Afghan central government rules little more than Kabul. While Mr. Bush talked of the Afghans "building a nation that is free, and proud, and fighting terror," the Taliban have re-emerged as a serious force barely two years after what seemed a crushing military defeat. Afghan warlords, at best a fractious bunch and at worst a mortal threat to Afghanistan's democracy, have armies that dwarf the national government's forces. The border with Pakistan remains porous to members of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.
In the past year, North Korea has proceeded incrementally toward assembling a nuclear arsenal. Israeli-Palestinian relations have frozen into a seemingly intractable standoff, which poisons Arab attitudes toward the United States, yet the Bush administration is now making virtually no serious effort to push the hostile camps toward negotiations. And Mr. Bush's policies have badly damaged America's alliances with its most important economic and military allies in Europe. Latin American governments are more estranged from the United States than they have been for a long time. Washington was also centrally responsible for the collapse of trade talks that were aimed at ending the crushing unfairness of the rich nations' subsidies for crops that cannot compete on the open market.
Mr. Bush's one-sided emphasis on Iraq is not the only explanation for these multiple reverses, but it figures in all of them. That may explain why Mr. Bush largely passed over them last night.

HEADLINE: Strong Finish For Motorola Last Quarter 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY FEDER

 BODY:
Motorola, the nation's largest wireless communications equipment company, did its bit to support growing optimism in the technology sector yesterday by reporting stronger-than-expected earnings and sales in the last quarter of 2003.
 "We're seeing economic improvement across the board in the U.S. and the world," said Edward J. Zander, who succeeded Christopher B. Galvin two weeks ago as chairman and chief executive. 
 Like Nokia, the worldwide cellphone market leader, and several smaller rivals, Motorola saw a surge in the second half of 2003 in demand for cellphones, particularly those with cameras. But Motorola was unable to ship all the phones it could have sold, leaving it to the company's other businesses to produce the increases in profits and sales from a year earlier. 
Motorola said its wireless networking equipment segment and its integrated electronics unit, which is the leading supplier of electronic components to the auto industry, led its revenue growth. The integrated electronics unit and the group thatsells radio communications systems to government and industry led the increase in profits. Profits in the battered semiconductor unit, which Motorola is in the process of spinning off, jumped to $51 million from $7 million a year ago, excluding severance payments to laid-off workers and other one-time costs. 
"Over all, we had a very strong finish to the year," said Mike Zafirovski, president and chief operating officer.
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said it earned $489 million, or 20 cents a share, up 181 percent from the $174 million, or 8 cents a share, in the last quarter of 2002. Taking into account special charges like severance payments and write-downs in the book value of obsolete equipment, Motorola earned $409 million, or 17 cents a share, in the recent quarter, compared with $291 million, or 13 cents a share, a year ago.
The earnings topped the consensus expectations of analysts by 4 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial. Motorola's revenues for the quarter, $8.02 billion, were 4 percent ahead of the $7.7 billion the company achieved in the last quarter of 2002. Analysts had expected Motorola to report essentially flat revenues. 
Motorola also said that increased cash flow and reduction in its debt had left it with its strongest balance sheet in more than 20 years.
The spate of good news from other technology companies in recent weeks apparently had investors anticipating a strong performance. Before the earnings report was released, Motorola's shares closed up 10 cents, at $17.05, a 52-week high. But profit-taking then drove them as low as $16.80 in after-hours trading.
Analysts said the report left lingering concerns about the cellphone unit, which is Motorola's largest. The fourth-quarter sales and earnings would have been stronger had the company not fallen behind its shipping schedules for new models because of problems obtaining components. As it was, although sales jumped 12 percent from the third quarter of 2003 and orders rose 64 percent, the unit's $3.3 billion in revenue was down 3 percent from the last quarter of 2002.
Motorola said now that the new products are reaching market, it expects sales in the current quarter to be 20 to 25 percent higher than in the first quarter of 2003. That should help the company achieve total sales in the first quarter of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion, up 7 percent to 13 percent from a year ago, the chief financial officer, David Devonshire, said. 
But Mr. Devonshire's projection of 5 to 7 cents a share in earnings for the quarter was cautious enough to have contributed to the after-hours selling, said Brian T. Modoff, who follows Motorola for Deutsche Bank in San Francisco.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
In Position for the '04 Race

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Three years to the day after taking the oath of office, President Bush began his re-election campaign Tuesday night with a State of the Union address that blended potent reminders of his role as commander in chief of a nation at war with pledges to confront the domestic issues that his Democratic rivals hope may keep him from winning a second term.
 With Saddam Hussein in captivity, Afghanistan beginning to build a new government and the United States on the offensive against terror around the world, Mr. Bush opened his address recounting his record on national security, ground where polls show he is politically strongest. He used the word "war" at least 10 times and asserted, "Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for the better." 
 But he quickly turned to his own backyard, where polls show voters far less sure about his leadership, and there he used his speech to sketch out what amounted to a blueprint of a two-tiered campaign strategy that balanced compassionate appeals to swing voters on issues like the economy, health care and education with other issues popular with the conservative base he wants to rally.
"The values we try to live by never change, and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions, such as families and schools and religious congregations," Mr. Bush said, portraying himself as the national paterfamilias, fighting to protect the American way. "These institutions, these unseen pillars of civilization, must remain strong in America, and we will defend them."
Accordingly, he vowed to fight efforts by "activist judges" to define marriage as anything but the union of a man and a woman, and he called for new legislation barring discrimination in the awarding of federal grants and contracts to religion-based institutions that provide social services. He pledged a doubling of federal money for abstinence education in schools and modest new amounts for school drug testing "as a tool to save children's lives." 
The White House was so eager to highlight these passages that the president's chief political adviser, Karl Rove, telephoned social conservative groups on Tuesday to make sure they would be watching the speech. Afterward, leaders of some such groups expressed delight.
"I am thrilled, and our public is thrilled," said the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition. "While you have most of the Democratic candidates not supporting marriage in this emphatic way, it really leaves them on the wrong side of the issue."
Gary L. Bauer, a longtime conservative activist who sought the Republican presidential nomination against Mr. Bush in 2000, said: "I don't think he wants history to record that on his watch the fundamental definition of marriage was changed. I think it'll send a strong signal not only to his base, which of course feels strongly, but I think swing voters will, from the evidence, come closer to the Republican position. I think this is a plus all the way around."
Mr. Bush broke little new substantive ground on policy, instead highlighting his record of tax cuts and Medicare overhaul, declaring that a nascent economic recovery confirmed that "the American people are using their money far better than government would have," vowing that any effort to repeal his new prescription drug coverage under Medicare "will meet my veto.". He offered little in the way of money for proposed new programs, and indeed pledged to limit growth in "discretionary spending" while acknowledging that his efforts to fight terror and increase domestic security would require continuing costs.
Above all, in the splendor of the Capitol, Mr. Bush portrayed himself as the best defender of American interests, from tax cuts at home to terrorism abroad. And he reminded his listeners, and his Democratic rivals, that he begins this election year conspicuously atop the political equivalent of Everest, while the men who would replace him are scrambling in the foothills of the White Mountains. Mr. Bush spoke like a man who is headed to the Moon and Mars, while the Democrats are headed to Manchester, N.H.
The president's very prominence also makes him a target, and the closely contested Iowa caucuses on Monday and next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary show widespread sentiment for unseating Mr. Bush in a both Midwestern swing state that Al Gore barely carried in 2000, and a New England one that Mr. Bush narrowly won. If this is a moment of some triumph for the president, it is also a time of potential peril.
The nation remains sharply divided over Mr. Bush and his policies, especially his handling of domestic issues like the economy, education and health care, and largely opposed to his grand goals for space exploration. The situation in Iraq remains unsettled, and the public sentiment remains mixed over whether the American invasion was worth the cost in lives and treasure.
"The country is closely divided," a senior Bush campaign adviser acknowledged in Iowa on Monday. "That's a reality. It's not something to worry about. It's something to deal with. Ultimately, you talk about your policies and project a positive optimism for the country."
That is what Mr. Bush sought to do Tuesday night.
In his first State of the Union message two years ago, Mr. Bush set the nation on a course of confrontation with the "axis of evil," or Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and last year he laid out his case against Mr. Hussein, citing what later turned out to be sharply disputed British intelligence that Iraq had tried to buy uranium from Niger, in West Africa, and the threat of chemical and biological weapons that inspectors have yet to find. Both speeches had dark themes at their heart.
This year, Mr. Bush sounded continued warnings, noting that while 28 months had passed since Sept. 11, 2001, without further attacks on American soil, dangers remain.
But with his administration struggling to win broader international support for rebuilding Iraq, and United Nations backing for its efforts to create a new interim government there, Mr. Bush was also upbeat, insisting: "The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right."
He concluded by closely echoing the words Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote on the day he died, April 12, 1945, declaring: "My fellow citizens, we now move forward with confidence and faith." 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 27, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page news analysis article on Wednesday about the impact of electoral politics on President Bush's State of the Union address referred incorrectly to a statement in last year's address, about Iraqi efforts to acquire uranium. The president said Iraq had been seeking to buy uranium in Africa. He did not specifically mention the African country of Niger, though it was identified several weeks earlier -- along with Somalia and Congo -- in the National Intelligence Estimate provided to members of Congress on Iraqi purchase attempts.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE OVERVIEW; 
BUSH, SOMBER AND DETERMINED, STRESSES WAR AGAINST TERROR

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush warned Americans on Tuesday night that there could still be a terrorist attack on the United States and then presented a choice between his continued leadership and a return to the "dangerous illusion" that the threat had ended.
 In a 54-minute State of the Union address, Mr. Bush showcased the extent to which he will use his administration's fight against terrorism in his re-election campaign. He then moved on to a variety of domestic issues and forcefully questioned court cases that have opened the door to same-sex marriage. 
 The president said that if activist judges pressed the issue, "the only alternative" would be a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, a move that would endear him to his conservative supporters. "Our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage," Mr. Bush said. 
Addressing the central domestic issue this election year, Mr. Bush said that the economy was "growing stronger" and that his recipe of permanent tax cuts, trade promotion and added oil and gas drilling would further strengthen the recovery.
"We have not come all this way, through tragedy and trial and war, only to falter and leave our work unfinished," he said. "Americans are rising to the tasks of history, and they expect the same from us."
Mr. Bush offered a panoply of smaller domestic proposals like promoting sexual abstinence among teenagers, increased financing for drug testing in schools and a call for athletes to stop using steroids.
Reflecting the restrictions imposed on him by the growing budget deficit, many of the proposals carried relatively little or no cost. He never discussed one of his most potentially costly new proposals, his declaration last week that Americans would return to the Moon by 2020 and use that as a launching pad to Mars.
Mr. Bush cast himself as the steady commander in chief of what he portrayed as a nation at war, seeming to suggest that changing the leader midbattle was risky.
"Twenty-eight months have passed since Sept. 11, 2001, over two years without an attack on American soil, and it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us," he said in the somber tones he reserves for his most important speeches. "That hope is understandable, comforting and false." Transcript, Page A18. 
Mr. Bush put forth no major new foreign policy or domestic initiatives in an address that was as much about political drama as substance and that served as the president's grandest stage until his party's nominating convention in New York in September. Speaking to an estimated audience of 60 million people in an address that the White House scheduled a day after the caucuses in Iowa and a week before the primary in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush defended himself against the attacks by the Democratic presidential candidates on a wide range of foreign and domestic matters like tax cuts, Iraq and whether the war on terrorism is, as he put it, "a war at all." Mr. Bush most directly took on his critics over Iraq and the question of banned weapons.
"Some in this chamber, and in our country, did not support the liberation of Iraq," Mr. Bush said. "Objections to war often come from principled motives. But let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power."
Had his administration failed to act, Mr. Bush said, "the dictator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day."
Mr. Bush did not mention that American inspectors had found no unconventional weapons, the major stated reason that the administration went to war with Iraq.
There was an excited mood in the chamber of the House of Representatives, as there almost always is when a president delivers a State of the Union address. But the response to the remarks reflected the deep divisions between the two parties. Democrats sat silently at many points, particularly when Mr. Bush discussed the economy and his domestic initiatives.
The audience applauded 71 times, including sustained applause for one of Mr. Bush's guests, Adnan Pachachi, president of the American-selected Iraqi Governing Council. A year ago, Mr. Bush used his State of the Union address to make the case for military action against Iraq and devoted large sections of that speech to "a serious and mounting threat to our country" posed by Mr. Hussein's illicit weapons. 
This year, Mr. Bush only briefly mentioned the continuing searchby David Kay, the chief American weapons inspector in Iraq, but did not promise, as he had in the past, that the weapons would eventually be found.
The president began his talk with a discourse on what he called his administration's achievements in national security, an area where polls show that he has an enormous advantage over the Democrats. Mr. Bush cited as a prime accomplishment Mr. Hussein's capture in December. "The once all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole and now sits in a prison cell," Mr. Bush said, prompting one of the biggest rounds of applause of the evening. 
He devoted the second half of his speech to an area where he is far more vulnerable, the economy, which has lost 2.5 million jobs since he took office. 
In contrast to the celebratory partisan energy generated by speeches on Monday night by Senators John Kerry and John Edwards in Iowa, Mr. Bush's demeanor was one of sober gravitas as he sought to portray a mature, experienced leader who had guided the nation through the 9/11 attacks -- an accomplishment that no Democratic would be able to claim.
In a chamber missing the three senators who are seeking the Democratic nomination for president -- Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts, Mr. Edwards of North Carolina and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who were all in New Hampshire -- Mr. Bush made no mention of the Democratic races that were consuming the nation and his own political advisers. His goal, his aides said, was to portray himself as so immersed in the serious business of running the nation that he was little concerned with the Democratic fistfights playing out in a frigid corner of the Northeast.
On health care, an issue that has become a centerpiece of the Democratic campaigns, Mr. Bush offered an expansion and repackaging of plans that he has previously introduced, tax credits to help pay for insurance and health savings accounts that would encourage people to set aside money tax free for unreimbursed medical expenses.
"Our goal," he said, "is to ensure that Americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs." 
Democrats said the proposals fell far short of what was needed to help the 43 million Americans who lacked insurance and the additional millions whose household budgets were strained by health costs.
On immigration, Mr. Bush repeated his proposal to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrant workers, a plan that the White House hopes will appeal to Hispanic voters critical to Mr. Bush's re-election.
Mr. Bush repeatedly stressed that he had signed into law a new Medicare bill that provides a prescription drug benefit for retirees, a step that his party hopes will neutralize a traditional Democratic advantage. Similarly, Mr. Bush appealed to the political center by reminding the nation that he had signed a broad overhaul of education policy, the No Child Left Behind Act.
Mr. Bush's State of the Union address last year focused heavily on the impending Iraq war. In making his case for why Mr. Hussein posed a threat, the president said Iraq had failed to account for large stocks of biological and chemical weapons and appeared to be pursuing a nuclear weapons program. To bolster his case last Jan. 28, Mr. Bush uttered these 16 words that haunted him for months: "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa." 
Last summer, the White House acknowledged that intelligence behind the assertion was flawed, exposing Mr. Bush to criticism that he had deliberately exaggerated the threat.
On Tuesday night, Mr. Bush offered no specific evidence to back up his more general and much less disputed statement that "terrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world."
Mr. Bush said criticism about unilateral action in Iraq was misplaced, noting that at least 34 nations had contributed assistance to the United States. He mentioned in passing that the United Nations was participating in his efforts to restore sovereignty to Iraq. But he also made clear that there were limits to the United States' willingness to await international approval for military action against terrorists and nations that help them.
"America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush called for added spending on programs to help promote democracy in the Mideast, but did not mention his stalled plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
In a Democratic rebuttal, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota attacked Mr. Bush on foreign and domestic policy. Ms. Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Mr. Bush had pursued "a go-it-alone foreign policy that leaves us isolated abroad and that steals the resources we need for education and health care here at home."
Mr. Daschle, the Senate minority leader, said the "massive" tax cuts championed by Mr. Bush had not created the jobs the administration promised and had "instead led to an economic exodus."
Mr. Bush appeared well prepared for what is sure to be a year of intense partisan warfare. Alluding to the presidential race, Mr. Bush drew a distinction between his stewardship and his challengers.
"We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face a choice," Mr. Bush said. "We can go forward with confidence and resolve or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us. We can press on with economic growth and reforms in education and Medicare or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions."
With many crucial provisions of the Patriot Act set to expire on Dec. 31, 2005, Mr. Bush stepped into a potential minefield by calling for renewal of the law. Attorney General John Ashcroft has been leading the charge for the act as it has come under increasing attack from liberals and conservatives, who say it impinges on civil liberties. Democrats have promised to oppose renewing many important sections of the law, particularly those broadening government surveillance powers. Some critics in Congress applauded enthusiastically on Tuesday night when Mr. Bush noted that the law was scheduled to expire.

HEADLINE: Chief of Gruner & Jahr's U.S. Division Is Likely to Be Fired, Executives Say 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Daniel B. Brewster Jr., the chief executive of Gruner & Jahr USA Publishing who was brought aboard in 2000 to transform the company into a major magazine publisher, will soon find himself without a job after his bold plans faltered, according to two company executives. 
 Mr. Brewster met with the company's staff yesterday morning and acknowledged that he believed he was about to be fired, the executives said. Mr. Brewster's boss, Axel Ganz, a member of the board of Gruner & Jahr in Germany and its head of international publications, was flying to New York last night and could be meeting with Mr. Brewster as soon as this morning, they said. Mr. Ganz is expected to serve as interim chief executive of the division, which publishes Family Circle, Parents and Fast Company, among other magazines. 
 News of Mr. Brewster's imminent ouster was first reported in Der Spiegel, the German newsmagazine. Gruner & Jahr is based in Hamburg and is owned by Bertelsmann, the giant German media company. 
In the last year, Mr. Ganz has expressed support for Mr. Brewster, despite several public black eyes for the company, including a legal dispute with Rosie O'Donnell, a former business partner, and news that it had inflated circulation figures for several of its magazines.
Top executives at Bertelsmann have become increasingly uncomfortable with the negative press coverage of the company, according to the two executives at Gruner & Jahr. Mr. Brewster has also been involved in heated divorce proceedings, which also made Mr. Ganz and other members of the board uncomfortable, according to the two executives, who insisted on anonymity.
But it was Gruner & Jahr's poor financial results for 2003 that convinced the board it was time to make a change. After a significant turnaround in profits in 2002, the company failed to match that performance last year, falling far short of expectations, according to an executive.
Reached at home, Mr. Brewster, who is three and a half years into a five-year contract, said he had been assured by Axel Ganz that there had been "no determination of any change" in his job responsibilities.
Mr. Brewster, 48, developed a reputation as a strong publisher when he was chief executive of American Express Publishing, a partnership with Time Inc. He was seen as something of a savior for Gruner & Jahr when he was hired in 2000 by Thomas Middelhoff, then the chief executive of Bertelsmann. Mr. Brewster said then that he would double Gruner & Jahr's revenue within five years. 
The company acquired Inc., a magazine for small-business owners, for about $200 million just before Mr. Brewster arrived, and then bought Fast Company, a magazine focused on the new economy that had been growing at a rapid pace. But the purchase price of $360 million, along with the subsequent bursting of the Internet bubble and a plunge in advertising revenue, caused many to question the timing of the deal. 
Other magazine industry executives speculated that Gruner & Jahr might sell its holdings in the United States. The company sold its British holdings to the National Magazine Company, the British division of the Hearst Corporation, in 2000. And Bertelsmann has become a less aggressive company since Mr. Middelhoff left in 2002.
But the company has a major new venture planned here -- a celebrity picture magazine called Gala -- and Mr. Ganz, who now lives in Paris, has told the board that he will personally oversee its development.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Meat Eater No More" (letter, Jan. 16):
 I am distraught when I read that people are not eating beef for various reasons. 
Most of these reasons are based on misinformation and propaganda. 
 I raise beef cattle in Texas. Like most ranchers, I do not feed my cows anything other than grass, hay and supplements like grain and corn. Feeding anything else is inhumane and economically unwise, as it may jeopardize the cows' health.
Rest assured, Mr. and Mrs. Public, we want and will continue to deliver the best-tasting, safest food product to your table and ours.
My family will continue to eat beef because we believe in our product.

HEADLINE: No Foolproof Way Is Seen To Contain Altered Genes 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
A new report commissioned by the government suggests that it will be difficult to completely prevent genetically engineered plants and animals from having unintended environmental and public health effects. 
 The report, released yesterday by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, says that while there are many techniques being developed to prevent genetically engineered organisms or their genes from escaping into the wild, most techniques are still in early development and none appear to be completely effective. 
 "One of our big messages throughout the whole report is that there are very few bioconfinement methods that are well developed," Anne R. Kapuscinski, a professor of fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology at the University of Minnesota and a member of the committee that wrote the report, said at a news conference in Washington yesterday. 
Companies and scientists are now developing a wide range of genetically modified organisms: salmon that grow superfast, mosquitoes engineered not to transmit malaria, corn that produces pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals. 
One concern about these transgenic products is that their genes or the organisms could spread. Fast-growing fish, if they were to escape into the wild, might beat out regular salmon for food or mates, disrupting the ecological balance. Genes giving crops resistance to herbicides or insects might spread to weeds, making the weeds harder to eradicate. Pollen flow from corn engineered to produce a drug could allow the drug to get into corn destined for the food supply. 
Much of the efforts to prevent these effects have involved physical containment, like growing fish in tanks rather than the ocean or growing crops in greenhouses. 
But the new report, commissioned by the Department of Agriculture, looks at biological methods of containment, which it calls bioconfinement. These include measures like inducing sterility by giving fish an extra set of chromosomes or exposing insects to radiation. Bacteria might be given "suicide genes" that would cause them to self-destruct if they escaped. Crop scientists are working on a variety of techniques, including putting the foreign genes into the chloroplasts rather than the nucleus because chloroplast genes usually do not get into the pollen. 
In many cases, the report says, such bioconfinement will not be needed because the organisms will pose little risk. But it says that when it is needed, it might be useful to use more than one method at a time, since no single method is likely to be 100 percent effective. The report also says such bioconfinement methods are best considered early in the development of a genetically modified plant or animal rather than as an afterthought. 
The panel's report could have some bearing on issues now before regulators. It recommends, for instance, that nonfood crops be sought for growing pharmaceuticals or chemicals that need to be kept out of the food supply. 
This position is favored by many environmental and consumer groups and by food companies, which fear that a contamination incident would hurt sales and undermine public confidence in food safety. But the biotechnology industry has generally argued that it is most economical to use widely grown crops like corn and that these crops can be adequately isolated from crops grown for food.
The report also says there are weaknesses in the safeguards being taken by a company that is seeking Food and Drug Administration approval to sell salmon genetically engineered to grow faster. 
The company, Aqua Bounty Technologies of Waltham, Mass., has said it would sell to fish farms only female fish that have been sterilized, thereby eliminating the possibility that the fish could reproduce should they escape into rivers or the ocean. But the report says those methods alone might not be sufficient, in part because sterilization does not always work. It says the fish should be grown only in special inland facilities, rather than in cages in the ocean from which they might escape. 
Joseph B. McGonigle, vice president of Aqua Bounty, said there were errors in the report. "They clearly don't have a full grasp of both what we're proposing and how effective the technology is," Mr. McGonigle said. 
Consumer groups and the biotechnology industry differed on their interpretation of the report. 
Gregory Jaffe of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said the report's conclusion that there was no foolproof bioconfinement method suggested "there is a need to have a better regulatory system that assesses whether there are any risks to begin with." 
But the Biotechnology Industry Organization said in a statement that the report concluded that "technology providers have a variety of methods available to ensure confinement of organisms modified through biotechnology when risk warrants it." 
In another report issued yesterday, the National Research Council said urgent action was needed to preserve the Atlantic salmon in Maine, where the fish supply has been rapidly declining. The fish there constitute most of the Atlantic salmon population in the United States. A program of removing dams should start immediately, the report said.

HEADLINE: Despite Problems, Connecticut Has Low Corruption Rank 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
It might seem, from the headlines, that Connecticut has stumbled into an endless bog of government corruption. Gov. John G. Rowland is facing an impeachment inquiry after admitting last month that he lied about free work done on his private cottage by state employees. Prosecutors are said to be zeroing in on other officials, and in the past year alone, two big-city mayors have been convicted of federal crimes. 
 But residents of the state can take comfort: Connecticut is only the 31st most corrupt state in the union, at least according to one ranking. 
 That statistic comes from a survey released by Corporate Crime Reporter, a Washington-based newsletter. The survey ranks all 50 states by the number of public corruption convictions over the last decade per 100,000 residents.
 By that standard, Connecticut comes out a relatively healthy 2.16. It is in better shape than its neighbors New York and New Jersey, which rated 10th and 16th respectively.
 "Thank God for small favors," said John Pavia, a law professor at Quinnipiac School of Law. The news, he said, might even provide a new state tourism slogan: "Not as Corrupt as You Think." 
 A call to the state's Tourism Council to test out that phrase was not returned last night.
 At the same time, Mr. Pavia sheepishly pointed out that the survey runs from 1993 through 2002, and therefore does not include two of the most recent high-profile convictions. Last year, Bridgeport's mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, was convicted on a raft of corruption charges, and Philip A. Giordano, the former mayor of Waterbury, was convicted of sex crimes against children and admitted on the stand to taking bribes. In March, Mr. Rowland's former chief of staff admitted to taking bribes from a state contractor.
 Those cases have helped earn the "land of steady habits" a few unwelcome new nicknames, including Corrupticut. 
 In fact, despite its respectable ranking, Connecticut receives a long verbal spanking on the Corporate Crime Reporter's web site. 
 "Connecticut, for example, has a strong economy and an educated citizenry," writes Russell Mokhiber, the report's author, in a statement posted on the group's web site. "But its political economy has historically been weak, with little public debate about the level of corruption around it until federal prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's office in Hartford decided to force the issue out into the open."
 There were no such moralizing paragraphs on the site about Mississippi, which the survey rated the most corrupt state in the union (7.48 in numerical terns). The least corrupt, incidentally, is Nebraska, at 0.52.
 The survey's bald numbers may be a little unfair to states that have mounted especially vigorous efforts to root out corruption and racked up more convictions as a result. 
 "There is the suggestion that because a state ranks high on the list, not enough is being done, when that is not necessarily true," Mr. Pavia said.
 And of course, there are Democrats who say that Connecticut might rate better if not for its current Republican governor, whose administration has been accused of numerous ethical lapses since he was first elected in 1994.
 "I sincerely believe that the Rowland administration is an exception," said George C. Jepsen, the chairman of the Democratic State Committee. "He markedly changed the ethical tone when he came in."

HEADLINE: THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PLAN: THE MESSAGE; 
Pataki Proposes a Budget Even Lawmakers Can Love

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. MCKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
With the Republican National Convention coming to New York City, Gov. George E. Pataki is not looking for a budget fight this year like the battle that nearly crippled him politically last year.
 So he has put a $99.8 billion budget on the table that does not make deep cuts to education or health care. At the same time, he has tried to relieve counties and cities from some of the crushing burden of rising Medicaid and pension costs, which have inspired a revolt among property tax payers and local politicians. 
 The governor even promised to set aside $325 million from the expansion of gambling to pay for improving the schools in New York City, as the state's highest court has ordered, though Democrats immediately said it was too little and questioned whether it was wise to milk gambling addicts to help students. 
 On balance, however, Mr. Pataki appeared to be presenting the kind of budget one might expect in an election year, even though he is not running for election. The plan has a healthy 3.5 percent increase in spending, despite a $5.1 billion shortfall between revenue and expenses. 
 His remarks on Tuesday were a far cry from last year, when he declared he would never allow increases in "job-killing taxes" and proposed slashing the education budget by $2 billion. That plan led to a rebellion among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who passed tax increases over his veto. 
 This year, the governor stressed togetherness and optimism in his 55-minute budget address. Gone was his hard-line stance against raising taxes or spending. He talked of striking a balance between fiscal restraint and the need to improve education and provide health care. He spoke rosily of how the state was "beginning to emerge from a period of economic uncertainty to the dawn of a new era of hope and optimism." 
 "It's a different tone," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a veteran Manhattan Democrat. "I don't think he wants to fight the Legislature. The Legislature doesn't want a fight. It's not in anyone's interest to repeat last year's slugfest."
 Edmund J. McMahon, a conservative analyst with the Manhattan Institute, put it more cynically. "He's greased it up for passage," he said. "The way to get it passed is you spend up to levels the Legislature expects. It's an election year budget for them and he's tried as hard as possible to make it something they can pass easily."
 Some lawmakers said the governor was trying to be all things to all people and wondered if this would be possible to pull off when all the numbers were tallied up. 
 For beleaguered county executives, he promised a constitutional amendment banning laws that force local governments to pay for new programs without providing any money for them, a practice he has not been shy about endorsing in the past. He also pledged a state takeover of the cost of nursing homes over the next 10 years.
 For labor, he promised no new layoffs or further cuts to staff, ignoring the fact that he has not laid off anyone during the fiscal crisis of the last three years but instead employed a hiring freeze to trim the work force. For college students, he said he would not raise tuition this year, as he supporting doing last year, though he failed to mention that he wanted to save $227 million by making scholarship recipients forgo a third of their grants until after graduation.
 For the elderly, he said he would yoke state rebates for school property taxes to inflation. For farmers, he said he would create new tax benefits for agricultural businesses. For fiscal conservatives, he said he would raise the state's emergency reserve fund to $800 million. He also proposed a constitutional amendment to limit debt. 
 He threw a bone to manufacturers, promising to cut their taxes in five years by unifying the three taxes they now pay into one lower payment.
 Mr. Pataki even offered what looked very much like an olive branch to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who controls his chamber's Democratic majority. Every year since 1997, the governor has purposely cut money for preschool and for reducing class sizes, knowing these are two of the speaker's priorities. He has then forced the Assembly to buy back the programs with other concessions. Not this year. 
 The governor also tried to be diplomatic about the dust-up with lawmakers over this year's budget, which has ended up costing about $98.2 billion even though legislative leaders predicted it would only cost $92.8 billion. Asked if the Legislature was to blame for the steep rise in spending, the governor replied, "I don't want to look backward." 
 The governor also made some promises he might not be able to keep. For instance, there is his plan calling for a cap on the contributions the state and local governments make to the state's Common Retirement Fund, in a bid to save cities and counties about $800 million. But the comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat, has said the plan is not constitutional.
 Playing their usual loyal-opposition role, the Democrats immediately poured cold water on many parts of the governor's plan. Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, pounced on the governor for not putting more money in the budget for improving New York City schools and for relying on uncertain gambling revenue to pay for that court-ordered task. 
 Mr. Silver also criticized Mr. Pataki for extending sales taxes on clothing and raising taxes on nursing home and hospital bills, to collect more than $723 million, while talking about preserving tax cuts passed in previous years. "Once again the governor's rhetoric does not match the reality of his actions," he said.
 Even Mr. Pataki's Republican colleague, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who had little but praise for the governor's plan, said taxes on nursing home bills and the proposed expansion of gambling to pay for schools were "very troubling, very troubling."
 But these are minor disagreements in comparison with last year. This year's budget was more notable for what the governor did not do. Overall he allowed spending to grow $3.4 billion, even though many of the federal grants the state received last year for antiterrorism measures and health care are disappearing. He did not propose rolling back the temporary tax increases the Legislature passed last year to weather the fiscal storm. He even put a $147 million increase in education aid on the table, which will be a starting point for negotiations with legislative leaders, rather than the whopping reduction he started talks with last year.
 In short, Mr. Pataki is not spoiling for another showdown. Senator Bruno noted that the governor had balanced the budget "in a way that really is not extremely hurtful or painful." And Senator Stephen M. Saland, a Republican from Dutchess County, said that the budget address "was far less confrontational than last year." 
 "You can sense a different attitude, you just cannot sense a different budget," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat. "Clearly they want a less contentious process."

 At 48, Mr. White has had two heart attacks, one mild, the other serious. The first came in June 2002. But Mr. White, who has the bearing of a football player, hardly took much notice. He never even went to the hospital. The pain came -- a short firecracker burst -- and then subsided after he took a week off from his job as an assistant superintendent for the New York City Housing Authority. 
 The next attack, a month later, nearly killed him. Triple-bypass surgery saved him, but the damage, complicated by diabetes and hypertension, limited the functioning of his heart. Mr. White's doctors told him that his scarred heart operates only half as well as that of a healthy man. Which means that Mr. White is easily winded and has dizzy spells. 
He can no longer wrestle with his son, Steve, 13. And though he went back to work shortly after his second heart attack -- remembering his own father's decades-old lesson that providing for family is a man's primary responsibility -- Mr. White could not do the heavy lifting involved in cleaning and repairing boilers. 
"I'm very hardheaded, and I wanted to try to do what I'd always done," he said. "If I could work, I would. And I would probably drop dead on the job."
Retirement and rest were his only options. At the time, in August 2002, the mortgage payment on his two-story home was $1,605 a month, and his two older children were in private school. And his wife, Melissa White, 40, who also has heart disease, was unable to work because of her condition. Yet Mr. White's retirement pay was only $673 a month, 40 percent of his full-time salary. With the regular bills, Mr. White's situation was unworkable. 
This month, his benefits for Social Security, retirement and disability kicked in, but the economic fallout from the yearlong income reduction has been substantial. 
"The gas, light bills and mortgage backed up," he recalled. "And I was in and out of the hospital." 
In December 2002, Mr. White filed for bankruptcy to settle with his creditors. His payments amounted to $600 a month, but he was still strapped with the mortgage. Steve and Mr. White's daughter Victoria, now 12, were pulled out of private school to cut costs. But the mortgage was still due.
"I was about to lose everything I worked for," he said. "It's not much, but it's my house, and I didn't want to be sick and homeless."
Out of work and out of options, Mr. White and his wife turned last September to Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens. The agency is one of the seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"It took all I had as a man to ask for help; I had to swallow my pride when I went to Catholic Charities," Mr. White said. "But the day I called, they didn't turn me away."
He connected with Rosa Orihuela, a Catholic Charities caseworker. Ms. Orihuela gave Mr. White $555 from the Neediest Cases Fund to help the family with the mortgage arrears.
"I put myself in their shoes and their problems became mine," she said. "With all the problems he went through, he's still a survivor. I was grateful that I could help him through the fund."
Mr. White still has some back mortgage payments due, but Ms. Orihuela's assistance was a real gift.
"God bless Miss Rosa," he said. "She probably had a lot of cases, but she worked with me and helped me."
With his finances more manageable, Mr. White focuses on his health.
And though Mr. White, who talks in the soothing tones of a preacher, is a man of faith, he is also a realist. He wears a silver cross that rests on his stomach, but he can't forget the 12-inch scar that runs from the top of his chest to his navel.
"I know that God will keep me, but I know what's happening to me," he said. "I don't have the time that I think I need, so I have to set everything up." 
With this, Mr. White tried to hold back his tears, distracting himself by smoothing out the tablecloth. But they came anyway. And when talk turned to his youngest child, Tiana, 2, there were more tears. 
"She's so young and we're going through so much," Mr. White said. "Will we be there for her?" 
When Mr. and Mrs. White kneel in their bedroom, they pray for health and strength and endurance. They also pray for time. 
"I just want to make sure that when I leave, my kids will be O.K.," he said. "And that they know I did the best I could. I'm going to fight the good fight."

HEADLINE: Putin Eager to Show Russian Gains In Meeting With World Bank Head 

BYLINE:  By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin used a visit on Tuesday by the head of the World Bank to underscore his plans for economic improvements at home, as well as Russia's intention to forgive more debts owed by poor nations. 
 At a meeting here with the bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, Mr. Putin said Russia wanted to use its higher profile as a World Bank member to illustrate how its economic and financial situation had improved. The bank has given Russia about $8.4 billion in loans since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
 Russia will hold the presidency of the Group of 8 industrialized nations in 2006, and political analysts suggested that Mr. Putin wanted to illustrate that Russia had reached a level of prosperity strong enough to further distance itself from fiscally strapped countries. 
"For Putin, it's important that Russia stands up from its knees and becomes a full-fledged World Bank member, not as supplicants but as members of the global finance community," said Dmitri V. Trenin, director of research of the Carnegie Moscow Center. "And in terms of debt relief, Putin wants to rebuild Russia as an economic power. He understands that the basis of greatness in this day and age is economic." 
In remarks broadcast on national television, Mr. Putin said he would focus on "significant acceleration of economic growth" and "resistance to poverty." He also pledged that Russia would "continue improving its economic institutions, budget policy, financial markets and banking sector," as well as promoting small and medium-size businesses. 
Mr. Putin also said that Russia would intensify debt forgiveness to third world countries, but he did not say which ones. The Kremlin responded to calls by the United States to forgive Iraq's debt, wiping out more than half the $8 billion Soviet-era debt Iraq still owed to Russia in the hope that it would help Russian oil companies to do business there.

HEADLINE: Economic Talks Draw Elite to Davos, but Have No Salient Issue 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
The black-tie soiree, canceled last year because it might have seemed flippant during a buildup toward war in Iraq, has been reinstated. The executives and politicians have reserved suites in fancy hotels. As for security in these days of terror threats and alarms, the airspace over this snow-struck Alpine village will be closed and hundreds of police officers and up to 6,000 troops will be on patrol. 
 The World Economic Forum is once again luring the elite of business and governments and a handful of advocacy groups to the Alps, opening its annual session here on Wednesday. But this year, 2,100 participants from 94 lands are mulling developments in a world with no single political focus and no overwhelming economic certainties. 
 Since a midyear session in Jordan last June, the road map to peace in the Middle East has become an indistinct trail to no obvious destination, while the United States occupation of Iraq confronts a seemingly sustained insurgency. Signs of a global economic recovery conflict with worries about the weak dollar, corporate malfeasance, and other uncertainties stretching from China's boom to Europe's borrowing.
"This year you don't have an overriding issue," said Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the forum, whose participants this year are set to include, among others, Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general; Vice President Dick Cheney; former President Bill Clinton; President Mohammad Khatami of Iran; King Abdullah of Jordan; Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan; and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. A contingent of American business leaders will include Bill Gates of Microsoft; Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, Carleton S. Fiorina; and Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, Douglas N. Daft. L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Iraq, is also set to attend.
Participants will be looking for potential breakthroughs on some points, Mr. Schwab said. Mr. Annan and Mr. Erdogan may discuss United Nations plans for territorial resolution in Cyprus, whose northern part has been under Turkish occupation since 1974. And around 20 trade and economic officials -- though not the most senior trade negotiators from the United States or the European Union -- are set to talk about restarting the global trade talks that collapsed last September in Cancun, Mexico. Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bremer are likely to urge broader international backing for the American vision of transferring power in Iraq, meeting officials said. 
But there are notes of caution, too. One goal of the conference, Mr. Schwab said, will be to "make sure that people don't become euphoric" about the signs of global economic recovery. 
The five-day gathering is not meant to reach any binding conclusions. Under pressure from busy executives, the program has been slightly shortened and downtime for skiing scrapped. 
In recent years, the gathering, first held more than 30 years ago, has also acted as a lightning rod for opponents of globalization. Some groups have simply held their own meetings in Davos, but others have taken part in raucous protests. 
But this year, antiglobalization groups have not applied for permission to march in Davos itself. Instead, they plan to demonstrate in a nearby town, Chur. The Swiss police say some protesters may try to break through a police cordon to reach Davos.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: IOWA; 
Dean's New-Voter Strategy Seemed to Work, for Others

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and MARJORIE CONNELLY

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Although bringing out first-time voters was central to the strategy of Howard Dean, they largely supported Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina in the Iowa caucuses Monday, according to polls of voters as they entered the caucuses.
 This year, roughly 122,000 people attended the caucuses. That is twice the number of people who turned out in 2000, but less than the estimated 125,000 who turned out in 1988. 
 Unofficial results, with 99 percent of precincts reporting, show that Mr. Kerry drew 37.6 percent of the vote, Mr. Edwards 31.9 percent, Dr. Dean 18 percent, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt 10.6 percent. 
Entrance polls showed that 55 percent of the participants in the caucuses Monday night were attending for the first time, compared with 46 percent in 2000.
Mr. Kerry drew the support of 36 percent of this year's first-time voters, while Mr. Edwards drew 24 percent and Dr. Dean drew 22 percent.
The results seemed to challenge one of the fundamental premises of the Dean campaign -- that Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, could be powered to victory by people who had never voted before.
Dr. Dean may have inspired their interest in the political system. The polls indicate that first-time Iowa voters who made up their minds more than a month ago stuck with him.
But they also show that first-time voters who made up their minds more recently were more likely to vote for Senators Kerry or Edwards than for Dr. Dean.
Political scientists said this dynamic indicated that many of those undecided first-timers could have been influenced by what the political scientists saw as Dr. Dean's missteps in the last few weeks and a conclusion that he would not be able to beat President Bush in November.
"Dean had an awful couple of weeks," said Dennis J. Goldford, chairman of the department of politics and international relations at Drake University here. 
"Toward the end, he fouled up enough, either in verbal gaffes or his inability to take criticism in the normal give and take of hardball politics, that he made a lot of people nervous."
The polls were conducted by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International for the National Election Pool of television networks and The Associated Press. They questioned 1,666 people as they arrived Monday night for the caucuses in 50 precincts throughout Iowa. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Dr. Dean drew 32 percent of first-time caucusgoers who made up their minds more than a month ago, while Mr. Kerry attracted 28 percent.
Of the first-time attendees who decided more recently, 39 percent supported Mr. Kerry, while 29 percent backed Mr. Edwards. Only 18 percent backed Dr. Dean.
The only real differences between first-time voters and others were that they were younger, more likely than experienced caucusgoers to rely on the Internet for information about politics and less likely to identify strongly as Democrats.
This year 17 percent of all caucusgoers were under 30; by comparison, four years ago only 9 percent were under 30.
In terms of issues that were important to them, first-time voters generally were no different from other voters. 
Thirty percent of first-timers (29 percent of all voters) said the economy was most important, and 27 percent said health care (28 percent of all voters). Only 12 percent of first-timers (14 percent of all) said the war in Iraq -- Dr. Dean's signature issue -- was of paramount importance, although 70 percent disapproved of the war (75 percent of all).
Political scientists said that candidates' claims of bringing out new voters are rarely borne out in election results.
In the recall of the California governor last year, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the leading Republican and the eventual winner, asserted that he could inspire new voters. Polls by Edison/Mitofsky showed that only 3 percent of California voters said they had never voted before, and another 3 percent said they rarely voted. Of that 6 percent, about half voted for Mr. Schwarzenegger.
"It's a very populist message to push: 'I've got new voters who are upset with the process,' " said Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. 
But Mr. Smith said that particularly when the new voters were expected to be young, the numbers could fall short.
Mr. Goldford of Drake agreed, noting also that the campaigns left themselves vulnerable if they relied on youthful volunteers. "You can't run a professional presidential campaign on a kiddie corps," he said. "Lots of folks said they had been approached by Dean people and that they were enthusiastic, but then they would wander off and talk about where they went to college and what their major was. Iowans don't want to be told by kids from out of state how to vote."
Moreover, the 122,000 Iowa caucusgoers represented only about one in five of all registered Iowa Democrats. So even if they were all first-time voters, there were still far more people who were not inspired to turn out.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE CHAMBER; 
A Celebration With Prickly Undertones

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
A presidential State of the Union address is always a bit like a wedding, a stately, yet celebratory occasion that lays out a grand vision for the future. But when the State of the Union is delivered in an election year, just one day after a blistering contest among Democrats seeking to defeat a Republican president, the celebration can turn a bit prickly.
 That was certainly the case on Tuesday night, as President Bush took his vision for the nation to a Capitol riven by politics. 
 In the Senate, Democrats were still parsing the surprise victory of one of their colleagues, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, in the Iowa caucuses on Monday. Some House Democrats, meanwhile, bemoaned the withdrawal of Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the former Democratic leader, from the race. In both chambers, they cast aside the usual niceties that accompany the annual State of the Union address -- hours before the speech even began. 
Some, like Representative Robert Wexler, Democrat of Florida, went so far as to issue news releases lambasting the address in advance. Others, like Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, simply made their views known in the course of hallway conversations with reporters.
"I'm told that the thrust of the message from the president will be 'stay the course,' " Mr. Dorgan said Tuesday afternoon. "If that's true, the message is off track."
Republicans, for their part, welcomed the president with the kind of warmth and good cheer reserved for a conquering hero -- or at least a commander in chief.
Mr. Bush took pains to remind his audience that the United States was still a nation at war. But he also laid out what Senator Bill Frist, the Republican leader, called a "very aggressive" domestic policy agenda, including initiatives on health care, space exploration and immigration. Many of these initiatives have little or no chance of passing Congress this year, but Republicans went out of their way to praise them nonetheless.
"It demonstrates leadership to tough problems, tough challenges with demonstrated leadership -- boldness, vision, courage, looking for the future," Dr. Frist said, "and we all like that in our leadership, and we all admire it tremendously."
The speech came on the first day of the new Congressional session, and many lawmakers had not seen one another since Thanksgiving. But the extended winter break did little to ease the bitter partisan bickering that prevailed on Capitol Hill last year, and some members of Congress were clearly looking toward Mr. Bush to help lift the tone.
"For several weeks now, the president has been hammered by candidates in Iowa and elsewhere, and so that can't help but take its toll," said Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska. "I hope the president can rise above it, and I hope that if he offers to be conciliatory, that it will be accepted."
Every State of the Union address is both a statement of policy and politics, and this year's address, coming at the outset of the presidential election season, was no exception. The White House's choice of guests -- among them military people, including an Army chief warrant officer who participated in the raids to capture Saddam Hussein, and a woman who stands to benefit from the new Medicare prescription drug legislation -- served to highlight what Mr. Bush sees as his domestic and foreign achievements.
The timing of the speech reflected the political season as well. The White House artfully scheduled the address in a manner that would draw attention from the Democratic contests in Iowa and New Hampshire; last year, the State of the Union speech was delivered on Jan. 28. 
Republicans on Capitol Hill seemed especially eager for a shift in the news.
"The president's got a great story to tell about what he's accomplished for America the last three years," said Senator Rick Santorum, a member of the Republican leadership.
Noticeably absent from the Capitol were the three Senate Democrats running for president -- Mr. Kerry and Senators John Edwards and Joseph I. Lieberman -- as well as Representative Gephardt and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, all of whom were in New Hampshire campaigning.
Mr. Kucinich gave his own state of the union address in New Hampshire, with a decidedly different spin. He proclaimed the country is "in a perilous condition due to fear, war, tax cuts to wealthy Americans, and trade policies leading to widespread unemployment."
Also absent was Senator Trent Lott, the Mississippi Republican, who was asked by Senator Frist to watch the speech in a secret location -- a precaution that would ensure the survival of at least one member of Congress should the Capitol come under a terrorist attack.
Absent, as well, was the sense of good will toward the president that some Democrats felt last year as Mr. Bush addressed the nation. Republicans had just taken control of both houses of Congress, and lawmakers had several months earlier authorized Mr. Bush to use force against Iraq. As the president laid out his case for war, some Democrats applauded alongside their Republican colleagues.
Among them was Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the Democratic whip in the House. Asked Tuesday morning if he would clap this year, Mr. Hoyer reiterated his strong support for ousting Mr. Hussein as the right thing to do. But he followed with this caveat, about Mr. Bush: "His domestic program has been an abject failure, and I'm certainly not going to cheer and holler about empty rhetoric."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: RETIREMENT; 
Bush Promotes Earlier Proposals for Tax-Advantaged Savings Accounts

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush hinted at big plans on Tuesday about overhauling Social Security and restated demands to make the last rounds of tax cuts permanent, but he made only fleeting references to new initiatives.
 Alluding to his oft-stated goal of privatizing Social Security, Mr. Bush said that "younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirement account." 
 But the president is not expected to propose an immediate shift from Social Security in his pending budget. Rather, administration officials say they plan to recycle a proposal from last year to expand tax-advantaged savings accounts. 
Mr. Bush's limited agenda reflects pressure from conservative Republicans as well as Democrats to rein in a budget deficit that could approach $500 billion this year.
Though Mr. Bush demanded that Congress make last year's tax cuts permanent, he repeated recent pledges to reduce the deficit by half over the next five years and hold the growth in discretionary spending to 4 percent a year.
And though he promised an initiative called "Jobs for the 21st Century," which included extra help to schools and community colleges, Mr. Bush provided no hint of how much money he would spend. 
Mr. Bush previously proposed a $3 billion program to help unemployed workers pay for job training, but the proposal never passed Congress and he did not allude to it again this year. 
The administration's proposals for big new tax-advantaged savings plans -- one for retirement, another for savings for any purpose -- have the virtue of allowing Mr. Bush to think big without spending much money, at least over the course of the next few years. As proposed last year, a married couple would be able to set aside up to $15,000 a year in a "lifetime savings account" and thousands more in so-called retirement savings accounts.
People would still have to pay taxes on money they contribute, but not on any investment income that accrues after that. Besides allowing people to set aside more money than before, the proposal would allow people to withdraw money from the "lifetime" accounts whenever they want and for whatever purpose.
The problem, some economists say, is that the proposals would do little in themselves to solve the basic long-term problem of Social Security, which is that the so-called trust fund faces eventual insolvency as the nation's 75 million baby boomers reach retirement age over the next several decades.
And over the longer term, they say, the proposed savings accounts could cost tens of billions of dollars a year as more and more of the nation's investment income becomes entirely shielded from taxation.
Many experts, Republican and Democratic, predict that Mr. Bush will make only limited progress on major tax initiatives this year. 
Making the tax cuts permanent would cost more than $1 trillion over the next decade, according to estimates last summer by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and none of the recent tax cuts expire in the next year.
"I don't see them pushing on anything hard except possibly a half-hearted effort to make the tax cuts permanent," said Bruce Bartlett, a longtime Republican tax expert who is now a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a policy research group.
Economists at the Brookings Institution estimated that, 25 years from now, the new savings accounts could cost the United States Treasury $50 billion a year in lost tax revenue.
Under the proposals first put forward one year ago, a married couple would have been able to set aside up to $15,000 a year in a "lifetime savings account" and as much as $15,000 more in the "retirement" accounts.
Last year, Congressional Republicans persuaded the White House to back away from the proposals, largely because they were trying to push Mr. Bush's big tax-cutting plan at the time. 
This year, administration officials are fine-tuning the ideas and shifting the emphasis from the extremely liberal "lifetime" accounts to the more restrictive "retirement" accounts that could be used only once a person reached retirement age.
Many Republican proponents of the idea see them as a back-door approach to a much more fundamental overhaul of Social Security itself.
"You never actually mention Social Security, but you build up these big private retirement accounts and then at some point it's much easier to cut the growth in Social Security benefits," said Kevin Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who supports the proposals. Mr. Hassett said costs over the first 10 years have been estimated at about $7 billion, which is almost pocket change in the context of tax politics.
President Bush campaigned for president four years ago in part on the idea of privatizing Social Security by allowing people to invest in their own private investment accounts rather than contribute to the government's program.
To truly privatize Social Security, as Mr. Bush and many Republican lawmakers want to do, experts say the government would face up to $1 trillion in "transition costs." These are the costs to cover payments to existing retirees at a time when the next generation of retirees is no longer contributing to the Social Security trust fund.
Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who has worked at length on a bipartisan plan to modernize tax-advantaged savings accounts, said the administration's proposal last year amounted to more of a tax shelter for current earnings than a way to promote retirement savings. "I'm pleased that the president is raising the issue of savings, but the focus needs to be on retirement savings," Mr. Cardin said Tuesday, before the president's speech.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE GUESTS; 
In Gallery, The Faces Highlight The Policies

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
When President Bush acknowledged Adnan Pachachi, the current chairman of the Iraqi Governing Council, in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, the gesture was not merely a formality. If earlier parts of the speech were meant to underscore a continuing commitment to fighting terrorism, the nod to Mr. Pachachi highlighted the administration's hopes for an easing of the sacrifices that this commitment has thus far entailed.
 "Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future," the president said before he turned to Mr. Pachachi, who was sitting next to Laura Bush in the House gallery along with other invited guests. "Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation." 
 The guests were chosen, as has been the custom since President Ronald Reagan first welcomed personal invitees in 1982, to lend human faces to the list of initiatives outlined in Mr. Bush's address. But in this election year, as Democrats try to point to weak spots in administration polices -- both foreign and domestic -- the assorted faces in the balcony also served as glimpses of the issues the administration may use to shape the direction of the campaign.
While some were invited so as to shine an optimistic light on troublesome issues like Iraq, others were chosen to personify hard-won victories, like the recently signed law overhauling Medicare. Some were there to underscore an upturn in the economy, others to showcase the administration's resolve to continue with initiatives like wider federal financing of community service programs run by religious organizations.
Among several invited members of the military was Chief Warrant Officer Stephen Douglas Combs Jr. of Fall River, Mass., who, the White House said, participated in the capture of Saddam Hussein.
Joining Mr. Pachachi as a face in the next phase of Iraqi reconstruction was Rend Rahim Francke, the Governing Council's senior diplomatic representative in Washington.
While there were plenty of guests signifying a show of strength in foreign policy, there were also many invited to highlight accomplishments on domestic issues, including the new Medicare law.
One was Elsie Blanton, who administration officials said would greatly benefit from the legislation. Ms. Blanton, from Apopka, Fla., spends $900 a month on prescription drugs, the White House said, roughly three-quarters of her monthly income from Social Security. She stands to save $6,000 to $9,500 a year when the new benefit goes into effect in 2006, the president said.
Eileen Halter, a small-business owner from Ottoville, Ohio, was present as a symbol of the recovering economy. Ms. Halter runs an engraving company and benefited significantly from Mr. Bush's tax cuts, the White House said -- so much so, officials said, that her company will hire 50 new employees this year.
Several of those present were from religion-based community service organizations, invited to signal a continued commitment to the president's initiative to provide federal money to such groups for drug treatment programs.
One of those guests was Julio Medina, a drug dealer turned counselor. Mr. Medina graduated from the New York Theological Seminary while serving a lengthy prison sentence. He now runs the Exodus Transitional Community, a religion-based counseling center in East Harlem that is dedicated to issues related to addiction and AIDS.
Others attending included Tom Brady, the quarterback for the New England Patriots, to whom television cameras turned when the president called on star athletes to stand up against the use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Mr. Brady and his teammates, who are headed to the Super Bowl, run a sports camp for local youths.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: OPPOSITION RESPONSE; 
Democrats Say President Is Out of Touch With Americans

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Democrats in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail accused President Bush of ignoring the economic struggle of working-class Americans in his Tuesday night address and called him the architect of a flawed foreign policy.
 Democratic presidential candidates, campaigning in New Hampshire, quickly weighed in after the speech ended, saying Mr. Bush has failed to deliver on earlier promises on medical care and education and was offering a picture starkly at odds with the experiences of Americans dealing with job losses and inadequate health care coverage. 
 "After four years in office, this president still doesn't understand what's happening in living rooms across this country," said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, trying to build on his win Monday in the Iowa caucuses. 
Gen.Wesley K. Clark called the speech "nothing but special effects" to hide policy shortcomings. Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, said the president's "empty proposals do nothing to address the real problems facing working Americans -- problems his presidency has only made worse."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said Mr. Bush was trying to "camouflage his irresponsible, divisive, right-wing agenda and repackage himself as a centrist compassionate conservative around election time."
Senator John Edwards of North Carolina said the speech shows Mr. Bush "believes that compassionate language and empty slogans will make working Americans forget the burdens they face every day." 
In their formal, nationally televised response, the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, and the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, staked out their policy ground for the new Congressional session as well as the campaign season. Mr. Daschle pointed to the president's call to make permanent a set of tax cuts already adopted Congress.
"Rather than a society that restricts its rewards to a privileged few, we need an 'opportunity society' that allows all Americans to succeed," Mr. Daschle said.
Ms. Pelosi, like several other Democrats, faulted Mr. Bush on his handling of the war on Iraq.
"The president led us into the Iraq war on the basis of unproven assertions without evidence," she said. "He embraced a radical doctrine of pre-emptive war unprecedented in our history; and he failed to build a true international coalition."
As they exited the House floor after the State of the Union address to give media interviews, Democratic lawmakers were provided a list of points comparing the president's claims with policy on a variety of issues including job training, the environment and retirement savings.
Democrats on Capitol Hill are bracing for a confrontational year, and party leaders see a benefit in the competitive Democratic presidential primary, saying the anti-Bush message delivered by the contenders helped amplify what Democratic lawmakers in Congress were saying.
"The fact that they are out there being critical of Bush and talking about problems with his domestic issues helps us," one senior Democratic Congressional aide said.
Democrats also raised contrasts between the president's space initiative and what they saw as unmet domestic needs. "In education, we promised to leave no child behind, but this president now proposes going to Mars, where there is no education for children," said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House.
Ms. Pelosi, who previously sat on the House Intelligence Committee, praised American troops serving overseas but said Mr. Bush "has pursued a go-it-alone foreign policy that leaves us isolated abroad and that steals the resources we need for education and health care here at home." She urged the president to work through international institutions.
"Instead of billions of dollars in no-bid contracts for politically connected firms such as Halliburton, and an insistence on American dominance in Iraq," Ms. Pelosi said, "let us share the burden and responsibility with others, so that together we can end the sense of American occupation and bring our troops home safely when their mission is completed."
Mr. Daschle, who faces a tough re-election fight in a state where Mr. Bush is popular, left most of the foreign policy critique to Ms. Pelosi and concentrated on economic and social issues. He said the nation's "first challenge is to strengthen the economy -- the right way." 
He said Democrats would propose tax cuts intended to boost manufacturing companies as a way to create good-paying jobs in the United States. He also said Mr. Bush had not followed through on his commitment to education and that his economic policies were hurting states to an extent that was causing a steep rise in college tuition costs.
"Since President Bush took office, the average tuition at a four-year public college has increased by nearly $600," Mr. Daschle said. "The America our parents gave us was a place in which everyone had a chance to go to a good school, and then to college, community college or vocational school, regardless of family income. Our children deserve nothing less." 
The themes of the Democrat response, which the two minority leaders first laid out in a speech last week, were struck by other leading Democrats on Capitol Hill and will be a persistent part of the exchanges between the two parties this year.
"I think what you're going to see is a contrast in priorities," Mr. Daschle said, discussing the coming session in a meeting with reporters. "The president will talk tonight about going to Mars and the Moon. We think that there are challenges here at home that ought to be addressed."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: REPUBLICANS; 
Kerry Is Seen As Strong But Beatable

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Republicans involved in President Bush's re-election effort said Tuesday that Senator John Kerry would be a more formidable opponent thanHoward Dean in November but just as vulnerable to Republican attacks.
 Mr. Bush's campaign team spent Tuesday assessing Mr. Kerry's strengths, which they said were considerable but not yet enough to guarantee the nomination. They also said they believed that Dr. Dean's chances of halting his slide were slim. 
 Despite the upended Democratic field, Bush campaign officials and outside Republican strategists said that the outcome of the Iowa caucuses would not lead to any fundamental change in political strategy for the White House. Mr. Bush's advisers have said for months that they expect a hard-fought race with the Democratic nominee and that they are prepared to run against any of the leading candidates.
"This field is every bit as left-leaning today as it was last week," a Bush campaign official said. "The front-runner today is every bit as negative as the front-runner was last week." 
Even so, for months there had been a general assumption within the Bush campaign and among the pollsters and strategists who work with the White House that Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, was the most likely nominee. But Mr. Bush's team had always hedged its bets and continued to plan for the possibility that another candidate could break out of the pack and overtake Dr. Dean.
In an effort to show that they were not caught completely off guard, Republicans cited on Tuesday an internal memorandum written in November by Matthew Dowd, the Bush campaign's director of strategy, which said that the Democratic field was "very fluid" and that Dr. Dean was showing signs of vulnerability. Among them was a "1.1 to 1 image ratio," jargon meaning that as Dr. Dean became better known, "as many people in America dislike him as like him," the memorandum said.
Looking ahead to the Democratic convention in Boston in July, several Republicans suggested they would cast Mr. Kerry, of Massachusetts, as a second coming of Michael S. Dukakis, the state's former governor who, as the 1988 Democratic nominee, lost badly to Mr. Bush's father. Mr. Kerry, they noted, was once Mr. Dukakis's lieutenant governor.
A prominent Republican who works with the Bush team said that Mr. Kerry would be tagged as a "Kennedy Democrat" whose long record of Congressional votes provided a rich vein for Bush campaign researchers looking to define him as out of step with the country on social and economic issues.
The Bush team has assembled thick files on the records of all the major Democratic candidates and has devised tactics for running against any of them. In recent weeks, it has dispatched Ed Gillespie, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to Arkansas, the home state of Gen. Wesley K. Clark, to deliver an attack on him, reflecting concern at the White House that he could emerge as a challenger with a case to make against Mr. Bush's foreign policy record.
Mr. Kerry, they said, offers a particularly big target. Unlike Dr. Dean, who as a governor did not take positions on many national issues, or Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who has been in the Senate only six years and has a thin record of votes and policy initiatives, Mr. Kerry is serving his fourth term in the Senate, with positions on nearly every public policy issue. 
Unlike Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, whose record on Capitol Hill includes many votes that deviated from liberal orthodoxy on both domestic and foreign policy, Mr. Kerry, they said, has a record -- especially on social and economic issues -- that is easier to portray as too far left for the country.
"He's got one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate," said Charlie Black, a longtime Republican strategist, previewing the way in which the Bush campaign would try to define Mr. Kerry. "Unlike a Lieberman or someone without a voting record, it's going to be very hard to get him out of the left corner."
But Republican strategists said Mr. Kerry had attributes Dr. Dean did not, including a credible claim to experience in foreign policy and a compelling biography. 
"In comparison to Dean, I see Kerry as being much more presidential," said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster. "He has made a transition you don't often see senators or congressmen make when they run for president. When you run for a legislative body, voters ask if you are smart enough to legislate. When they are voting for presidents or governors, they ask if you are strong enough to govern. Through the back and forth, Kerry has grown into emphasizing the strength of leadership."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION; 
President's State of the Union Message to Congress and the Nation

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's State of the Union address, as recorded by The New York Times:
 America this evening is a nation called to great responsibilities. And we are rising to meet them. 
 As we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American service men and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror. By bringing hope to the oppressed, and delivering justice to the violent, they are making America more secure. 
 Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger lists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are patrolling our coasts and borders. And their vigilance is protecting America.
 Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world. The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief you passed is working. Tonight, members of Congress can take pride in the great works of compassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible. You're raising the standards for our public schools; and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under Medicare.
 We have faced serious challenges together -- and now we face a choice. We can go forward with confidence and resolve -- or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us. We can presson with economic growth, and reforms in education and Medicare -- or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions.
 We've not come all this way -- through tragedy, and trial, and war -- only to falter and leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to the tasks of history, and they expect the same from us. In their efforts, their enterprise, and their character, the American people are showing that the state of our union is confident and strong.

Security
 Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people. Twenty-eight months have passed since September the 11th, 2001 -- over two years without an attack on American soil -- and it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us. That hope is understandable, comforting -- and false. The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombassa, Jerusalem, Istanbul and Baghdad. The terrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world. And by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated.
 Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us. And one of those essential tools is the Patriot Act, which allows federal law enforcement to better share information, to track terrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets. For years, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers. If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting terrorists. Key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire next year. The terrorist threat -- the terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens. You need to renew the Patriot Act. America is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war.
 Last March, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a mastermind of September the 11th, awoke to find himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani authorities. Last August the 11th brought the capture of the terrorist Hambali, who was a key player in the attack in Indonesia that killed over 200 people. We're tracking Al Qaeda around the world -- and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed. Thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on the manhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves -- and, one by one, we will bring these terrorists to justice.
 As part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists, and could supply them with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. The United States and our allies are determined: We refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger.
 The first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made Afghanistan the primary training base of Al Qaeda killers. As of this month, that country has a new constitution, guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women. Businesses are opening, health care centers are being established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan are back in school. With the help from the new Afghan Army, our coalition is leading aggressive raids against the surviving members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation that is free, and proud, and fighting terror -- and America is honored to be their friend.
 Since we last met in this chamber, combat forces of the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Poland and other countries enforced the demands of the United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein -- and the people of Iraq are free. Having broken the Baathist regime, we face a remnant of violent Saddam supporters. Men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows.
 These killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a serious, continuing danger. Yet we're making progress against them. The once all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole, and now sits in a prison cell. Of the top 55 officials of the former regime, we have captured or killed 45. Our forces are on the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day, and conducting an average of 180 raids a week. We are dealing with these thugs in Iraq, just as surely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein's evil regime.
 The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last January, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man. Today our coalition is working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law, with a bill of rights. We're working with Iraqis and the United Nations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the end of June. As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear. They are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends. But the United States of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. The killers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom.
 Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future. And tonight we are honored to welcome one of Iraq's most respected leaders: the current president of the Iraqi Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi. Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation. Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for the better. Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction programs, including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons. Colonel Qaddafi correctly judged that his country would be better off, and far more secure, without weapons of mass murder. Nine months of intense negotiations involving the United States and Great Britain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not. And one reason is clear: For diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible, and no one can now doubt the word of America.
 Different threats require different strategies. Along with nations in the region, we're insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear program. America and the international community are demanding that Iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons. America is committed to keeping the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the world's most dangerous regimes.
 When I came to this rostrum on September the 20th, 2001, I brought the police shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end. I gave to you and to all Americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies. And this pledge, given by one, has been kept by many. You in the Congress have provided the resources for our defense, and cast the difficult votes of war and peace. Our closest allies have been unwavering. America's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless. And the men and women of the American military, they have taken the hardest duty. We've seen their skill and their courage in armored charges, and midnight raids, and lonely hours on faithful watch. We have seen the joy when they return, and felt the sorrow when one is lost. I've had the honor of meeting our servicemen and women at many posts, from the deck of a carrier in the Pacific, to a mess hall in Baghdad. Many of our troops are listening tonight. And I want you and your families to know: America is proud of you. And my administration, and this Congress, will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror.
 I know that some people question if America is really in a war at all. They view terrorism more as a crime, a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments. After the World Trade Center was first attacked in 1993, some of the guilty were indicted and tried and convicted, and sent to prison. But the matter was not settled. The terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations, and drawing up more ambitious plans. After the chaos and carnage of September the 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers. The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States and war is what they got. 
 Some in this chamber, and in our country, did not support the liberation of Iraq. Objections to war often come from principled motives. But let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power. We're seeking all the facts. Already the Kay Report identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations. Had we failed to act, the dictator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day. Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been revealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world. Iraq's torture chambers would still be filled with victims -- terrified and innocent. The killing fields of Iraq -- where hundreds of thousands of men and women and children vanished into the sands -- would still be known only to the killers. For all who love freedom and peace, the world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a better and safer place.
 Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized. This particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in Britain, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands, Norway, El Salvador and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to Iraq. As we debate at home, we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners, or dismiss their sacrifices. From the beginning, America has sought international support for our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much support. There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of many nations, and submitting to the objections of a few. America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people.
 We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater Middle East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken, and condescending, to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government. I believe that God has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom. And even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades, it will rise again.
 As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny and despair and anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of America and our friend. So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater Middle East. We will challenge the enemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher standard from our friends. To cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian. And soon, a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region. I will send you a proposal to double the budget of the National Endowment for Democracy, and to focus its new work on the development of free elections and free markets, free press and free labor unions in the Middle East. And above all, we will finish the historic work of democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq, so those nations can light the way for others, and help transform a troubled part of the world.
 America is a nation with a mission -- and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire. Our aim is a democratic peace -- a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman. America acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side, yet we understand our special calling: This great republic will lead the cause of freedom.

The Economy
 In the last three years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the American economy. We have come through recession and terrorist attack and corporate scandals and the uncertainties of war. And because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this economy is strong and growing stronger.
 You have doubled the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, and you have lowered taxes for every American who pays income taxes.
 Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy forward. The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years. New home construction: the highest in almost 20 years. Home ownership rates: the highest ever. Manufacturing activity is increasing. Inflation is low. Interest rates are low. Exports are growing. Productivity is high. And jobs are on the rise. These numbers confirm that the American people are using their money far better than government would have -- and you were right to return it.
 America's growing economy is also a changing economy. As technology transforms the way almost every job is done, America becomes more productive, and workers need new skills. Much of our job growth will be found in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology. So we must respond by helping more Americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy.

Education
 All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too long, for too many children, those skills were never mastered. By passing the No Child Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country. We're providing more funding for our schools, a 36 percent increase since 2001. We're requiring higher standards. We are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals. We're reporting results to parents, and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing. We are making progress toward excellence for every child in America.
 But the status quo always has defenders. Some want to undermine the No Child Left Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability. Yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense: We expect the third graders to read and do math at third grade level, and that is not asking too much. Testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind. This nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics. I refuse to give up on any child -- and the No Child Left Behind Act is opening the door of opportunity to all of America's children. At the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now. Many of the fastest-growing occupations require strong math and science preparation, and training beyond the high school level. So tonight I propose a series of measure -- measures called Jobs for the 21st Century. This program will provide extra help to middle- and high school students who fall behind in reading and math, expand Advanced Placement programsin low-income schools, invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in our high schools. I propose larger Pell Grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school. I propose increasing our support for America's fine community colleges, so they can -- I do so so they can train workers for industries that are creating the most new jobs. By all these actions, we will help more and more Americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country.

Taxes and Jobs
 Job training is important, and so is job creation. We must continue to
 pursue an aggressive, pro-growth economic agenda.
 Congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes. The tax reductions you passed are set to expire. Unless you act -- unless you act -- unless you act, the unfair tax on marriage will go back up. Unless you act, millions of families will be charged $300 more in federal taxes for every child. Unless you act, small businesses will pay higher taxes. Unless you act, the death tax will eventually come back to life. Unless you act, Americans face a tax increase. What Congress has given, the Congress should not take away: For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed should be permanent.
 Our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employees with relief from needless federal regulation, and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits. Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote conservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy. My administration is promoting free and fair trade, to open up new markets for America's entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers, and to create jobs for American workers. Younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirement account. We should make the Social Security system a source of ownership for the American people.
 And we should limit -- and we should limit the burden of government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayers' dollars. In two weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets important domestic needs, while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than four percent. This will -- this will require that Congress focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's money. By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years.

Immigration
 Tonight I also ask you to reform our immigration laws, so they reflect our values and benefit our economy. I propose a new temporary worker program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers, when no Americans can be found to fill the job. This reform will be good for our economy -- because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system. A temporary worker program will help protect our homeland -- allowing border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security. I oppose amnesty, because it would encourage further illegal immigration, and unfairly reward those who break our laws. My temporary worker program will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law, while bringing millions of hardworking men and women out from the shadows of American life.

Health Care
 Our nation's health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of change. Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives. This dramatic progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance. Members of Congress, we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country.
 Meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort -- and two months ago, you showed the way. By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit, you kept a basic commitment to our seniors: You are giving them the modern medicine they deserve.
 Starting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs -- and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional $600 to buy medicine. Beginning next year, seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease, and seniors just entering Medicare can receive wellness exams.
 In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare. For a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half. Under this reform, senior citizens will be able to keep their Medicare just as it is, or they can choose a Medicare plan that fits them best, just as you, as members of Congress, can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs. And starting this year, millions of Americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical expenses, in a health savings account.
 I signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors, or to take away their prescription drug coverage under Medicare, will meet my veto.
 On the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that Americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs. To make insurance more affordable, Congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs. Small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates, so they can cover more workers with health insurance -- I urge you to pass Association Health Plans. I ask you to give lower-income Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance. By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs and improve care. To protect the doctor-patient relationship and keep good doctors doing good work, we musteliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits. And tonight I propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage, as part of our new health savings accounts, be allowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their taxes.
 A government-run health care system is the wrong prescription. By keeping costs under control, expanding access and helping more Americans afford coverage, we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes America's health care the best in the world.

Drug Abuse
 We're living in a time of great change, in our world, in our economy, in science and medicine. Yet some things endure: courage and compassion, reverence and integrity, respect for differences of faith and race. The values we try to live by never change. And they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions, such as families, and schools and religious congregations. These institutions, these unseen pillars of civilization, must remain strong in America, and we will defend them.
 We must stand with our families to help them raise healthy, responsible children. And when it comes to helping children make right choices, there is work for all of us to do.
 One of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and futures on drugs. Our government is helping parents confront this problem, with aggressive education, treatment, and law enforcement. Drug use in high school has declined by 11 percent over the last two years. Four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001. In my budget, I have proposed new funding to continue our aggressive,community-based strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs. Drug testing in our schools has proven to be an effective part of this effort. So tonight I propose an additional 23 millions for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children's lives. The aim here is not to punish children, but to send them this message: We love you, and we do not want to lose you.
 To help children make right choices, they need good examples. Athletics play such an important role in our society, but, unfortunately, some in professional sports are not setting much of an example. The use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball, football and other sports is dangerous, and it sends the wrong message -- that there are shortcuts to accomplishment, and that performance is more important than character. So tonight I call on team owners, union representatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the right signal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now.

Sex and Marriage
 To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face -- even when they are difficult to talk about. 
Each year, about three million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them, or kill them, or prevent them from ever becoming parents. In my budget, I propose a grass-roots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks. 
We will double federal funding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact of life: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Decisions children now make now can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives. All of us -- parents and schools and government -- must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture, and to send the right messages to our children.
A strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization.
Congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton. That statute protects marriage under federal law as the union of a man and a woman, and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states. Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process. Our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.
 The outcome of this debate is important -- and so is the way we conduct it. The same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in God's sight.

Social Services
 It's also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion of America's religious institutions. Religious charities of every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country: mentoring children, feeding the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely. Yet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups, just because they have a cross or a Star of David or crescent on the wall. By executive order, I have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based charities. Tonight I ask you to codify this into law, so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate -- them -- against them again.
 In the past, we've worked together to bring mentors to children of prisoners and provide treatment for the addicted, and help for the homeless. Tonight I ask you to consider another group of Americans in need of help. This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society. We know from long experience that if they can't find work or a home or help, they are much more likely to commit crimes and return to prison. So tonight, I propose a four-year, $300 million Prisoner Re-Entry Initiative to expand job training and placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups. America is the land of second chance and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.
 For all Americans, the last three years have brought tests we did not ask for and achievements shared by all. By our actions, we have shown what kind of nation we are. In grief, we have found the grace to go on. In challenge, we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people. In victory, we have shown the noble aims and good heart of America. And having come this far, we sense that we live in a time set apart.
 I've been witness to the character of the people of America, who've shown calm in times of danger, compassion for one another, and toughness for the long haul. All of us have been partners in a great enterprise. And even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic times. Last month a girl in Lincoln, R.I., sent me a letter. It began, "Dear George W. Bush. If there is anything you know, I, Ashley Pearson 2 -- age 10, can do to help anyone, please send me a letter and tell me what I can do to save our country." She added this P.S.: "If you can send a letter to the troops please put, 'Ashley Pearson believes in you.' "
 Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops has just been conveyed. And yes, you have some duties yourself. Study hard in school, listen to your mom or dad, help someone in need, and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform, say "thank you." And, Ashley, while you do your part, all of us here in this great chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of America safe and free.
 My -- my fellow citizens, we now move forward, with confidence and faith. Our nation is strong and steadfast. The cause we serve is right, because it is the cause of all mankind. The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable -- and it is not carried forward by our power alone. We can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years. And in all that is to come, we can know that his purposes are just and true.
 May God continue to bless America.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION; 
Response of Democratic Party Leaders to President Bush's Address to Congress

 BODY:
Following is the response by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, to the State of the Union address, as recorded by The New York Times:

Ms. Pelosi
 The state of our union is indeed strong, due to the spirit of the American people -- the creativity, optimism, hard work and faith of everyday Americans. 
 The State of the Union address should offer a vision that unites us as a people -- and priorities that move us toward the best America. For inspiration, we look to our brave young men and women in uniform, especially those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their noble service reminds us of our mission as a nation -- to build a future worthy of their sacrifice.
Tonight, from the perspective of 10 years of experience on the Intelligence Committee working on national security issues, I express the Democrats' unbending determination to make the world safer for America -- for our people, our interests and our ideals.
Democrats have an unwavering commitment to ensure that America's armed forces remain the best-trained, best-led, best-equipped force for peace the world has ever known. Never before have we been more powerful militarily. But even the most powerful nation in the history of the world must bring other nations to our side to meet common dangers.
The president's policies do not reflect that. He has pursued a go-it-alone foreign policy that leaves us isolated abroad and that steals resources we need for education and health care here at home.
The president led us into the Iraq war on the basis of unproven assertions without evidence; he embraced a radical doctrine of pre-emptive war unprecedented in our history and he failed to build a true international coalition.
Therefore, American taxpayers are bearing almost all the cost -- a colossal $120 billion and rising. More importantly, American troops are enduring almost all the casualties -- tragically, 500 killed and thousands more wounded.
As a nation, we must show our greatness, not just our strength. America must be a light to the world, not just a missile.
Forty-three years ago today, as a college student standing in the freezing cold outside this Capitol Building, I heard President Kennedy issue this challenge in his Inaugural Address: "My fellow citizens of the world," he said, "ask not what America will do for you, but what working together we can do for the freedom of man."
There is great wisdom in that, but in it there is also greater strength for our country and the cause of a safer world.
Instead of alienating our allies, let us work with them and international institutions so that together we can prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and keep them out of the hands of terrorists.
Instead of billions of dollars in no-bid contracts for politically connected firms like Halliburton, and an insistence on American dominance in Iraq, let us share the burden and responsibility with others, so that together we can end the sense of American occupation and bring troops home safely when their mission is completed.
Instead of the diplomatic disengagement that almost destroyed the Middle East peace process and aggravated the danger posed by North Korea, let us seek to forge agreements and coalitions -- so that, together with others, we can address challenges before they threaten the security of the world.
We must remain focused on the greatest threat to the security of the United States -- the clear and present danger of terrorism. We know what we must do to protect America, but this administration is failing to meet the challenge. Democrats have a better way to ensure our homeland security.
One hundred percent of containers coming into our ports or airports must be inspected. Today, only 3 percent are inspected. One hundred percent of chemical and nuclear plants in the United States must have high levels of security. Today, the Bush administration has tolerated a much lower standard.
One hundred percent communication in real time is needed for our police officers, firefighters and all our first responders to prevent or respond to a terrorist attack. 
Today, the technology is there, but the resources are not. One hundred percent of the enriched uranium and other material for weapons of mass destruction must be secured.
Today, the administration has refused to commit the resources necessary to prevent it from falling into the hands of terrorists.
America will be far safer if we reduce the chance of terrorist attack in one of our cities than if we diminish the civil liberties of our people.
As a nation, we must do better to keep faith with our armed forces, their families and our veterans. Our men and women in uniform show their valor every day. On the battlefield, our troops pledge to leave no soldier behind. Here at home, we must leave no veteran behind. We must ensure their health care, their pensions and their survivor benefits.
The year ahead offers great opportunity for progress and perhaps new perils still hidden in the shadows of an uncertain world. But you, the American people, have shown again and again that you are equal to any test. Now your example summons all of us in government, Republicans and Democrats, to a higher standard.
This is personal for all of us, in every community across this land. 
As a mother of five, and now as a grandmother of five, I came into government to help make the future brighter for all of America's children. As -- as much as at any time in my memory, the future of our country and our children is at stake.
Democrats are committed to strengthening the state of our union -- to reach for a safer, more prosperous America.
Together, let us make America work for all Americans -- let us restore our rightful role of leadership in the world, working with others for "the freedom of man."

Mr. Daschle
 Let there be no doubt -- the state of our union is strong -- stronger than the terrorists who seek to harm us and stronger than the challenges that confront us. At the same time, we know that our union can be stronger still.
The president spoke of great goals, and America should never hesitate to push the boundaries of exploration. But neither should we shrink from the great goal of creating a more perfect union here at home.
In his speech, the president asked us to double the budget of the National Endowment for Democracy. He asked us to make permanent the tax cuts already passed. And he asked us to use Social Security money to pay for it. For the last couple of weeks, I've been traveling through my home state of South Dakota, visiting the people and small towns that are America's backbone. The folks I met are good people. They're happy to help others around the world. But they're asking something, too: What about us? When do our priorities become America's priorities?
Rather than a society that restricts its rewards to a privileged few, we need an opportunity society that allows all Americans to succeed. Our opportunity society has at its foundation good jobs, a solid education and quality health care that is affordable and available. We believe that we have to honor the promises we've made to the millions of familieswho worked hard, played by the rules and have earned a retirement of dignity.
Our first challenge is to strengthen the economy -- the right way. The true test of America's economic recovery is not measured simply in quarterly profit reports, it's measured in jobs. The massive tax cuts that were supposed to spark an economic expansion have instead led to an economic exodus. To make up for the three million private-sector jobs that have been lost on the president's watch, the economy would have to create 226,000 jobs a month through the end of his term. Last month, the economy created only a thousand new jobs. That's not good enough. America can't afford to keep rewarding the accumulation of wealth over the dignity of work. Instead of borrowing even more money to give more tax breaks to companies so that they can export even more jobs, we propose tax cuts and policies that will strengthen our manufacturing sector and create good jobs at good wages here at home. We can also show our patriotism while strengthening agriculture and rural America by labeling all food products with their country of origin.
Education is the second key to our opportunity society. Two years ago, the president signed a new education law. The heart of that law was a promise. The federal government would set high standards for every student and hold schools responsible for the results. In exchange, schools would receive the resources to meet the new standards. America's schools are holding up their end of the bargain -- the president has not held up his. Millions of children are being denied the better teachers, smaller classes and extra help that they were promised.
At the same time, the president's tax cuts have put states in such a bind they're being forced to raise the cost of college. Since President Bush took office, the average tuition at a four-year public college has increased by nearly $600. The America that our parents gave us was a place in which everyone had a chance to go to a good school, and then to college, community college or vocational school, regardless of family income. Our children deserve nothing less.
Third, our opportunity society is built on the belief that affordable, available health care is not a luxury, but a basic foundation for a truly compassionate society.
Today, 43.6 million Americans -- almost all of them from working families -- have no health insurance. That's over 3.8 million more than when President Bush took office. Those Americans lucky enough to have health insurance have seen their premiums go up each of the last three years. The increase in premiums that middle-income families have seen over the past three years is actually larger than the four-year tax cut that they've been promised. This is an invisible tax increase on middle-class families.
Tonight, three years into his administration, the president acknowledged that the rapidly rising cost of health care, and the increasing number of Americans with no health coverage, are problems. But tax cuts he proposed are not a solution. Tax cuts will do little to make health care more affordable or reduce the number of people without insurance, and they will weaken health coverage for those who have it now.
When I was driving around South Dakota this summer, I met a nurse in Sioux Falls who has cancer. She told me that she couldn't afford the $1,500 a month her drugs cost. She told me that she was going to die -- that she was a lost cause. But, she said, we must solve this problem; don't turn more people into lost causes.
We believe that the federal government should use the power of 40 million Americans to lower prescription drug prices and to allow us to get more affordable drugs from Canada -- instead of forbidding both. Drug companies and insurance companies are the only ones who benefit from that restriction -- not the American people -- and that's why we want to change it.
In our vision of an opportunity society, promises made to those who have worked a lifetime will be honored in retirement. That's why we believe that America's pension system needs to be strengthened, and that Social Security's benefit should be a guarantee, not a gamble.
Only when every American who wants to work can, when every child goes to a good school and has the opportunity to go further, only when health care is available and affordable for every American, when a lifetime of work guarantees a retirement with dignity and when America is secure at home and our strength abroad is respected not resented -- only then will we have a union as strong as the American people. Thank you for listening, good night, and God bless America.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION; 
The Democratic Candidates in Their Own Words

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from responses by Democratic presidential candidates to the State of the Union message.

Wesley K. Clark
 Tonight, more than eight million Americans are out of work. But President Bush will pledge to spend trillions to privatize Social Security and make his tax cuts for the very rich permanent, locking in an unfair advantage for those who need it least. 
 He'll spend billions on the war in Iraq, missile defense and sending a man to Mars. But he's going to spend a grand total of $120 million for job training. That's just $15 for each unemployed American. That's not much more than the cost of bus fare to the training center, lunch and coffee. 
Tonight, 44 million Americans still don't have health care. But President Bush won't do nearly enough to make health care truly affordable. He won't do nearly enough to make health care truly accessible.

Howard Dean
 George Bush's empty proposals do nothing to address the real problems facing working Americans: problems his presidency has only made worse. On creating jobs, providing health care, and educating our children, I wish this president could learn from our example in Vermont, where we delivered real results for families. . . .
The state of the union may look rosy from the White House balcony or the suites of George Bush's wealthiest donors. But hard-working Americans will see through this President's effort to wrap his radical agenda with a compassionate ribbon.

John Edwards
 Tonight, the president said that the state of our union is confident and strong. The first question you and I need to ask is, "Which union, Mr. President?" His America -- the country where the Washington lobbyists, special interests and his C.E.O. friends get what they want, when they want it -- is doing just fine. But in our America, the state of working Americans is a struggle every single day. 
What this president fails to understand is that we still live in two different Americas: one for the privileged few, and another for everybody else. Instead of proposing ideas that would help heal our great divides, he is dividing us even further and believes that compassionate language and empty slogans will make working Americans forget the burdens they face every day.

John Kerry
 After four years in office, this president still doesn't understand what's happening in living rooms across this country. Paul O'Neill is right: because this president only hears the special interests and lobbyists he doesn't see what's happening in our economy, in the workplace and to families everywhere.
I'm running for President because it's time we put country over campaign contributions.
Tonight, President Bush talked about how he wants to help people find jobs, but for three years he's stood by while we've lost more jobs than at any time since the Great Depression. He promised to create 250,000 jobs last month, but he's only created a thousand. We're 249,000 jobs short. Americans should be able to trust that what the President tells them is true.

Dennis J. Kucinich
 The President mentioned the words "terror" and "terrorism" so many times tonight that it's clear to me that he is promoting a culture of fear. It's unfortunate because he could have done something more calming and healing for the nation. Instead he chose to continue to raise the red flag of terror.

Joseph I. Lieberman
I've spent the last year listening to Americans, and the state of the union that George W. Bush lives in is very different from the state that most hard-working Americans are living in. In fact, he seems to be in a state of denial about the state of our economy, our health care system and our relations with the world. 
Right on schedule, George W. Bush is trying to camouflage his irresponsible, divisive right-wing agenda and repackage himself as a centrist compassionate conservative around election time. But no amount of election year conversions, extraplanetary travel or hollow gestures can cover up this president's leadership failures and his extreme politics.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE VOTERS; 
Floridians and Oregonians Offer Mixed Reaction to Words on War and the Economy

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH and SARAH KERSHAW; Abby Goodnough reported from Miami and Sarah Kershaw from Seattle. Reporting was also contributed by Dennis Blank in Winter Park, Fla., Brian Libby in Portland and Matthew Preusch in Seattle.

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
In the perennial swing state that is Florida, there was little unanimity among several groups watching the State of the Union address.
 In Oregon, meanwhile, the high unemployment rate colored the reactions of viewers watching the speech. 
 An immigration lawyer in Miami Beach rained scorn on President Bush's defense of the war on Iraq. Retirees in Winter Park, outside Orlando, praised Mr. Bush's every word, saying he had made the world safer, while college students watching from a bookstore here perked up only at his education proposals. 
The lawyer, David Shahoulian, noted with irritation that Mr. Bush had made little mention of his original reasons for going to war. 
"He started and ended with 'Life is better without Saddam,' and no one can argue with that," Mr. Shahoulian, 32, said as he watched the speech in a friend's living room in South Beach. "But the reasons we went to war -- the guy's supposed weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda -- he just kind of stuck that in the middle."
But at Winter Park Towers, an apartment complex for retirees in a wealthy suburb of Orlando, Roland Lee, a retired civil engineer who is 80, applauded Mr. Bush's urging that the Patriot Act be renewed.
Mary Danielson, 80, a former nurse, added, "It would be more dangerous than ever if Saddam was still in power."
In Oregon, where the unemployment rate was at 7.3 percent in November, the economy weighed heavily on voters interviewed. In 2000, the state's voters split 47 percent to 47 percent for George W. Bush and Al Gore, with 5 percent voting for Ralph Nader.
Oregon's outcome was almost as close as Florida's, which required a recount that lasted weeks and determined that Mr. Bush won the state by just 537 votes.
Richard L. Johnston, 73, a retired civil engineer for Southern Pacific Railroad and a Korean War veteran, watched the speech in his living room in northeast Portland with his wife and his dog, a chocolate Lab named Mocha. Twenty-five minutes into the speech, when Mr. Bush was still discussing Iraq, the war on terror and various foreign policy threats, Mr. Johnston sounded irritated, saying, "Let's get to the economy here."
When the president did turn to the economy and talked about economic growth, Mr. Johnston was skeptical. "You won't convince anybody in Oregon it's better," he said.
While he was critical of Mr. Bush on the economy, Mr. Johnston said he agreed with the president's approach on security.
"I go along with him on the home security and so forth," he said, "some of these things we should have been doing before."
Sam and Linda Dahan, also residents of Portland and both unemployed, had a similar reaction to the time Mr. Bush spent on foreign policy versus the economy. 
"It's been a jobless recovery and he didn't address that in my mind," said Mr. Dahan, 49, who was laid off last year from a high-technology firm, Electro Scientific Industries. "I hear that the economy is going up, but I don't see it for me."
Ms. Dahan, 53, was laid off in 2001, from the Portland marketing department of Enron. "I'm not a Bush basher," she said, "but I felt like it was just a pep rally."
Ms. Dahan said she was torn in 2000 between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, ultimately voting for Mr. Gore. Mr. Dahan, an immigrant from Morocco, is not yet an American citizen and thus could not vote, but he said he would have voted for Mr. Gore.
Mr. Dahan said he was disturbed by the president's prominent and early discussion of the Patriot Act.
"I really regret that we've lost some of our freedoms," he said. "It echoes through history that when freedoms are taken away they are very hard to bring back."
Jim Burns, 64, a retired cherry and apple farmer from Milton-Freewater, in northeast Oregon, is a registered Republican who voted for Mr. Bush in 2000 and said he agreed with his assertion that it was America's role to pursue the "thugs" and "killers" of the world.
"I'm a believer in the war on terror," he said. "I think we have to clean the world up and we're the only ones who can do it."
Mr. Burns, however, was critical of Mr. Bush's plan to grant temporary work permits to millions of undocumented workers.
"I oppose amnesty," he said, adding that other farmers in the Walla Walla River Valley, where migrant workers -- including several who worked for him -- pick the Bing cherries and Red Delicious apples during their harvests, agreed. 
During the address, Mr. Burns said that the plan was still too vague for him to understand it. "When he said, 'no amnesty,' that helped, but really, he didn't expound on it so much that I know a heck of a lot more than I knew about it before."
Mr. Burns said that while he recognized the importance of immigrant labor to the nation's economy, he opposed citizenship for those who entered the country illegally.
In Miami, Mr. Shahoulian, the immigration lawyer, said Mr. Bush's plan for immigration reform was not nearly as strong as two other sets of proposals that came earlier, which he feared would now be shelved. The main problem with Mr. Bush's plan, he said, was that it provided no path to permanent citizenship.
Mr. Shahoulian also cringed at Mr. Bush's mention of tax cuts, saying that they were not justifiable. "We had a giant surplus when he passed them, but all the surplus has disappeared," he said. "And now he wants to make the tax cuts permanent?"
At a bookstore on the campus of Florida International University in Miami, most of Mr. Bush's talk about tax cuts and the economy meant nothing to the handful of students watching the speech. But Grisell Gomez, 23, was struck by Mr. Bush's statement that the deficit would be cut in half over the next five years. She wondered how he could do it without reversing his tax cuts.
In Winter Park, however, John Hailand, 86, a former research executive, was of a different mind. "The tax cuts did a great deal to get us back on our feet," he said.
Suzanna Sharkey, who watched the speech with Mr. Shahoulian in her South Beach apartment, said the president's emphasis on national security and the war in Iraq made her sick with frustration. A teacher at a school for juvenile offenders, Ms. Sharkey, 35, said Mr. Bush should invest less in the military and more in education.
"He's spending what, $84 billion on this war?" she said. "And I have kids coming to school who can't even afford health care and don't have enough money to buy lunch."

HEADLINE: Algerian Refinery Closed for Inquiry After Blast That Killed 27 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: ALGIERS, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Algeria's state oil company said Wednesday that the Skikda refinery, which produces most of its refined oil exports, would remain closed indefinitely after a deadly explosion at a neighboring gas plant on Monday. 
 The explosion in Algeria, which is the second largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, killed 27 workers and closed Algeria's largest refinery and oil port. 
 "Skikda is closed and will remain closed until the technical inquiry is finished," a spokeswoman for Sonatrach, the state oil and gas company, said. 
The company's chief executive, Mohamed Meziane, said on state radio that it would cost $800 million to rebuild three damaged units that process liquefied natural gas. 
Initial reports suggested that a faulty boiler at one of the units caused the accident. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said an independent commission would investigate the cause of the explosion. 
Oil prices in the United States reached a 10-year high of $36.37 a barrel on Tuesday because the accident added to concerns about supplies being tested during bitter winter cold. 
Algerian officials said the final toll was 27 workers dead and 72 injured. Most of the injured have been discharged from hospitals. Officials said at least 20 victims had been identified. 
The accident will hurt the Algerian economy, which is almost entirely dependent on the export of hydrocarbons. 
Hydrocarbons brought in $24 billion last year, or 96 percent of the country's export revenues. 
Mr. Meziane, the Sonatrach executive, rejected harsh criticism from Algerian newspapers that the plant had poor safety measures and that the accident could have been prevented. He said safety measures had helped limit the damage. 
On Tuesday, Algeria invoked a contract clause allowing a supplier to suspend its obligations in extreme unforeseen circumstances. 
The Sonatrach spokeswoman said exports had ceased at the port, which is on the Mediterranean Sea 310 miles east of Algiers. 
The Skikda complex employs 12,000 workers and produces 335,000 barrels a day of refined products. Skikda typically makes 10 to 13 shipments of naphtha a month of more than 27,000 tons each. 
Algeria is the world's fifth largest gas producer and a quarter of its gas shipments leave from Skikda, all to southern Europe. 
Hit by a decade of Islamic rebel violence, Algeria is to be the host of the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, on Feb. 10, when OPEC will set supply and pricing policy for the second quarter, beginning April 1.

HEADLINE: Malaria on the Rise 

 BODY:
Malaria, a disease forgotten in wealthy countries, is advancing, killing a million people or more a year, at least 700,000 of them African children. In many nations, some people spend several months a year ill from malaria, a toll that cripples African economies. One reason for malaria's resurgence is that it has evolved to resist the two standard treatments. In East Africa, chloroquine, the most widely used drug, fails two-thirds of the time, and a newer treatment is useless in nearly half of the cases. 
 A better treatment exists, but the world is adopting it far too slowly. It is a two-drug therapy that includes artemisinin, a Chinese plant used against malaria in herbal form for thousands of years. The combination therapy works 95 percent of the time, prevents disease transmission to others and is slow to provoke resistance. 
 Yet only 6 of the 42 African nations with endemic malaria -- whose decisions are heavily constrained by outsiders -- have changed drugs. For two years, Doctors Without Borders has been arguing that the global malaria establishment, especially influential donors like the United States Agency for International Development, has been dragging its feet. An article published last week in the medical journal The Lancet provides evidence that international health organizations are pushing countries to continue to use drugs they know do not work.
The main reason is cost. A chloroquine dose costs a few pennies. The best price available for the artemisinin-based combination therapy is 40 cents for a child's treatment and $1.50 for an adult's. That may not sound like much. But until recently, poor countries bore the cost of drugs themselves. Many sick people cannot pay 40 cents.
Wealthy countries are going to have to pay for the more expensive drugs. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is now doing this, but the fund has very little money. Changing drugs requires countries to adapt health care services and find ways to get people to finish a three-day treatment. Countries will not switch unless they are sureof steady financing for the new drugs.
The underlying problem is that most people who die of malaria are poor rural children, and the disease has been eradicated in most wealthy nations. The lack of a global lobby against malaria has brought the world to the sad, absurd point where organizations dedicated to saving lives are pushing drugs that they know will allow children to die.

HEADLINE: Stuck in a Walk-Up, Only Steps Away From Life 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Sometimes it is four or five flights that stand between them and the sunshine. Sometimes it is only 12 stairs -- a physical barrier so daunting that it has virtually marooned many aged or ailing New Yorkers in apartments they cannot afford to give up, trapped high above the teeming street life they once enjoyed and took for granted.
 Were it not for the stairs, people like Robert Fine, who has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, would not need to make appointments with friends to carry him down from his second-floor West Village apartment so that he can enjoy some fresh air. And he would not need to ask strong-looking strangers on the street to carry him back up. 
 Were it not for the stairs, people like Sebastian Pernice would not have to wait for the world to come to him, in his airy fifth-floor apartment of almost 30 years in the West Village, 67 steps off the ground. 
"Sometimes, you feel very trapped," said Mr. Pernice, who has a diagnosis of AIDS. "Everyone tells me that I should get out more, because I'm often depressed. The only thing is -- the stairs."
New York City has thousands of people in walk-ups who, though not completely homebound, are still separated from the world by a finite number of vertical steps, bedeviled by what they might consider a conspiracy of fates. They do not fit the classic definition of a shut-in, those so bedridden or immobile that they could not leave any apartment. Many of the marooned would eagerly encounter the outside world if they lived on the ground floor or in an elevator building.
But unable to afford a comparable home anywhere else in the city, and unwilling to leave a beloved neighborhood that is part of their marrow, they have few options but to stay frozen in a world that eventually shrinks to the four walls of their walk-up.
Many live alone. Many are treading poverty, dependent on fixed incomes and rent regulations. And many more New Yorkers will soon find themselves in similar straits, housing groups and social workers predict, assuming the elderly population continues to boom and construction of new housing does not keep pace.
There are roughly 328,000 apartments in walk-up buildings in New York City with four or more floors, according to the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. There are 277,000 more apartments in buildings with three stories, basements included. That total of more than 600,000 -- or 20 percent of all the city's apartments -- makes New York the walk-up capital of America, housing groups reckon.
For generations of New Yorkers, walk-up apartments have been an inconvenient but vital staple of vertical urban life, a gritty first berth up the ladder of success for the newcomer and the striver. But walk-ups are far from the dominion of the young. According to new research from New York University and the International Longevity Center, 27 percent of New Yorkers over 65 live in walk-up apartments that are not on the first floor.
The story of Dawn Gantly, a 70-year-old expatriate from Britain, is typical, tempering optimism with economic hardships, independence with personal concessions.
A former retail saleswoman, Ms. Gantly has lived by herself in the same rent-regulated, fourth-floor walk-up studio on East 28th Street in Manhattan for 25 years. But her vision is rapidly deteriorating. Her legs have poor circulation. And while she would love to live in a garden apartment, or in an elevator building, she can barely afford her current regulated rent of $484 a month. In fact, she was almost evicted two years ago.
So she rarely ventures out anymore, save for imperative errands to buy food for her two cats, visit the doctor or, on Christmas Eve, pick up a mince pie. She recently signed up for the city's Meals on Wheels program through the nearby Stein Senior Center, and every week or so, Julie Audet, an accountant at Credit Suisse First Boston, visits Ms. Gantly as part of a volunteer program arranged by United Neighbors of East Midtown, a community group.
"You've always been an independent person, but suddenly, you can't do these things anymore, darling, and you get stuck up here," Ms. Gantly said. "You do get a little lonely, and you do feel it's you against the world, so it's so pleasant to have people come by and help."
If Ms. Gantly is emblematic of those who have readily accepted help, then the sisters Soto in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn -- Feliza, 86, and Carmen, 91 -- are examples of those who are still reluctant.
For years, Carmen lived on the second floor of a three-story walk-up, and Feliza on the third floor. But Feliza recently received a diagnosis of Alzheimer's and can leave the apartment only occasionally. So Carmen moved upstairs to take care of her sister. And because the two refuse to get a home health attendant, the eldest sister must run the errands, despite her own osteoporosis, difficulties with the stairs and a wobbly banister in the building.
"I cannot live without Carmen," Feliza said in Spanish, through interpreters with the Fifth Avenue Committee, a community group. "She's the only companion I have."
They are desperate to live in a building without stairs. So a few months ago, when the two heard that they could get into a public housing building with elevators if they canceled their Section 8 housing vouchers, they did just that. But they were mistaken. And now, with their Section 8 vouchers gone, they are plowing into their savings to pay the rent of $891 a month.
"We don't have any place to go," Carmen said.
Self-sufficient or not, many walk-up residents say that they must get used to the new reality of watching the center of gravity of their daily activities shift skyward, and waiting for everything, and everyone, to come to them. God's Love We Deliver, which serves a growing roster of people with AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis and other serious diseases, estimates that 20 to 30 percent of its 1,500 daily deliveries are made to people essentially trapped in walk-ups.
One of those deliveries goes to Mr. Pernice, the AIDS patient in the fifth-floor West Village walk-up, who consumes his hot meal at lunchtime with his medication. While it is easy, he said, to feel despondent about his health and his isolation, he says that he has come to appreciate the nest he has created for himself, and his longtime partner, Tim Sutton.
"I used to fly up and down the stairs, and it's been difficult to lose all that, being sick a lot," Mr. Pernice said. "But sometimes, I feel like I'm in an aerie, because I have my pets, I have my books."
If there is one commodity that many of these walk-up residents say they most fondly desire, though, it is the chance to enjoy as much human contact as possible -- whether in person or over the phone.
That is part of the reason why Alvin Lorberfeld, who has nerve damage in his legs that makes the one-flight, 13-step journey to his apartment arduous, enjoys the University Without Walls program established by Dorot, a social service organization in Manhattan. 
People who are basically homebound can discuss, in a teleconference call, anything from international affairs to Jewish humor (Mr. Lorberfeld's current choice). And in so doing, they make disembodied contact or even form friendships with people they have never met, or may have met long ago.
"There was a gal in a class -- she happened to be from the Bronx -- she was from my old neighborhood," said Mr. Lorberfeld, 76, who now lives in Bayside, Queens. "But I only knew her first name."
Then there is the remarkable story of Mr. Fine, who asks friends to carry him down from his second-floor apartment on Perry Street, and strangers to carry him up.
Mr. Fine, who says that he is in his 50's, used to be in the real estate business. He has used a wheelchair for several years now, but he is so determined to go outside that he keeps a motorized scooter on the ground floor, outside his building. He does not go out much -- he cannot stand the cold, for one thing -- but when he does, he relishes every moment.
"Other people might think it's no big deal, trudging through the streets, but for me, it's almost like a special treat," he said. "When you're cooped up, and you go outside, you say to yourself -- 'Wow, this is so fabulous to be outside."'
Mr. Fine does not mind being inside, though. 
With the help of his current full-time home health aide, he busies himself with his plants, his books, his collection of dance figurines atop his fireplace. He will recite poems for any visitor: Wallace Stevens and Emily Dickinson are particular favorites. And he loves ballet, most of all, as evidenced by a large collection of brooches depicting dance figures.
"I used to spend all my time outside -- I'd sleep and go out all the time, but now, I hate to say relegated -- but it's a fact that I'm domesticated," he said.
His apartment also has lots of framed photographs and drawings. Many are of famous ballet dancers. There is a print of a Cartier-Bresson photograph. And near the door, there are photographs of a young man standing next to his motorcycle and trekking through Southeast Asia and Latin America.
The young man, of course, is Mr. Fine himself, back before the stairs became the dividing line between what he could and could not do.

Easing of Internet Regulations Challenges Surveillance Efforts

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission's efforts to reduce regulations over some Internet services have come under intense criticism from officials at law enforcement agencies who say that their ability to monitor terrorists and other criminal suspects electronically is threatened. 
 In a series of unpublicized meetings and heated correspondence in recent weeks, officials from the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration have repeatedly complained about the commission's decision in 2002 to classify high-speed Internet cable services under a looser regulatory regime than the phone system. 
 The Justice Department recently tried to block the commission from appealing a decision by a federal appeals court two months ago that struck down major parts of its 2002 deregulatory order. Justice Department officials fear that the deregulatory order impedes its ability to enforce wiretapping orders. 
The department ultimately decided to permit the F.C.C. to appeal, but took the highly unusual step of withdrawing from the lawsuit, officials involved in the case said. 
As a result of the commission's actions, said John G. Malcolm, a deputy assistant attorney general who has played a lead role for the Justice Department, some telecommunications carriers have taken the position in court proceedings that they do not need to make their networks available to federal agents for court-approved wiretapping.
"I am aware of instances in which law enforcement authorities have not been able to execute intercept orders because of this uncertainty," Mr. Malcolm said in an interview last Friday. He declined to provide further details.
The clash between the commission and officials from the Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies pits two cherished policies of the Bush administration against each other. On one side stand those who support deregulation of major industries and the nurturing of emerging technologies; on the other are those who favor more aggressive law enforcement after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The outcome of the debate has far- reaching consequences.
Law enforcement officials say it will determine whether they can effectively monitor communications between suspects over new kinds of phone services that otherwise might allow them to escape detection. Also at stake is whether the government or industry will bear the considerable costs of developing the technology for such surveillance.
By contrast, some F.C.C. officials and telephone industry executives say that if the commission buckles to the other agencies and forces the industry to take on a host of expensive obligations the development of promising new communications services may be stalled or squelched for years to come.
The law enforcement officials have also raised concerns about recent statements by the commission's chairman, Michael K. Powell, that suggest he intends to propose rules soon that would place nascent Internet-based telephone services under a looser regulatory regime than the traditional phone system.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Powell declined to discuss the subject.
David Fiske, the commission's chief spokesman, said that he could not respond to Mr. Malcolm's statement that the F.C.C.'s interpretation of the rules was making it more difficult to execute surveillance orders.
A senior official at the F.C.C. said the commission was not unsympathetic to the concerns of the law enforcement agencies. "We're an economic regulatory agency as well as a law enforcement agency and we have to look at the interests of everyone," the official said.
Some industry experts say that their biggest worry is that law enforcement demands may reshape the technical specifications of the new Internet voice services, an accusation that officials at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. deny.
"What's most scary for industry and perhaps some people at the F.C.C. is the notion that the architecture of the Internet will depend on the permission of the F.B.I.," said Stewart A. Baker, a former general counsel of the National Security Agency, which monitors foreign communications. Mr. Baker now represents a number of telecommunications companies as a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson.
But law enforcement officials say they are not seeking uniform technical standards but requirements that the new companies offering "voice over Internet" services build into their systems easy ways for agents to tap into conversations between suspects.
In a strange-bedfellows twist, officials from the F.B.I. and other agencies have found themselves the unlikely allies of groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which have also argued that the new Internet services offered by cable companies should be under a regulatory regime like the phone system -- but for different reasons. The A.C.L.U. prefers that approach because it would prohibit cable companies from discriminating against Internet service providers, and as such would assure a greater diversity of voices. 
The law enforcement officials have repeatedly complained about the direction the agency has been taking on the issues.
Last month, officials from the Justice Department, the F.B.I. and the drug agency warned officials of the F.C.C. that the commission's regulatory rulings on high-speed Internet access through cable systems "suffers from statutory interpretation problems" and "directly threatens" the ability to apply the law permitting them to monitor suspects, according to a letter on file at the F.C.C. describing a meeting on the issue. 
The meeting at the F.C.C. included lawyers from the Justice Department's criminal division, civil appellate division, narcotics and dangerous drugs section and solicitor general's office, as well as officials from the F.B.I. and D.E.A.
Shortly before that meeting, the Justice Department tried to block the F.C.C. from appealing a decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting in Seattle, because of the problems it could pose for law enforcement, officials said.
The commission lost the case last October, when the panel issued a ruling that may force the cable companies to share their broadband networks with competing Internet service providers.
The F.C.C. order, which was partly struck down, had classified cable broadband as an "information service" under the 1996 Telecommunications Act. In so doing, it threatened to undermine the ability of law enforcement agencies to use the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a wiretapping law that applies to phone services but exempts information services.
The Justice Department ultimately reached a compromise that permitted the commission to go forward and petition the entire Ninth Circuit to review the case, Brand X Internet Services v. Federal Communications Commission. 
But government lawyers removed the department from the case, rejecting the Justice Department's traditional role as the main legal advocate for the United States in nearly all cases before federal appeals courts.
Law enforcement officials have also objected to the F.C.C. about the approach that Mr. Powell has begun to articulate. They say his aim of having few regulations over the emerging technology that will allow consumers to use the Internet to send and receive phone calls could make it significantly more difficult for prosecutors and federal agents to monitor those calls.
The F.B.I. and the Justice Department have told the commission that greater use of high-speed Internet phone services "offers increasing opportunities for terrorists, spies, and criminals to evade lawful electronic surveillance," according to a document on file at the F.C.C.
Classifying Internet-based phone services as "telecommunications" would allow law enforcement officials to require companies to provide them with access to contemporaneous conversations on their networks under the 1994 wiretapping law.
But such a classification also imposes on the companies a host of onerous requirements under the 1996 act, including those intended to assure that telephones are universally available and that everyone has access to 911 emergency services. These obligations, purveyors of the new Internet telephone services say, are so expensive that they will deter their development.
Government and industry lawyers say that the commission could try to define the new services as "telecommunications" under the 1994 surveillance law and "information" under the 1996 act. But taking that potentially conflicting approach could undermine the F.C.C. in court in the inevitable legal challenges that would follow its rulings.
Mr. Powell, in a series of recent speeches and interviews, has suggested that the new technologies need to be classified as "information services" and thus be subjected to fewer regulations.
"Don't shove the round Internet into a square regulatory hole," Mr. Powell said at a luncheon appearance last week before the National Press Club. "We cannot contort the character of the Internet to suit our familiar notions of regulation. Do not dumb down the genius of the Net to match the limited visions of the regulator.
"To regulate the Internet in the image of a familiar phone service is to destroy its inherent character and potential," Mr. Powell said. Such new technologies empower people, "giving them more choice and control."
"And I think as consumers do more, governments do less, because we don't regulate our citizens."
In the same speech, Mr. Powell added, "We will need to ensure the legitimate concerns of public safety and law enforcement are addressed."

HEADLINE: Security Seen as Greatest Obstacle to Holding Direct Elections in Iraq by June 30 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG and JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.; Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
For months, the Bush administration has resisted Iraqi calls for direct elections by June 30, citing the need for a census to compile voter rolls and other measures to ensure fair voting but too cumbersome to complete in time.
 But some experts say that many of these conditions could be met. Another obstacle, perhaps greater and largely unacknowledged, according to the military, the United Nations and outside election experts, is the continuing violence in Iraq. To argue that security is a serious impediment, however, would be to admit that American forces are unable to quell the running war with the insurgents. 
 Some American generals now say privately that the continuing attacks, especially those against Iraqi civilians, present a daunting obstacle to holding the direct elections demanded by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the country's most powerful cleric among the majority Shiites. 
Even those outside experts who say that there are practical ways to hold a quick vote say that turnout could be suppressed by violence, and that protecting the polls with soldiers or policemen, too, may keep people away.
"I guess you could devise mechanisms to make it possible, security permitting," said Joost R. Hiltermann, a Middle East expert at the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organization, who visited Iraq this week to research the prospects for elections here. "But 'security permitting' is a big if. The risk is that if you go ahead, the results could be seriously skewed, even dangerously skewed."
If bombings or other attacks like those that occurred this week in Baghdad, Karbala and Mosul take place in one section of the country or another during balloting, the resulting disparities in security might badly reduce turnout in certain areas and render the election unfair, election experts say. Iraq's ethnic divisions, mirrored imperfectly in its politics, tend to follow rough geographic lines that define the largely Kurdish north, the central Sunni Arab heartland and the overwhelmingly Shiite Arab south.
It would be especially dangerous if security is weak in Sunni Arab areas and consequently depressed turnout among that group, which makes up a fifth of the country's 25 million people. Sunnis formed the core of Saddam Hussein's government, and it is in the so-called Sunni Triangle that violence against the American military is fiercest. Many Sunnis already feel disenfranchised, and their anger will only grow if security problems keep them from voting and skew the election results, Mr. Hiltermann said. 
Under the current plan, a transitional assembly -- several hundred Iraqis from every region and social sector -- will be chosen in caucus-style elections from the country's 18 provinces. That assembly is to choose an interim government in June, and that indirectly elected interim government is to draft a constitution. 
But shortly after the November agreement, Ayatollah Sistani came out against the caucus plan and for direct balloting. A direct ballot would give the Shiites, who account for 60 percent of the population, a clear advantage, while the caucus plan is more likely to give moderate politicians a leg up.
On Monday, 100,000 supporters of Ayatollah Sistani marched through Baghdad protesting the coalition's plans. Because the issue of violence would lend weight to the arguments of those who oppose a direct election, the ayatollah's supporters generally avoid the issue of security.
"Grand Ayatollah Sistani insisted on direct elections, and it's a sort of obligation," said Muhammad Alaaowi al-Shameri, a representative of Ayatollah Sistani at the Khadimiya mosque in Baghdad, in an interview this week. "It must be done. The picture of real democracy will not be achieved unless we have direct elections."
The military, though, which has sustained hundreds of casualties in the past few months, sees democracy following security, not the other way around.
"Regarding elections, the concerns one in the military would have are security, and how the votes are represented and counted, given right now there's no polling data," a United States Army general based in central Iraq said in an interview on Wednesday.
Iraqi army and police forces would have to guard the polls, because a highly visible presence of American soldiers at voting booths could be seen as intimidation, the general said. But there are not even enough policemen right now to fight crime and battle insurgents, he said.
Other experts agree that the practical and technical obstacles to cobbling together a direct election swiftly could be overcome if the American-led occupation truly wanted to hold an early vote. Optimistic internal reports have also been written by Iraqi officials and by experienced hands at the United Nations.
Ibrahim al-Jafari, a Shiite member of the American-picked Iraqi Governing Council, said on Wednesday that he supported elections and even suggested that militias already organized by some Iraqi parties might play a role in helping to provide security. But that, too, could raise questions of intimidation, as the handful of parties with well-developed militias, like the two big Kurdish ones, would undoubtedly field candidates during an election.
The call for elections was repeated in Washington today by another member of the Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi, this month's chairman, who asked again for the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, to send a team of experts of Iraq to determine whether direct elections can be held before June 30. 
"In principle, we are all in favor of elections," Mr. Pachachi said in a luncheon speech. "The problem is that of time. Can we have proper elections in the next three months?" 
An electoral assessment team from the United Nations visited Iraq for two weeks over the summer and concluded that it was possible to set up mechanisms for direct elections within six months, according to an official who worked out of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad.
Their findings were summed up in an internal report written by Carina Perelli, the head of the electoral assistance division of the United Nations, who had met with Iraqi officials and leaders of the Coalition Provisional Authority. The report, the existence of which was first mentioned in Time magazine this week, was never circulated and is now considered outdated by United Nations officials in New York precisely because the security situation has deteriorated so much that the findings are obsolete. A bombing in August drove the United Nations out of Iraq, along with many other international organizations.
Mr. Annan is sending a four-member team of military and security experts to Iraq this week to assess potential dangers here before deciding whether to send in an electoral assessment team that would look again at the feasibility of direct elections. 
In addition to the formidable security issue, American and Iraqi officials are debating whether ration cards issued to households under the United Nations oil-for-food program can be used to build voter rolls in the absence of a census. The proponents of this plan say the computerized list of households and their members is fairly comprehensive. But its detractors, including coalition officials, say the oil-for-food rolls are likely to be inaccurate, especially given how Mr. Hussein sometimes manipulated them for his own political purposes. 
Supporters of direct elections say there are other ways to avoid a time-consuming census. Voter cards, for example, could be issued to individuals when they show up to vote. Some have suggested setting up regional civil affairs offices to locate voters and record their addresses, letting them register on the basis of whatever form of identification card they may already possess or issuing a standard identity card to all who register to vote.

Bremer to Miss Talks
DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 21 (Reuters) -- The American administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, will not attend the current World Economic Forum here in this Swiss ski resort, a spokesman for the organizers said Wednesday.
The spokesman said he did not know why Mr. Bremer had canceled the trip. He said he expected another member of the American administration to come instead.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 24, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about prospects for direct elections in Iraq misstated the view voiced by Adnan Pachachi, current chairman of the Iraqi Governing Council. He said that direct elections are desirable in principle; he did not join the demand by leaders of the Shiite Muslim majority that they be held immediately.

HEADLINE: Iran's Leader Mixes Hope With Defiance In Davos Talk 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Iran's president, facing a deepening political crisis at home and persistent doubts abroad about Iran's nuclear ambitions, brought a robust, if mixed, message of hope and defiance on Wednesday to this year's World Economic Forum, a meeting of political and business leaders.
 President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, who threatened to resign last week after Iran's conservative religious leaders disqualified about 3,600 candidates for parliamentary elections next month, said he hoped the elections would be free and competitive. But he left open the question of his own future. 
 "My colleaguesand I will be at the service of the people of Iran, and inshallah, hopefully, we will have a good election," Mr. Khatami said at a news conference, using the phrase for "God willing." 
In an interview with Swiss Television, he said, "I have the intention to continue my task and my service to the people." 
President Khatami was unequivocal in rejecting the Bush administration's allegations that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons. Noting that his government had allowed United Nations inspectors to tour Iran's nuclear facilities, he said that Iran's motives were peaceful and that it had nothing to hide.
"I do not accept what he said," Mr. Khatami said of President Bush, who has declared that Iran opened the doors to its nuclear program only under pressure from the United States.
Mr. Khatami also dismissed a suggestion that he meet with Vice President Dick Cheney, who is to deliver a speech here on Saturday, well after Mr. Khatami is supposed to return to Tehran.
"The first requisite to any dialogue is the mutual respect between the two parties," Mr. Khatami said. "Anywhere that we sense and feel that the other side respects us and does not force anything upon us, we are prepared to talk. We have not sensed that on the United States side."
In case anybody missed the point, he noted that his definition of a dialogue was an exchange between "scholars and wise men."
All in all, it was a spirited performance from a leader who is a rare figure at such gatherings, and whose multiplying problems had led some organizers to fret that he might be a last-minute cancellation, or that he might avoid the news conference.
Mr. Khatami has repeatedly used the threat of resignation in clashes between his reform-minded government and the Guardian Council, a 12-member body dominated by clerics that has sweeping power in Iran.
The council set off a storm by disqualifying nearly half of the 8,200 candidates for the elections, on Feb. 20. The move was widely condemned as an effort by conservatives to beat back gains made by reformists, who hold a wide majority in Parliament.
Mr. Khatami seemed eager to use the platform of Davos, with its rarefied crowd of corporate executives, cabinet ministers and other notables, to send at least two messages. Iran, he declared, is proceeding on the path to democracy, if at its own pace, and the government is ready to engage with the outside world, provided outsiders treat it with respect.
After his appearance, Mr. Khatami headed for talks with the British foreign secretary, Jack Straw; the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo; and the president-elect of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili.
Mr. Straw, with his French and German counterparts, worked out an agreement with Mr. Khatami last October that allowed officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect facilities that the United States suspects may be used to develop a nuclear weapon.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Straw urged the United Nations to support a request by the United States to assess whether elections could be held in Iraq in time for a transitional government to take over on July 1. "If there were to be a re-engagement of the U.N.," he said, "that could only assist in this process."
While the reconstruction of Iraq came up in several panels on Wednesday, it has not been an overriding theme here, as it was last year, when the hostility toward the Bush administration was palpable.
In a discussion of the campaign against terrorism, the sharpest criticisms of American policy came from Americans, like Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch. When Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister, declared that the war in Iraq had "made the world a better place," he steeled himself for disagreement from members of the audience. None came.
To the extent that people are worrying about the United States, they seem more alarmed about the ballooning federal budget and trade deficits, which some fear could derail the global economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Earnings Rise 21% At Harley-Davidson 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Harley-Davidson reported yesterday that quarterly earnings rose 21 percent on stronger shipments to dealers, but that retail sales fell from a year earlier, when 100th anniversary bikes increased demand. 
 Harley, based in Milwaukee, said its dealers in the United States had a modest decline in sales in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. 
It did not give an exact figure. 
 Harley-Davidson said fourth-quarter profit rose to $182.4 million, or 60 cents a share, from $150.9 million, or 49 cents a share, a year ago. 
Analysts expected earnings of 58 cents a share. 
Harley-Davidson management forecast a strong 2004, citing dealer optimism, the improving economy and momentum from the 100th anniversary. 
The company said revenue rose to $1.16 billion, from $1.03 billion.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Bank Earnings Send the Dow and S.&P. 500 Higher

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Strong bank earnings pushed the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to 22-month highs yesterday, but technology stocks lagged on disappointing news from Lucent Technologies and Motorola.
 With little market-moving news coming out of President Bush's State of the Union address on Tuesday night, analysts attributed the gains to upbeat quarterly profit reports, led by J.P. Morgan Chase. Six weeks of advances in technology and telecommunications stocks, however, prompted many investors to collect profits in those sectors. 
 The run-up in anticipation of good earnings reports has excited investors, but some are skeptical about whether the outlook for 2004 is robust enough to justify valuations, especially for tech stocks, said John Caldwell, chief investment strategist for the McDonald Financial Group, part of KeyCorp, which is based in Cleveland. 
"Folks are getting away from their infatuation with tech stocks," Mr. Caldwell said. "They're looking more toward companies like J.P. Morgan Chase. And why not? Not only did they just announce a big merger, but their earnings were substantially better than anticipated."
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 94.96 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,623.62. It was the highest close for the index stocks since March 19, 2002, when it closed at 10,635.25.
The Standard & Poor's 500 gained 8.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,147.62 -- its highest close since March 22, 2002, when it finished at 1,148.70. The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.53 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,142.45.
Much of the advance came late in the day. Earlier, earnings reports appeared to be motivating some investors to sell, said Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities.
"Even some of the stocks that have had great results, like Merrill Lynch, are down on profit taking," Mr. Clark said. "Others are falling because of concerns about outlook."
Over all, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to rise 20 percent, but that may not be enough to match investors' heightened expectations. Still, most analysts remain bullish about equities over the long term.
Also, the Commerce Department reported a 1.7 percent increase in housing construction in December, making 2003 the best year for home builders in 25 years. 
J.P. Morgan Chase gained $1.01, to $40.10, after reporting profits of $1.86 billion, well above Wall Street's estimates. Like other major banks reporting results in recent days, J.P. Morgan's profits were lifted by improvements in both corporate and consumer credit as well as the rebounding stock market.
But Merrill Lynch lost 58 cents, to close at $59.60, despite beating expectations for the fourth quarter and reporting its best-ever year of earnings. Revenues, which came in slightly below estimates, might have put off some investors.
Other decliners included the telecommunications manufacturer Lucent Technologies, which lost 33 cents, to $4.42, after it reported profit results that beat expectations, but forecast future earnings to be flat to only slightly higher.
Motorola fell 24 cents, to $16.81, after its fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations, but analysts were less than impressed by a 3 percent decline in cellphone sales.
There was also some weakness in semiconductor stocks, with Advanced Micro Devices dropping $1.48, to $15.90. AMD beat forecasts with its first profit in more than two years, but said future sales could decline.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE FORMER GOVERNOR; 
DEAN'S CAMPAIGN ALTERS APPROACH AFTER IOWA LOSS

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JODI WILGOREN; Michael Janofsky contributed from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Senior aides to Howard Dean took several steps on Wednesday to overhaul his candidacy, including softening the tone of his speeches and eliminating high-voltage campaign rallies in favor of dignified appearances where he would present himself as a mature ex-governor with a command of health care and the economy.
 The moves came as senior advisers expressed concern in interviews that Dr. Dean's candidacy was imperiled after a third-place finish in Iowa and a roaring, raucous concession speech that many opponents have held up as evidence that Dr. Dean is unfit to be president. 
 The advisers said they had concluded that the portrayal of Dr. Dean as a candidate unhinged would make it impossible, at least for now, to run advertisements attacking their opponents here, a significant restriction for any candidate in a tough race. Dr. Dean and his wife, Judith, have also agreed to do their first joint television interview, which will appear Thursday night on ABC's "Prime Time." 
Evidence of a new Dr. Dean was on display Wednesday morning in Manchester, where the candidate, speaking softly and haltingly, highlighted his proposed overhaul of the campaign finance system, in what aides described as their first effort to change the subject of the campaign discourse.
The new steps were mapped out in a series of meetings that continued Wednesday in Burlington, Vt., where the governor went to recover from a cold that left him hoarse and looking beleaguered.
"I don't buy into the notion that somebody did it to us, but somehow we got caught in the mutually assured destruction of a harsh, negative, vitriolic campaign that created very negative images of Howard at the very time that he needed to humanize himself," said Steven Grossman, the chairman of the campaign and a former Democratic national chairman, as he began a seven-hour round-trip drive from his home in Boston for the meeting in Vermont.
Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey said that in a conference call with members of Congress and Dr. Dean's staff on Tuesday night, he said Dr. Dean "has to get away from the negative attacks."
"He has to be positive, talk about the future, don't talk about others," Mr. Pallone said. "Don't even defend yourself against attacks by others."
Dr. Dean's advisers said they had been deluged with advice from all the camps that make up the unusual alliance of the Dean campaign -- from their young Web-based supporters to senior members of Congress to his growing legion of paid consultants -- about what their candidate should do. Several advisers said they were increasingly concerned that he could face a loss in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday that could be devastating.
"I told him to be a minipresident; not to be so hot, to tone it down," said one of his most prominent supporters, who did not want to be identified as sharing his private advice to Dr. Dean. "I said, 'In the future, if you want to stir up the crowd, have somebody else do it for you.' "
Representative Robert Menendez of New Jersey said he had told Dean aides that Dr. Dean "needs to do more of the uplifting, motivational, substantial vision of where he would take America."
"Put him in the type of circumstance where he is not just pumping the crowd, but is engaged in a conversation with the electorate that reflects his intellect and concern for people," Mr. Menendez said.
Dr. Dean's aides said they were taking that advice, and said that would become increasingly clear over the next day. Late Wednesday night his aides noted that despite the disparaging publicity from the loss in Iowa and his exuberant postcaucus performance, Dr. Dean had raised $590,000 in contributions since Monday. 
The retooling of the Dean campaign reflects the dramatic turn in fortunes for this candidate, and just six days before the vote in New Hampshire, a contest that just two weeks ago Dr. Dean seemed positioned to win overwhelmingly. Instead, a series of polls have shown his support dropping, putting him in a tight contest with Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
On Thursday, aides said, Dr. Dean plans to take his campaign finance proposal a step further by calling for a $250 limit on contributions to an individual candidate, down from the current $2,000. The proposal is timed to come on the day that the Democratic presidential candidates are meeting in a televised debate which Dr. Dean's advisers view as critical to turning around his fortunes.
Dr. Dean went so far as to first schedule, and then postpone, campaigning door-to-door in Newport, about 60 miles northwest of here, in the first bit of retail politicking he would have done in months. Aides said that over the next few days, he would put aside the noisy rallies that have become associated with his candidacy for town-hall-style meetings, and visits to schools and hospitals, all intended to highlight his work as governor of Vermont.
At the same time, an aide said, Dr. Dean will stop talking about the process of his campaign -- in other words, his success at using the Internet to recruit supporters -- and more about the issues that polls said New Hampshire voters were interested in. Aides said that in effect they were trying to reclaim the spirit of the Dean candidacy that allowed him to dominate this state just three months ago.
"He connected with people here when he was himself; three or for months ago, he drove Kerry from the state," an aide said. "What the guy has to do to win is go back to that and be the doctor-governor who stands up for what he believes in and achieves results."
The change in tactics comes at a time of both gloom and defiance among many of Dr. Dean's supporters, some of whom said he had been unfairly pilloried for his concession speech. "They're writing his obituary and stuff, but I remember when McCain beat Bush in New Hampshire last time, everybody said Bush was dead," said Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. "Check his address now."
Dr. Dean's advisers said they viewed the debate here on Thursday as a potential turning-point that might allow New Hampshire voters to take a second look at their candidate, and thus move the campaign discussion away from the way Dr. Dean ended his campaign in Iowa. 
Saying they were confident of a successful showing by Dr. Dean at the debate, his advisers said they were pouring money and personnel into New Hampshire to make certain they won. In doing so, they are taking advantage of a decision not to participate in the campaign finance system, freeing him from the spending limits. Mr. Kerry is the only other Democrat bypassing the system.
"We're throwing it all into New Hampshire right now," said Paul Maslin, who is Dr. Dean's pollster.
On television here, Dr. Dean's main advertisements show him smiling and surrounded by children and an elderly couple.
The heavy emphasis on that advertisement comes at a time when some Democrats close to the campaign question the use of a commercial in the final days of the race in Iowa that showed Dr. Dean alone on the screen, rather than with people, in a way that might rebut the image of the candidate as a loner.
As Dr. Dean took a break at his home, his aides met in Burlington to plot out some of the steps. "I don't make a seven-hour round trip when I don't have to," Mr. Grossman said. 
"This is a business in which you either grow or die," he said. "Howard has got to grow out of the Iowa experience in a way in which he connects with people on their basic, human, guttural needs."
Mr. Maslin said he hoped New Hampshire would change the story line. But, he said, he was not certain what would happen.
"I'm not sure there's any magic here," Mr. Maslin said. "All us smart people here can say is, Do this, or do that. It's all overrated. It all comes down to him."

 Still struggling to recover from a $1.2 billion accounting scandal, Royal Ahold, the food retailer, said it was closing its United States corporate retail headquarters in Chantilly, Va., relocating or eliminating about 100 positions there. 
Ahold said most of its corporate retail functions in the United States would be managed starting this summer from a new Boston administrative office that would help manage two of its United States subsidiaries, the supermarket chains Stop & Shop and Giant-Landover. Ahold is in the midst of a major cost-cutting program. Earlier this week, the company announced plans to sell 204 convenience stores in the United States that belong to its Tops Markets chain.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: PalmOne To Cut Work Force By 12% 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 PalmOne, the maker of hand-held computers, said yesterday that it would cut its work force by about 12 percent as part of an effort to refocus its investments on devices that include mobile phones. The company, based in Milpitas, Calif., said it would cut some 100 jobs. 
The reduction affects positions throughout the company and will leave PalmOne with some 740 employees. PalmOne, created last year by its split from PalmSource and its subsequent acquisition of a rival, Handspring, said it hoped to deliver a profit in the 2005 fiscal year. The company said it planned to maintain its dominant position in the market for hand-held computers, but would invest more in the high-growth area of phones that allow users to keep track of personal information, also known as smart phones. PalmOne shares fell $1.21, or 10 percent, to $10.86.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: OVERVIEW; 
Nets Are Sold for $300 Million, And Dream Grows in Brooklyn

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Bruce C. Ratner, the developer who wants to move the New Jersey Nets to downtown Brooklyn, reached an agreement yesterday to buy the team for $300 million, defeating a similar offer by Charles Kushner and Senator Jon S. Corzine, the team said.
 There is no guarantee that Mr. Ratner will be able to fulfill his vision in Brooklyn, where sports fans are still haunted by memories of the Dodgers' departure to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. The arena would be built on the same site the Dodgers were rebuffed from buying. 
 Mr. Ratner faces numerous obstacles, including having land condemned and having railroad tracks moved, before he can move the Nets to Brooklyn when the team's lease at Continental Arena expires in 2008. 
But the first step in building a new arena for the Nets is complete: the purchase of the team. Without the team, Mr. Ratner has said, the $2.5 billion commercial and residential complex designed by Frank Gehry, with the Nets' arena as the centerpiece, would be dead.
Edwin Stier, president of the Nets' ownership group, Community Youth Organization, said: "We're in the final stages of negotiating an agreement with Bruce Ratner. The contract terms have been finalized and we're putting the paperwork together."
For most of the past week, Mr. Ratner and Mr. Kushner were able to examine long-withheld and detailed financial records about the team, allowing them to form substantial, final bids.
On Monday, Mr. Ratner formalized his month-old $300 million bid and negotiators began to clarify the elements of his offer, including the long-term salary obligations he would assume. 
On Tuesday, Mr. Kushner presented two offers: one, of $267.5 million in cash, and a second, consisting of $200 million upfront and $100 million over several years, one official involved in the negotiations said. But that was considered inadequate, and the decision was made to complete the deal with Mr. Ratner.
Despite Mr. Kushner's willingness yesterday to raise his offer to $300 million upfront, the Nets and their negotiators decided that they had finished their contract with Mr. Ratner and chose not to consider Mr. Kushner's final bid.
"He just wasn't there," one executive who has been briefed throughout the talks said of Mr. Kushner. "Ratner wanted this thing so bad, he did what it took to get it."
Bob Sommer, a spokesman for Mr. Kushner, a Florham Park, N.J., real estate developer, said, "Charlie Kushner bid $300 million in cash today to keep this team in New Jersey and is disappointed in the result."
The C.Y.O. board agreed to the deal's terms, and the contract now goes for approval tomorrow to YankeeNets, the holding company for the Nets and the Yankees, which is on the verge of being dissolved. Approval is also needed from three-quarters of the teams in the National Basketball Association to buy the franchise and a simple majority to move it.
A move to Brooklyn would mean another move for the peripatetic franchise. It began life as the New Jersey Americans of the American Basketball Association in Teaneck, N.J., then played in Commack, N.Y.; West Hempstead, N.Y.; Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y.; Piscataway, N.J.; and finally found permanence in 1981 when it became a tenant of what is now Continental Arena.
The Nets have often struggled on the court but won the Eastern Conference championship the past two seasons. Still, the Nets are next to last in average attendance among the N.B.A.'s 29 teams this season.
The team's value has exploded since Roy Boe paid $1.1 million for the A.B.A. franchise in 1969. At $300 million, the price is double what Community Youth Organization, led by Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz, paid for it in 1998, a year before they merged it with the Yankees into YankeeNets. But it ranks behind the record $360 million paid in 2002 for the Boston Celtics.
The sale to Mr. Ratner, whose company is also the development partner of The New York Times Company in a new building for the newspaper's headquarters, culminates a six-month process.
First there were three bidders: Mr. Ratner, who started at $275 million; the Kushner group, which includes Mr. Corzine, the United States senator from New Jersey, and which opened at $250 million; and Charles B. Wang, the co-owner of the Islanders, at $265 million. They were later joined by Stuart Feldman, a venture capitalist who never publicly discussed his $257.5 million offer or his intentions for the team. Mr. Wang dropped out in frustration with the process, and Mr. Feldman was never a serious competitor.
The effort to sell the Nets has been marked by recriminations between owners of the Yankees and the Nets, as well as among Nets owners themselves. 
"It took so long because the personality clashes at YankeeNets created an untenable situation," said Joseph Ravitch, a managing director of Goldman Sachs, one of the team's investment bankers. "The agreement reached in December to separate C.Y.O. from Yankee Holdings was a critical step in expediting the sale of the team."
Community Youth Organization bought the Nets with the idea of moving them to Newark to help revive its economy. Mr. Katz and Mr. Chambers pledged to pour the profits into a newly formed charity. But the team lost tens of millions of dollars and failed to complete a deal for an arena in Newark, leading to a split between Mr. Chambers and Mr. Katz and ultimately the decision to sell.
Earlier this week, George Zoffinger, president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which owns Continental Arena, criticized Mr. Katz and Alan Landis, another Nets owner, and vowed to block Mr. Ratner from taking the Nets name to Brooklyn.
"We think a lot of N.B.A. owners are going to want to be in this market," he said. "I suggest Ratner name the team after himself: the Brooklyn Rats. Katz and Landis will fit right in."
In the final stages of their partnership, Nets owners refused to provide bidders with access to financial information necessary to assess the team's value until they were assured last month that YankeeNets would adopt a plan to dissolve, an official involved in the negotiation said.
The Ratner group, whose partners include the hip-hop entrepreneur Jay-Z and Vincent Viola, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, has been trying to create a proposal that would encounter little resistance from government officials and community opponents. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been an enthusiastic supporter of the project, but the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki has been been relatively quiet. 
A top state official said the governor did not want to be accused of poaching on New Jersey assets and was concerned about the growing list of teams seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in state subsidies for new arenas and stadiums, including the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets, the Knicks and the Rangers.
The project has been embraced by many Brooklyn politicians as the antidote to the loss of the Dodgers and as the crystallization of the borough's economic comeback.
But Patti Hagan, a leader of the Prospect Park Heights Coalition, said the project would eliminate 237 jobs and homes for 864 people.
"This is an example of developer imperialism," she said. "The emperor has decided to take over 10 acres of private property and abolish all the jobs and homes that exist here. Mr. Ratner should know he has a fight on his hands."
In addition to community opposition, Mr. Ratner faces extensive attendance and revenue losses while the team stays in New Jersey before the move to Brooklyn.
Dean Bonham, a sports industry analyst, said: "There is no magic solution to keeping fans in the Meadowlands when you're potentially heading for Brooklyn. But I would deliver the message that a new era for basketball is dawning in New York, he's building a state-of-the-art facility and if you want to be part of something new and fun, come participate with us."

HEADLINE: Home Building Keeps Driving The Economy 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
The housing market may not be done driving the economy.
 The Commerce Department said yesterday that construction began on a larger-than-expected number of homes in December, capping the best year for new housing in a quarter of a century and leading some industry analysts to raise their housing forecasts for 2004. 
 "Month after month, we've expected total housing starts to moderate a bit, but it doesn't seem to have happened," said Orawin T. Velz, a senior economist at Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer of home mortgages. "With this rate in December, the decline in 2004 may not be much at all." 
That bodes well for an economy that has been relying on the building, buying and refinancing of homes even as companies cut workers and production.
In all of 2003, builders broke ground on 1.85 million homes, an 8.4 percent increase over 2002 and the best year for home building since 1978. That year, total housing starts, which include both single-family and multifamily homes, were 2.02 million.
Housing starts in December reached an annual rate of 2.09 million, the fastest rate since the 2.26 million annual pace in February 1984. December's new-construction figure represents an increase of 1.7 percent over November's figure and a rise of 15 percent over that for December 2002. 
Economists polled by Bloomberg News had predicted that housing starts would fall 5.8 percent to an annual rate of 1.9 million in December from November. Economists said that while housing numbers could be erratic and were often revised, the data released yesterday may mean that 2004 will be a stronger year than had been expected, and may seem strong even compared with the last three years of extraordinary refinancing and home-buying activity. 
"Combined with the unexpectedly low mortgage rates, this suggests that we may have been too conservative in our assessment of 2004," said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. On Monday, the association had forecast that single-family housing starts would drop about 3 percent in 2004, to 1.45 million homes.
In fact, the annual rate of new construction of single-family homes fell a modest 0.6 percent from November to December. 
"The report is still consistent with a very slight slowing in housing," said David Lereah, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors in Washington. But single-family housing starts for the year were at their highest since 1977. Multifamily housing starts were up for both the month and the year.
In addition, applications for building permits rose 3.3 percent in December, to an annual rate of 1.92 million, from 1.86 million in November, suggesting that builders will be busy meeting demand through at least January and February, economists said. 
Mr. Carliner added that other businesses would benefit as well. "It's going to mean additional demand for mortgages, real estate services, furniture and all types of things," he said.
And housing with permits requested before December could still be awaiting construction. Permits were requested for 1.86 million homes last year, 6.3 percent more than in 2002. 
More important, analysts said, is that home buyers are seeing the lowest interest rates on home loans since June, when rates reached a 41-year low, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage research concern in Pompton Plains, N.J. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the industry benchmark, is now 5.74 percent, HSH said. Just a month ago, the rate exceeded 6 percent.
In addition, more and more analysts are predicting that slow-growing employment numbers and other economic data will persuade the Federal Reserve to keep its key short-term rate at 1 percent, not only when it meets next week but also for most of the year and even into 2005. 
"I think increasingly it looks like 2004 could be better than 2003," Mr. Carliner said. "We certainly didn't expect to have mortgages available at 5.7 percent in January."
Many people do seem to still be buying. The Mortgage Bankers Association said yesterday that its index of purchases rose 12.5 percent from the previous week.
Investors also seemed to believe that yesterday's housing numbers would mean better results for this year. The Standard & Poor's supercomposite thrifts and mortgage finance index closed up 2.6 percent yesterday.
But some economists worried that a substantial part of the home building is speculative and could create an excess of homes, eventually leading to a decline in housing prices.
"I look at this rate of building, and to me it's just crazy," said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a Washington research group. "Homes are being built in a way that is inconsistent with any plausible growth in demand." 
Some economists found it troubling that the increase in housing starts last month was largely a result of the rise in construction starts of multifamily homes while starts of single-family homes declined, albeit slightly. In general, apartment vacancies are high and rent prices are low, they said, so why build potential rental units? 
Mr. Carliner of the National Association of Home Builders said the increase seemed to be in areas where rental units would most be needed. For instance, he noted that much of the growth in multifamily housing was in the Northeast, presumably in metropolitan areas, where demand remains strong.

ROGERS CORP. IS MOVING SOME WORK TO CHINA

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The Rogers Corporation, which makes material for computers and wireless equipment, said it would close its manufacturing plant in Windham, Conn., by the end of the year. 
About 125 employees work at the plant, Rogers said. Manufacturing will be moved to the company's plant in Suzhou, China. A few jobs will be moved to Rogers's headquarters in Rogers, Conn., the company said. Some workers from the Windham plant will be hired at other factories in Connecticut, Rogers said, but it was "impossible to speculate" how many.

FLIGHT ATTENDANTS' UNION REFUSES TO SIGN CONTRACT

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The flight attendants' union for United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, has refused to sign a contract approved in April that cut pay by 9 percent because the company has announced plans to reduce retiree health benefits. The Association of Flight Attendants said it would fight the retiree cuts in UAL's bankruptcy proceeding or in other court actions. 
The Chicago-based airline promised specific benefits to employees who retired by July 1, and more than 2,500 accepted the offer, the union said. The contract is legally viable regardless of whether the union signs it, a United spokeswoman, Jean Medina, said. UAL said last week that it would seek an agreement with 35,000 retirees on the health care payments, and might ask the bankruptcy court to reduce its share of the expenses.

HEADLINE: The Loud Answer to Davos, in Bombay This Year, Is Antiwar 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BOMBAY, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Kenyans in colorful robes and headgear, South Koreans with blue peace signs painted on their faces and Britons carrying posters of Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Bush crossed out in black joined thousands of others marching through the congested streets of Bombay on Wednesday to denounce the Iraq war. It was a demonstration that marked the close of the fourth annual World Social Forum.
 Delegates carrying placards that read "Iraq is not for sale" and "End occupation of Iraq" elbowed others who raised slogans of "Down with war, down with Bush" and caused chaos in downtown Bombay. Police officers brandishing riot sticks could barely keep the crowds under control. 
 The local police, who feared that the antiwar protest might get out of hand, mounted a heavy guard at the United States Consulate.
More than 80,000 people from a hundred countries took part in the six-day forum, which was held in Asia for the first time. The forum was founded as a counter to the World Economic Forum, which is being held in Davos, Switzerland, an international meeting of politicians and business executive to discuss world trade and other issues.
The march ended at Azad Maidan, or Freedom Park, near the majestic Victoria Terminus, a lavish 19th-century domed structure that houses India's largest train station.
The mood was somber. Detler V. Larcher, from Bremen, Germany, gestured to the milling crowds and said, "People are clearly saying that George Bush is responsible for the growing anti-American feeling across the world." 
In addition to its primary focus on denouncing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the forum highlighted issues ranging from caste and gender discrimination to nuclear disarmament and rights of the disabled. True to form, the meeting did not come up with any declaration or action plan.
The freewheeling nature of the forum, however, did not find unanimous support even within India. A splinter group of far left elements called for a violent movement against globalization and war. 
This group, calling itself Mumbai Resistance 2004 (using a common spelling of "Bombay"). was based just outside the forum and vehemently protested its acceptance of financing from "American multinationals." So while the previous three meetings, in Porto Alegre, Brazil, were financed by the Ford Foundation, the meeting in India was sponsored by Oxfam International and others.
The event will shift back to Brazil next year.
Nineteen-year-old Chaman Singh, who weaved his way in and out of the milling crowds peddling savory Indian snacks for 5 cents each, said he did not know who George Bush was or what the meeting was all about. 
"Most of them look like they are farmers and they don't seem to want my samosas," said Mr. Singh, who had shifted his business to Azad Maidan from the nearby beach in anticipation of good sales. But by the end of the evening, he was disappointed. "I usually make 100 rupees $2.20 at Chowpatty Beach, but today I've only made 60 rupees so far," he said.

HEADLINE: War of Ideas, Part 5 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
God bless the Democratic Party's primary voters in Iowa. They may have rescued our chances of succeeding in Iraq and even winning the war of ideas within the Arab-Muslim world. Go Hawkeyes!
 How so? Well, it seems to me that Iowa Democrats, in opting for John Kerry and John Edwards over Howard Dean, signaled (among other things) that they want a presidential candidate who is serious about fighting the war against the Islamist totalitarianism threatening open societies. 
 "It was a good night for the Tony Blair Democrats in Iowa," said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute. By "Blair Democrats," Mr. Marshall was referring to those Democrats who voted for the Iraq war, and conveyed "a toughness and resolve to face down America's enemies," but who believe the Bush team has mismanaged the project. This is so important because there has been no credible opposition to the Bush foreign policy since the Iraq war. Democrats have been intimidated either by Mr. Bush or by Mr. Dean.
Mr. Bush's lightning victory in Iraq intimidated those who favored the war but had reservations about the Bush approach. And then, when things started to go sour in Iraq, Mr. Dean's outspoken opposition to the war -- and the eager reception it received from some Democratic activists -- got those Democrats who did vote for the war tied into pretzels, trying to simultaneously justify their war vote and distance themselves from it.
Without a serious Democratic critique of the war -- and I define "serious" as one that connects with the gut middle-American feeling that the Islamist threat had to be confronted, but one that lays out a smarter approach than the Bush team's -- Mr. Bush has gotten away with being sloppy and unprepared for postwar Iraq.
My hope is that Iowa will embolden the Blair Democrats to shuck off their intimidation, by Mr. Bush and Mr. Dean, and press their case. It is the only way to build a national consensus for what's going to be a long cold-war-like struggle to strengthen the forces of moderation and weaken the forces of violent intolerance within the Arab-Muslim world -- which is what the real war on terrorism is about. To be successful, Democrats will need a candidate who understands three things (which Messrs. Kerry, Lieberman, Clark and Edwards do):
First, this notion, put forward by Mr. Dean and Al Gore, that the war in Iraq has diverted us from the real war on "terrorists" is just wrong. There is no war on "terrorism" that does not address the misgovernance and pervasive sense of humiliation in the Muslim world. Sure, Al Qaeda and Saddam pose different threats, Mr. Marshall notes, "but they emerge from the same pathology of widespread repression, economic stagnation and fear of cultural decline." Building a decent Iraq is very much part of the war on terrorism.
Second, sometimes smashing someone in the face is necessary to signal others that they will be held accountable for the intolerance they incubate. Removing the Taliban and Saddam sent that message to every government in the area.
Third, the Iraq war may have created more hatred of the U.S., but it has also triggered a hugely important dialogue among Arabs and Muslims about the necessity of reform.
A serious Democratic candidate, I hope, will force the Bush team to accept the fact that it has failed to create a stable political transition in Iraq and must urgently change course in two ways: (1) It can't succeed in Iraq without forging a rapprochement with Iran, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Otherwise, they will ensure that we fail. If Iraq works, that will create its own reform pressures around the region. (2) The Bush team has to scrap the complicated caucus system it has devised for choosing an interim Iraqi government. It won't work. The Shiites' demand, though, for immediate elections also won't work.
The U.S. should beg the U.N. to find an Afghan-style solution for Iraq: expand the Governing Council from 25 to 75 people, bring in all strands and make it the interim government -- in return for the U.S. dropping its approach and the Shiites dropping theirs. It is the only way out of this impasse -- the only way to create a decent Iraq that can help us win the war of ideas in the region.
Democrats haven't been able to hold the Bush team accountable because their party couldn't offer a credible alternative. Well, here's hoping that the credible Democratic opposition was just reborn, re-energized and "de-intimidated" by the people of Iowa. Lord knows we need it.

HEADLINE: Heading for the Stars, And Wondering if China Might Reach Them First 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY and WILLIAM J. BROAD; Jim Yardley reported from Beijing for this article and William J. Broad from New York.

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
When President Bush outlined his ambitious vision last week for a new era of space exploration, one country in particular was on his mind as he extended an invitation for international cooperation: China. 
 In the last year, China succeeded in becoming only the third nation to put an astronaut into orbit, definitively signaling that it intends to break into the front rank of space explorers. 
 The Chinese plan to send more astronauts into space next year, to launch a Moon probe within three years, and are aiming to land an unmanned vehicle on the Moon by 2010, a half decade before the deadline President Bush set for the next Americans to arrive there.
The United States and China now stand at a critical juncture, between cooperation or competition, in what could be a costly and dangerous new space race that extends even beyond China. 
Mr. Bush was deliberately reaching out to the Chinese, a senior administration official in Washington said. "The reference to international cooperation was not a throwaway line," said the official of the speech on Jan. 14. "It was an invitation. The president drew a day-night contrast. This is not the cold war." 
But it could be. The Chinese are not alone in this new push to harness the power and prestige of space, which is fast becoming a necessary stop, like mastery of the atom, for aspiring global powers.
Nations like Brazil and India are taking ever wider steps to make sure that they are not left behind in the new space race, intensifying the pace of exploration by the developing world. 
Joan Johnson-Freese, an expert the Chinese space program at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, said the Bush administration had no choice but to respond to China's recent successes with a space initiative.
"The success allowed China to reach out to other countries and they've been responding favorably, so we could not do nothing," she said in an interview. "While a space race is not a foregone conclusion, it is a possibility." 
She added that the United States now had a window of opportunity for concord that might not last long. "Cooperation is the best position for the U.S. and the future," she said. "An inclusive vision will give the U.S. an opportunity to assume the mantle of leadership on a mission that could inspire the world."
The greatest concern is the militarization of space, using space-based weapons and satellites to extend the reach of nations or potential terrorists, and allowing more extensive and widespread intelligence gathering than ever before.
Such scenarios are central to the mistrust between the United States and China. Many American analysts note that China's manned space program falls under a wing of the People's Liberation Army, and suspect that China's primary ambitions in space are military.
Some analysts contend that China's manned space vehicle is specifically designed for potential military uses. The Chinese, meanwhile, saw the technological prowess displayed by the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, and are now emphasizing the importance of "information warfare," with the need for a presence in space.
In October, People's Liberation Army Daily said outer space would become a "sphere of warfare" because space-based satellite technologies were critical for a swift, modern military.
"It's clear that the Chinese are worried about the U.S. domination of space, and that the U.S. considers China as a potential competitor," said Adam Segal,a senior China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. "It's probably a good time to try to talk about these things since we haven't moved very far along in any of these plans."
President Bush never mentioned China by name in his address, but the administration official said that by not limiting his call to Europe and Russia he was implicitly reaching out to Beijing. Asked for comment on playing a possible role in Mr. Bush's Moon-Mars endeavor, China's Foreign Ministry answered in broad terms, noting that China is committed to collaborating with other space-faring nations, including the United States. 
But the Foreign Ministry also hinted at past frustrations, noting that the Chinese space program has already sought -- without success -- a stronger relationship with NASA. Since 2002, the ministry noted, the two sides have been talking about a meeting of the heads of the two space agencies. 
"We hope the realization of this meeting will present an opportunity for developing Chinese-American cooperation in the space sphere," the ministry said in a written statement.
Brian Harvey, author of the forthcoming "China's Space Program: From Conception to Manned Space Flight," said the United States had in the past excluded China on space issues, partly as political retribution for the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. In one case, American officials denied visas for more than 50 Chinese officials to attend an annual meeting of the World International Space Congress held in Houston.
"The Chinese have felt very isolated," Mr. Harvey said. 
Publicly, both American and Chinese officials now say the relationship is growing closer, even as frictions continue, particularly over Taiwan. Notably, the Chinese allowed Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to tour China's top-secret space command center in Beijing on the same day as Mr. Bush's speech on space.
The visit was part of a larger trip intended to build closer military ties. General Myers also met with his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Liang Guanglie, and later conferred with Jiang Zemin, the former Chinese president who remains in charge of the Chinese military.
At a news briefing, in a gesture to smooth tensions, General Myers was careful to praise China's successful launch last October. "Obviously, this is a big step for the Chinese space program, and we congratulate them," he said. 
China has taken other important steps as well. It recently teamed up with the European Union on a new global satellite navigation system. In a different project, China and the European Space Agency launched a research satellite last month to study the Earth's magnetic fields, China's first such collaboration with developed countries, state news media reported. China has also joined with Brazil on satellite launches. 
In all, China plans to launch 10 satellites this year, and a total of 30 by 2005; it currently has 16 in orbit. The satellites have scientific, commercial and military applications. 
More bold are China's plans to build on the success of last year's Shenzhou 5 space orbit, and eventually to land on the Moon. Officials say next year's Shenzhou 6 mission is expected to carry two astronauts on a five- to seven-day space journey.
Efforts to reach the Moon are beginning in earnest this year, and some experts in the United States speak ominously of a "Red Moon" -- the possibility that China might one day launch military astronauts into space with the aim of setting up a Communist lunar base. 
Last March, Luan Enjie, director of the China National Aerospace Administration, described the Moon as "the focal point wherein future aerospace powers contend for strategic resources."
But Mr. Luan and other Chinese officials say China's lunar ambitions are wholly peaceful. Mr. Luan suggested that one of China's primary motivations for reaching the Moon was possible economic exploitation. He told People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, that China was also interested in developing lunar energy resources, like helium-3, a rare form of the element that scientists say could power advanced reactors on Earth.
In an interview this week, Ouyang Ziyuan, chief scientist for China's Moon program, said the program was part of China's larger efforts to become a leader in space. 
"China has made a lot of achievements in satellite applications and manned space flight, but we haven't done much in deep space exploration," he said. "We need a breakthrough in this field to fill the gap. As a starting step, the Moon program is very necessary." 
United States government documents, like the Air Force's Space Operations Doctrine and its Space Command's Strategic Master Plan, talk much about maintaining "space superiority" near Earth and even about using weapons in orbit. But they remain silent about the Moon.
"There is nothing in Air Force planning for the Moon," said Theresa Hitchens, vice president of the Center for Defense Information, a private research group in Washington.
Still, some analysts believe the Moon is part of a larger American military plan and interpreted Mr. Bush's speech as unilateral in emphasis, with echoes of the cold war.
"The Moon is a beachhead," said Alice Slater, director of the Global Resource Action Center for the Environment, a private group in New York. "It's the high ground from which they want to control space" she said of the Bush administration.
Bush administration officials say they are not worried that China's space achievements will undermine American prestige and leadership. Throwing open the door to Beijing on the Moon-Mars initiative, they added, stands to enhance American influence.
But the real potential for cooperation, the senior official said, "we're going to have to determine over time as China's activities unfold." 
In the jubilant aftermath of the Shenzhou 5 flight, Chinese officials flirted with the notion of launching their own Mars mission by 2020. But this month, officials said any timetable was premature and that China was not yet far enough along to initiate such a program. 
Meanwhile, the official Chinese news media have closely followed the exploits of the American robotic Mars explorer, Spirit, as have Chinese space officials.
"We have been always closely watching Mars exploration activities," Mr. Luan, the top space administrator said on the day Spirit landed. "We hope the U.S. mission will be a complete success in the days to come."
This article is the first on the expanding space race in the developing world. Later articles will examine a setback in Brazil and India's attempt to use its space program for development.

HEADLINE: Tycoon Finds Russian Jail Falls Beneath His Standards 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS and ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
The food in there is slop, people say, but that is not why Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest prison inmate, skips lunch.
 He is just too busy, said a lawyer who visits him almost every day. Three months after his arrest, according his legal team, Mr. Khodorkovsky has plowed through 12 volumes of charges and evidence against him. He has 215 to go. 
 "Every day he surrounds us with questions," the lawyer, Anton V. Drel, said in an interview. "He has a lot of ideas."
The young cutthroat entrepreneur who is worth $8 billion after taking over Russia's biggest oil company, and who had begun to cast his eye on the presidency, seems to be pouring his heart into his new role as jailhouse lawyer.
It may be a futile exercise, as even his lawyers come close to admitting. The case of Mr. Khodorkovsky, 40, has clearly been orchestrated from the top, and courtroom arguments may have little influence on its outcome. "He understands that he may have to be in prison a long time," Mr. Drel said. "I can't say he looks very good. You can see that he's tired."
The charges against him are a hodgepodge of white-collar crimes including tax evasion, fraud, embezzlement and forgery, yet the real reason for his arrest is still a matter of debate here.
"There's still no definitive analysis," the American ambassador, Alexander Vershbow, said at a recent public discussion. "A lot of factors were involved. I think that clearly President Putin and the leadership viewed Khodorkovsky as posing both a political challenge and becoming too much of an independent actor in the economic sphere."
Just as clearly, the leadership has used the arrest to send a message about who is boss in Russia, and the audiences range from Mr. Khodorkovsky's fellow billionaires to the envious hoi polloi.
Beginning with a predawn arrest by armed masked men on Oct. 25 and continuing through a court hearing last week at which the defendant was shown on a television screen pleading in vain to be freed on bail, the Khodorkovsky case has been an exercise in public humiliation.
Mr. Khodorkovsky shares a small cell with two other men, exercises in a walled enclosure for two hours a day and is permitted to talk with his wife and parents through a plate glass window two times a month.
With President Vladimir V. Putin hinting last month that "five or seven or 10" more people could follow Mr. Khodorkovsky into jail, the country's wealthy oligarchs have lowered their heads and backed quietly away from their former colleague.
It is hard to find anyone -- apart from the lawyers who are paid to do so -- to defend him in public.
At the same time, with a presidential election arriving in two months, the pillorying of a super-rich oligarch does no harm to Mr. Putin's standing among the public.
"Most of Russia would be happy to see him carried through the streets in a cart so that they could poke sticks at him," said Pavel Arsenyev, who heads the Moscow office of the Foundation for Civil Liberties, which monitors prisoners' rights.
Already there seems to be a good deal of official poking going on.
As Mr. Khodorkovsky sits digging through his documents under a light bulb that shines around the clock, the government has been chipping away at his company, Yukos Oil.
Soon after his arrest, it froze about 40 percent of the company's stock, mostly belonging to Mr. Khodorkovsky. Then it began reviewing the company's licenses to natural resources. Since then it has begun to dun Yukos for more than $3 billion in back taxes and has removed the company's license to develop an important oil field. Two of the company's biggest shareholders have been jailed -- Mr. Khodorkovsky and his right-hand man, Platon Lebedev. Two others, who have taken refuge in Israel, have been placed on a government "wanted" list. The man who ran daily operations, Vasily Shakhnovsky, went on trial last week on charges of tax evasion and forgery.
Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest caused the collapse of a merger with a second Russian oil giant, Sibneft, that would have put him at the head of the world's fourth-largest oil producer. Negotiations to sell part of Yukos to an American oil company have also been thrown into doubt.
"First they imprison him, then they break up YukosSibneft," said Robert Amsterdam, one of a separate team of American lawyers defending Mr. Khodorkovsky. "Now they're going after Yukos for taxes. This is the way Putin works. The man sounds reasonable, but behind him the administrative machine works to expropriate the company."
Yukos remains immensely profitable despite these setbacks. But Mr. Khodorkovsky has transferred his interest in it to an associate and claims to have no access to its funds.
The $8 billion man lives on a different scale now, Mr. Drel said.
To supplement the dreadful prison food, he is permitted to receive about 70 pounds of supplies from home each month. Mostly his wife sends him yogurt, the lawyer said; once she sent him a chicken.
She has also opened a small account for him at the prison canteen, where he can buy treats like juice, cookies and pastries. Officially prisoners are allowed one shower a week, but Mr. Khodorkovsky can use his canteen bank account to pay for extra showers as well.

HEADLINE: Conservative Republicans Push For Slowdown in U.S. Spending 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
A day after President Bush vowed to submit an austere budget and halve the deficit in five years, conservatives in his own party said on Wednesday that they were not satisfied and stepped up their campaign to force the White House and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to do more to hold down the growth of government spending.
 Forty Republican House members gathered to hash out how to press Mr. Bush and the Congressional leadership to deal with spending increases that they say are running out of control and a deficit that is reaching alarming proportions. 
 Their discomfort has been echoed in recent weeks by conservative researchers and commentators who support Mr. Bush on most issues. Among them are the Heritage Foundation, the Club for Growth, a political action committee, and The Wall Street Journal's editorial page. 
"The president used the State of the Union to defend past spending increases, and he made eight specific calls for new spending increases," said Brian M. Riedl, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation. "But he made zero calls for spending cuts. He merely said focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending and be wise with the people's money. That's not specific enough."
Mr. Bush had long attributed the sharp swing from budget surpluses to deficits to the recession and the war on terror. Now, he faces political pressure not just from small-government conservatives in Congress and Democrats who say his tax cuts have plunged the government into a sea of red ink, but also from voters.
Polls show that the widening deficit is of increasing concern to the electorate and that Republicans are losing their traditional advantage over Democrats on the issue. 
A poll this month by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 51 percent of respondents called the deficit a top priority for Mr. Bush and Congress. That was up from 40 percent a year earlier and 35 percent two years ago.
Concern about the deficit was particularly evident among Democrats, 57 percent of whom identified it in the Pew poll as a priority issue, versus 44 percent of Republicans. 
Democrats said Mr. Bush had mortgaged the nation's future to pay for repeated rounds of tax cuts whose benefits went largely to the wealthy but that had failed to deliver the promised rebound in job creation. The party's presidential candidates regularly use the deficit as a proxy for Mr. Bush's overall economic management and argue that the deficits are leading the government to underfinance programs in areas like health and education.
The government ran a deficit of $374 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, and the deficit is expected to be around $500 billion for the current fiscal year. When Mr. Bush took office three years ago, the Congressional Budget Office forecast a surplus of $5.6 trillion for the following decade.
In recent years, Republicans have focused less on the deficit than on the desirability of holding down spending and enacting tax cuts to help the economy and restrict the growth of government. Politically, Republicans have always been able to rely on their image as the party to trust with the purse strings, and to assert that Democrats would raise taxes not to cut the deficit but to pay for even more spending. 
But an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll this month found that Democrats had nearly caught up with Republicans on the question of which party does a better job of controlling government spending. The poll found that 33 percent of respondents said Republicans did a better job, with Democrats at 31 percent.
Fiscal conservatives said it would be hard for them to make progress on deficit reduction in an election year, when lawmakers of both parties would be eager to send more federal money home to their districts.
"You're going to have someone upset with you if you do the right thing," said Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the group whose members were meeting to agree on ways to hold down spending and address the deficit. "That's what we've got to find out: Are our members willing to stand up and do the right thing?"
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Mr. Bush said he would send a 2005 budget to Congress next month that would hold the rise in discretionary spending to 4 percent, about what he proposed last year. 
Liberal groups said Mr. Bush had shortchanged many domestic programs to offset his increase in military spending and the budget for domestic security following the terrorist attacks in 2001. The catchall spending bill for the current fiscal year has been hung up in Congress because of partisan disputes, though Democrats signaled on Wednesday that they would let it pass this week.
According to calculations by the Heritage Foundation, government outlays for the current fiscal year will rise 9 percent, after increases of 13 percent in 2002 and 12 percent in 2003, making the last few years among the fastest-growing periods of government spending since the 1960's. White House officials said that Mr. Bush had spent money for the needed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and to protect the nation from terrorism and that domestic spending outside security had been held in check.
But many conservatives said they were still irked by Mr. Bush's record, especially since he signed into law last year an overhaul of Medicare that amounted to the largest expansion of a federal entitlement program in a generation.
"The Republican party has long been the party of small government," an aide to a senior Republican senator said, "but the era of small government has ended for the Republican Party."
Referring to Mr. Bush's call on Tuesday night for athletes to stop using performance-enhancing drugs, the aide said, "Unfortunately, the president's ban on steroids doesn't apply to the appropriators."

HEADLINE: Report Says Europe Is Behind on Single-Economy Goal 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
After a decade of effort, the European Union's goal to build a seamless single market out of 15 disparate economies is running out of steam, according to a report released Wednesday by its executive body, the European Commission.
 Even the union's more specific aim of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 is on course to fail, the commission's president, Romano Prodi, said on Wednesday in a statement intended as a warning to the union's current members. The report comes ahead of an economic summit meeting scheduled for this spring. 
 The leaders of the European Union adopted the ambitious vision of a knowledge-based economy at a summit meeting in Lisbon in 2000, when the Internet boom was at its peak. The agreement set specific goals to be reached by 2005, including an array of European Union legislation intended to pull the national economies together. 
Four years after the Lisbon meeting, the goal is still far off. "It is clear that we are going to miss our midterm targets," Mr. Prodi said, accusing the union's members of not demonstrating enough "ownership" of the joint project.
Unfinished tasks include the creation of unionwide laws on patent protection and intellectual property rights, and a directive on unionwide recognition of professional qualifications.
Last week, the commission called Belgium, France, Germany and Luxembourg laggards for failing to put in place unionwide internal market laws. Generally, it can take 18 months for laws approved by the union to be written into the national laws of member countries.
Since the European Union abolished internal borders 10 years ago, its internal market has increased economic growth across the union by at least 1.8 percent, the commission said in its report. By freeing the movement of goods across national boundaries, the internal market has helped create 2.5 million jobs, the commission estimated.
But the momentum is faltering. After steady progress in bringing the economies together in the 1990's, "some of the key measures are moving in the wrong direction," the report said.
It found that the price of goods in different countries in the European Union stopped converging in 1998, and the growth in trade within the union stalled in 2001 and started to shrink in 2002.
To achieve what is called the Lisbon strategy, the European Union would have to overtake the United States in terms of competitiveness. But the commission said that labor productivity -- one measure of competitiveness -- was declining in the union. "The gap with the United States has widened," it said.
A European Union diplomat who requested anonymity said that Germany was committed to the goals, but agreed that new impetus is needed in Germany to achieve them.
"Germany is in the process of implementing all E.U. laws, but it is a decentralized political structure," the diplomat said. "A federation like Germany cannot immediately go and implement laws." 
Another European Union diplomat from a large member country accepted the commission's criticism. "They are right," he said. "Member states are not following their commitments."
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Jacques Chirac of France are planning to meet on Feb. 18 to discuss the issues raised in the report. 
The diplomat said that while the commission is correct to scold member countries for failing to adopt the single-market laws, the commission itself should not stifle progress with too much regulation.
"There is a regulatory element to the problem holding the E.U. back," he said, adding that countries like Britain favor introducing "an 'is it necessary?' test for all E.U. laws."

HEADLINE: Investment Banking Helps Merrill to Record Profit 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit rose to a record, fueled by strength in investment banking.
 Merrill, based in New York, reported net income of $1.24 billion, or $1.23 a share, for the fourth quarter of 2003, in contrast to $539 million, or 56 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Analysts had expected earnings of $1.01 a share, according to Reuters Research. 
Shares of Merrill, however, fell 58 cents, to $59.60.
Net revenue rose 17 percent, to $4.92 billion, Merrill said.
For all of 2003, Merrill had a profit of $3.99 billion on net revenue of $20.15 billion.
"I think Merrill is real focused, that's why we own them," said Erick Maronak, director for research at Victory Capital in New York, which oversees about $1.7 billion. 
"The business looks solid," Mr. Maronak said, "the numbers look good and I think there's more to come."
Fourth-quarter profit was bolstered by after-tax gains of $45 million related to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and restructuring charges and other charges, Merrill said.
Fourth-quarter net revenue at the company's Global Market and Investment Banking unit increased 24 percent from a year earlier, to $2.2 billion, while revenue at its brokerage arm rose 9 percent, to $2.3 billion.
Merrill advised the FedEx Corporation on its recent $2.4 billion buyout of copy center operator Kinko's, and ranked No.3 in global debt and equity sales for 2003, behind Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, according to Thomson Financial.
The company, which has spent much of the last three years cutting jobs to reduce costs under E. Stanley O'Neal, its chief executive, added 300 jobs in the quarter, bringing its total number of employees to 48,100.
"I think O'Neal has been smart in what he's done and how he had reorganized the company over the last couple of years, but he's also gotten darn lucky," said Michael Vogelzang, who helps manage about $4 billion at Boston Advisors and owns Merrill shares.
"When the market is like it is the last six months," Mr. Vogelzang said, "there's enough business going around that everybody can make a lot of money at it, and they are one of the better firms in the business."
Merrill said investment banking revenue for the quarter was $759 million, or 32 percent higher than the same period a year earlier. 
A sharp rise in the business of helping corporate clients sell stock and bonds to investors led to a 45 percent increase in underwriting revenue, the company said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The Bush proposal on illegal immigrants is a tentative but important first step.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine, and he teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His new book is "Why Economies Grow," from Basic Books and the Century Foundation. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH'S recent proposal to grant temporary legal status to illegal immigrants is not yet fleshed out enough to judge how effective it will be. Six million to eight million illegal workers would qualify, as would future immigrants hired by companies that could show that Americans were not willing to take the jobs.
 One especially serious concern is that immigrant workers will be tied indefinitely to the company that sponsors them. Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at Notre Dame, warns that this would give the company undue power over wages and other worker rights, and a result could be a permanent class of low-wage employees. 
 But if the Bush plan raises more questions than it answers, it is still an encouraging first step that focuses needed attention on an issue that will become more urgent in coming years.
For one thing, there will probably be no stopping the steady march of unskilled and skilled labor across borders. The United States has been unable to stanch flows of illegal immigrants from Mexico, for example. 
But economists of varying political views also say that the limited migration of skilled and unskilled workers, if properly harnessed, can be a vital source of economic growth in developed and developing nations. 
"This is the last unexplored frontier of globalization," says Dani Rodrik, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "We have to start taking labor mobility seriously." 
In fact, theoretically, the bigger the differences in wages for similar work across the world, the greater the potential rise in incomes to the receiving and sending nations. It is analogous to the benefits from international trade when goods are cheaper in one country than another. 
A team of British economists led by L. Alan Winters of the University of Sussex has developed a traditional model to estimate such gains. In general, the model assumes that developed nations generate higher profits and more investment as labor costs are saved. They also generate higher government revenues as the new immigrants pay payroll and income taxes, as well as sales taxes. As for developing nations, their migrant workers now make far more money and send a large part of it home. 
Mr. Winters and his colleagues have found that if the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations increase by 3 percent their quotas of migrant labor, both skilled and unskilled, world income would rise by a considerable $156 billion a year, or 0.6 percent of total world income today. 
But if the theory is convincing, the practical issues are considerable. Absorbing lower-wage workers in host nations means that domestic wages are at least somewhat undermined. More immigrants will also put pressure on already overburdened social programs. As for the sending nations, they in turn may not receive a fair share of the economic benefits if workers leave and never return. 
A temporary limited migration program similar in principle but different in important details to what the Bush administration seems to have in mind can minimize such problems. By providing migrant workers legal status, including eligibility for domestic social programs, businesses could not easily pay wages below the going rate or ignore their payroll taxes and other benefits, as they now can for illegal immigrants. For these reasons, some labor unions are beginning to support such legalization.
With legal status, the immigrants will also be paying more taxes, including payroll taxes, to support social programs. In fact, the migration of young workers to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations could be an ideal way to pay part of the rising costs of public pensions, including Social Security in the United States, as populations age. 
As for benefits to developing nations, preliminary results of an incomplete survey by Mark Rosenzweig of the Kennedy School and his colleagues show that earnings increases for migrants over what they made in their home countries are steep. To give an idea, the average increase in annual wages for unskilled labor in 1996 was $7,400, and it was much higher for skilled labor.
Also, one fourth of the workers sent ample sums home. 
What is critical to the equitable distribution of benefits, however, is that workers return home after a few years. Cycling workers would allow more poor workers from a wider range of nations to migrate. Further, says Jagdish N. Bhagwati of Columbia University, these workers are often agents of change when they return, even if they are unskilled, because they bring back new attitudes, financial resources and knowledge. 
But simply requiring workers to return home is not enough. Attractive incentives must be provided as well, and those in the Bush plan are inadequate. Devesh Kapur, a professor of government at Harvard, who with his colleagues has done comprehensive research in the field, suggests that one possibility is to have the United States retain part of the wages paid to new legal migrant workers in an investment account that is given back to the workers only when they return to their home countries. 
As for the power of businesses over their recruits in the Bush plan, Mr. Kapur says that employees should be required to work for their sponsoring company for only a limited time, and then be allowed to look for other jobs. 
For all its benefits, however, greater labor mobility is no panacea in itself. In the United States, for example, a Bush-style immigration program would work best, in my view, in tandem with a reasonable increase in the minimum wage. As for sending nations, Mr. Rosenzweig points out that returning money in the form of remittances is most productive when the economy can adequately channel them to useful investment and social programs. 
Moreover, some older policies work at cross purposes. Mr. Kapur notes that one reason so many Mexicans flee to the United States is that the North American Free Trade Agreement subjected them to low-price American agricultural competition that is subsidized by the government. 
More labor mobility, then, is an exciting potential source of growth for all, but it will work only in conjunction with proper safeguards and fair and productive social policies.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE VOTERS; 
Kerry and Edwards Get Second Looks In New Hampshire

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 21 

 BODY:
A week and a half ago, when Steve Wulff and his friends held up homemade "Kerry for President" signs, their effort was met with derision. "Drivers heckled me and a jogger shouted I was wasting my time," recalled Mr. Wulff, a 20-year-old volunteer.
 But after Senator John Kerry's come-from-behind victory in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, an elated Mr. Wulff was in the campaign's headquarters late that night making a big yellow sign that read simply: "Thank You, Iowa." 
 Mr. Kerry's campaign is indeed grateful to Iowans these days because voters in New Hampshire are now taking a second look at him as they prepare to vote in their crucial primary on Tuesday. His campaign, like that of Senator John Edwards, was regarded as moribund, if not completely dead, before the Iowa vote. But both campaigns -- particularly Mr. Kerry's -- seem to be captivating voters throughout New Hampshire, prompting them to reconsider whether Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont and long the leader in polls here, is the best choice among the Democrats.
In dozens of interviews the past two days, many New Hampshire voters who were formerly undecided or supporting Dr. Dean or other candidates say they have decided to support Senator Kerry. His strong showing in Iowa, they say, is leading them to believe that he could very well be the strongest opponent against President Bush in November. 
Others say the renewed news media coverage of Mr. Kerry, as well as of the strong second-place finish by Mr. Edwards, has caused them to re-evaluate all the candidates, and many are liking what they see.
"I was wavering between Kerry and Clark, but now I think it will be Kerry for me," said William M. Cudmore, a student and reservist, who might logically have been seen as a supporter of Wesley K. Clark, a retired general. But as Mr. Cudmore browsed in a bookstore to avoid the cold, he said Mr. Kerry was "really picking up steam, and I like his stances on a lot of issues."
New Hampshire voters take pride in their independence, insisting that they have the first genuine primary because, unlike the Iowa caucuses, theirs is by direct vote. But in a year when the vast majority of Democrats here say in polls that defeating Mr. Bush is their first priority, they do not seem bothered that Iowa has pointed them toward a new candidate.
"I hate to follow the crowd," said Don Turnage, 57, a photographer from Concord who says he will now vote for Senator Kerry, "but Democrats need to get behind somebody who could win." 
Mr. Turnage said he had come to his decision about Mr. Kerry after focusing on him for the first time in a radio interview this week. He said that while he "really liked Howard Dean," he thought that Dr. Dean had little chance of winning a national election.
Opinion polls seem to reflect the shift. In mid-January, Dr. Dean was the clear favorite of New Hampshire voters, with Mr. Kerry polling a distant third place behind General Clark. Now multiple tracking polls show Dr. Dean and Mr. Kerry leading with General Clark slightly behind. Bill Shaheen, the New Hampshire state chairman of the Kerry campaign, who ran campaigns for Al Gore and Jimmy Carter here, said, "This is the latest-blooming rose I've ever seen."
It is not clear which other candidates will lose votes if Senator Kerry gains them, although some voters said that they had found Dr. Dean's poor performance in Iowa disappointing. Others said they were infuriated by his growling and defiant speech after the caucuses.
"I was a really strong supporter of Howard Dean, but I was completely turned off the way he yelled at the Iowa voters, and it really shook my confidence in him," said Lisa Dibrigida, a pediatrician, who was helping her children with homework at a Dunkin' Donuts in Bedford. She said the Iowa results had made her "want to take another look" at other candidates, particularly Senator Edwards. "For a lot of us, Iowa raised the issue of Howard Dean's electability," Dr. Dibrigida said.
Just two weeks ago, organizers of veterans for Senator Kerry said they had trouble filling buses for campaign events -- and veterans are one of the strongest constituencies of the decorated war hero. A lunch in Bedford this month was a polite and sober affair, attended primarily by businessmen supporting other candidates, whose companies had paid for their tickets. In a room of 200, there was only one table of supporters.
But on Tuesday, Mr. Kerry's return to New Hampshire was riotous, and supporters have been packing every event since.
"This has given him a huge boost here," said Steven Shurtleff, a retired United States marshal and supporter who works at the Museum of New Hampshire History in Concord.
Even so, actual support is difficult to measure because of the quirky ways of the Democratic primary. In New Hampshire, Republicans outnumber Democrats, and independents outnumber both. And independents may vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary. So it is difficult to measure how many of the state's 260,000 independent (or "undeclared") voters care enough about the Democratic primary to vote. This is the first year since 1984 when there is no active Republican contest here. That alone could increase the number of independents choosing a Democratic nominee. 
Some of the undeclared are people like Jason Marshall, a dock worker who voted for Mr. Bush in 2000 but is upset about the direction of the economy. He will vote for someone in the Democratic primary but said "it would probably be a last-minute decision."
According to polls, up to 20 percent of New Hampshire voters are undecided, and for them the drama in Iowa was a wake-up call.
"I have been kind of leaning towards Dean, but with so many candidates I've been very undecided, so now I'll be paying a lot more attention, and listening to what they are saying," said Erin Campbell, 27, a mother of two.
And in a state where people take voting seriously, it is clear that a lot of soul searching is going on. Megan MacMullin, an estate lawyer, said she had recently switched her support from Howard Dean to John Kerry, who she said, "has started doing a much better job of getting his message out."
But Jean Dowling, a retired dental receptionist from Merrimack, said she was more determined than ever to vote for Howard Dean.
"I'm sticking with him," Ms. Dowling said. "I liked his enthusiasm the other night even though everyone has been critical of it. I don't think John Kerry has enough spark, but in the end I'll vote for anyone other than George Bush."

HEADLINE: THE SKI REPORT; 
More Than a Race, the Birkebeiner Is a Way of Life

BYLINE:  By JACK BELL

 BODY:
For 30 years, the usually solitary sport of cross-country skiing has been transformed into a mass race of inspiration and perspiration along a 51-kilometer trail through the woods of northwest Wisconsin: it is the American Birkebeiner. 
 Four men -- John Kotar (64 years old), Ernie St. Germaine (56), David Landgraf (54) and Karl Andreson (80) -- have skied it every year since the first race in 1973. Known as Founders, they are no Johans come lately and will be among more than 6,000 skiers waxing, huffing and puffing on Feb. 21, when the 31st race begins in Cable (population 836) and wends south over 32 miles of groomed trails on challenging terrain to Hayward (population 2,129). 
 The Birkie, as it is called, is the largest cross-country skiing event in North America, drawing serious competitors from 19 countries and 45 states -- and more than 15,000 spectators -- to a refrigerated party that puts more than $4 million into the Wisconsin economy. It was not always so. 
"The first race had 34 people in it," said Kotar, a native of Slovenia, who is a professor of forestry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There were 33 men and one woman (Jacque Lindskoog of Edina, Minn.) in that first race. "At that time, most people thought we were a little nuts to do this kind of thing. But people like me kept coming back because it became like a marathon: each year you think you can do better."
The race is modeled after the Birkebeiner Rennet in Lillehammer, Norway, which commemorates a historic event during the Norwegian Civil War in the winter of 1206. Vikings wearing birch bark leggings (birkebeiners) saved the heir to the throne of Norway from invaders, taking the child on skis 55 kilometers, from Lillehammer to Trondheim, to safety.
"I started skiing two weeks before the first Birkebeiner," Landgraf, a physical education teacher in Bloomer, Wis., said. "It was a disaster. I was literally crawling up the hills at the end of the race. I keep going back because once you've done the race, you feel obliged, and I plan to keep going as long as it's enjoyable."
Landgraf recalled the fifth race, in 1977, when the creator of the Birkie, Tony Wise, persuaded several hundred serious Norwegian skiers to ski in the race. In all, there were 2,006 participants that year. 
"For some reason, they all took off before the starting gun," Landgraf said. "It was wild because people were still in the bathrooms, some didn't have their skis on. Once the race started, there was no coming back."
As the number of participants grew and the race began to attract elite skiers from other countries (Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Norway and Russia send the most) and increasing numbers of Americans, race organizers were forced to break the participants into groups, or waves. The initial wave includes elite men and women (76 percent of skiers are male) who are competing in the F.I.S. Marathon Cup series. Then comes 10 waves of skiers divided by competitive status and age. 
Cross-country skiing has evolved over the past 30 years, improved by technology that changed the equipment, training regimens and the style of skiing on the trail. When St. Germaine, an American Indian who is a tribal judge and historian on the Lac du Flambeau reservation in northern Wisconsin, got ready for that first race in 1973, he clipped his boots into now ancient three-pin bindings and grabbed a couple of bamboo poles. The style was classical: the glide technique. The goal was to finish without injury or frostbite. 
Since the middle of the 1980's, the most competitive skiers in the world have used the often frenetic skating style that was introduced by Bill Koch, a United States Olympian. The equipment has changed from the old Nordic three-pin bindings to the more streamlined Alpine bindings.
"With the advent of skate skiing, time is no longer a factor with me," St. Germaine, who was the best man at Landgraf's wedding, said. "I have and always will be a classical skier.
"The Birkie is a way of life. It helps me focus on a goal each year and helps me maintain a positive, healthy lifestyle. I think this would please those old Norwegians in Hayward, who held dear their heritage and keep alive a tradition, their way of life."
Registration (birkie.com) costs $120 and is still open for this year's event for people 18 and older. Two other races are open to children: the Sons of Norway/Swiss Miss Barnebirkie for ages 3 to 13, and the Junior Birkie for ages 10 to 15.

HEADLINE: Court Upholds E.P.A. Role in Alaska Case 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Narrowly divided on a question of federal versus state regulation, the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to insist that factories and power plants use the "best available" anti-pollution technology and to block construction of those that, in the agency's view, do not.
 The 5-to-4 decision came in a Clean Air Act dispute between the federal agency and Alaska over conditions for allowing the world's biggest zinc mine to expand its operations. The E.P.A. had overruled Alaska's acceptance of the technology that the Red Dog Mine proposed to use to control the additional pollutants that the expanded facility would emit. 
 The ruling has implications for the new generation of coal-fired power plants being planned across the Rocky Mountain West. These will require permits under the same provisions of the Clean Air Act that the court interpreted Wednesday. 
As an affirmation of the federal agency's authority over the states, the E.P.A.'s victory was in some respects an awkward one. The solicitor general's office vigorously defended the agency's authority when the case was argued in October. But a month later, the Bush administration abandoned more than 50 investigations into violations of the Clean Air Act, a sharp change in enforcement policy that rejected making use of the agency's full authority.
The agency's official response to the ruling appeared to reflect the situation's inherent ambivalence.
"We're reviewing the opinion," Cynthia Bergman, an agency spokeswoman, said, "and while we're pleased, we continue to believe that states have the primary responsibility for the enforcement of our environmental statutes."
Vickie Patton, a lawyer for Environmental Defense, an advocacy group that filed a brief in the case, said the decision "highlights the stark contrast" between the power the court has affirmed and the current position of the executive branch in "dramatically scaling back the use of these vital legal protections."
The Red Dog Mine, 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, is the biggest private employer in northwest Alaska. In 1996, the mine owner, Teck Cominco Alaska Inc., proposed expanding production by 40 percent. The plan required a special Clean Air Act permit because Alaska, having met the national standards for nitrogen dioxide pollutants, is required by the statute not to allow "significant deterioration" of its good air quality.
The question for the Supreme Court was whether federal or state environmental officials should have the final word on whether the mine's proposal to control its new emissions was the "best available control technology" that the law requires.
Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation had accepted Cominco's proposal to install an anti-pollution technology known as Low NOx, for low nitrogen oxide, as "logistically and economically less onerous" than an alternative that, while more expensive, was more efficient. The E.P.A. vetoed that decision on the ground that the state had not justified its refusal to insist on the alternative as the best available.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, upheld the E.P.A. In Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's opinion affirming that decision, the Supreme Court said Congress had "expressly endorsed an expansive surveillance role for E.P.A.," which the agency carriedout properly when it found Alaska's action to be unreasonable.
While the case, Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 02-658, presented a statutory rather than a constitutional issue, it had overtones familiar from the court's debates over the allocation of federal and state power. 
The dissent by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy accused the majority of "relegating states to the role of mere provinces or political corporations, instead of coequal sovereigns entitled to the same dignity and respect." But the states were divided in this case, with a group of mostly Western states siding with Alaska, and Northeastern states siding with the federal regulators. States including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut told the court that E.P.A. oversight "provides a necessary backstop" to clean air enforcement. These states' attorneys general recently declared that they intend to bring their own enforcement suits if the E.P.A. will no longer do so.
Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer joined the majority opinion. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas joined the dissent.

HEADLINE: Some Pataki Cash Sources Are Termed Questionable 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
The proposed budget that Gov. George E. Pataki rolled out on Tuesday relies on some questionable revenue sources to improve failing schools and close a $5.1 billion budget gap, starting with the money expected to come from video lottery terminals, lawmakers and budget experts say.
 Governor Pataki, a third-term Republican, has proposed establishing eight new gambling parlors with the slot machine-like devices, in addition to the eight parlors already approved for horse tracks. Together, the governor has projected, the gambling parlors will produce about $240 million for the state in the fiscal year beginning in April, and that sum should grow to more than $2 billion in the next three years. 
 Under his plan, all that money would be earmarked for improving New York City schools and other failing school systems in the state, as the state's highest court has ordered. 
Lawmakers from both parties, however, have expressed reservations about the plan and about other parts of the budget. Some said the budget plan is so porous it essentially leaves it up to the Legislature to find the ways to fill the holes.
In the case of the video lottery terminals, for instance, the constitutionality of the gambling parlors has been challenged in court by the Saratoga Chamber of Commerce, and a five-judge panel could upset the plan any day if it rules against the state.
Even if the court upholds the plan, and Mr. Pataki has confidently predicted that it will, most of the racetracks still have not opened their parlors. Saratoga and four other tracks upstate have plans to open them this year, but the two around New York City, Yonkers Raceway and Aqueduct, are not expected to have parlors running until next year, budget officials say.
No one knows what the new parlors will look like or where they will be located, though under the governor's plan, state lottery officials would ask casino operators to submit proposals. The governor has only proposed legislation saying the new parlors cannot be within 15 miles of upstate tracks or in the suburbs of Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties. Five could be put in the city, but not in the Bronx or Queens, or above 59th Street in Manhattan.
Assembly Democrats, many of whom are from the city, are leery of the proposal. First, they point out, the Board of Regents has estimated the cost of meeting the court order to provide a sound, basic education to city children as closer to $4 billion, and the money is needed sooner. In addition, some city lawmakers regard gambling as a tax on the poor. Finally, many say the supply of revenue from the gambling parlors might be unreliable and predictthat the court will reject it. 
"Not only is it not wise, I think it would not be approved by the court," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, the Education Committee chairman. The video lottery proposal has "multiple flaws," he added. 
Legislative leaders, however, recognize that the governor has now thrown the burden of finding an alternative to the parlors on their shoulders. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said on Tuesday that he did not want a casino on every street corner, but he was careful not to rule out the governor's idea. 
The Republican leader of the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, has made it clear that his caucus might have to accept the gambling expansion proposal because raising broad-based taxes was out of the question in an election year. The plan for video lottery terminals may be questioned by everyone, "but they end up having to support it," he said.
Mr. Pataki has expanded gambling significantly since taking office in 1995, pushing a law through the Legislature enabling him to negotiate compacts with Indian tribes to open six new Indian casinos. So far, however, only one of those has opened: last year in Niagara Falls. The state lottery has also expanded under his tenure, as has the Quick Draw gambling games in taverns. The State Lottery Division took in $5.39 billion last year, up from $3.61 billion in his first year in office.
Lisa Dewald Stoll, the governor's spokeswoman, said Mr. Pataki did not like gambling, but considered it a lesser evil than raising income taxes, business taxes or other broad-based taxes. When asked about the charge that gambling saps poor people of their money, Mr. Pataki has said again and again that New Yorkers are already squandering dollars at casinos in Connecticut, New Jersey and Ontario, and that the state should grab some of that revenue.
"The governor knows broad-based tax increases hurt New York's economy and our ability to create new jobs," Ms. Stoll said. "The lottery expansion will create new jobs and allow New Yorkers to see the dollars they already spend in states like Connecticut and New Jersey invested in their own state and in their own children."
Besides the gambling parlors, Mr. Pataki's budget also relies on accounting changes and capping the state and local contributions to the Common Retirement Fund to save $440 million and help close the budget gap. 
Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat, has said those changes would be illegal because they would harm the $117 billion fund's viability and would violate a constitutional ban on using the pension fund for fiscal relief. The comptroller, who is the sole fiduciary for the fund, informed the governor in late December of his stance, but Mr. Pataki put the savings into his budget plan in any case. His aides say he still hopes to negotiate a resolution with Mr. Hevesi.
"I think it was inappropriate for him to take this as a savings because it's illusory, it's not real," Mr. Hevesi said on Wednesday. "Even if I agreed and they passed the law, one retiree goes to court and wins."
The governor included other savings that if history serves as a guide, the Legislature will never accept. Among them are cuts to college scholarships worth $227 million, several reductions in benefits under Medicaid to save $425 million and cutbacks in aid for school buildings, trade schools and buses amounting to $186 million. 
Finally, he listed a savings of $170 million from his refusal to go along with the Legislature's plan to refinance and assume New York City's remaining debt from the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, even though the matter is still being fought out in court. 
The result is a budget that challenges legislators to come up with alternatives to these cuts, a process that is more complicated this year because of the coming election and the court order to improve schools. 
"There is the potential for a huge fight," one senior Democratic legislative staff member said, insisting on anonymity. "I can see places where this gets very contentious, and that's clearly not what the governor wants."

HEADLINE: JetBlue Airways Wants to Serve La Guardia 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
JetBlue Airways, the low-fare carrier that has become the largest airline serving Kennedy International Airport, asked the federal government yesterday for permission to begin flying from La Guardia Airport as well.
 The move is the latest step in an aggressive expansion drive by the four-year-old airline, which is based in Queens. Earlier this month, it began service from Boston, and it has ordered dozens of new aircraft that it will begin putting into service this year. 
 If the Transportation Department approves its request, JetBlue plans to begin flights from La Guardia this spring, said a spokesman, Gareth Edmondson-Jones. A spokeswoman for the department said it had not yet reviewed the application. 
JetBlue asked the government for 10 takeoff and landing slots at La Guardia, which would allow it to schedule five flights a day. It plans to operate from two gates, Mr. Edmondson-Jones said.
JetBlue has 83 flights a day from J.F.K., flying to 19 cities, out of its 222 daily flights to 22 destinations in the United States and Puerto Rico. 
Last month, JetBlue passed American Airlines to become the leading airline at J.F.K. in terms of passengers carried. Mr. Edmondson-Jones declined to say which cities JetBlue would serve from La Guardia.
In a statement, the airline's chief executive, David Neeleman, said that JetBlue did not plan to cut back on service to J.F.K., where the airline is constructing a new terminal and a new hangar. However, Mr. Neeleman said that some passengers prefer to fly into and out of La Guardia, which is closer to Manhattan and easier to reach from many areas than J.F.K. is.
"It does give our passengers another option when they choose to fly JetBlue," Mr. Neeleman said in the statement.
La Guardia gained a reputation during the late 1990's as a crowded airport beset by delays. But passenger levels have fallen since the economic downturn and the Sept. 11 attacks, leaving room to expand service.
In the 12 months ended in November, La Guardia handled 22.4 million passengers, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. That is down more than 11 percent from the 25.3 million people La Guardia handled in 2000.
The move by JetBlue comes as US Airways is seeking to sell several of its assets to raise cash. Those assets include its East Coast shuttle; gates at La Guardia and in Boston; and one of its hubs, in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia or Charlotte.
JetBlue is thought to be among the airlines that have requested information from US Airways, according to people briefed on the discussions. Mr. Edmondson-Jones would not comment. But he said there was no need to buy US Airways' gates at La Guardia to begin service because takeoff and landing slots are available.
"Obviously, we need confirmation back" from the government before putting the plan into action, Mr. Edmondson-Jones said. He added that the airline would be able to start service in two to three months once it decided to add an airport to its roster.
Despite its dominance at J.F.K., JetBlue lags behind another low-fare carrier, Delta Air Lines' Song, which offers service from all three New York-area airports. But JetBlue is quickly expanding, with plans to add both cities and aircraft. On March 3, it plans to begin service from New York to Sacramento.

HEADLINE: ROOM TO IMPROVE; 
The Ready-Mix Kitchen

BYLINE:  By MARCO PASANELLA

 BODY:
NOW that the big home retail stores are offering off-the-rack renovations, designers like me are wondering if we're obsolescent. Why hire an architect and a contractor to renovate, when a store can give you the whole shebang?
 Nowhere is this question more pressing than in the kitchen, a subject of national obsession. Hundreds of thousands of kitchens will be renovated this year, at an average cost of $17,700, according to Kermit Baker, an economist at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. More than half of such renovations are done by homeowners themselves, and many others by the top-to-bottom services of big retail stores. 
 The stores' popularity is easy to understand. One-stop planning, purchasing and installation cut the annoyances, and eliminating the middleman reduces the price. That's the theory, anyway. 
To see if the premise lives up to the promise, I asked four companies -- Ikea, Boffi, Expo Design Center and the Home Depot -- how they would propose to renovate the kitchen of a friend, Lara Suarez, in NoLIta. Armed with a sheaf of photos and a rough floor plan, I gave each company the same guidelines: show me the best value, and tell me what it should look like.
What I found is that, during hourlong initial consultations, the designers provided by each company were more patient and courteous than I am as they explained the relative merits of things like drawer slides.
Other customers I spoke with seemed to agree. Sue Williamson, an assistant principal at a high school in Brooklyn, said her Home Depot designer "read me well" and was unfazed when she called "in hysterics" with last-minute changes. Ken Arthur, managing director of a children's theater company, said he was pleasantly surprised to find that Expo, a Home Depot company that sells higher-end merchandise, helped him get building permits and navigate his co-op board's approval process when he renovated his kitchen last year. "What I thought was going to be fast and cheap turned out to be fast, inexpensive and well done," he said.
On the other hand, gaining access to a store's expertise can be hard. To meet with a staff designer, who helps you lay out your space and select materials, the Home Depot, Expo and Boffi require retainers ($100, $750 and $2,000 respectively); Ikea's consultations are free.
At the Expo Design Center in New Rochelle, N.Y., a sales agent told me to pick what I wanted from the store's 100,000 square feet of cabinet, counter and appliance displays. I would then pay $750 toward my cabinet selection and be assigned a designer. But how, I wondered, was I supposed to pick by myself? Estimating cost is vexing, as each cabinet style has several prices per linear foot, with premium choices costing up to five times as much as the basic versions. How would I find the best value? And what about the look? Buy now, design later? Not for me.
My Expo visit made clear the cold reality behind off-the-rack renovations: stores exist to sell, and their employees, particularly those working on commission, have incentives to sell customers as much as possible. (Granted, designers like me often work on commissions based on a percentage of construction and appliance costs -- 20 percent is typical -- and contractors customarily add a markup. The retail stores charge no design fees if you buy their merchandise.)
One shortcoming at Ikea and the Home Depot is that the designer does not normally see the kitchen before drafting a scheme. Instead, the company sends a measurer who, in turn, conveys the dimensions, and in some cases photographs, to the designer. But the person with the tape measure would rarely take note of where the morning sun comes in or what style furniture is in the living room.
Normally, a designer would see a renovation through from concept to completion, being sure that as problems arise, what is built is in keeping with the original design. At Ikea, Expo and the Home Depot, on the other hand, the designer passes a plan to a project manager, although the Expo designer monitors the progress. When a hollow wall turns out to be solid or a pipe pops up in an unexpected place, the project manager adapts the design.
The nuts-and-bolts execution is the stores' biggest challenge. All but Boffi hire subcontractors to do the actual work.
Any renovations can be hellish, of course, no matter whom you hire to do them. The best you can hope for is that when problems arise, they can be addressed quickly. Expo, Ikea and the Home Depot, however, often require full payment up front, rather than in stages, as is the norm when a designer supervises the job. So when things do go wrong, customers are left with little leverage.
Susan Hughes, a public relations consultant in Washington, said that she was thrilled with Expo's design for her kitchen, but that its installation was a nightmare. Several months ago, she said, she returned home from work to find water from a bathroom flowing through her living room, and no workers in sight. Three crews later, Expo has agreed to pay $2,500 to replace her ruined carpet, but her kitchen is still unfinished. (The company has promised it will be done by the end of the month.) Ms. Hughes found that she had limited influence over the workers because they were hired by Expo. "How can you read the riot act to workers you didn't actually hire?" she asked. 
Customers may be able to avoid these problems by asking about the specific crew assigned to the job -- how many kitchens has it done, and how much experience does it have? Alternatively, customers may want to hire their own contractors.
And now for the results. Some $50,000 separated the most expensive plan (Boffi, at $59,100) for Ms. Suarez's kitchen from the least expensive (Ikea at $8,906). But which was the best?
Each store's designer had to contend with the kitchen's idiosyncracies. At almost 10 feet by 10 feet, it is roomy, but the shallow shelves offer little storage. The only place to put a dish next to the stove is in the air.
To open up the space, Boffi cleverly proposed moving the refrigerator from its prominent position by the living room and tucking it behind a door. Ikea flipped the refrigerator to the oven side, freeing up the entire sink wall for food preparation. To increase storage, all the plans added cabinets above and below the counters. Ikea, Expo and the Home Depot took advantage of the high ceilings in the room -- nine and a half feet -- to add taller cupboards. The catch was that the top shelf would be out of Ms. Suarez's reach. More storage does not always mean usable storage. Only Boffi deliberately used standard-height cabinets, placing them within easy reach. 
In my opinion, all four companies piled too much onto their renovations. Ikea and Expo marooned seven-foot-tall cupboards in clumsy freestanding positions. Boffi extended its cabinets partly over an opening into the living room, obscuring a valuable view. Each company also called for generous drawers -- handy for a line cook, but probably not necessary for a client whose primary meal is a morning cup of coffee. None of the designers told me that cabinets with drawers are typically 15 percent more expensive than those with doors. And everyone was quick -- overly quick, I would say -- to have Ms. Suarez's charming old-fashioned stove and two-year-old refrigerator replaced.
The tendency to overdo was most evident in the Expo scheme. Jumbled and visually dissonant, it featured awkwardly shaped countertops and moldings that did not match others already in the room. Added to that were details that suggested a McMansion, like expanses of stainless steel (stove, dishwasher, refrigerator and microwave), beige granite counters and a backsplash made of inch-square tile and inset with depictions of fruit.
The Expo designer actually saw the kitchen. Designers for the other companies -- Boffi, Ikea and the Home Depot -- may have been hampered because they had only secondhand information. But they proposed covering up the beautiful tile work under the sink or ignored the ceramic insets in the existing backsplash. Nor could they consider the kitchen in relation to other rooms. To avoid grappling with the existing conditions, the Home Depot's designer opted for what he called a neutral look. Natural maple cabinets with simple paneled doors were intended to harmonize with the surroundings -- an arbitrary selection, because there is no maple in the rest of the apartment.
Ikea took a similar tack with gray ash cabinets, albeit with a bit more Euro flair. Boffi was the only vendor to address the issue head on by boldly inserting its trademark sleek cabinets and counters, in stark contrast to the existing ramshackle environment. None of the designers I consulted suggested restoring the moldings. Only Expo's designer proposed painting the peeling walls.
Naturally, the vendors specified only those products carried by their employers. But the best kitchens usually come from a wide and imaginative variety of sources. With a little more flexibility, Ikea's frosted-glass cabinets, at $66 for a model 18 inches wide and 30 tall, could be paired with a colorful glass mosaic tile backsplash. Or the Ikea cabinet shells -- "carcasses," as they are called in the trade -- could be given upgraded doors like solid oiled walnut with nickel-plated flush pulls. 
The biggest differences among the proposals lay in the quality of the materials, which generally varied according to cost. Boffi's extra-chunky stainless steel counters are almost twice the standard thickness, and, at almost $7,000, cost roughly twice as much as stainless counters from commercial kitchen supply stores. The finish is nearly as lustrous as sterling silver, rather than the familiar brushed tin. The same level of finish is found in Boffi's luxuriously shiny and indestructible polyester-coated cabinets. Even the utensil drawers have the confident thunk of a Mercedes door.
The Omega Embassy cabinets selected by Expo are plywood, not the less durable particleboard, with substantial stainless drawer slides. Expo's granite is . . . well, granite -- but at $79 a square foot installed, it is competitive with that of specialty stone suppliers. The Home Depot's KraftMaid cabinets are also appealing, if a little less solid than Expo's. The Home Depot recommended counters of Silestone, a low-maintenance synthetic that looks fake.
At the low end, Ikea's cabinets are heftier than its furniture, and they offer good value, with fully extendable drawers and substantial drawer bottoms, three-eighths of an inch thick. Ikea's hardware may look a little skimpy, but it's easily replaced. Hi-Macs, the acrylic material Ikea recommended for countertops, is durable and stain-resistant.
Despite the range of prices quoted, the four schemes displayed a remarkable uniformity: two rows of boxes set across from each other and a fixation on stainless steel. A store designer is unlikely to offer any radical ideas, like liquid crystal lighting, or even mildly adventurous ones, like open slotted racks for dish storage.
In the end, perhaps that's not so important. Not every kitchen needs to be a design statement. All the vendors have a solid grasp of space planning; all make it easy to envision options; all supply well-made products. In short, each does a decent job. And sometimes decent is good enough. With these off-the-rack suppliers taking on most of the burden, you are free to focus on what is most important: what comes out of your kitchen and whom you share it with.

HEADLINE: For a Fee, Wind Up Atop the Search Heap 

BYLINE:  By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
GOOGLE vanity is getting to be costly.
 As Internet users seek to differentiate themselves from people who share their names, some are buying their way to prominence on Google, Yahoo and other search engines. The added exposure comes courtesy of keyword advertising, in which marketers -- or common folk, for that matter -- bid to have brief advertisements appear atop or beside search results whenever Internet users type in certain words. 
 Most commonly, that means users who type the phrase "airline tickets" into a search box on Google or Yahoo will see a prominent text ad for Expedia or Travelocity, for which those companies bid more than 75 cents per click last week on Yahoo (Google does not disclose bid prices). But increasingly, it means people will also find an "ad" for Mark Pincus, for instance, whenever they type in his name into Google. 
Mr. Pincus, a San Francisco-based technology entrepreneur who most recently founded a networking site, www.tribe.net, bought his own name on Google in 2002, he said, because he thought people would have trouble finding him after a job move.
"I'd been chairman of a company called Support Soft, so if people wanted to find my bio, they could Google me and find me that way," Mr. Pincus said. "But when I stepped down, that was gone, so in a sense my Internet history had been wiped out."
"I knew that when people Googled me, what came up was a lot of random stuff, and I wanted to control what was found about me," he said. "And O.K., I also loved to see how many times I got Googled in a week."
When Internet users type Mr. Pincus's name into Google these days, they are greeted by a tinted ad with a link to his biographical page, atop a page of other Mark Pincus-related links. The ad, when clicked, yields a resume and links to Mr. Pincus's personal Web log, or blog, and the blog of the extended Pincus family. He pays the Google minimum, a nickel per click, for the ad -- and 25 percent of those searching for his name click on the link. 
Charlene Li, an analyst with the technology consultancy Forrester Research, said that buying one's own name as a string of keywords "is a trend that definitely has legs, especially if their name carries some sort of brand weight."
"These are people that want to be found, for whatever reason," she said.
The practice, Ms. Li said, has been dominated by freelancers and other independent professionals like doctors or lawyers. The chief benefit for advertisers is that they pay nothing until their ads are clicked on. (Those bidding on unusual names would also be at an advantage, with fewer potential competitors.) Advertisers may also set a limit on what they pay, and they receive reports on the number of clicks logged, among other things. 
Of course, for those with unusual names and enough archival material on the Web, an advertisement may be unnecessary, since a biographical Web page may appear near the top of search listings anyway. "The more common your name, the harder it is for people to narrow it down to you," Ms. Li said.
That is one reason Andrew Goodman of Toronto, the founder and principal of Page Zero Media, an Internet consulting firm, also buys his own name on Google. In Google's conventional search-engine results, the first link to Mr. Goodman, who shares his name with one of three civil rights workers slain in Mississippi in 1964, appears below three links to that Andrew Goodman. 
Mr. Goodman paid 22 cents a click to have searches on his name also return a tinted box at the right under "sponsored links;" it links to a page about a book he has written (on search-engine marketing, naturally). But he is getting competition for his own name -- and not from other Andrew Goodmans: a pair of authors of a competing book have secured a sponsored link next to his.
"I'm paying 22 cents for my name now, but they're outbidding me," Mr. Goodman said. "I'd rather pay 10 cents, of course, but if someone makes me pay 50 cents, I'll do it."
Google allows individuals to bid on the names of other people, with the exception of trademarked names. Dana Baker, editor in chief of Yahoo's Overture unit, which displays the paid search ads at Yahoo's site, among others, said that the company's editors also generally barred advertisers from buying other people's names.
Jennifer Vaughn, a freelance voice-over artist in Bokeelia, Fla., said the result page for her name on Google yields a monthly average of 116 clicks on a sponsored link to her site, www.jennifervaughn.com. (She says she is not sure what she pays for the link, because "Jennifer Vaughn" is just one of 150 phrases or words she buys on Google.) "If people have done business with me and wanted to do business with me again, people are in the habit of typing the name into the search engine first," she said. "It's worked really well."
Buying one's own name this way does raise some thorny questions, though, Ms. Li of Forrester said. For one, if you are well known professionally as an employee of a particular company, the company may not want you to divert prospective clients to a site other than its own. 
Ms. Li said that she began buying her own name at Google (5 cents a click) and Overture (10 cents) last year, but that when users type it in, they get a sponsored link not to a personal page, but to her biography at the Forrester Research site. "I think about that," she said. "The fact is, I may stay with Forrester for a long time, but at some point I may not be with them. And the fact of the matter is, this is my reputation I need to protect."
Meanwhile, the ad has even provided interesting personal results. In late December, a former boyfriend in Amsterdam e-mailed her after a hiatus of several years, using the contact information found through the Google ad. "It was a good thing, though," she said. "We're still friends."

SHORTLY after Phish, the improvisational rock band, finished its New Year's Eve concert at American Airlines Arena in Miami, perhaps a couple of hundred people remained at play in the private suites that lined the hall. Brad G. Serling, as big a Phish fan as they come, joined them briefly but soon had to depart for the bowels of the arena.
 "Everyone's making plans to go party, and here I am making plans to go to the production office," said Mr. Serling, 31. His tone was a bit rueful, but he was certainly not complaining. 
 That is because there was no place Mr. Serling, a Johnny Appleseed of online concert recordings, would rather go. By 2:30 a.m., he later recounted, he had the entire concert on his iPod, courtesy of the band's sound engineer. At 4:30 a.m., he was back at his hotel in South Beach, transferring the more than two gigabytes of audio files to one of the three laptop computers he had brought along. 
Later in the day, from a hotel with a faster Internet link, he uploaded the concert files to the Internet. And so, by the morning of Jan. 2, Phish fans worldwide could pay $11.95 to download the New Year's Eve concert from Live Phish Downloads (www.livephish.com), a site run jointly by the band and Mr. Serling's company, Nugs.net.
Mr. Serling had also joined forces with three less-prominent bands -- the Radiators, the String Cheese Incident and Yonder Mountain String Band -- to post recordings of their own New Year's concerts at another site, LiveDownloads (www.livedownloads.com).
As other technology companies scramble to match the success of Apple's online music store, iTunes, which sells songs for 99 cents each, a different online-music economy is emerging around the sale of recordings of live performances -- often with no restrictions on how they can be played or shared. 
Since it was established in late 2002, Live Phish Downloads, which now offers audio files for about 50 Phish concerts, has generated more than $2.25 million in sales. Its success has helped prompt a new look at the potential for bands to become their own distributors online.
And on Tuesday, Coran Capshaw, manager of the Dave Matthews Band, said the group had agreed to set up a downloading site with Nugs.net. While other bands following a similar model have focused on selling concert recordings, the Dave Matthews Band intends to begin in March by selling downloads of its album catalog, to be followed shortly by sales of concert recordings. (RCA, the band's record company, is to receive part of the proceeds from the sale of albums online.)
Even Phish's record company, Elektra, which receives a small cut of the Live Phish Downloads proceeds, has embraced the band's online marketing of its music. 
"We always thought it would be nice for there to be a happy medium where the band gets more involved with the fans, and this seems to us to be a perfect way to do it," Brian C. Cohen, Elektra's senior vice president for marketing, said in a telephone interview. "It gives the fans access to officially sanctioned recordings. It conditions the fans to not expect to get these things for nothing, and I personally think it's a model, both for the record business and for bands, whether signed or not, to make money from valuable content and at the same time seed the relationship in a very positive way with the fans."
One way that selling downloads appeals to fans is by offering music files that are not crippled by limitations on where and how many times the file can be copied. Such so-called Digital Rights Management systems are used by many traditional online music stores. But most of the budding concert download sites, including Live Phish Downloads, sell unrestricted files.
"The No. 1 issue that most of the music industry has wrong is D.R.M.," Mr. Serling said in an interview last week at his home in Los Angeles. "Why make it harder for people to buy your product? The answer is fear, and you have to get over the fear. What would you do if you walked into Tower Records to buy the new Dave Matthews Band CD and the guy behind the counter said: 'Here's your CD. It's $18, but you can only listen to it in your den on one stereo. You can't take it to the car. You can't put it on your iPod.' You would laugh at him and walk out, right? It's the same thing here."
"I don't live in a fantasy world," he added. "I know we're getting ripped off left and right by people copying our files. But people who are intent on ripping you off are going to rip you off no matter what you do. All we can do it make it easier for the vast majority of people who want to do the right thing."
However compelling that argument, Mr. Capshaw said the Dave Matthews Band had not decided whether its online offerings, particularly its albums, would be copy-protected or unrestricted. (For its part, Phish recently gave would-be pirates a new incentive to do the right thing, announcing that it was donating its profits from Live Phish Downloads to a nonprofit group supporting music education for children.)
Other bands, too, are being drawn to the model. In November, the hard-rock band Primus began PrimusLive (www.primus.com) with a company called BackOfficeMusic. Last month, the guitarist Steve Kimock started a live-concert download store in partnership with a new New Jersey company called DigitalSoundboard (www.digitalsoundboard.net). 
A year ago Pearl Jam began offering downloads of live shows to fans who also bought a CD of that concert. Now, the band also offers concert recordings through iTunes, though only song by song. 
But even as other bands and other companies get into the concert-downloading game, Mr. Serling is the sector's youthful godfather.
Growing up near Philadelphia, Mr. Serling became a serious fan of the classic rock of the 1960's and 1970's. By 1990, when he entered Cornell, he was regularly taping Grateful Dead concerts in the area that the band set aside for noncommercial tapers -- and meeting like-minded fans through the Internet-based interest groups known as Usenet. 
At that time, trading Grateful Dead tapes was an arduous experience, often conducted by mail, and there was one big problem: sound quality. "People have all of these subjective ratings for their tapes and someone's like, 'Oh this is an A+,' but then you get it and it sounds horrible," Mr. Serling said. "So I thought it would be great to put up clips from the tapes so you know what you're getting."
Given the bandwidth limitations of the early 1990's, that was a challenge, but by 1994 Mr. Serling had posted some audio clips from his collection to a computer server set up for Grateful Dead fans. And so the seeds of Nugs.net were planted.
After college, Mr. Serling went to work in a new kind of business -- Web design and consulting -- where his company did not mind his using the corporate bandwidth. In 1995, he started offering RealAudio streams of shows. In 1997, he bought the Nugs.net domain -- short for nuggets -- and in 1999 began offering MP3 tracks that could be downloaded and replayed. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Serling continued to collect and post concert recordings of bands that allowed taping. By June 2000, fans were downloading 500,000 MP3 files a month from Nugs.net, from bands including the Grateful Dead, Phish and the String Cheese Incident. The demand was met with the bandwidth of Mr. Serling's new employer, CinemaNow, for which he became chief technology officer. 
When Nugs.net hit that mark, Mr. Serling said, "that was when I saw that there was enough interest to make a business out of it" -- in other words, to begin selling recordings, if permission could be obtained. 
Around the same time, the same idea appeared to occur to music executives, including John Paluska, Phish's manager. "We became aware of Nugs.net in particular as a very well-run and successful fan site that had both a lot of shows, high-quality shows and, even more than that, high reliability and customer satisfaction, even though it was just a fan site," Mr. Paluska recalled in a telephone interview. "So we started looking around and asking, 'Who's running this site?"'
The result was a collaboration between Phish and Mr. Serling called Live Phish Downloads, established in December 2002, which now posts live recordings of every Phish concert for sale within 48 hours. Profits are divided between the band and Nugs.net on undisclosed terms.
Last summer, when it was clear that Nugs.net had made the leap from fan site to business and that Mr. Serling had made the leap from Johnny Appleseed to commercial farmer, he quit his job at CinemaNow.
Now, from a spacious house in the Hollywood Hills, with a microwave antenna pointed at a receiver somewhere in the flatlands below, Mr. Serling is just trying to stay ahead of his new competitors. In addition to a deal with the Dave Matthews Band, Nugs.net has reached a broader agreement with Musictoday, a company run by Mr. Capshaw that provides Internet services to more than 250 other bands, including Metallica and the Rolling Stones.
Musictoday already offers services like Web stores, ticketing and fan club support to its artist clients. Now, Musictoday will also offer those bands a downloading service powered by Mr. Serling's operation. For Nugs.net, the Musictoday deal is meant to expose the company to hundreds of bands without having to hire dozens of salespeople.
"Hopefully this deal can help us get to the next level," Mr. Serling said.
Until now, most bands that have embraced selling concert recordings are best known for their improvisational live performances, not studio albums. Mr. Serling acknowledges that his distribution model might not appeal to every musical act -- at least until there is more evidence of potential profits.
For now, though, after years of running Nugs.net as a labor of love, Mr. Serling feels as if he is living a fantasy. In addition to the pay sites, Nugs.net still offers dozens of concerts free, in both streaming and downloadable formats.
"This is what I would be doing even if there were no LivePhish.com," Mr. Serling said. "I would be out there as a taper with my recording deck and making files and putting them up on Nugs.net. It's nice to be able to do the same thing and also pay the rent."

Listening In
Downloading a Copy of the Concert You Missed
 THOSE accustomed to downloading individual songs as MP3 files may be in for a jolt if they try downloading complete concerts. The files are, of course, a lot bigger.
If you don't have a high-speed connection, be prepared to give your computer and phone line over to downloading overnight (at least).
And get ready to learn some new technical lingo. Many of the new concert-download sites offer two file formats, MP3 and FLAC. 
MP3 is known as a lossy compression format. That means that if a standard audio file is compressed to MP3 and then re-expanded for burning onto a standard CD, the resulting file is not an exact copy of the original: audio information has been permanently lost.
FLAC (short for free lossless audio compressor-decompressor), on the other hand, is lossless. If a standard audio file is compressed to FLAC, the resulting file is not as small as an MP3, but when re-expanded it should be an exact copy of the original file. Audiophiles prefer lossless compression formats, but those files are bigger and take longer to download.
For instance, Phish concerts at Live Phish Downloads generally take up three CD's once uncompressed (about 2 gigabytes, or 2 billion bytes of information). In MP3, the same concert would occupy only about 150 megabytes and take about 20 minutes to download over a 1-megabit broadband connection, or about six hours over a 56-kilobit dial-up link.
In FLAC, the show might occupy 900 megabytes.
Because lossless files are bigger, concert downloading sites generally charge more for them. Live Phish Downloads, for instance, generally charges $9.95 for the MP3 version of a concert and $12.95 for FLAC. (The New Year's Eve concert costs more because it occupies four CD's.) 
Here are a few sites that sell downloads of concert recordings, generally for about $10 for an MP3 version and $13 for a higher-quality format.

www.livephish.com -- About 50 Phish concerts, as well as side projects by band members.

www.livedownloads.com -- A few shows from the Radiators, the String Cheese Incident and Yonder Mountain String Band.

HEADLINE: Panel Offers Energy Plan For City in '08 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS LUECK

 BODY:
A mayoral task force looking into New York City's expanding energy needs said yesterday that the city would need about 25 percent more electricity by 2008. The group recommended that new power plants be built, that existing ones be retrofitted and that the process for selecting sites for plants be simplified.
 The New York City Energy Policy Task Force, formed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in July, said the added electrical resources would be needed for economic expansion, to make energy prices competitive with those in other cities and to fill a void created by power plants that are mothballed. The group, headed by the city's Economic Development Corporation, includes more than a dozen utility executives, environmentalists and economic development officials. It described its recommendations as an "electricity resource road map" that would require large investments and pressure from the government and private companies. 
 Among the most politically sensitivequestions addressed was where new power plants should be built. Although the group did not point to any specific sites, it said the city must make sure that its zoning rules provided adequate industrial parcels for new plants. The report also called on legislators in Albany to reinstate rules that expired in 2002, which streamlined the complex regulatory process required to approve the sites of new power plants. But it said the rules should also require more analysis of the how emissions affected neighborhoods, and ensure that low-income and minority communities were not singled out for new plants.
Among its recommendations to the city, the group said long-term electrical power purchasing agreements should be considered with private companies that would be contingent on the construction of new or retrofitted power plants. It said meetings should be held with developers and financial institutions aimed at providing financing for new plants and power lines. It also said that existing but outdated power plants should be retrofitted. 
Gil C. Quiniones, a senior vice president of the Economic Development Corporation and chairman of the task force, said yesterday that it would issue future reports twice a year on how its recommendations are faring. In a statement, Mayor Bloomberg said the city's energy needs "are growing day by day, and we must act now to ensure that have sufficient supply of clean and reliable power." 
Ashok Gupta, an official of the Natural Resources Defense Council and a member of the task force, called the report "a comprehensive and balanced blueprint for meeting future electricity needs while reducing harmful pollution."

None of Our Rowdy Friends Have Settled Down
The event on Tuesday night was billed as a bipartisan viewing of PRESIDENT BUSH's State of the Union address.
 But a quick scan of the room made it seem as if the EASTERN ESTABLISHMENT of political, business and media types had been told to meet at the closest treehouse. DAVID ROCKEFELLER; PETER G. PETERSON, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations; NICHOLAS LEMANN, dean of Columbia's journalism school; DAVID DINKINS; TINA BROWN and HAROLD EVANS; even MOBY, the outspoken rock star, was there. 
 The host was The Atlantic Monthly, and the place was Madison Avenue at the swank Sony Club atop the Chippendale-style skyscraper designed by PHILIP JOHNSON.
The impression was confirmed by the electronic straw poll (as well as the groans during the president's televised speech) that 73 percent of the room "strongly disagreed" with Mr. Bush's idea of abstinence education to fight venereal disease.
"We see a common theme here, of godless New York," joked the evening's host, JAMES FALLOWS, a correspondent for The Atlantic. He then introduced WALTER CRONKITE.
"Never before in the history of this nation," said Mr. Cronkite, in his finest Men-Walk-on-Moon delivery, "has a president of the United States taken such a firm stand, as he did tonight, against -- gonorrhea." Pause. Guffaws. Applause.
GEORGETTE MOSBACHER, a prominent Republican fund-raiser, leapt to President Bush's defense.
Social Security, education and other domestic issues weren't addressed by BILL CLINTON and the Democrats when they were in office, she said, despite the simultaneous advantages of low interest rates, low inflation and a budget surplus.
Indignant, LAUREN HUTTON cited the quadrupling of the national debt and Mr. Clinton's attempts to reduce it. "But I guess you can't read or something," said Ms. Hutton, glaring at Ms. Mosbacher. "Because I can, and I'm a model! "
Like a Christian surrounded by lions, Ms. Mosbacher seemed to radiate defiance. "You don't have to personally insult me to make a point," Ms. Mosbacher said. "I didn't insult you."
Ms. Hutton, taken aback, replied, "How did I personally insult you by saying I'm a model?"
Ms. Mosbacher, accepting some sort of Warner Brothers cartoon logic, said, "That's an insult to you!"
Then Ms. Mosbacher gathered her purse and a copy of The Atlantic Monthly, as if about to leave. But she stayed awhile longer, before leaving, untheatrically.

Dude, Where's My Gun?
ASHTON KUTCHER, paramour of DEMI MOORE and avatar of "Punk'd," cannot go anywhere these days where photographers may gather without something in their reptilian brainstems that says circle, scent, pounce.
So it was at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on Columbus Circle yesterday when Mr. Kutcher, just in from Park City and the Sundance Film Festival, bounded onstage. Suddenly, paparazzi thrilled to the chase, electronic flashes flaring, shouts from behind lenses of "Ashton, this way!" "Ashton, that way!" "No, Ashton, over here!"
Mr. Kutcher, wearing a green ski cap and a tie-and-sweater combination, took it all in good-natured, arms-akimbo stride. By now, he has fashioned his own boyish shtick to amuse reporters while avoiding questions he finds annoying.
At one point, a television reporter was in mid-Demi question when Mr. Kutcher jumped off stage and, as reporters chuckled, dashed around the room like Groucho Marx. He never answered the question.
Mr. Kutcher was in town -- along with AMY SMART, his co-star in "The Butterfly Effect," which opens tomorrow -- to announce the AOL Moviegoer nominations. But the camera flashes were so retina-threatening that Ms. Smart declared, "We're not reading these until the flashes stop!"
Mr. Kutcher did answer questions eventually. If I.R.S. agents ever appeared at Mr. Kutcher's door to seize his house and assets, would he weep like JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, as in a memorable episode of MTV's "Punk'd?"
Mr. Kutcher, in full imp, replied, "Ah, I don't know if I'd cry." Pause. "I'd be looking for a gun." with Melena Z. Ryzik and Paula Schwartz

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
That Car Is Only 20. Why Give Up Now?

BYLINE:  By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
THERE is a certain type of car owner who takes pride in driving the latest and greatest model. Upon hearing that the Mercedes Deluxe is being followed by the Mercedes Super Ultra, the hairs on their arms tingle. Al Engelhart is not one of those people. 
 Mr. Engelhart, who lives in Hingham, Mass., belongs to another breed of driver entirely. One that, as a consequence of thrift, sentimentality or perhaps plain old inertia, is wedded to the same aging vehicle for a very long time. We're talking decades. Indeed, Mr. Engelhart still owns the 1983 Volvo 244 GL he bought new 20 years ago and calls Blanche for its ivory color. The body is rusted and the car is drafty in the winter. And, frankly, it smells like gasoline. But, Mr. Engelhart, a chemical engineer, argues that it "still runs like a top." 
 For dedicated old-car owners like him, the routine act of driving can be a highly involved journey. There are frequent mechanical failures, long caucuses with mechanics and salvage yard workers and nickel-and-dime problems -- windows that don't shut, broken gauges -- that drive everyone but the owners crazy. Not to be forgotten are the social indignities: ribbing from friends, pleas from embarrassed relatives. 
"People are always asking me, 'When is your father going to get rid of that car?' " said Karen Hewitt, whose 77-year-old father, James McKeon, still drives his beloved 1984 Cadillac Coupe DeVille. When Ms. Hewitt, who lives in Queens, recently borrowed the car, known as the Cadoo, to take her 6-year-old son to a New York Rangers game, it stalled in a busy intersection. "My son slid down in his seat and begged me to never take the car again," Ms. Hewitt said. 
Many old-car drivers say the decision to hang on to a clunker is one of simple economics: they're saving a bundle on new-car payments. But it's often only a delusion, said Richard Hart, who lives in Durham, N.C., and owns a 1963 Dodge Dart that has seemingly spent as much time in the shop as on the road. "You always tell yourself, 'It's only a couple hundred more bucks,' " Mr. Hart said. "It's like you have amnesia. You think if you get it fixed, it'll be good for another year. Of course, it never is."
A look at Mr. Engelhart's repair records shows just how pricey an old car can be. Told in color-coded, spreadsheet format, the story of Blanche is one of small, routine costs punctuated by eye-popping expenditures, like the $2,400 bill in March 1992 for "Volvo salvage and reconstruction." "My wife slid down a hill on one of those icy days," Mr. Engelhart said. "Totaled the front end." Or the $2,300 he spent in November 1998. "I took it for a paint job and the guy says, 'It's rusted. Your whole frame might split in half.' Blanche had to have a complete floor job. There was an argument in my house over that one." 
While some hold on to old cars to avoid the costs of buying a new model, others, like Mr. McKeon, do so out of sheer devotion. To hear him recall the day, in 1985, that he walked into Potamkin Cadillac in Manhattan and bought the Cadoo is to attend the beginnings of an epic romance. "The salesman told me, 'See that car, Jim? It's the last of the big ones,' " Mr. McKeon said. "The minute I laid eyes on it I fell in love."
Like all passionate affairs, however, his is a bit starry-eyed. In Mr. McKeon's view, the car is "almost like new." If, of course, you overlook the deep scratches on the bumper. And the cracks in the leather upholstery, the duct tape on the taillights and the rust on the wheel wells. Still, at nearly 20 years old, the car has only 87,000 miles on it, and, Mr. McKeon says, people will sometimes leave a note on his window asking if he wants to sell. The answer: an emphatic no. 
Then there are people like Jim Travers, who don't seem to be motivated by either love or money. Mr. Travers, an Internet marketer in Dania Beach, Fla., has three old cars, including a 1992 Chrysler Town & Country minivan that, he noted, is "not a car anyone would keep for sentimental reasons unless they're an idiot." It has been recalled several times, and the air-conditioning works only on high. "You have to be seriously motivated to cool down," he said. The speedometer began following its own scientific principles, adding a one to the miles per hour -- 145 equals 45 -- before quitting entirely and emanating a green glow at night, which, besides being creepy in a Stephen King way, drained the battery.
Why does he still drive the thing? "I guess it's the familiarity," Mr. Travers said. "I can parallel park it with my eyes closed. And I know how it's going to behave in any weather situation. Plus, it's gotten me out of car-pooling at work." No one will ride in it.
NEARLY everyone has held on to a car too long at one time or another. But it takes a distinct personality to consistently go against our car-conscious society and drive what many would call a clunker. Will power is important, to resist the lure of splashy car advertisements, as well as a certain indifference to advancements in design and even a disregard for safety improvements like antilock brakes and traction control. 
Above all, driving an old car requires a good mechanic. "Finding an auto shop near your work is key," said Mr. Hart, an editor at an alternative weekly. "That way being without a car isn't so bad -- you can walk to your job." Mr. Hart's Dodge is in the shop again, awaiting a steering column tube, an obscure part he tracked down from a Dart enthusiast near the Arctic Circle in Sweden.
Mr. Engelhart, meanwhile, has assembled around Blanche a crack team of specialists more commonly associated with million-dollar race cars: a tow-truck operator, a body man, a painstaking mechanic who can eke the most out of an aging engine. Which is a good thing, because two Saturdays ago Al Jr. was on his way to a snowboarding meet when Blanche spun out of control and smashed into a guardrail, doing several hundred dollars' worth of damage. Mr. Engelhart's prognosis? "I think we're going to be able to save the car," he said.
But maybe there comes a time when even the most die-hard owner should just pull the plug. Curtis Burrell, reached at Bobby's Junkyard in Cornelia, Ga., is used to seeing drivers comb the lot for parts for their old pickups. Mr. Burrell can sympathize. "I had a car like that for about five years," he said, "a 1988 Ford Bronco II, and I just couldn't get rid of the damn thing. I was obsessed with it. It kept breaking down."
Finally, he had had enough: "I stuck a sign out on it and sold it. I tell you when the guy drove off, it felt like a thousand-pound weight had been lifted off my shoulders."

HEADLINE: How an Art Scene Became a Youthscape 

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
Imagine that you have opened a Chelsea art gallery. Not a white cube with vaulted ceilings and frosted glass doors, but a showroom in your 200-square-foot studio apartment. Each night, a futon is retrieved from the bathtub and flopped on the floor for sleeping. Come daylight, it is rolled back up and put away in preparation for visitors. How long do you think you would last?
 Daniel Reich spent two years running such a gallery in his Chelsea studio apartment, and he prospered. Several of the artists he worked with are among those selected for the next Whitney Biennial, and in November he moved his gallery from his bedroom to an upscale storefront on West 23rd Street. 
 Mr. Reich, 28, is part of a group of enterprising young dealers who are shaking up a corner of the New York art scene. Roughly the same age (mid-20's to mid-30's), they have come to the fore in the last few years and are committed to showing new work by emerging artists and artist collectives. They have even formed their own collective, the New Art Dealers Alliance, known as NADA. 
Their approach shows signs of succeeding. With a hint of small sister-big sister rivalry, NADA staged its first art fair last month alongside Art Basel Miami Beach, a big, mainstream contemporary art fair. True to form, the NADA fair was organized like a co-op, with each participating gallery paying a set fee ($2,000) and receiving the same size booth. Sales exceeded expectations, the participants said, and have continued beyond the fair. "It used to be the case that you'd hear a young person was starting a gallery and it was considered a kind of odd eruption," Mr. Reich said, standing in his new Chelsea space. "But suddenly an unprecedented number of young people have opened galleries all over the city, making us into a new scene for collectors and writers to follow." 
Mr. Reich is not the only young dealer to have started in an apartment. Oliver Kamm, a former employee of the Marianne Boesky Gallery, set up shop in the living room of his one-bedroom Chelsea apartment in late 2002. "The first month I sold $20,000 worth of art, and sales continued steadily," said Mr. Kamm, 31, who in early 2003 moved to a white-cube gallery on West 22nd Street.
Like Mr. Kamm and Mr. Reich, who cut his teeth at the Pat Hearn Gallery, many of these young dealers worked for more established outfits before going it alone. John Connelly, 35, spent eight years at the Andrea Rosen Gallery before opening his own in mid-2002, a closet-like space on the 10th floor of a building on West 26th Street. "I was excited by a new, younger generation of artists," he said. Three of his artists will be in the Whitney Biennial.
Other young dealers have found the Lower East Side and Brooklyn (where many of the artists they represent live) more congenial. Two years ago Michelle Maccarone, 30, opened a gallery in a dilapidated three-level building on Canal Street, which doubles as her home. "I wanted a space with character, and this place is funky," she said, sipping tea and chain-smoking in her messy makeshift office. Mirabelle Marden (a daughter of the painter Brice Marden) and Melissa Bent at Rivington Arms, Lia Gangitano at the nonprofit space Participant Inc. and Yuki Minami at the Transplant Gallery are nearby.
Aside from youth, what binds these dealers is the precarious economics of their ventures. Few have backers, and many have relied on part-time jobs or family money to subsidize their galleries. At one point Mr. Reich was so broke that his mother had to pay the rent on his apartment-gallery. 
There are also similarities among the artists whom the dealers show: most are young, still in graduate school or fresh out of college. (Galleries looked down on this practice until a few years ago.) Two recent Cooper Union graduates, Nick Mauss and Shelby Hughes, were presented at the inaugural exhibition at Mr. Reich's Chelsea gallery in November; in February Mr. Kamm is to present the New York debut of Kamrooz Aram, 24, a painter who just completed his M.F.A. at Columbia. 
Artists' collectives, a throwback to the 1960's and 70's, are also resurgent. Among today's fashionable ensembles are Dearraindrop, Milhaus and the collaborative art project K48. The art they produce varies widely, although they all tend to mix media to create total environments.
Zach Feuer, 25, a founder and director of LFL Gallery in Chelsea, sees this collectivist and collaborative tendency as characteristic of his generation. "Even when artists work individually, you will often find other artists working together on the same thing, sometimes sharing a studio," he said. 
As for the art, the reigning spirit seems to be coolly detached and style-conscious. With all the talk of youth culture being digital and high-tech, many of the artists shown in the new galleries are obsessed with craft and the physical act of making art. Knitting and sewing are popular, as is a kind of doodle drawing. 
At the same time the works carry little social or political freight. Nobody is protesting anything. And for the first time in a long while young gay artists are doing work that has nothing to do with loss, sorrow or AIDS. Instead they trade in a fluid, playful sexuality, with lots of kinkiness and gender-bending, along with frequent allusions to drugs, sex, pornography and music (especially glam rock). 
The collective mentality also appears to have spread to the dealers. NADA was founded about a year ago by Mr. Feuer, Mr. Connelly and two dealers who work for other galleries, Sheri L. Pasquarella and Zach Miner. The goal was to create a forum for professional and social exchange among younger dealers.
"We sensed that there was another, less adversarial way of doing business that would support and foster a greater sense of community," said Ms. Pasquarella, 27, the director of the Gorney Bravin & Lee gallery. NADA has more than 50 members, most of them under 35 and nearly all in New York.
So far its activities have been largely social, consisting of pizza nights and cocktail parties at the galleries and homes of members. There is even talk of a softball team. (Maybe NADA could play A.D.A.A., the Art Dealers Association of America.) There have also been loans of equipment and artwork among members and some referrals of buyers. In the fall the group arranged guided tours of NADA galleries in Chelsea and Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
The dealers admit to rivalries, but say common interest unifies the group. "We tend to look at our businesses in a different way from another generation of dealers," said Becky Smith, the owner and director of the Bellwether Gallery in Williamsburg. "We don't see the art market as one big pie that we all have to fight over, but as something that is endlessly expandable. If we can make people excited about our galleries and the kind of art and artists we show, then we figure this will benefit us all."
Recalling NADA's first meeting, Mr. Kamm said: "The thing that struck a few of us was that there was a lot less Prada than we thought there'd be. It was just a bunch of scrappy, ambitious young people with a passion for art and a desire to learn more about others doing the same kinds of things." 
But will it last? Ms. Smith, 37, is not sure. "There is no doubt NADA is utopian," she said. "Hopefully it will last. Most likely it will go the way of free love when enough feelings get hurt. But for now it is fun to be together and enjoying each other."
At NADA's art fair in Miami, Ms. Smith said, there was a lot of interest in her artists. "I used to joke that NADA stood for networking and drinking," she said, "but after Miami I've realized it is much more. Three years ago I would sell one print of the work of Sharon Core out of a show. I sold 25 of her photographs in Miami, ranging in price from $2,000 to $4,500. Since coming back, I've sold a couple of prints almost every day. There are even waiting lists for work she hasn't made."
Although still relatively affordable, some of the works shown by the NADA dealers command higher prices because of increasing demand. In his apartment, Mr. Reich sold Tyson Reeder's drawings for $200 each; in an exhibition opening today at Mr. Reich's gallery, the drawings are priced from $1,000, and there is a waiting list. Paul P.'s paintings started around $800 when they were shown in Mr. Reich's apartment; a still life with flowers in a group show that opens today at Andrea Rosen is priced at $3,000.
But NADA's chummy atmosphere is not for everyone. Despite overtures, Ms. Maccarone remains a nonmember. She says she has a different vision and model for her gallery. "I operate more like a kunsthalle, doing four or five in-depth solo exhibitions a year," she said. "I'm also more interested in installation and site-specific work. Basically it's less market driven."
Mr. Reich says that for the younger dealers the art business is less about making money than about expressing the values and experiences of his generation. "It's all about being happy about whatever you can be happy about," he said. "My generation grew up in a time when we didn't have heroes. You grew up believing you were being hoodwinked and manipulated -- and knowing you were, but learning to enjoy it because it came in fun colors or was on MTV.
"The bottom line," he added, "was that I really wanted to have a gallery, and sometimes you just have to start doing something with whatever you have at your disposal."

HEADLINE: Where the Lower East Side Keeps Trendy Masses at Bay 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
LET me say right from the start that I am writing this article with more than a little trepidation. 
 Six months ago, you see, I moved into a new apartment on Grand Street, on the Lower East Side, after spending the better part of the previous decade in the East Village. One of the reasons for the move -- besides marriage, low interest rates and marriage -- was that the East Village, in my none-too-snooty opinion, had become terrifically, horrifically overrun and overexposed. 
 Every block was a party block, packed with trendy bars, trendy restaurants and often untrendy people. Avenue A was a constant pub crawl, Avenue B was a cooler version of Avenue A, and Avenue C was starting to become Avenue B. (Don't even get me started on Avenue D.) 
So it was that I fled south in search of something a little less popular, a little less celebrity-friendly and, most important, a little quieter on weekends. I went looking for the ancient arrival point of immigrants, a district of pickle shops and dumpling stands, a place of tenement houses and warehouse lofts. I went looking for the Lower East Side, and boy, did I find it. 
As always, it is an area in flux. During the 1800's, it was home to hundreds of thousands of Irish, Italian, German and Jewish immigrants fleeing famine, political oppression and economic desolation. Later came waves of Latino and Chinese settlers. They all added their own traditional houses of worship, restaurants and other gathering places. 
Now, as the East Village overflows, the neighborhood is once again flooded by newcomers, though the "immigrants" this time around are less likely to come from abroad than from more expensive, more gentrified areas of the city. Like generations before them, they are bringing the trappings of their own tastes: new bars, cafes, shops, restaurants (and yep, luxury apartments) are peppering the already dense patchwork of ethnic cultures.
The resulting hybrids are fascinating. There are bars like Barrio Chino, an elegant six-month-old cubbyhole on Broome Street, which serves autentico Mexican tapas and 50 varieties of tequila, as well as a roster of designer cocktails (raspberry mojitos and red wine caipirinhas); and new restaurants like Les Enfants Terribles, which opened on Canal Street in October and serves Afro-French cuisine and almost always has a D.J. spinning. 
Tourists drawn to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum -- which celebrates the courage and harsh living conditions of early residents -- take their lunch at bright, tasty cafes like 88 Orchard, and Brown (part of a nifty little stretch of specialty shops on Hester Street). And artists, always looking for a good deal, have come here, too; rock 'n' roll and readings are held in bar basements, while the Mazer Theater, on East Broadway, has a hit musical on its hands, "A Stoop on Orchard Street," which pays homage to this bargain bazaar street's pushcart and poverty-stricken past (and charges $45 a ticket, $25 for children).
And while I don't want to make it seem too hip for fear of encouraging any more of the teeming masses to come down below Delancey Street, I must say that the neighborhood's unique mix of old and new seems far more interesting than those $5 lattes on Avenue B.

Marking Off Territory
First, let's define our terms. Most experts would argue that the Lower East Side begins at Houston Street and includes everything south to the Manhattan Bridge. But the East Village -- like slacker wildfire -- jumped Houston Street years ago, blazing down Ludlow and Orchard Streets, leaving techno bars, velvet-roped lounges and $9 cosmos in its wake. 
In the last five years, that inferno of cool has also torched once-sketchy stretches of Clinton Street (now lined with a half-dozen starry restaurants), Norfolk Street (on the corner of which Keith McNally's Schiller's Liquor Bar now resides), and Attorney Street (the home of Sin-e, the respected music club). So it was that the freewheeling weekend crowds that roam the East Village slowly co-opted the northern parts of the Lower East Side -- from Houston to Delancey Streets -- and turned it into the East Village South.
Those crowds, however, have seemed less eager to cross Delancey Street, a wide red-light-be-damned boulevard that feeds a constant stream of heavy traffic across the Williamsburg Bridge. So for the current survey, the concentration will be on the roads less traveled: those south of Delancey, east of the Bowery, and north of the Manhattan Bridge. Call it the lower Lower East Side, or LoLES for short.

A Glance to the Past
The starting point of any tour is the starting point for many tours: the Tenement Museum, which was established in 1988 and now draws more than 100,000 visitors a year. The museum's ticket office and visitors' center sit at the corner of Broome and Orchard Streets, where the asphalt gives way to brick; the museum itself is at 97 Orchard, as is a small theater. 
The theater is one of several in the neighborhood, a list that includes the Abrons Arts Center (part of the Henry Street Settlement) and the Mazer, both of which can handle large Off Broadway-size crowds. But judging from the number of storefronts opening up -- "For Rent" signs are common -- it seems just a matter of time before more Off Off Broadway companies migrate south.
Ditto for galleries. Broome Street has one -- the Lower East Side Artisan Exchange -- as does Canal, the Michelle Maccarone Gallery. A new art space, Sky High, is due to open soon in a former dress shop at 371 Grand Street.
When the weather is warm (remember that?), the Tenement Museum offers walking tours that stroll past the neighborhood's synagogues, its settlement houses and, of course, the Doughnut Plant, the specialty doughnut shop (including pumpkin, cranberry and, this week, pomegranate) on Grand Street, which has been destroying people's attempts at the Atkins Diet since 2000. Kossar's, the venerable bialy and bagel joint down the block, has been doing the same type of sabotage for decades, minus the frosting.
The walking tours -- which will start up again in April -- also include some spinach with the sugar, with educational stops at Seward Park (home to the first municipal playground in the city), Straus Square, and the Forward building, where the Jewish socialist daily newspaper used to have its offices. In a sign of the times, the building is being converted into high-end apartments.

'Oh, Wow' Moments
While Grand Street is the main drag, with Chinese vegetable and fish shops to the west of Allen Street and pharmacies, banks and shops to the east, the side streets can offer more intriguing avenues of inquiry. Indeed, one of the joys of the neighborhood is its "Oh, wow" effect, the sensation of suddenly finding a new spot in the last place you'd expect. 
Walk along Hester Street, for example, between Allen and Essex, and you'll find a stretch populated by a gorgeous sweet shop (the Sweet Life), a brand new gourmet grocery (Orange), an arty cafe (Brown) and an old-time Jewish bakery (Gertel's). Or stroll on Forsyth Street, just north of Grand, where a casual visitor might suddenly find a new subterranean Italian restaurant (Grotto) with an outdoor garden, a Chinese comic and video game shop (Yang Fai Sports and Trading Corporation), a florist (Love Flowers) and two cafes (Monterone and Whisk Et Al.).
Though the predominant cuisine of the Lower East Side remains Chinese -- with a handful of Vietnamese and Malaysian variations -- Grotto, which opened in October, isn't the only new restaurant to try a different ethnic mix. Les Enfants Terribles, new on Canal and Ludlow Streets, mixes French and West African (the chef is from Ivory Coast), while the older Good World Bar and Grill, around the corner on Orchard, has Scandinavian food, of all things. (You know: herring, Swedish meatballs, more herring.) Both places attract the type of good-looking young crowd that likes to eat with Mary J. Blige or Outkast playing in the background and vodka drinks playing in the foreground. Those with sweeter teeth -- or no ID -- head for Il Laboratorio del Gelato, a tony joint next to the Tenement Museum.

When the Sun Goes Down
There are also still some Jewish delicacies to be found in the neighborhood, though such fare has faded somewhat in recent years, especially after Ratner's, on Delancey Street, closed in 2002. The neighborhood can still claim two pickle shops (the Pickle Guys on Essex and Guss's Pickles on Orchard), a kosher catering business on Essex, as well as a kosher bakery and pizza parlor on Grand between Essex and Norfolk. (It's the same block as the Doughnut Plant and Kossar's Bialys, thereby making it the most diet-destroying stretch of road in the neighborhood.)
Then there's Noam Sokolow, who bucked the trend by opening a new kosher delicatessen, Noah's Ark Original Delicatessen, on Grand Street last summer. The deli, which serves everything from French fries to matzo-ball soup in hefty portions, is actually the second ark; the original opened in 1988 in Teaneck, N.J.
Kasha varnishkas notwithstanding (try saying that five times fast), what seems to be bringing the most newbies into the neighborhood, at least to visit, is what happens after most of the shops close. Since 1999, at least a half-dozen new bars have opened below Delancey, with two -- Barrio Chino and Les Enfants -- dating back to the fall, and one as-yet-unnamed spot said to be coming soon to Essex Street. 
Two of the pioneers in the neighborhood opened in 2001 on Broome Street: Lolita, a two-level rock 'n' roll hangout with exposed brick walls, big art and an occasional reading or rock show in the basement; and Happy Ending, a swanker lounge with dance music and a regular shoulder-to-shoulder crowd that likes to stay up late. A former massage parlor, the bar has two levels, with downstairs generally more crazed than up; in more sedate moments, the bar also offers readings. 
One of the owners of Lolita, Clyde Rennie, 30, said that while some night crawlers are hesitant to cross Delancey, those that do feel rewarded. 
"There's a sense of finding something down here, of discovering a spot," Mr. Rennie said, slinging beer in his bar's basement. "And I think that's part of its appeal."

And Yes, a Velvet Rope
Indeed, true adventurers might also be able to find the mysterious Milk and Honey, a semi-private lounge that also opened several years ago just below Delancey on Eldridge Street. Famed for its handmade cocktails and picky management, the catch with Milk and Honey is that you have to know its address -- and its phone number -- to get in.
The new establishments joined a couple of older joints, including the giant Chinese restaurant and bar, Congee Village (which has -- no kidding -- pretty decent and very cheap cosmopolitans), and 169 Bar, a dressed-up dive on East Broadway that has dressed itself up in recent years with a back garden and very large bouncers.
There was no such thing in front of Barrio Chino last Friday night when I approached with two friends, Zack and Anthony. The brick-walled bar, decorated with Chinese lanterns and those little drink umbrellas, was opened last fall by Dylan Dodd, a soft-spoken young man who makes all kinds of drinks but has a true passion for tequila. Mr. Dodd spent six months in Mexico researching the drink and recently came back with dozens of varieties, going up to $25 a shot. 
Barrio Chino serves its tequila straight, with a chaser of sangrita, a tomato concoction that tastes a little like Bloody Mary mix. My friends and I tried out a few and suddenly it didn't seem so cold outside. 
Which was good, because we walked to the next spot, Les Enfants Terribles. Despite a name that makes it sound like a bad Victor Hugo novel, this new place is already attracting in-the-know crowds; several large parties were there when we arrived, around 11. 
Luckily, we were only concerned with the bar, which serves a variety of rum drinks (the menu spells it "rhum"), including a Jericoacoara ($7), a Brazilian drink that has rum, ginger, lemon and honey. "You like this one?" said Mehdi Mokhnachi, a manager, with a note of mischief in his voice. "Me, too."

Stamina Pays Off
After that drink with the really long J-something name, we moved around the corner to Good World, a former Chinese barber shop that attracts a packed -- and thirsty -- group of patrons during the weekend.
This Friday was no exception; couples necked in the front, girls danced in the back and smokers caught colds out front. It was all too much.
The next stop was 169 Bar, which on this particular evening was featuring a D.J. with a taste for salsa, along with a live percussionist. The bar attracts a varied clientele; a pool table in the back is usually busy, as is a video-game machine in the front. (The bar also has an ATM -- inside.) 
This night, the vibe was slightly retro; a clutch of men were break dancing, while separately, a clutch of women shook their tail feathers. It all felt like an extremely cool prom. 
By the time my compatriots and I stumbled to Lolita, it was almost 1 a.m. and the crossing-Delancey set was out in force. The basement bar was packed, while upstairs two women were D.J.'ing rock 'n' roll and old-school hip-hop. 
The scene was flirty and fun and the bar was popular enough on this night to need a doorman, a bulky fellow named Gerard who was able to spare a moment for commentary. 
"This area is interesting because what gives it its character is the grittiness," he said. "That's what makes people want to come. But the more who come, the less grit and less character. So it's tough."
He paused and added: "I guess I like it just as it is."
And walking back to my new home, so close to the bar, so far from the masses, I couldn't have agreed more.

A year after he faced a broad wave of anti-American sentiment here, the United States attorney general, John Ashcroft, returned to this Alpine village on Wednesday to say that America was winning the war on terrorism and to promote a new campaign to assail global corruption.
 Mr. Ashcroft was the most senior American official to address the annual World Economic Forum as Washington seeks to swing international opinion behind its vision of a transfer of political authority in Iraq. Vice President Dick Cheney is also expected to attend the gathering at the weekend. 
 At his previous appearance last January, just weeks before the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Ashcroft and others, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, confronted business and political leaders whose mood varied from skepticism to hostility toward America's military intentions in the Middle East. Mr. Ashcroft also faced wide criticism of the harsh measures he had taken to combat terrorism.
"I didn't come back to Davos because I haven't been able to find any hostility in Washington, D.C.," Mr. Ashcroft joked at a lunch gathering, apparently referring to questioning in the United States about the extent to which civil liberties have been subjugated to security measures taken in the name of pre-empting new terror attacks.
At this year's meeting, the mood is more muted and diffuse, focusing on an array of economic and business uncertainties. But there were some important leaders who challenged the results of America's war on terrorism and its campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan, told a conference session that the war in Iraq "complicated the already tense situation in which the world found itself" with many Muslims resenting the way their cause was being depicted and feeling a "deep sense of injustice and powerlessness."
"The world became a very dangerous place to live," he said.
Mr. Ashcroft had a more positive message.
"We are winning the war against terrorism," he said, insisting that despite criticism of his record, Washington was respecting the civil rights "at the highest level possible."
He was referring specifically to questioners who challenged the Bush administration's decision to detain people as "enemy combatants" with no access to lawyers or legal support.
But Mr. Ashcroft alluded to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to say that America was at war, giving Washington the right to seize its foes.
Mr. Ashcroft said that in the past the United States had called on nations to fight terrorism. Now, he said, it would call on them to fight corruption in government.
He called governmental corruption a "contagion that cannot be contained by borders" and urged strong international cooperation to combat it through political leadership and a readiness by governments to inform people honestly about its actions.
"Information is the enemy of corruption," he said. "Corruption cannot flourish in the light of day."

HEADLINE: Agency Asks Zimbabwe to Release Stored Food 

BYLINE:  By SHARON LaFRANIERE

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
United Nations officials asked Zimbabwe within the past week to release some of the government's stockpile of 236,000 tons of corn, after a month in which three million malnourished people were forced to subsist on half rations from program. 
 The stockpile was reported in the government-controlled daily newspaper, The Herald, on Dec. 30. 
 In interviews this week, program officials said that releasing the corn would reduce prices and relieve the need for donated food as Zimbabwe approaches its leanest agricultural months, February, March and April. 
An inflation rate of 600 percent has put corn, a staple of the nation's diet, out of reach for many Zimbabweans. More than 7 million of Zimbabwe's 12 million-plus citizens are short of food, according to a study prepared this month by United Nations organizations. 
Publicly, aid officials offered no explanation of the Zimbabwean government's decision to stockpile food in a time of shortages. But President Robert G. Mugabe has long been accused of using food as a weapon of political control, drawing on government stocks to maintain political backing for his party. 
In November, Human Rights Watch, an international human rights group based in New York, accused Mr. Mugabe of denying subsidizedgovernment food to people who are not listed as party supporters. Mr. Mugabe has said his government distributes food fairly to those in need. On Thursday, an aide to Mr. Mugabe refused to explain why the government has not dipped into its silos of corn, saying the question was not posed for "patriotic purposes." 
Since 2001, the government has had a monopoly on the trading of corn and wheat -- a system that, according to the new study, has helped create huge shortages. The black market is now the main source of food, the study found. 
The World Food Program, an agency of the United Nations, has distributed nearly half a million tons of food in the past two years. But in December, lack of donations forced the program to cut rations in half. 
Since then, the European Union has donated $35 million for food and the United States has provided $12 million worth of sorghum.

HEADLINE: Crowded Skies Are Here Again 

 BODY:
Here's a bit of welcome bad news: airport congestion is making headlines again. Delays at O'Hare airport in Chicago have become so serious that the Federal Aviation Administration has pressed United and American to reduce by 5 percent the number of flights they schedule at peak hours. 
 The fact that the nation's aviation system is overwhelmed at crucial choke points is a source of tremendous frustration to travelers, and it poses safety challenges to a strained air traffic control system. Reducing flights is a short-term but ultimately unsatisfactory fix. Increased capacity (more runways, for starters), instead of arbitrary caps on flights, is the real solution. 
 On the bright side, however, the bad news about congestion means that the airline business has bounced back from its post-9/11 doldrums. Before the attack, airports were so overloaded that restrictions were imposed on new flights out of La Guardia in New York, and travelers were in a constant state of frustration. Then came 9/11, and with it far weightier concerns. Terrorism fears and a slowing economy forced struggling airlines to shrink their schedules drastically and, just like that, flights became eerily on time. 
The industry's revival mirrors the overall economy and a general sense that life cannot be put on hold until Tom Ridge gives us an all-clear green signal. December was the first month that passenger demand was back at the levels before September 2001. And though it has not yet returned to profitability, American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, has seen its stock price rise by 1,000 percent since it flirted with bankruptcy early last year.
The major carriers have all reduced costs and are smaller than they were before the attack. More nimble discount airlines, like JetBlue and AirTran, which are offering increasingly good products and reintroducing a bit of whimsy to the skies, account for much of the system's new capacity. As a result, passengers enjoy more choices and lower fares.
In the long term, demand for air travel should continue to grow. Airport operators and aviation officials who believed that they could put off capital projects aimed at expanding capacity must now readjust their thinking.

HEADLINE: Along Public Trail, a Church Recounts Its History 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: ALCOVA, Wyo. 

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of people come here each year to a granite-walled nook in the hills just off the old pioneer trail to hear the tale of the lost Martin Handcart Company of 1856 and how a party of poor Mormon converts faced down death in a howling blizzard.
 The place, called Martin's Cove -- an uninhabited hollow of sand and sage surrounded by sheer cliffs that block the wind -- sits on federal land 50 miles southwest of Casper, part of the vast Western domain of the Bureau of Land Management. But the story is not told by bureau employees. Missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, dispatched on six-month assignments and brimming with faith, are the trail and museum guides. 
 Now that unusual relationship -- a publicly owned historic site interpreted by a private and very interested party -- has been locked into law. A brief provision tucked into an energy appropriations bill signed by President Bush in December authorizes a 25-year lease agreement between the church and the government, with all but automatic renewals after that. 
What that means is that the Mormon Church will, in a very real way, own the Martin's Cove story, probably in perpetuity. All visitors must cross private land purchased by the church in the 1990's, and the legislation allows church authorities to decide, in consultation with the bureau, who may be denied admission for, say, improper deportment. On each side of the fence marking the public-private line, missionaries are happy to answer questions of history or Scripture.
The arrangement and the controversy that simmers around it in Wyoming lays bare an American frontier between religious and secular life that is as raw today, in everything from school prayer to town-hall Christmas creches, as it was when the Mormons first made their way to Utah in the 1840's.
Some local residents and advocates for strict separation of church and state say they fear that history is being privatized, that spiritual lessons will supersede facts or that a religious interpretation will distill the complexity of Western history into an overly simplified fable.
"It's historical revisionism -- they're using a particular place to enshrine these deaths, but in the history of the western movement, thousands of people died, so it's very difficult to claim this particular spot as sacred ground," said Barbara Dobos, a resident of Casper and public-lands advocate who has led the opposition to the church's efforts.
Other people who have followed the issue say that historians have often missed the psychological complexities of the pioneer experience, and that perhaps only through the lens of faith can a place like Martin's Cove really be understood. In a state where land battles usually involve the economics of energy or ranching, religious motivation is a curveball.
"Some people are quite stirred up, and I suspect it's going to remain that way," said Tom Rea, a former newspaper reporter who is writing a book about the country west of Casper, including Martin's Cove. 
"The Mormons came in with a whole other reason to own land -- not for resource exploitation, but for storytelling," Mr. Rea added. "That puts this in a different category than anything I can think of."
At the center of it all is the humble handcart: a wheelbarrow, essentially, that was pulled by converts who had no money for oxen. Only about 5,000 of the 70,000 Mormon pioneers ever used handcarts, mostly between 1856 and 1858. 
Now the handcart has become one of the paramount symbols of Mormonism, with cart-pulling ceremonies and festivals held everywhere from Russia to Florida. And the church has used its economic muscle to preserve the landmarks of the pioneer experience. More than 16,000 acres of Wyoming ranch land along the trail were purchased in the 1990's in the name of preservation.
Even the missionaries concede that balancing God and man at Martin's Cove can be dicey. After the visitors center opened in 1997, on land owned by the church, Wyoming public school students began showing up for tours as part of their state history classes. About 10 percent of Wyoming residents are Mormon. 
"When the kids come, we put the literature aside," said P. Bryce Christensen, director of Mormon Handcart Historic Sites in Wyoming, which includes Martin's Cove. "We don't want anybody going back home and saying, 'Guess what, Mom, we got a Book of Mormon on our field trip.' "
On the other hand, Mr. Christensen said, no missionary will ever shrink from answering questions. At least six non-Mormon tourists have been baptized into the faith after visiting the cove, he said, though he only hears about the ones who contact him.
"We're very, very careful," Mr. Christensen said. "This is not a proselytizing mission, but if people have questions, we're very interested in helping."
What happened at Martin's Cove, named for the group's leader, Edward Martin, was unquestionably harrowing. The 600 converts were poorly equipped with handcarts made of green wood that split in the desert air. And the company of travelers was fatally late, reaching what became Wyoming as the first snows fell, in October 1856, three months later than trail wisdom dictated. About one in four died from starvation and exposure.
One survivor later wrote in anguish about her prized possession: a fine pair of scissors she had carried from England. As hardship deepened into disaster, she used the scissors to amputate the frostbitten fingers and toes of her children. The cove became a place of death, the bodies left in the snow for wolves. The company was finally saved by a rescue party from Salt Lake City.
But the facts are easy. Here, everything is nuance. Inside the cove on the government monuments that were installed years ago, and in a museum display in Casper, where the Bureau of Land Management operates the National Historic Trails Interpretive Center, God is conspicuously absent and the tone is grim. The pioneers were late, the displays say. They struggled and died. What drove them or what made them believe that flimsy handcarts could overcome Western terrain and fall weather is not addressed.
"When we put something on a sign or a brochure or document, we write it for everyone," said Jude Carino, an archaeologist and director of the trails center. "What we don't necessarily always do is put it through the filter of the believer."
The missionaries have no such qualms. At the visitors center, journals are displayed with entries about angels helping push the handcarts through the snow. And though the fateful decision to start too late is mentioned, the message throughout, as the missionaries admit, is the transcending power of belief.
Whether the church has found the right Martin's Cove at all -- some researchers favor a place half a mile west -- is an open question. Some critics say that with that kind of uncertainty, celebrating this cove over others is historically untenable. 
The church's chief historian, Richard E. Turley Jr., said in a telephone interview from the church's headquarters in Salt Lake City that though there is debate about the location, most of the evidence points to the current site. He added that the legislation for the 940-acre lease includes the alternative cove.
Ms. Dobos, the public lands advocate, says the questions are likely to come up again in the next few months when public hearings are held to assess the environmental impact of a long-term lease on the property. Officials at the Bureau of Land Management say the environmental review and other terms of the lease, which was pushed by the Utah Congressional delegation with some allies in Wyoming, were spelled out specifically by Congress.
Some historians, meanwhile, say the Mormons should be commended. Handcart pioneers were driven by different motivations than were gold seekers or cattlemen or Oregon-bound farmers, they say, and telling the story of Martin's Cove as a religious fable is perhaps truer to the actual event.
"Their inner worlds were different," said Patricia N. Limerick, a history professor and chairwoman of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado at Boulder. "I think in our efforts to strictly avoid an advocacy of religion, we silence a whole point of view in human life."
Ron Strand, a neighbor, is also pleased with how things are turning out and with the jolt to the economy that 60,000 annual visitors can provide. He is building an eight-unit motel behind Alcova's general store, which he runs with his wife, Yolanda. Since the visitors center does not sell souvenirs, the Strands have been happy to oblige, offering souvenirs like pioneer bonnets and earrings in the shape of handcart wheels.
"I've lived all my life here, and I'd never heard of Martin's Cove until the Mormons came," Mr. Strand said. "But I'm happy to have them."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Show Unexpected Drop; Indicators Index Up 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
A surprise dip in new claims for jobless benefits and a gain in a closely watched gauge of economic activity herald stronger job growth in the months ahead, economists said on Thursday.
 The number of Americans applying for state unemployment insurance declined 1,000 last week, to 341,000, the Labor Department said in a better-than-expected report on the job market. 
 The drop in first-time claims was the second consecutive decline and defied Wall Street forecasts for a rise to 347,000, bolstering speculation that employment will advance strongly in January after minimal growth last month. 
 "We have been looking for a continuous improvement in the labor market and this is certainly a step in the right direction," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
 The Labor Department reported a gain of just 1,000 jobs in December, despite a fall in the unemployment rate to 5.7 percent. The scant increase shocked markets and stymied economists who expected that the job market would have shown more improvement this far into a broad economic recovery.
 More than 2.8 million jobs have been lost since President Bush took office in January 2001.
 The Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators notched a ninth straight monthly gain in December. The 0.2 percent rise in the index, which foreshadows economic activity in the next three to six months, matched Wall Street expectations.
 "All indicators point to continued economic growth," Ken Goldstein, the Conference Board economist, said in a statement. "More job gains than in November and December are in store for the early months of 2004."
 Mr. Goldstein said consumer spending, which drove much of the recovery from the 2001 recession, remained relatively strong, while a robust recovery in business investment in equipment and software was on track.
 The leading index has increased at a 4.7 percent annual rate from its most recent low in March, consistent with economic growth in the second half of 2003.
 Mr. Goldstein said the index's continued rise signaled that strong economic growth -- in the 5 percent to 6 percent annual rate range -- should persist in the near term.

HEADLINE: Gruner & Jahr Fires Chief of U.S. Unit, Confirming Reports 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
After days of speculation that he was about to be fired, Daniel B. Brewster Jr., president and chief executive of Gruner & Jahr USA Publishing, was told yesterday that he was out of a job. The news came from the man who will succeed him temporarily, Axel Ganz, the president of the publisher's international division.
 Gruner & Jahr, which publishes Family Circle, Parents, YM and other magazines, said the search for a permanent successor was under way. Mr. Ganz, who lives in Paris, will need to work hard to make sense of a company that has had a year of bad headlines and unimpressive financial performance. 
 The very public stumble has left some wondering whether Gruner & Jahr, which is majority owned by Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate, might quit the United States market. It sold its British holdings in 2000. But Mr. Ganz said the company would continue to operate in the United States.
 "We are committed to this market and this company here," Mr. Ganz said. "We want to go forward and develop our business." 
 He said the company still planned to create a weekly celebrity magazine called Gala, but he would not commit himself to timing. He said he first needed to stabilize the situation and find a new chief executive.
 Mr. Brewster, 48, was hired in 2000 to build Gruner & Jahr from its middling size and reputation into the top ranks of the magazine business. He predicted then that Gruner & Jahr would double revenue in five years. 
 But several efforts to increase its size have not worked as planned. The company spent $360 million to buy Fast Company, a decision predicated in part on the growth of the digital economy, but the subsequent implosion in the technology sector wiped out most, if not all, of the magazine's profits. 
 Mr. Brewster's decision to try to revive McCall's, then one of the so-called Seven Sisters women's magazines, by hitching it to the name and image of Rosie O'Donnell, then a television talk show host, also failed when the partnership ended in acrimony and a bitterly fought trial. During the trial, it was disclosed that the company had manipulated circulation figures to keep advertisers from learning that Rosie magazine was having trouble retaining readers.

Microsoft's Revenue for Quarter Gains as Profit Declines

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Buoyed by the unexpected double-digit growth in PC sales and an increase in business-customer revenue, the Microsoft Corporation reported on Thursday that its fiscal second-quarter results substantially surpassed financial analysts' expectations as revenue exceeded $10 billion for the first time.
 While sales were unusually strong, Microsoft's profit declined in the quarter because of a significant charge for stock-based compensation for employees. Moreover, the company faced tough questioning from analysts who have become increasingly uneasy about the way the company sells its software to corporate customers and the long-term effects of that strategy. 
 For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 14 cents a share, down from $1.87 billion, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. But profits for the three-month period included an after-tax charge of $2.17 billion, or 20 cents a share, in expenses related to the stock-based compensation. 
 Without the charge, the company would have posted a profit of 34 cents a share. On that basis, analysts polled by Thomson First Call had expected a profit of 30 cents a share.
 Revenue was $10.15 billion, up 19 percent from revenue of $8.54 billion in the period a year earlier.
 "They beat my estimates and they beat the Street," said Sanjiv G. Hingorani, a financial analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.
 The company reported its results after the close of the market, where Microsoft shares closed down 29 cents, to $28.01. In after-hours trading, they fell as low as $27.29.
 The company's greatest strength for the quarter came from its core businesses, its Windows XP operating system for desktop computers and servers and its Office suite of application programs for personal computers.
 "The biggest story is our big three businesses," said John Connors, the company's chief financial officer. "Each one was up over 20 percent."
 He acknowledged that the company had joined Wall Street analysts in underestimating the growth of PC demand for the quarter worldwide. PC sales, the foundation of Microsoft's business, were strongest in the United States and Europe and weaker in Japan and Latin America, he said.
 Over all, Mr. Connors said that the company expected strong growth in consumer spending to continue globally, but he warned that corporate "cost containment" efforts that focused on information technology spending could limit Microsoft's future growth. He also warned that the growing popularity of the Linux operating system and other noncommercial products would continue to be a threat.
 While analysts were generally impressed by the near-term revenue growth, the company's difficulties in explaining clearly what is happening in its business sales drew intense scrutiny from financial analysts.
 Over the last year, Microsoft has been struggling to move its business customers from a traditional software-licensing business model to a subscription-oriented one. 
 Many analysts have noted that customer resistance to the transition is one of the main obstacles facing Microsoft in its corporate business, as well as an opportunity for competitors. During a conference call with analysts on Thursday after Microsoft reported its results, many questions focused on the shift.
 Microsoft accounts for the multiyear deals by recognizing the revenue over the course of the contract. The portion that is booked but not yet recognized is called unearned revenue. For the quarter, the company's unearned revenue continued to decline -- by $395 million, after sliding $770 million last quarter -- raising new concerns about its success in shifting customers to subscription-based purchases of software. 
Last quarter Microsoft told financial analysts that the number declined largely because computer security concerns led to delays of purchases by corporate customers. This quarter, however, the company played down security concerns, and that led to an intensification of the discussion of the reason for the decline in unearned revenues.
 "The Street is hypervigilant in focusing on this number," said Rick G. Sherlund, a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs & Company.
He said the decline in unearned revenue was an indication that Microsoft was having trouble persuading customers to shift to its Software Assurance, or maintenance, programs. At the same time, he noted that the company's overall business was probably strong enough to offset any disappointment in its business sector.
 Revenue grew 66 percent in the mobile products business, where Microsoft introduced two hand-held phones during the quarter. However, in its home and entertainment products business, revenue was down for the quarter largely because Microsoft did not have a hit software title for its Xbox video game console during the Christmas quarter. Microsoft said that it was still on track to reach its goal of having an installed base of 16 million Xbox players by the end of its fiscal year and one million subscribers to the Xbox Live online service.
 The company also said revenue in its MSN business was $292 million, an increase of 47 percent. Its subscription revenue was down 2 percent and subscribers to the MSN service remained flat, at eight million. Microsoft said recently that it is shifting the focus of its online business toward portal-style competition with Yahoo and search engine revenue in competition with Google.
 For the quarter ending in March, the company predicted revenue of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion and earnings per share of 23 to 24 cents. For the full year, the company increased its revenue prediction to $35.6 billion to $35.9 billion and said earnings per share, including stock-based compensation expenses of 35 cents, would be 82 to 83 cents.

HEADLINE: Ford Reports 2003 Profit But Posts LossIn 4th Quarter 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Led by its financial unit, the Ford Motor Company reported a slim profit for 2003 on Thursday, after losing more than $6 billion over the previous two years.
 But in the fourth quarter, Ford said, its loss grew from the quarter a year earlier, largely because of a $1.6 billion charge taken primarily to cover health care and other benefits for 20,000 Ford production workers who remain at its former subsidiary, the parts maker Visteon. 
 Executives forecast operating earnings of 40 cents to 45 cents a share this quarter, at best flat compared with the results a year earlier. The company has already forecast modestly higher operating earnings for 2004, excluding one-time charges -- in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 a share, up from $1.14 a share in 2003. 
 Both Ford and General Motors, which reported its earnings on Tuesday, continue to make money from lending to car and truck buyers and from other financial operations. They, along with Chrysler, are struggling to make money in their principal business -- manufacturing cars and trucks -- because of a continuing price war. The three big automakers are offering buyers discounted financing, rebates and other incentives that are cutting into profit margins yet failing to stem the loss of market share to foreign producers. 
 Weak profits in North America mean, among other things, that slim annual bonus checks will be paid to production workers in March. Ford will pay its 95,000 hourly workers in the United States $195 on average, slightly above the $160 bonus paid last year and the $170 that G.M. will pay to its 125,000 workers this year. 
 In the late 1990's, much healthier times for Ford, annual bonus checks averaged several thousand dollars, providing an economic boost in the Midwest and other areas with Ford plants. 
 For 2003, Ford reported net earnings of $495 million, or 27 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $980 million, or 55 cents a share, in 2002. 
 After losing $5.45 billion in 2001, the company replaced its chief executive with the chairman, William Clay Ford Jr.. Mr. Ford, great-grandson of the founder, Henry Ford, quickly embarked on a turnaround plan. 
 "We have dramatically improved our profitability, beaten Wall Street's expectations for eight consecutive quarters and moved closer to achieving our mid-decade goals," Mr. Ford said in a statement Thursday. 
 John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said in a research note, "We continue to believe that Ford is in a tough spot between G.M. and the Japanese, limiting earnings growth potential, but it is undeniable that the company's execution is improving."
 The company, which also produces Lincoln and Mercury vehicles as well as European lines like Volvo and Jaguar, said it hoped to shore up its automotive profitability this year with a wave of new products, including passenger cars aimed at winning back customers from Toyota and Honda. 
 Last year, Ford lost nearly $2 billion in its automotive operations, including special charges but before taxes, compared with a loss of almost $1.2 billion in 2002. Excluding special charges, pretax automotive operations swung from a loss to a slim profit.
 But the tally of special charges more than doubled, to nearly $2.1 billion from $900 million. Much of that resulted from the charge related to Visteon, which Ford spun off in 1999 but which employs 20,000 union workers who are still on Ford's payroll. The charge was largely related to health care costs, a rising expense for domestic manufacturers and one that Mr. Ford has called a big challenge for Detroit. 
 Another charge, of $513 million, was taken during the year to cover restructuring in the company's struggling European operations, which lost more than $1 billion last year before taxes. 
 For the fourth quarter, Ford reported a net loss of $793 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $130 million, or 7 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2002. 
 Excluding special charges, it earned 31 cents a share from continuing operations, 3 cents more than the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. 
 Revenue in the quarter was $46 billion, up from $41.5 billion in the 2002 quarter.

HEADLINE: Kodak to Reduce Its Work Force by Up to15,000 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
The digital revolution dealt Kodak workers a painful blow on Thursday. Facing a sharp drop in demand for conventional film, the Eastman Kodak Company said it was speeding its transition to digital imaging while cutting costs in its film business by eliminating up to 15,000 jobs worldwide, more than a fifth of its work force.
 The job cuts will come over three years, and the company said it would take charges of up to $1.7 billion against its earnings in that period. Worldwide sales of consumer film, one-use cameras and advanced film stock fell 11 percent in dollar terms, and 15 percent in volume, in the fourth quarter from the period a year earlier, the company said. 
 In the United States, the shift to digital cameras was even more pronounced. Fourth-quarter consumer film sales fell 20 percent in dollars and 23 percent in volume. Daniel A. Carp, Kodak's chairman and chief executive, told analysts at a meeting in New York that the company intended to cut fixed costs in its conventional film business faster than the volume declined.
 Kodak expects the changes to save $800 million to $1 billion a year by 2007. Last year digital sales totaled $4 billion, 30 percent of Kodak's revenues. Mr. Carp said digital revenue would rise to 60 percent of sales and half of profits by 2006.
 Wall Street was encouraged. Kodak's stock jumped as much as $4 a share before closing at $30.95, up $3.49, in New York Stock Exchange trading. Over all, Kodak's digital businesses -- including medical and scientific imaging -- are profitable, a Kodak spokesman, Gerard Meuchner, said. He declined to specify which digital units might not be profitable, but said the company was confident that each would become so, as investments in them generate more sales and efficiencies.
 Kodak reported that its fourth-quarter profit fell 83 percent, to $19 million, or 7 cents a share, from $113 million, or 39 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Kodak earned $199 million, or 70 cents a share, in the latest quarter.
 Sales rose 10 percent in the fourth quarter, to $3.78 billion, from $3.44 billion a year earlier, as increasing sales of digital products more than made up for the decline in traditional film.
 In September, Kodak announced that it was ending investments in its traditional film business, and in December it cut its dividend to 50 cents a year from $1.80; both moves were aimed at freeing money to invest in consumer, professional, medical and scientific digital imaging.
 Kodak became a household name 104 years ago after it introduced the Brownie, a dollar camera so simple that children could use it. But the company was slow to recognize the popularity of digital cameras, losing ground to Canon, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and others before moving aggressively into digital imaging.
 Its Easy Share digital cameras were the top-selling consumer cameras of any type in the United States over the holidays, Mr. Meuchner said. The company said it would soon introduce six new models, including several high-end, high-profit cameras aimed at professionals. Kodak no longer makes film cameras.
 Kodak pointed to its ofoto.com unit as an example of its new success. The service enables customers to send digital images over the Internet and get back conventional prints in the mail. Kodak recently expanded ofoto.com to Europe.
 For decades Kodak had a virtual monopoly on color film, which generated huge profits. But as competitors emerged, including Agfa in Europe and Fuji in Japan, Kodak's profit margins eroded, and for two decades it has been shrinking its work force and moving jobs overseas.
 Kodak invested billions of dollars in other industries, including a drug company -- in the hope that somewhere in Kodak's stores of patented chemicals and processes it might have hidden pharmaceutical assets that could earn profit margins comparable to those of the color film business.
 Mr. Carp said the company would concentrate on acquisitions that would fit neatly into its business plan, rather than on exotic ideas with potential profits. That comment appeared aimed at fending off the interest in Kodak shown recently by Carl C. Icahn, the Wall Street investor.
 Kodak said one sign of its focus on investing in profitable existing businesses that fit into its plans was a $35 million tender offer announced on Thursday for the remaining publicly held shares of Chinon Industries, a Japanese digital camera supplier.
 Since 1998 Kodak has cut about 22,000 jobs. It now employs about 64,000 worldwide, 30 percent of them in Rochester, where an equal share of jobs will be cut, Mr. Carp said. The company was long known as the Great Yellow Father in its hometown because of its support of cultural, social, artistic and civic organizations, but as the company's profits have shrunk, so has its role in the community. 
 Past job cuts have not damaged the economy in western New York State, but the new cuts may have a greater impact. Most older workers eligible for early retirement or large settlements are gone, and in recent years the company has begun laying off people in their 30's whose only job has been with Kodak, said Kent D. Gardner, director of the Gleason Center for State Policy in Rochester.
 Over three years, the cuts will eliminate about 4,500 jobs -- close to 1 percent of the 528,000 jobs in the Rochester market, the largest in western New York, Mr. Gardner said. It is unclear, he said, whether these younger workers will take advantage of Kodak's retraining benefits or will move on.

HEADLINE: Too Much Regulation? Corporate Bosses Sing the Sarbanes-Oxley Blues 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
"THEY'VE gone too far," the chief executive of a large American company complained. "Our audit bill is going to double."
 Two years after Enron collapsed, complaints of overregulation are beginning to be heard. "Corporate America is spending an awful lot of money on internal controls that are not benefiting shareholders," said that chief executive, after getting assurances his identity would be protected. 
 A survey of global chief executives released by PricewaterhouseCoopers at the World Economic Forum found that 59 percent viewed overregulation as a significant risk or, worse, one of the biggest threats to the growth of their companies -- far more than viewed global terrorism or currency fluctuations as posing major risks.
 What has alarmed many is Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires chief executives and chief financial officers to certify the adequacy of their internal controls. Then outside auditors must attest to that opinion.
 That provision is not in effect yet, but many companies are going through 404 audits this year to get ready. The idea is to find problems while there is still time to fix them without getting a bad audit report. 
 And it is working. In recent years, said Dennis M. Nally, the United States chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers, "internal controls were a passing thought" to many auditors. Now, "the opportunity on 404 is for companies to look at controls and systems and see if there is a more efficient, effective way." 
 That is especially true at companies that have made a series of acquisitions. Standardizing controls was seldom a priority. In some of the audits now being done, companies are learning that their controls do not mesh, just as their computer systems sometimes did not.
 "We are finding things that need to be changed," said William G. Parrett, the United States chief executive of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. But he said it was too early to know if the benefits would justify the costs.
 Even the chief executive who was so angry over rising costs conceded that his auditors had found issues in the company's treasury operations that needed fixing.
 Additional spending on controls may be wasteful for some companies, but improving controls could be critical for others. Good controls can create environments in which it is much harder for crooked bosses to make the changes in financial records needed to create phony profits and in which honest bosses can be confident that the numbers they are being given are accurate.
 The new audit report on controls could also provide a useful change to the pass-fail audit system of the past, when auditors never commented on the quality of a company's accounting, just on whether it met minimal requirements of complying with the rules. That is still true for the main audit: auditors are supposed to discuss quality issues with audit committees, but not tell the public.
 But the attestation of controls could take a different path. No company's controls are perfect, and it would be good if auditors were able to comment on shortcomings without infuriating companies - or panicking investors over relatively minor issues.
 Some chief executives are not worried. "For big, established companies that already do the right thing, it's no big thing," said Michael S. Dell of Dell Computer. 
 But he also passed along a song being circulated on the Internet about a supposed chief executive who has nightmares about being led away in handcuffs.
 "I really miss the good old days, when I told my board what to do," he sings. "Now my audit committee is slapping me silly. Got the Sarbanes-Oxley blues."

PENNEY TO CLOSE TELEMARKETING CENTER AND CUT 475 JOBS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 J.C. Penney plans to close a telemarketing center in Austin, Tex., cutting 475 jobs, and take over management of six warehouses to reduce costs. 
The moves will reduce fourth-quarter profit by about 4 cents a share, Penney said. The company, based in Plano, Tex., still expects net income to rise to 80 cents a share, including the costs, a spokesman said. Penney will have nine call centers after closing the Austin location in the second quarter. It operates seven warehouses itself in addition to the six that were managed by outside contractors. The changes, which may include additional job cuts resulting from centralized purchasing and distribution, are expected to save Penney about $100 million a year.

And So's Your Old Man: Needling the Bush Legacy

BYLINE:  By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
AMERICAN DYNASTY
Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush
By Kevin Phillips
397 pages. Viking. $25.95.
 In "American Dynasty," his furious jeremiad against the Bush family, Kevin Phillips does not explicate the many differences between President George W. Bush and his father, or their very different brands of foreign policy. Instead he delivers a high-decibel, high-dudgeon rant against what he sees as their dynastic ambitions and their shared biases and motives. 
 "Dynasties," he declares at the start of this book, "tend to show continuities of policy and interest-group bias -- in the case of the Bushes, favoritism toward the energy sector, defense industries, the Pentagon and the C.I.A., as well as insistence on tax breaks for the investor class and upper-income groups."
Mr. Phillips worked in the Nixon administration and made his name back in 1969 with "The Emerging Republican Majority," a book that predicted the ascendancy of the G.O.P. In recent years, however, he has become a populist social critic, increasingly focused on the gap between the rich and poor, and to his mind the Bush family embodies the worst sort of elitism. In these pages he accuses family members of Machiavellian deception and "blatant business cronyism" with ties to big corporations, big oil and the military-industrial complex. 
"After four generations of connection to foreign intrigue and the intelligence community, plus three generations of immersion in the culture of secrecy (dating back to the Yale years of several men in the family)," he writes, "deceit and disinformation have become Bush political hallmarks. The Middle Eastern financial ties of both Bush presidents exemplify this lack of candor, as do the origins and machinations of both Bush wars with Iraq."
A compilation of all manner of charges against Bush family members, "American Dynasty" is a huge mixed salad of a book. It tosses thoughtful meditations on the blowback effect of America's involvement in the Middle East and disquieting analyses of the two Bush administrations' ties to Enron and Halliburton, together with meandering discussions about the Ivy League-old-boy-network and shrill denunciations of the role that Texas machismo has supposedly played in three American wars (Lyndon B. Johnson's escalation of the Vietnam War and the two Bush administration wars against Saddam Hussein). 
There are biting riffs indebted to the work of other writers like Molly Ivins, Michael Lind, Chalmers Johnson and Seymour M. Hersh; strained efforts to connect a wide array of scandals and possible scandals (from family links to firms with investments in Nazi Germany to the Iran Contra affair); and large heapings of conspiratorial conjecture that undermine the more persuasive arguments in this volume.
As he's done in earlier books, Mr. Phillips tries to coin a lot of historical analogies. In his 2002 book, "Wealth and Democracy," he drew comparisons between America and imperial powers like Britain, Holland and Hapsburg Spain, warning of symptoms that can eventually afflict great capitalist powers. In these pages he draws comparisons between George W. Bush's recapture of the White House eight years after his father's defeat by Bill Clinton, and the English Stuart and French Bourbon restorations. For Mr. Phillips the Bush "restoration" is an alarming development, contrary to the American political tradition.
He argues that restorations usually follow "some national trauma," and that restored rulers usually display "many of the same biases and tendencies that had undone the deposed kings." In the case of the Bushes he provides a laundry list of qualities he sees as shared traits: from an adolescent sense of humor and penchant for mangled syntax, to what he calls an "economic worldview" predicated upon an "open favoritism to the rich."
As for the two wars against Iraq, he contends that both Bush administrations demonstrated a "lack of presidential clarity and candor about the purpose for which the war was being fought," including a drive to control the region's oil, "even if the motivation was less about short-term U.S. oil supplies and more about future geopolitical power." 
Mr. Phillips is eloquent on the continuing fallout of American decisions, beginning in the 70's, to pour huge amounts of armaments into the tinderbox of the Persian Gulf and Middle East, into countries "menaced by religious and resource conflicts." He also raises disturbing conflict-of-interest questions about the Bush family's intertwining political and business relationships around the world, relationships embodied by Bush Senior's post-presidential affiliation with the Carlyle Group, a merchant bank with military-sector investments.
The narrative of "American Dynasty," however, is so discursive, its ambitions so amorphous, that the book all too often devolves into a simple litany of accusations against the Bushes, some grounded in careful research, others based on little more than innuendo and speculation.
Intent on underscoring similarities between Bush the elder and Bush the younger, Mr. Phillips tends to skate over their considerable differences: most notably, the current president's tilt toward a unilateralist, moralistic and pre-emptive foreign policy and his father's inclination toward a more internationalist realpolitik.
Mr. Phillips prattles on repetitiously about the role that Skull and Bones, a Yale secret society, might have played in shaping a Bush predilection for secrecy. And he peppers his text with labored analogies, going so far as to suggest that if Hillary Rodham Clinton is elected president in 2008, "public perception might well lurch toward some American equivalent of the 15th-century Wars of the Roses, during which the English Crown was contested by the houses of York and Lancaster."
Such hyperbole, like Mr. Phillips's suggestion that "one could plausibly argue that the pull on George W. Bush toward war with Saddam Hussein was as much a family legacy as were his admissions to Andover, Yale, and Skull and Bones," distract attention from the more substantive and credible points he wants to make. In the end they make "American Dynasty" feel less like a considered examination of the Bush family legacy and more like an ill-tempered diatribe filmed by Oliver Stone.

HEADLINE: Why Libya Gave Up on the Bomb 

BYLINE:  By Flynt Leverett; Flynt Leverett, a visiting fellow with the Saban Center for Middle East Politics at the Brookings Institution, was senior director for Middle Eastern affairs at the National Security Council from 2002 to 2003.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Bush made clear in his State of the Union address, he sees the striking developments in relations with Libya as the fruit of his strategy in the war on terrorism. The idea is that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's apparent decision to renounce weapons of mass destruction was a largely a result of the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, which thus retroactively justifies the war in Iraq and holds out the prospect of similar progress with other states that support terrorists, seek weapons of mass destruction and brutalize their own people. 
 However, by linking shifts in Libya's behavior to the Iraq war, the president misrepresents the real lesson of the Libyan case. This confusion undermines our chances of getting countries like Iran and Syria to follow Libya's lead. 
 The roots of the recent progress with Libya go back not to the eve of the Iraq war, but to the Bush administration's first year in office. Indeed, to be fair, some credit should even be given to the second Clinton administration. Tired of international isolation and economic sanctions, the Libyans decided in the late 1990's to seek normalized relations with the United States, and held secret discussions with Clinton administration officials to convey that message. The Clinton White House made clear that no movement toward better relations was possible until Libya met its responsibilities stemming from the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. 
These discussions, along with mediation by the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, produced a breakthrough: Libya turned over two intelligence officers implicated in the Pan Am 103 attack to the Netherlands for trial by a Scottish court, and in 1999 Washington acquiesced to the suspension of United Nations sanctions against Libya.
Then, in the spring of 2001, when I was a member of the State Department's policy planning staff, the Bush administration picked up on those discussions and induced the Libyans to meet their remaining Lockerbie obligations. With our British colleagues, we presented the Libyans with a "script" indicating what they needed to do and say to satisfy our requirements on compensating the families of the Pan Am 103 victims and accepting responsibility for the actions of the Libyan intelligence officers implicated in the case. 
We also put an explicit quid pro quo on the table: if Libya met the conditions we laid out, the United States and Britain would allow United Nations sanctions to be lifted permanently. This script became the basis for three-party negotiations to resolve the Lockerbie issue. 
By early 2003, after a Scottish appeals court upheld the conviction of one of the Libyan intelligence officers, it was evident that our approach would bear fruit. Indeed, Washington allowed the United Nations sanctions against Libya to be removed last summer after Libya reached a compensation agreementwith the Pan Am 103 families and accepted responsibility for its officials' actions. 
But during these two years of talks, American negotiators consistently told the Libyans that resolving the Lockerbie situation would lead to no more than elimination of United Nations sanctions. To get out from under the separate United States sanctions, Libya would have to address other concerns, particularly regarding its programs in weapons of mass destruction. 
This is the context in which Libyan officials approached the United States and Britain last spring to discuss dismantling Libya's weapons program. The Iraq war, which had not yet started, was not the driving force behind Libya's move. Rather, Libya was willing to deal because of credible diplomatic representations by the United States over the years, which convinced the Libyans that doing so was critical to achieving their strategic and domestic goals. Just as with Lockerbie, an explicit quid pro quo was offered: American officials indicated that a verifiable dismantling of Libya's weapons projects would lead the removal our own sanctions, perhaps by the end of this year. 
The lesson is incontrovertible: to persuade a rogue regime to get out of the terrorism business and give up its weapons of mass destruction, we must not only apply pressure but also make clear the potential benefits of cooperation. Unfortunately, the Bush administration has refused to take this approach with other rogue regimes, notably Iran and Syria. Until the president is willing to employ carrots as well as sticks, he will make little headway in changing Iranian or Syrian behavior. 
The president's lack of initiative on this point is especially disappointing because, in the diplomatic aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the administration has a singular opportunity to effect strategic realignments by both Iran and Syria. Well-placed Iranians, including more pragmatic elements of Iran's conservative camp, have indicated through diplomatic channels and to former officials (including myself) their interest in a "grand bargain" with the United States. Basically, Tehran would trade off its ties to terrorist groups and pursuit of nuclear weapons for security guarantees, a lifting of sanctions and normalized relations with Washington. 
Likewise, senior Syrian officials -- including President Bashar al-Assad himself, in a conversation in Damascus last week -- have told me that they want a better strategic understanding with the United States. To achieve this, however, Washington needs to be willing to spell out what Syria would get in return for giving up its ties to terrorists and its chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. As Mr. Assad told me, Syria is "a state, not a charity" -- if it gives up something, it must know what it will gain in return. 
One reason the Bush administration was able to take a more constructive course with Libya was that the White House, uncharacteristically, sidelined the administration's neoconservative wing -- which strongly opposes any offer of carrots to state sponsors of terrorism, even when carrots could help end such problematic behavior -- when crucial decisions were made. The initial approach on the Lockerbie case was approved by an informal coalition made up of Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, and Secretary of State Colin Powell. Likewise, in the lead up to the negotiations involving Libyan weapons of mass destruction, the neoconservatives at the Pentagon and in the shop of Under Secretary of State John Bolton were left out of the loop. 
Perhaps a coalition among members of the State Department's bureau of Near Eastern affairs and the National Security Council's more pragmatic elements can chart a similar course involving Iran and Syria. However, until the administration learns the real lessons of the Libyan precedent, policy toward other rogue regimes is likely to remain stuck in the mud of ideology.

HEADLINE: The Other America 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Either the president doesn't get it, or he is deliberately ignoring the hard times that have enveloped millions of Americans on his watch.
 "For the sake of job growth," said Mr. Bush, to the loud applause of the Congressional bobbleheads at his State of the Union address, "the tax cuts you passed should be made permanent." 
 Job growth? That's the weirdest thing Mr. Bush has said since he told a CNN discussion group, "As governor of Texas, I have set high standards for our public schools, and I have met those standards." 
Nearly 2.5 million jobs have been lost since Mr. Bush became president, and the most recent employment statistics have made a mockery of the claim that tax cuts for the rich would be the engine of job growth for the middle and working classes.
Two days after the speech, Eastman Kodak announced plans to cut its work force by as much as 23 percent -- 12,000 to 15,000 jobs -- by the end of 2006. The news sent tremors through Rochester, where Kodak has its headquarters. More than 21,000 Kodak workers and their families live in and around Rochester.
The economy created a meager 1,000 jobs in December. Moreover, according to a report released Wednesday by the Economic Policy Institute, there has been a nationwide shift of jobs from higher-paying to lower-paying industries. In New Hampshire, where the Democratic presidential candidates are locked in a fierce primary fight, the wages in industries gaining jobs are 35 percent lower than in those losing jobs. New Hampshire is one of 30 states that have fewer jobs now than when the recession officially ended in November 2001.
When millions of families are suffering in the midst of what is billed as a robust recovery, we should start looking closely at the possibility that the system itself is breaking down.
This goes far beyond the issue of employment. The Times ran a front-page article on Wednesday about Gov. George Pataki's proposed state budget. The ominous subheadline read: "Plan Relies on Gambling to Aid Poorest Schools."
I wrote a story last week about the tens of thousands of low-income youngsters in Florida who are eligible for a children's health insurance program but are being put on waiting lists. State officials say they can't afford to insure the kids now. In California, an estimated 300,000 eligible children are being shunted to similar waiting lists. No one knows when they might get coverage.
President Bush got at least one thing right on Tuesday night, when he said, "Americans are proving once again to be the hardest-working people in the world." Those who are fortunate enough to be employed often have to work long hours, or string together two and three jobs to make ends meet. They are working harder and harder just to keep from falling behind.
The Bush administration has offered up a perverse acknowledgment of this struggle: a proposed change in Labor Department regulations that would enable employers to deny overtime pay for millions of workers.
Most of the Democratic presidential candidates, especially Senator John Edwards, have been hammering at these issues for some time. In his "Two Americas" speech, Senator Edwards says there is:
"One America that does the work, another America that reaps the reward. One America that pays the taxes, another America that gets the tax breaks. . . . One America -- middle-class America -- whose needs Washington has long forgotten. Another America -- narrow-interest America -- whose every wish is Washington's command."
The interests of the great corporations and the wealthy, privileged classes are not the same as those of American working families. And because the power of government has shifted so radically in favor of the interests of the former, there is little left but indifference to the needs and aspirations of the latter, who just happen to be the vast majority of Americans.
In Monday's column I incorrectly wrote that treason was among the charges lodged against Daniel Ellsberg in the Pentagon Papers case. He was accused of treason by his critics, but he was actually charged with violations of the Espionage Act.

HEADLINE: Canadian Leader Questions Police Raid on Reporter's Home 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Paul Martin sharply distanced himself on Thursday from the police raid of the home and office of a newspaper reporter who obtained secret government documents related to a suspected member of Al Qaeda, arguing that any investigation must be weighed against principles of freedom of the press.
 In New York, meanwhile, lawyers acting on behalf of the suspected Qaeda member, Maher Arar, filed suit in federal court accusing Attorney General John Ashcroft and two other top American officials, of deporting Mr. Arar to Syria despite knowing that Syria practices torture. Mr. Arar, a Syrian-born software consultant who denies any involvement in Al Qaeda, was arrested in 2002 during a brief stopover in the United States on his way home to Canada. He was expelled to Syria, where he says he was tortured. He has since returned to Canada. 
 Mr. Martin, speaking in Davos, Switzerland, where he is attending the World Economic Forum, expressed distress about a police action that he said neither he nor his aides were aware of beforehand. 
"Very clearly we are not a police state and we have no intention of being a police state," he said. "There is a balance between how does one protect the nation's security and what are the steps taken. And certainly our bias is going to be constantly to review that balance."
The issue appeared to be an early civil liberties test for the new prime minister, who campaigned for the Liberal Party leadership on the issue of empowering ordinary citizens. But it also gave the parliamentary opposition an opening to question whether Mr. Martin, who has been in office for five weeks, is fully in charge of his government.
On Wednesday, officers with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided the home and office of Juliet O'Neill, a reporter with The Ottawa Citizen, downloading her computer files and confiscating her notebooks, contact lists and other files. Their search warrants said she faced possible criminal charges of violating the Security of Information Act, a sweeping measure enacted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attcks on the United States to strengthen prohibitions on the possession of state secrets.
Ms. O'Neill is being investigated for an article she wrote last year outlining Canadian intelligence reports that Mr. Arar had trained in a terrorist camp in Afghanistan. She could face up to 14 years in jail for receiving and possessing secret documents. Her editors, however, say that Mr. Martin's remarks and comments by prosecutors suggested that imminent prosecution is unlikely.
Mr. Martin said Ms. O'Neill was "clearly not" a criminal and that the Security of Information Act must be reviewed. "What should be of interest to everybody is who leaked that information, not the journalist who received it," he said.
Ms. O'Neill said in a telephone interview that she welcomed Mr. Martin's remarks.
"I heard he said I am not a criminal and that is very heartening," she said. She complained that the police had taken "all the tools of my trade" in their raids. 
After Mr. Arar returned to Canada last October, he said he had been unfairly accused by the United States and had been tortured in Syria. He maintained that he had never been in Afghanistan. 
The Center for Constitutional Rights filed the lawsuit on his behalf in New York, naming Mr. Ashcroft, Tom Ridge, the head of the Office of Homeland Security, and Robert Mueller III, the director of the F.B.I., seeking damages and an apology. The Justice Department released a statement saying it believed Mr. Arar was a member of Al Qaeda.
Mr. Arar's expulsion has been a point of contention between Canada and the Bush administration, although officials in both countries say they shared intelligence suggesting that Mr. Arar had ties to a Qaeda support cell operating in Ottawa.
Opposition leaders raised questions about who in the highest levels of the government were in command of the security forces. Peter MacKay, a conservative leader in the House of Commons, said of Mr. Martin, "To think that he hadn't briefed himself is just unbelievable."
But the deputy prime minister, Anne McLellan, one of the senior officials charged with public security, told reporters that it would not necessarily be appropriate for them to be given prior information about actions taken in a R.C.M.P. criminal investigation.
Richard G. Dearden, Ms. O'Neill's lawyer, said he hoped that Mr. Martin would make sure that his client got a copy of the sealed affidavit with the evidence the police used to obtain the search warrant. Under the Canada Evidence Act, passed in December 2001, the attorney general has 10 days to decide whether to release the affadavit. 
"This becomes a test for the 'star chamber' procedures implemented after 9/11 and that are being used," Mr. Dearden said.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Dean Pitches Record, Courage and Leadership With a Smile

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
 This 30-second advertisement from Howard Dean began running in New Hampshire on Thursday.

PRODUCER -- Trippi, McMahon & Squier.

ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a shot of a younger Dr. Dean taking the governor's oath in Vermont and then focuses on a headline about his signing of the bill allowing gay civil unions. The screen flashes, "A true leader. Howard Dean." The screen then shows a picture of President Bush and a newspaper headline from January 2002 about Mr. Bush's popularity in the polls. The screen flashes "Democrats were silent," and then moves to shots of Dr. Dean speaking with prospective voters in a living room, standing alone in the woods and shaking hands with former President Jimmy Carter as the screen flashes, "opposed the Iraq war," "opposed Bush economic plan," "courageous." Next, the screen says, "What's politically popular is easy." After that it flashes, "But is that what America needs now?" The spot closes with Dr. Dean, smiling as he moves across a stage in slow motion. A giant American flag hangs behind him.

THE SCRIPT -- A narrator says, "Standing up for what's right even when it's not popular. That's the test of a true leader. When George Bush was riding high in the polls and other Democrats were silent, Howard Dean spoke out to oppose the war and Bush's economic policies. That's why Jimmy Carter called Howard Dean courageous. Saying the politically popular thing is easy, but is that really what America needs now?"

ACCURACY -- Dr. Dean has, of course, spoken out vociferously against the war and President Bush. But so has Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio. But Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has noted that Dr. Dean expressed support for a more restrictive Iraq war resolution than the one that passed last year. And while Mr. Carter did call Dr. Dean courageous, he also made it clear that he was not endorsing anyone in the nomination contest.

SCORECARD -- Dr. Dean's advisers are betting that his big smile at the end will win him thousands of votes lost by his Iowa concession. And the spot also seems to effectively position Dr. Dean as a governor with a record of accomplishment. It also tries to recast criticism over some of his verbal missteps as criticism over standing up for his values despite the consequences.

While that may work for some, other voters may not accept that as a blanket defense for statements some have criticized as being inappropriate or insensitive. The spot's negative references to "other Democrats" could disappoint potential supporters who want to see a less confrontational Dr. Dean now.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE STUMP SPEECH/Joseph I. Lieberman; 
Preaching Centrist Values And Claiming Clinton Style

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has a simple way of preaching the value of centrism: he tells voters that his long record of moderation and years of working across party lines is the winning political combination that Republicans will not know how to counter.
 "The normal arguments against Democrats don't work with me," he told a group of business leaders in Windham on Wednesday. 
 "They can't say I'm weak on defense because I'm not," he declared. "They can't say I'm a big tax-and-spend person because I'm not. They can't say I'm silent on values because I'm not. They can't say I flip-flop because," he paused, drawing out the words, "I. Do. Not." 
Sometimes he muses, "I have a dream that maybe I'm George Bush's nightmare."
As Mr. Lieberman of Connecticut increasingly struggles to be heard by voters in this first-primary state, these phrases are what he calls the "closing arguments" of his campaign here.
For a year, the man who was Al Gore's running mate in 2000 has struggled to catch fire with a message of moderation, arguing that he is the keeper of Bill Clinton's legacy and of the new, more moderate identity Mr. Clinton gave to his party.
And so time and again Mr. Lieberman has refined and polished his stump speech, looking for the way to make centrism capture the voters' imagination.
It is now a blunt plea for votes based not so much on where he stands on particular issues -- he has often stood against party orthodoxy on matters like school vouchers -- but on his consistency, his forthrightness, his independence and his character.
"If you disagree with me so strenuously on one of those issues and decide that that's the basis for your votes next Tuesday, I respect that," he told a group of educators here on Thursday. "But if you want somebody who's going to level with you and as president do everything I possibly can to protect your safety and lead a government that is there for your family when you need help, I'm your man."
He is a man, he often argues, who can build a coalition broader than the Democratic base in order to defeat President Bush. "We beat him by running as an independent, center-out Democrat," he says. "You unite the party and then pick up support from independents and even from some disgruntled moderate Republicans." Describing himself as "a bridge-builder," he adds that when the party won the national election in 1992, Bill Clinton "worked from the center out and so that's what I intend to do again." 
This rationale has been refined over time. Just a few weeks ago when Howard Dean looked ascendant, Mr. Lieberman was smiling his ubiquitous, voluptuous smile and grabbing for the center in a different way. Warning that to win, the Democrats could not "replace one set of extremes with an extreme anger of our own," he would speak of the "clear choice" facing Democrats between himself and Dr. Dean.
"I am not George Bush or Howard Dean," he would say, "but if you are looking for an alternative to both of them, I am your man."
Now, he takes implicit digs at others.
"I know who I am and what I stand for," he tells his audiences, a reminder that Senator John Kerry and Gen. Wesley K. Clark -- both ahead of him in the polls -- have been accused of inconsistencies on where they stand on the Iraq war.
"I didn't just get dropped into this race," Mr. Lieberman says, alluding to criticisms of General Clark as a latecomer not only to the contest but also to the Democratic Party.
And as the race has tightened and rivals have surged past him, Mr. Lieberman's speech has become sharper, more focused on President Bush. "If George Bush set out to make America weaker at home and more distrusted than ever in the world," he says, "Mr. President I have two words for you: mission accomplished."
And in his discussion of how he would raise taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans to pay for a middle-class tax cut he says, "Bush and Cheney and their buddies may not like it but I say to them, with all respect," -- here he uses a flourish reminiscent of Mr. Clinton -- "I don't feel your pain."
Indeed, the last Democratic president is a constant presence in Mr. Lieberman's speeches, as if he were campaigning around an unspoken maxim, "It's Bill Clinton, stupid." 
He reminds Democrats how President Clinton reshaped their party, making them stand for an agenda of middle-class tax cuts, a robust foreign policy, free trade and fiscal discipline.
And so Mr. Lieberman too builds his platform on tax cuts for the middle class to stimulate the economy, tax incentives to help business create and keep jobs in the country and tax increases for the wealthy to help pay for a raft of social programs, including health care, child care, education and job training.
He offers balm for the middle class, often ending his remarks by saying that he wants to restore to Americans the lost sense of optimism and limitless possibilities that he grew up with. 
"Today the middle class across this country is under more stress than I've ever seen," he said recently. "Paying so much for decent health care and not being able to afford it. Getting billed more than ever before and for child care and college education, struggling to keep their jobs and worried about them, worried about their retirement security. And through it all what has George W. Bush done? He's comforted the comfortable."
On foreign policy, Mr. Lieberman casts himself as a realist who can shepherd the country through a dangerously complex time, telling his audiences that he is running for president to make the country "stronger at home and in the world." 
He is unapologetic for his vote in favor of force in Iraq. "I was for the war against Saddam, and I haven't been afraid to say so because I know it has made the American people safer," he says flatly.
He lists his qualifications to be commander in chief, mentioning his long stay on the Senate Armed Services Committee and his world travels. But he also throws in the telling bits of autobiography intended to help him connect with his audiences, saying he was "the first in my family to go to college," the beneficiary of a good public school education and the child of parents who worked their way into the middle class.
He also suffuses his remarks with the language of values, seeking to show that he has the right moral compass. "My whole career is based on the premise that life in politics ought to be based on values," he said in a recent speech. "I must tell you when Republicans claim a monopoly on values or faith-based values, I'm not going to let them get away with it. Democrats are full of faith and values as much as the Republicans and I'm going to talk about that."
Perhaps because of the limited time left before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Lieberman's speech is becoming truncated, occasionally to the point of appearing like the CliffsNotes version of his candidacy. Sometimes, he just lists the ingredients: "Strong on security," "pro-growth," "independent-minded," "fiscally responsible," "socially progressive."
And although it was the sting of Mr. Gore's endorsement of Dr. Dean that sparked Mr. Lieberman's new-found aggressiveness, Mr. Lieberman has once again begun to remind Democrats of his partnership with Mr. Gore, a way of signaling to voters that they may have already voted for him once and perhaps they should again.
"Life," he says, "is about second chances."
This article is the fifth in a series looking at the basic campaign speeches of the presidential candidates.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE DEBATE; 
DEMOCRATS VOW TO BATTLE BUSH ON SOCIAL ISSUES

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: GOFFSTOWN, N.H., Jan. 22 

 BODY:
In their final debate before the New Hampshire primary, the Democratic presidential candidates declared on Thursday that they could withstand election-year attacks from President Bush on social values and tax cuts, as they sought to allay concerns among Democrats about the party's hopes of winning back the White House this fall.
 Looking weary and subdued after three weeks of nonstop campaigning, the seven Democrats insisted in a two-hour televised debate that they could easily defend themselves against the kind of attacks on social, military and economic issues that Republicans have used effectively against Democrats in presidential elections for 20 years. 
 "That's a fight I look forward to," Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said when asked if he feared that the White House would label him a tax-and-spend Democrat because he and his rivals want to repeal at least some of Mr. Bush's tax cuts.
"That's a fight we will win," he said. 
Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, said he had no fear of challenging Mr. Bush on social issues. Dr. Dean noted his own opposition to some forms of gun control and his advocacy of balanced budgets as governor.
"I'd challenge this president on values any day," Dr. Dean said. 
And Senator John Edwards of North Carolina reminded the audience that he had beaten as tough a Republican opponent as the one in this White House.
"Remember, I didn't get to the Senate by accident," Mr. Edwards said. "I actually defeated an incumbent Republican senator who was part of the Jesse Helms political machine in North Carolina."
The debate was relentlessly civil, a striking development given the fact that the candidates are five days away from the most competitive Democratic primary here since 1992. But the high stakes reinforced the candidates' efforts to be cautious. News analysis, Page A18. 
Again and again they bypassed opportunities to attack one another, leading one moderator to brand the session a "happy debate." And there were far fewer of the so-called rapid-response e-mail messages and leaflets that the campaigns have routinely fired off during debates to try to discredit opponents.
The tone at the debate, held on the grounds of St. Anselm College outside Manchester, was testimony to the extent to which Mr. Edwards's showing in Iowa, after running a campaign in which he presented himself as the most positive candidate, had set parameters for the intense contest in New Hampshire.
Not incidentally, the candidate who has often been the most aggressive in this contest, Dr. Dean, was under self-imposed restraints after giving an unruly concession speech in Iowathat many have seized upon to question his temperament.
This dynamic was clearly a matter of frustration to the questioners at the debate, which was sponsored by Fox News, ABC News, WMUR and The Manchester Union Leader.
At one point, Peter Jennings of ABC News tried to push Senator Joseph I. Lieberman to criticize his opponents, asking whether he believed that "Governor Dean and Senator Kerry have been hesitant, or would be hesitant, to take on George Bush successfully on the question of social values."
Mr. Lieberman chuckled, but would not take the bait.
"Let me put it this way: This is a time to be affirmative," he said. "I'd say, nice try."
The debate had been eagerly anticipated by many Democrats, given that the vote is just five days away and the contest is, by any measure, volatile. It was viewed by strategists as particularly important for Dr. Dean, after his difficult week, and for Mr. Kerry, who Democrats and some polls suggested had jumped to the lead, and thus was presumably being watched closely by voters here.
Dr. Dean, at the first opportunity, raised the matter that has clouded his candidacy this week: his loud and rowdy concession speech in Iowa on Monday night, an episode that his own aides say has threatened the viability of his campaign.
"You may notice that my voice is a little hoarse," he said. "It's not because I was whooping and hollering at my third-place finish in Iowa. It's because I have a cold."
Dr. Dean, speaking softly and with reserve, returned to the issue again a few minutes later.
"You know, I'm not a perfect person," he said. "I think a lot of people have had a lot of fun at my expense over the Iowa hooting and hollering, and that's justified. But one thing I can tell you is that I'm not kidding about what I say."
The Rev. Al Sharpton offered condolences to Dr. Dean, up to a point. "I wanted to say to Governor Dean, don't be hard on yourself about hooting and hollering," he said. "If I had spent the money you did and got 18 percent, I'd still be in Iowa hooting and hollering."
Dr. Dean managed a grin as the audience erupted in laughter.
The debate featured a smaller cast than in the past, with Carol Moseley Braun and Richard A. Gephardt now out of the race.
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio asserted that energy was the most important environmental issue facing the country.
"In the same way that President John F. Kennedy decided to bring the academic and spiritual resources of this country to have the United States reach the Moon some day, I intend to have a very infinitely interesting journey to planet Earth," he said. "And that journey will be about sustainable and renewable energy."
General Wesley K. Clark repeatedly defended his Democratic credentials, as he explained why he had voted for Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. And he declined to disavow a remark made by Michael Moore, the filmmaker, who at a rally in which he appeared with General Clark had described the president as a deserter.
"Michael Moore has the right to say whatever he feels about this," General Clark said. "I don't know whether this is supported by the facts or not. I've never looked at it."
Mr. Clark said Mr. Moore was "not the only person who said that," even while admitting that he had not taken the time to check the facts of Mr. Bush's attendance record with the National Guard in Texas. 
General Clark read from notes at one point as he discussed the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion rights, seeking to clarify his earlier statement that he would support allowing women to have an abortion up until the ninth month. 
"As much as I respect the opinion of the Catholic Church, in this case, I don't support it," he replied. "It's that simple.".
General Clark sharply criticized Mr. Bush, saying he had failed to take adequate measures to protect the nation from the attacks on the the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. "Before 9/11, he did not do everything he could have done to keep this country safe," General Clark said. "After 9/11, he took us to a war we didn't have to fight, and Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda is still going strong. We were at terrorist condition orange."
The debate came two days after the State of the Union address, which appeared in part to be an attempt by Mr. Bush to lay down his own re-election platform, rebutting criticism from the Democrats.
Mr. Bush's speech echoed in the debate here, as the candidates, for one example, answered questions about their position on gay marriage. Mr. Bush had suggested in his speech that he might support a constitutional amendment barring it.
Among the Democrats, only Mr. Sharpton disagreed with the assertion that gay marriage should be left for the states to decide.
"I am unilaterally opposed to any civil or human right being left to states' rights," he said. "That is a dangerous precedent. I think the federal government has the obligation to protect all citizens on a federal level."
In asserting that he was not out of the mainstream on social issues because his state had approved civil unions, Dr. Dean noted: "We chose not to do gay marriage. We chose to do civil unions. I think that position, actually, is very similar to Dick Cheney's, who thinks every state ought to be able to do what they want."
The Democrats, all of whom support repealing at least some of the Bush tax cuts, said they were not concerned that Mr. Bush would try to use that position to undercut them, the way Republicans have done to Democrats in a series of elections .
"There was no middle-class tax cut in this country," said Dr. Dean, who supports rolling back all the cuts. "Somebody has to stand up and say we cannot have everything. We can't have tax cuts, pay for health care, pay for No Child Left Behind and pay for an adequate defense."
Senator Kerry said he would counter attempts to paint him as a liberal. "I am a veteran," he said. "I fought in a war. I've been a prosecutor. I've sent people to jail for the rest of their life." He added that he had voted to overhaul the welfare system, and that he owned guns.
Asked what he would say to Republicans who tried to challenge him for being too liberal, Dr. Dean said: "Well, let's talk first about money. The president of the United States can't balance a budget." He added, "I'm much more conservative with money than George Bush is." 
He also said he did not support gun control as much as other Democrats.
Mr. Lieberman, though, said that of all the Democrats, he was the one the White House would have the toughest time coming after.
"The reason is that the Republicans can't run their normal playbook on me that they try to run on Democratic candidates," Mr. Lieberman said. "They can't say I flip-flop because I don't. They can't say I'm weak on defense because I'm not. 
"They can't say I'm weak on values because I'm not. They can't say I'm a big taxer and a big spender."

HEADLINE: An Act of Conscience, or a Violation of Trust? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Single Conscience v. the State," by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 19):
 By leaking a highly classified memo to the press, Katharine Gun surely violated the terms of her employment by Britain's top-secret Government Communications Headquarters. 
Such a violation of trust makes her unemployable by any agency that requires secrecy. 
 While if convicted, she faces up to two years in prison, that pales in comparison with the likely penalty of leaking secrets -- murder, torture, the murder of your family -- under the regime recently deposed by George W. Bush and Tony Blair.
That "Ms. Gun felt passionately that an invasion of Iraq was wrong" is appealed to as mitigating the leak, as if passionate feelings adhered to some kind of moral standard. Need we be reminded that "passionate feelings" underlie all kinds of reprehensible and criminal behavior, from domestic violence to suicide bombing? 
Is passion really so far above duty and commitment?

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL; 
Nets Sale Leaves State Looking for Alternatives

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS and DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. Jan. 22 

 BODY:
New Jersey officials offered explanations Thursday as to why they thought the state lost the Nets to a buyer who plans to move them to Brooklyn. Although they didn't quite say "we wuz robbed," it was clearly what they felt.
 George R. Zoffinger, the president and chief executive of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, all but uttered the 1932 phrase -- immortalized by a disgruntled fight manager -- as he criticized the decision by the Nets' owners Wednesday to sell the team to Bruce C. Ratner and not to a group led by the New Jersey developer Charles Kushner and Senator Jon S. Corzine. The sports authority owns Continental Arena, where the Nets now play. 
 In a news conference at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands, Zoffinger said good faith had been lacking in the final day of negotiations and that Lewis Katz, a key partner in the Nets' ownership group, stood to gain from the billions of dollars in real estate development that could grow out of a move to Brooklyn.
Katz did not return phone calls Thursday seeking reaction to Zoffinger's comments.
The proposed move could doom the nearly six-year-old effort to build a new home for the Nets and the Devils in Newark as part of that city's revitalization. Any new arena there now would presumably house only the Devils.
"The Brooklyn transaction was about real estate and not basketball, and we think that all along this thing was wired to go to Brooklyn," said Zoffinger, who appeared to take some solace in what he said was the uphill battle that New York politicians would face in getting a Brooklyn arena built.
"It made no difference what we did," he said.
But that said, Zoffinger did acknowledge that Gov. James E. McGreevey had made a "public policy decision" not to use state money to subsidize an effort to keep the Nets in New Jersey. 
Meanwhile, Zoffinger and others said that the move by the Nets ownership would require the state to reposition Continental Arena in the marketplace. He said that he was willing to work with the Nets' new owners to allow them to continue to play at the arena until their lease expires in 2008. But in the meantime, he said the 22-year-old Continental Arena would begin concentrating on attracting more concerts, circuses and ice shows and competing for the vast universe of trade shows.
The arena's attractiveness, he said, would only be enhanced by the planned construction of a $1.4 billion entertainment, office and hotel complex called Meadowlands Xanadu that is scheduled to be built on 106 acres adjacent to the arena. The economic activity of this development, said James Hughes, director of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, will dwarf the current level of activity in the Meadowlands generated by the teams now playing there.
Zoffinger said that the state agency currently loses $2 million a year because of the structure of the Nets' and Devils' leases at the arena and the dates that the teams monopolized. With the Nets eventually leaving, he said, Continental Arena will be free to attract a host of new events that would erase the $2 million loss.
But that kind of repositioning could be fatal to Newark's already sinking arena plan. For his part, Mayor Sharpe James of Newark said in a statement Thursday that he remained excited about proceeding with plans to build a $355 million arena in the city despite the state's loss of the Nets. Councilman Donald Tucker and others in Newark said that James was poised to announce next week that the city, along with the Devils, would still try to build the arena and financially bolster it by seeking to stage wrestling matches there along with N.C.A.A. basketball tournament games, concerts and auto and boat shows.
Zoffinger, who said he would seek to attract the same kind of events to Continental Arena, conceded that studies had shown that two arenas within 12 miles of each other vying for the same kinds of events would doom one or both to economic failure.
And Tucker said that James, despite his public optimism, might have to change course. He even suggested that James recognized this possibility as well because in the last few months, he has promoted a downtown "urban village" commercial and residential development that is designed to boost the city's population and take advantage of its proximity to public transportation and New York City.
One person who did talk positively Thursday of a new arena in Newark was Lou Lamoriello, the president and general manager of the Devils. Having a new arena all to themselves, he said, would help the Devils address the same kind of attendance problems that have plagued the Nets in New Jersey.
"This could be the perfect end to all of our problems," he said.
Through 23 home games, the Devils are averaging 14,497 fans at the 19,040-seat arena, which is not a particularly healthy figure for a team that has won three Stanley Cups in the last nine seasons.
But Lamoriello said he thought the Devils could do much better at the turnstiles if they played in an arena with better access to public transportation and were able to schedule more games on Fridays and Saturdays.
Because the Devils share an arena with the Nets, only two of the Devils' 41 home games are scheduled for Saturday nights this season. In contrast, the Islanders, who have Nassau Coliseum to themselves, are to play 12 home games on Saturday night.
Lamoriello also said that Continental Arena lacked the amenities that newer arenas possess and that he was skeptical that the Xanadu development would address the existing problems. 
"It's something the Devils drastically need -- a new facility," Lamoriello said.
The principal owners of the Devils are Katz and Raymond Chambers, who own 70 percent of the team, with other investors, through Puck Holdings. The other 30 percent is held by YankeeNets, which is to be dissolved at the end of this month.

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, an Uncertain Political Response to the Sale 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
During the past year, as the New Jersey Nets' owners publicly threatened to move the team out of the state, Gov. James E. McGreevey insisted that New Jersey would be better off losing the franchise than spending tens of millions of tax dollars to keep it.
 Now that the team's owners have agreed to sell to a group that intends to move it to downtown Brooklyn, Mr. McGreevey, a Democrat, will find out soon whether his economic calculation will have serious political fallout. 
 Articles about the Nets' impending departure dominated news coverage across the state on Thursday, and Republican leaders were quick to say Mr. McGreevey had botched the Nets transaction and "lost a professional sports franchise." 
Still, there were few signs of any widespread anguish about the plans for the Nets to move, and many political analysts said there was little to suggest that Mr. McGreevey would pay a steep price for losing a sports team. Since the 1970's and 80's, when New Jersey leaders tried to bolster the state's image by luring sports franchises from other communities, voters have grown wary of using tax money to underwrite any sports franchise, according to a variety of polls.
The state is facing its third consecutive budget squeeze and, since the state's homeowners carry the nation's highest property taxes, state officials felt they had little incentive to offer the kind of public money needed to keep the team. In fact, the Nets seemed to have become an afterthought among sports fans, and attracted sparse crowds in recent years even though they were the N.B.A. Eastern Conference champion the past two years.
"Bruce Springsteen and Tony Soprano have done more than anything to put New Jersey on the cultural map, but the Nets don't really seem to register," said Michael Alan Rockland, a Rutgers University professor who has written several books about New Jersey's image. "People feel better about New Jersey than they used to, they're comfortable with all its flaws, but for whatever reason, people never really bonded with the Nets."
The sale of the Nets and the prospective move to Brooklyn occur at a time when New Jersey's budget problems and Mr. McGreevey's own miscues have left him with low approval ratings. 
Losing the Nets also appears likely to strain his relationship with Democratic leaders in Essex County. In late 2001, as governor-elect, Mr. McGreevey asked the departing administration not to approve financing for an arena in downtown Newark, and pledged to prepare his own plan for a stadium.
Now the hope for a downtown Newark stadium is all but dead, but the governor said he was confident that middle-class taxpayers would be grateful that he did not use public funds to help those bidding against the group intent on the Brooklyn move. "If officials in New York commit to spending taxpayer dollars to build an arena for the benefit of team owners, that is their choice, but we will not play that game," he said in a written statement on Thursday. "I have different priorities and a greater responsibility to the people of New Jersey."
Republicans, whose opposition helped scuttle the plans for the publicly financed Newark stadium for the Nets and New Jersey Devils, still found fault with Mr. McGreevey over the loss of the team. State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr. said Mr. McGreevey's administration has harmed the state's business climate. State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr. said the team's departure would hurt restaurants and other businesses that cater to Nets fans.
"If Governor McGreevey believes the loss of the Nets will not have a negative economic impact on the many small businesses and hardworking families in the Meadowlands region, he is sadly mistaken," said Mr. Kyrillos, state Republican chairman.
McGreevey administration officials and some independent analysts said that if the Xanadu office and entertainment complex is built adjacent to the Meadowlands as planned, it will generate more business activity, and tax revenue, than the Nets.
If the Meadowlands redevelopment falters, Mr. McGreevey could face a backlash from an electorate that still questions his decision-making. For now, though, according to Clifford Zukin, director of the Star-Ledger Eagleton poll, voters appear to be unconcerned. 
"No elected official wants to be put in the position of losing a team or putting in lots of tax dollars," Mr. Zukin said. "But as far as playing a difficult hand, so far it looks like the governor has made the right decisions."

HEADLINE: Budget Priced, at $99.8 Billion; 
Can New York State Sell Its Fiscal Plan Like a $99.99 TV?

BYLINE:  By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
It is no bargain, but it does have the beguiling ring of a sale item.
 Like a color television priced at $99.99 or a pair of socks marked $1.98, the New York State budget proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki on Tuesday came in at a neat $99.8 billion. That is to say, not $100 billion. 
 But the smaller number is so close to that big, round, striking figure that lawmakers, lobbyists and others here are asking whether the total was intended to sound like a really good deal, leaving it to the Legislature to push the final tally over the top.
In the political psychology of lawmakers, a threshold number like $100 billion is freighted with trouble. Only one other state budget, California's, has risen that high. And no one in New York wants to be remembered as the first to propose the triple-digit budget.
"I am sure they struggled mightily to make sure it came in under 100 billion," said State Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat from Manhattan.
"It reminded me of how at the gas station the price is always point-nine," he said. "There must be some marketing mentality that says 99 cents is cheaper than a buck." In politics, he said, a figure like $100 billion would make a good "bumper sticker issue."
The governor's aides said they had not schemed to keep the number in the 90's but acknowledged they were not entirely unhappy that it ended up there.
"It wasn't something that was obsessed over," said an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But we weren't disappointed to see that it was under. 
"Obviously, it is not something you completely ignore. But the way the budget process works is you make your decisions and you don't know what the final figure will be."
It is only natural to want to put as thrifty a face as possible on one's spending habits. After all, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has portrayed himself as a fiscal conservative. And that television priced at $99.99 has a subliminal pull, those who plumb the psychology of sales say.
"I think it is human instinct to always try and see the best side of things," said Nina DiSesa, the creative director at the McCann Erickson advertising agency.
So even though everyone knows that $99.99 is essentially the same as $100, retailers continue the habit of knocking a few cents off to create the illusion of savings, she said. "It is in the interest of consumers and marketers that prices are attractive," she said. "And it's in the interest in the government to not look like spendthrifts."
Just two weeks ago in California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger tried to show his strength in wrestling the state budget under control by proposing a spending package that would total $99.1 billion for the coming fiscal year. Budget analysts said that was not a true reflection of all that Sacramento would spend when it included federal grants, which New York's budget does count in its total. 
Still, the $99.1 billion price tag is an important figure because it is the number that will be used and remembered.
"The hundred-billion-dollar mark is a psychological barrier like 10,000 on the Dow," said Edmund McMahon, senior fellow for tax and budget studies at the conservative Manhattan Institute. 
Unlike stock prices, however, government spending usually goes only one way -- up. "Like the state motto would say, 'Excelsior,"' Mr. McMahon said drily.
Governor Pataki has long cultivated the image of a frugal executive who never came across a tax he did not want to cut. Yet since he took office in 1994, the budget has grown by nearly $40 billion. Scott Pattison, the director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said New York's spending had kept pace with that of other states. 
With such huge amounts of money being discussed, it is easy to lose sight of just how much cash is being tossed around.
On Tuesday, when reporters were trying to figure out how the current year's budget quietly grew from the Legislature's estimate of $92.8 billion to $98.2 billion, even the lawmakers were a bit mystified. That is not uncommon in Albany, where the administration, the Assembly and the Senate all have their own ways of counting -- and each claims to be right.
"I wouldn't get caught up with the numbers," said Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate. 
But the numbers are formidable. Just the $5 billion discrepancy between those two estimates on Tuesday is more than the government of Uruguay spent in 2000. One hundred billion dollars could finance three trips to the moon, according to the proposal laid out last week by President Bush. Many nations do not even have a total gross domestic product that big; Mr. Pataki's proposal is nine times the G.D.P. of Armenia. A stack of 100 billion dollar bills would stretch well over 5,000 miles.
In more familiar terms, if a family wanted to spend the entire New York budget on a fleet of 2004 Rolls-Royce Phantoms, they could buy 308,641 cars priced at $324,000 each. Or if the buyer had more imperialistic intentions, $100 billion could fetch 926 Air Force F-22 fighter jets or 18 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
The state spends the bulk of the money on two things: education and Medicaid. Outside those areas, the most visible places New Yorkers se-e the spending is in transportation and policing. 
As daunting as the $100 billion mark may be, Albany lawmakers said it was likely that the state had seen the end of double-digit budgets. As in Hollywood, where a $100 million take at the box office was once considered a roaring success and is now barely enough to cover the marketing of some films, the $100 billion figure will likely be replaced by a new benchmark. 
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat, said that Mr. Pataki had only increased the importance of the figure by creeping so close, but not passing it. "I think he mistakenly invested it with more political significance than it had," he said. 
In reality, Mr. Brodsky said, the figure has little meaning. Though everyone is waiting for the Legislature to pass the mark, he said, Albany did so long ago with the help of spending by state authorities and other expenditures that do not show up in the budget total.
"We have been over a hundred billion dollars for 10 years now," he said.

HEADLINE: Guarding Their Homes Against the Bulldozer 

BYLINE:  By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Before the first N.B.A. tipoff at the gleaming arena that the developer Bruce C. Ratner envisions for the area straddling the Atlantic Avenue rail yards, Mr. Ratner will have to take on a scrappy squad from down the block: his neighbors.
 A more ethnically, economically and commercially diverse crew would be hard to assemble, even in New York City. Within the three-block chunk imagined for demolition, there are artists and auto body shops, a world-famous violin builder, a cherished neighborhood bar and a small company that makes hats for church ladies. 
 There are no-longer-young yuppie homesteaders who bought pieces of empty warehouses in a crack-plagued neighborhood 15 years ago, and their forebears, immigrants from Mexico and Barbados who bought rundown houses and patched them up. There are professionals in million-dollar penthouses and big Pakistani and Palestinian families crowded into small apartments. 
There is a Haitian car-alarm installer on Flatbush Avenue who just signed a 10-year lease on his garage, a Japanese print-maker on Pacific Street, and a clothing store named after Harriet Tubman.
Altogether, neighborhood organizers say, there are about 1,000 residents and workers in their unglamorous corner of Prospect Heights. All of them would have to move if Mr. Ratner gets the state to invoke its power of eminent domain and seize their buildings so he can erect an arena for the New Jersey Nets, which he is purchasing, and a vast retail and apartment complex.
And, for better or worse, they are taking their place in the long line of New Yorkers fighting quixotic-seeming battles against projects that threaten to devour their neighborhoods.
It is a mixed civic history, one filled with hard-fought failures -- the efforts to stop the World Trade Center, Lincoln Center and Mr. Ratner's own MetroTech complex in downtown Brooklyn -- and a few longshot successes, like the defeat of the highway project called Westway. 
Patti Hagan, a leader of the Prospect Heights Action Coalition, pointed out the dozens of signs and banners ("Don't Destroy Our Homes") hanging in windows. "It's all-out war at this point," she said. "You only get one chance to fight, and if you don't take the opportunity to fight what you think is wrong right now, it will happen, you will be bulldozed and there's no going back."
The local councilwoman, Letitia James, said yesterday that in the 24 hours since word got out that Mr. Ratner had bought the Nets, she had fielded calls from "at least 100 residents" considering lawsuits. "Everyone is calling me in tears," she said.
But veteran organizers noted that development battles are wars of attrition, usually won by the party with the deepest pockets. Olive Freud, who led the fight against the Columbus Center project on Columbus Circle in Manhattan, recalled the day in 1987 when a formation of 800 protesters opened black umbrellas in Central Park to show the size of the shadow the building would cast.
"They chased it away," she said. "People thought they had won." But within a few years, she said, another developer emerged. "Eventually he got exactly what he wanted." 
Scott Bullock, a senior lawyer at the Institute for Justice, a Washington group that helps property owners fight eminent domain seizures, said a successful campaign needed to get organized and educated early, keep the pressure on politicians and make as much noise for as long as possible.
So far, the arena opponents seem to be on schedule. Ms. Hagan trumpeted a traffic study predicting that another 23,000 vehicles a day would use chronically clogged Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues. 
They are studying environmental-impact laws and gearing up to fight the Empire State Development Corporation, which has the authority to condemn properties and pay the owners for them. 
A pair of architects who live in part of a converted factory on Dean Street have even proposed an alternate development plan that involves razing the Atlantic Center mall, a much-maligned shopping complex that Mr. Ratner built just north of the proposed arena site. (Its newest tenants include two state agencies, the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Empire State Development Corporation itself, which together pay Mr. Ratner more than 1.5 million taxpayer dollars a year in rent.)
"If Mr. Ratner were willing to condemn his own property, he would be able to build his arena without displacing anyone from their homes," said one of the architects, Karla Rothstein. "It would be an improvement on the existing mall."
She said she could not understand how the doctrine of eminent domain, which allows the state to seize blighted or underutilized land for the public good, could be applied to an area where long-vacant factories have been rapidly transformed into chic condos, or to a development that would be largely run as a private profit-makingenterprise.
As Mr. Ratner continues to line up support -- he already has Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz on his side, and is working on the governor's office -- Ms. Hagan said she felt that time was short.
All of this leaves people like Joe Pastore, a semiretired driver for the state who lives in a $400-a-month rent-stabilized studio just off Flatbush Avenue, angry and confused.
"I live at 473 Dean Street since 1967," he said. "For the government to tell me I've got to leave my home, that's not fair, you understand? This is no highway being built or no public building being built for the city or the state or the federal. 
Mr. Pastore, 59, recalled that he had watched his block evolve from a strip packed with working man's bars to a desolate eyesore and back to a thriving street.
"There's been a lot of changes here," he said. "But I never thought I'd be one of them."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO; 
Move to New Hampshire Often Brings New Tone

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Howard Dean is hardly the first Democratic presidential candidate to change his message and style between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. 
 In Iowa in 1976, for instance, Jimmy Carter was vague about where he stood on abortion in deference to that state's strong anti-abortion movement. But in New Hampshire, where Democrats tended to strongly favor abortion rights, Mr. Carter campaigned as a committed advocate of that position. 
 Mr. Carter won both states and had clear sailing to the nomination.
In 2000, Al Gore trounced Bill Bradley in Iowa after Mr. Bradley did not respond to Mr. Gore's repeated attacks on him. But Mr. Bradley took a different tack here, using his stump speeches to criticize Mr. Gore sharply, particularly his early votes in Congress to limit abortion. 
Polls showed Mr. Bradley gaining on Mr. Gore by at least one percentage point a day in the week before the primary. In the end, Mr. Bradley lost, but only barely.
It is not surprising that candidates change their tack. The economy here is different from Iowa's. There is no talk about farm subsidies, corporate meatpackers or ethanol. 
And primaries are different from caucuses. The relatively small number of people who attend the Iowa caucuses tend to be political activists. In New Hampshire, the turnout is almost always high. Independents are eligible to vote in the primaries. Younger, less partisan voters go to the polls.
"That means the candidates throw less red meat," said Linda L. Fowler, director of the Rockefeller Center for Social Sciences at Dartmouth. "Otherwise, you run the risk of alienating the independents and weak partisans." 
And particularly if a campaign seems to be flagging, it is important for the voters and the news media to think the candidate is correcting course, said Dayton Duncan, who has written a history of New Hampshire primaries.
Since Dr. Dean arrived in New Hampshire after a weak third-place finish in Iowa, he has hardly mentioned the war in Iraq, the issue that first propelled him to the top of the field, and he has tried to have dignified, issue-oriented campaign appearances, in contrast with the wild rallies that characterized his time in Iowa.
At the same time, Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, who finished first and second in Iowa, are retaining the messages that worked for them there.
Mr. Kerry is sounding more like a front-runner. Except for one oblique jab at Gen. Wesley K. Clark the other day, he has had nothing bad to say about his rivals, attacking only President Bush.
Mr. Edwards talks of two Americas, one for the haves and one for the have-nots, and he invariably sounds optimistic. His advisers say his positive presentation differentiates him from the other candidates.
General Clark and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman skipped the Iowa caucuses and have been campaigning here for weeks. What they are saying does not seem to have changed much since Monday night.
General Clark is running mainly on his military record and his foreign policy experience. 
Mr. Lieberman continues to paint himself as "the Democrat who can defeat George Bush." 
But if the other candidates are more or less sticking with familiar themes, Dr. Dean has changed his tune. On Wednesday, he talked at length about changes in the campaign finance system, an issue he rarely mentioned in Iowa.
To the extent that Dr. Dean now talks about Iraq, it is not about why he opposed the war but about his willingness to speak out when such a stand was unpopular. That is a main theme of his newest television advertisement, a low-key message that was first broadcast on Thursday. The advertisement concludes with a picture of Dr. Dean, not angry but smiling broadly.
His advisers said his emphasis on campaign finance was meant to appeal to the independents who flocked to Senator John McCain in the 2000 Republican primary here and to crystallize the notion that he was standing up to the establishment.
Andrew E. Smith, director of University of New Hampshire Survey Center, suggested another possible motive. The percentage of New Hampshire Democrats who consider themselves liberals rose to 54 percent in 2000, up from 32 percent in 1980, he said. Campaign finance overhaul, Mr. Smith said, plays well with liberals and might underscore Dr. Dean's determination to hang onto his liberal core in the hope of winning a plurality next Tuesday if the other candidates split the rest of the vote fairly evenly.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE POLITICAL CONTEST; 
On Candidates' New Stage Raucous Is Out, Civil Is In

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: GOFFSTOWN, N.H. Jan. 22 

 BODY:
The stretch between Iowa and New Hampshire is a very unforgiving time. Candidates who falter, like Howard Dean, have little time to correct course and must do so under the full glare of the media spotlight, with primary voters paying more attention than ever. 
 Candidates who soar, like Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, have a finite period to capitalize on the Iowa excitement and consolidate their gains in New Hampshire before the race moves onto a broader field. Candidates who hope to jumpstart their campaigns in New Hampshire, like Gen. Wesley K. Clark and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, must cope with the Iowa lift that other candidates received. 
 With those kinds of stakes, the debate on Thursday night was almost bound to be a careful, at times subdued, affair, a stark contrast to the last, raucous Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses.
All the candidates clearly drew the same lesson from Iowa: in a multicandidate field, those who attack may in fact wound their opponent, but benefit someone else. No one seemed eager for a reprise of the brutal exchanges that Dr. Dean and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri engaged in during the final days of Iowa, which many believe accounted for their third- and fourth-place finishes.
Mr. Lieberman burst out laughing as his questioners tried to engage him in critiques of his opponents. "I'd say, nice try," he said.
As a result of all this new-found amiability, Mr. Kerry had the happy advantage of being a leader in the polls here, but not drawing the attacks that being in that position ordinarily generates.
The debate reflected another lesson from Iowa -- the importance of electability, the perception that Democrats, more than anything, want to choose a nominee who can beat Mr. Bush and who can be viewed as presidential. Mr. Kerry said, several times, that he would relish the debate with Mr. Bush on issues from tax cuts to values.
Dr. Dean faced the most complex task when he took the stage at St. Anselm College -- rehabilitating himself after a third-place finish in Iowa and a concession speech heard well beyond the political world. He was eager to show humility, a recognition that he had veered from the expected bearing of a presidential candidate. "I am not a perfect person," he said, echoing a theme he hit on throughout the day. 
He highlighted his credentials as a budget-balancing fiscal conservative, saying he was "much more conservative on money than George Bush is." He trumpted his record as governor of Vermont. 
His advisers maintained that the Dr. Dean on view on Thursday night was the true Dr. Dean, the candidate who can deliver on the kitchen table issues that now consume the voters, like affordable health insurance.
But strategists for his rivals suggest Dr. Dean is in a strategic box. A candidate who rose to prominence as the fiery tribune of Democratic activists angry over the war with Iraq must now defuse charges that he is too hot-tempered, not presidential. That means he has the job of defending his candidacy and halting the rise of his rivals, but avoiding the attacks that hurt him in Iowa.
He has little time to make this turnaround, and the stakes are high. "Howard Dean has forged a very special relationship with the voters of New Hampshire," said one strategist for a rival campaign. "If he can rehabilitate himself anywhere, it's in New Hampshire. But the corollary is, if he can't rehabilitate himself there, he can'tanywhere."
There have been comebacks here before. Vice President George Bush rolled out of Iowa with a devastating third-place finish in 1988, only to resurrect himself eight days later with a win in the New Hampshire primary. 
And in 1992, Bill Clinton spent the days leading up to the New Hampshire primary battling back from a one-two punch of tabloid reports that he had conducted a 12-year extramarital affair and charges that he had sought to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. His comeback that year when he managed to place second came after a week of impassioned, voter-to-voter campaigning that became the stuff of legends, capped by the promise to keep "fighting until the last dog dies."
Dr. Dean clearly hopes to reprise that kind of direct appeal to the voters, over the heads of the pundits and the political class.
General Clark has also found the political ground shifting suddenly beneath his campaign. His allies had hoped that he would be the primary alternative to Dr. Dean in the aftermath of Iowa, but Mr. Kerry intervened. During the debate, General Clark found himself on the defensive on issues from abortion to his Democratic credentials.
In the end, the safest course for General Clark, and the rest of field, turned out to be focusing their fire on Mr. Bush.
"What I'm saying is President Bush must be held accountable," General Clark said. "Before 9/11, he did not do everything he could have done to keep this country safe."
And Mr. Edwards reiterated his populist critique on an administration that, he said, had come to preside over an economically divided America. There was, in short, a careful sort of unity among the Democrats gathered here Thursday night. Most of them could not afford anything less.

HEADLINE: Bid for a Brooklyn Sports Complex Faces Challenges From All Sides 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Marty Markowitz, Brooklyn's head cheerleader, was still riding a wave of euphoria, one day after the developer Bruce C. Ratner had won the bidding for the New Jersey Nets with plans to install them in a new home near downtown Brooklyn.
 "It's exciting," said Mr. Markowitz, the borough president. "It puts Brooklyn back in the big leagues." 
 But the hard questions are just beginning to emerge about the feasibility and financial viability of Mr. Ratner's proposal to build a $485 million arena designed by Frank Gehry as the centerpiece of an enormous $2.5 billion residential and commercial development. 
For example, can this project survive the kind of political minefields, environmental reviews, community opposition and lawsuits that have delayed or scuttled sports complexes elsewhere? Can Mr. Ratner and his partners counter familiar arguments that sports complexes are poor economic engines by combining the arena with housing, stores and office space? Will the developer be able to obtain private financing for the office towers? And finally, will he be able to keep down costs and minimize the need for public subsidies?
In a remarkably short time, the arena project has gained the enthusiastic support of Mr. Markowitz, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and many of Brooklyn's elected officials. This has happened even when sports complexes have become political dynamite, scaring many politicians aware of a public grown weary of subsidizing extraordinarily wealthy team owners and players.
Mr. Ratner, Mayor Bloomberg and the project's supporters say that the development will be more than a mere sports complex. The glass-walled arena, combined with four office towers and 4,500 apartments, will be a transformative project. It would establish Brooklyn as a destination again and accelerate a revival already taking place in nearby neighborhoods like Dumbo, Fort Greene and the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Experts say Mr. Ratner may have something else going for him. It is a lot easier to make a 19,000-seat arena work economically than a 78,000-seat stadium that is used only 10 times a year. Mark S. Rosentraub, a sports economist and the author of "Major League Losers: The Real Cost of Sports and Who's Paying For It," estimates that an arena needs to book about 200 events a year to make money. While the Nets have been unable to sell out at their current home at the Meadowlands, he said that Mr. Ratner and his partners should have no trouble filling the seats given that there are 6.3 million people in Brooklyn, Queens and Nassau County, a larger and wealthier market than in N.B.A. cities like Charlotte, New Orleans, Indianapolis and Cleveland.
"The numbers work," said Mr. Rosentraub, a frequent critic of public investments in sports complexes. "You'll have the best arena in the country to service a market of more than 6.3 million people."
Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp, a sports economic consulting company based in Chicago, said, "It will generate the largest naming-rights fee in the history of professional sports, because it is in New York City and the only other arena, Madison Square Garden, can't change its brand name without losing a lot of cachet."
But much about the project is unknown, including how much public money will be needed to make it work. Some officials said they expected Mr. Ratner's preliminary cost estimates to swell quickly. Mr. Ratner has tried to fashion an aerodynamic plan that he hopes will encounter little resistance from government officials or local residents.
Mr. Ratner and Mayor Bloomberg declined requests for comment yesterday, saying they were awaiting an official announcement by the current owners of the Nets. But at a Dec. 10 pep rally for the project in Brooklyn, Mr. Bloomberg made his sentiments clear: "We're prepared to team up with Forest City Ratner Companies and with elected officials and people of this borough to bring the Nets to Brooklyn."
In contrast, the Pataki administration has been more reserved, partly out of a concern that the Jets, Mets, Yankees, Rangers and Knicks also want public money for new complexes. "It's exciting," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, "but we'll see what he brings to us for final approval."
Neither the city nor the state has committed funds for Mr. Ratner's project and, one official said, they are "months away from agreeing on what they'll do for him."
The arena would sit on what is now the Long Island Rail Road's Vanderbilt storage yard. Mr. Ratner needs the railroad to move the 11 tracks crisscrossing the nine-acre site to the east.
He also needs the state to condemn four blocks to the east of the rail yard, which includes the homes of 864 people and businesses with about 200 jobs. Many of the residents have vowed to fight the project and will almost certainly file a lawsuit that could delay construction or stop it altogether. They have already formed an alliance with other community groups called United Brooklyn Coalition Against Urban Removal.
With the state in control of the land, however, Mr. Ratner would be able to avoid the city's land-use review process and build a larger and more dense project than he would under the city's zoning regulations. But he will have to complete a stringent environmental review, which could turn up problems like oil contamination in the rail yard.
Although Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Ratner have stated that the project would be built mostly with private money, the developer has asked state and city officials about doing $150 million in infrastructure work, including moving the tracks and utility lines in the area and building new streets and sewer lines.
Mr. Ratner has also proposed taking about $28 million a year in sales and income taxes generated at the arena to help pay the bonds for its construction. In addition, he is expected to seek tax-free financing for the housing, probably through the state's 80-20 program, which requires developers to set aside 20 percent of the apartments for low- and moderate-income tenants.
Councilwoman Letitia James, whose district includes the neighborhood, is a rare voice of opposition among Brooklyn politicians. She considers the project an oversized monster that will destroy a vibrant working-class neighborhood that has rebuilt itself over the past 20 years.
"This is a great day for rich developers and a sad day for working families," Ms. James said. "It will open the floodgates to public financing of sports arenas."
Harvey Robins, a former official in the Koch and Dinkins administrations, said the Ratner project is "antithetical" to building communities. "You're putting up monstrous buildings in a low-density area."
Brad Lander, director of the Center for Community and Environmental Development at the nearby Pratt Institute, somewhat sheepishly acknowledged that he was excited about a professional basketball team coming to Brooklyn. 
But he said it was disturbing that Mr. Ratner will bypass the city's land-use review process. He also feared that so many politicians had jumped on Mr. Ratner's bandwagon that it will undercut any attempt to negotiate for public benefits: earmarking housing and jobs specifically for local residents, building adequate parking and roads to offset potential traffic congestion on game nights. While there is a housing crisis in Brooklyn, he said, there is also an affordability crisis that the city should address.
"I'm excited out of hometown pride and the possibility of affordable housing and jobs," said Mr. Lander, who lives in Park Slope. "But I'm very concerned that there will not be a meaningful public process in which the developer commits to things that could make this really work for Brooklyn."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN; 
In Their Own Words: Democrats in Latest Debate

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements by the Democratic presidential candidates on Thursday at a debate in Goffstown, N.H., as recorded by The New York Times:

GEN. WESLEY K. CLARK
On terrorism
 President Bush must be held accountable. Before 9/11, he did not do everything he could have done to keep this country safe. After 9/11, he took us to a war we didn't have to fight, and Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda is still going strong. We were at terrorist condition orange. 

HOWARD DEAN
On Iraq
We had successfully contained Iraq for 12 years with no-fly zones. They had virtually no air force to speak of. It turned out they did not have the weapons of mass destruction that people thought they did, myself included. It turned out that much of what the president told us was not so. I believe that Saddam Hussein's removal from power is good. But I also believe that the way to have done it was to do it through the United Nations.

JOHN EDWARDS
On the economy
There's been no discussion about 35 million Americans who live in poverty every single day. Millions of Americans who work full time for minimum wage and live in poverty. We have, in a country of our wealth -- if you'll let me finish -- in a country of our wealth and prosperity, we have children going to bed hungry.

JOHN KERRY
On tax cuts
I am going to protect the middle class. And in the course of my career, I have voted for countless numbers of tax cuts. When I arrived in the United States Senate, the highest marginal rate was 72 percent. We took it down to 28 percent under Ronald Reagan. It then went back up somewhat. I voted for cutting the capital gains tax, I voted for tax incentives for businesses.

DENNIS J. KUCINICH
On the environment
By the year 2010, I'll call upon Americans to assist in creating a program not only of conservation, but of moving to renewable energy, away from oil, nuclear and coal and toward wind and solar and geothermal, green, hydrogen and biomass.

JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN
On Iraq
I didn't need George Bush to convince me that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the United States of America. John McCain and I wrote the law that made it national policy to change the regime in Baghdad. This man was a homicidal maniac, killed hundreds of thousands of people, did have weapons of mass destruction in the 90's, used them against the Kurdish Iraqis and the Iranians, admitted to the United Nations he had enough chemical and biological to kill millions of people, supported terrorism, tried to assassinate former President Bush. I repeat: We are safer with Saddam Hussein in prison.

THE REV. AL SHARPTON
On Iran
I think that one of the problems that we see in Iran in terms of the movement toward open elections, toward clear repression there, is something that we must be concerned about. But I do not, in any way, shape or form, support a military intervention.

HEADLINE: BRIDGE; 
New Life Master Helps Team Reach Compact Knockout Final

BYLINE:  By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
The inflation in the number of life masters since the title was created in 1936 has been astonishing, reminiscent of German currency in the 1920's. In 1937 there was one new addition to the ranks, but in 2003 there were 2,259.
 To start this year, there were seven new life masters at the Tristate Regional in Rye, N.Y., which ended Monday. One of them was Lynne Greenberg Koeppel, who reached the final of the Compact Knockout Teams with Susan Wexler, Judi Radin and Shelly Ferenbach. They eliminated a top-ranked group in the semifinal, then succumbed to a team led by Jacqui Mitchell, a 2003 inductee into the Bridge Hall of Fame. 
 The diagramed deal was not easy to analyze. Against three no-trump, Wexler led a club from the West position, and dummy's queen won. South finessed the diamond 10, losing to the king. The heart eight was returned, a slight deception, and the declarer finessed in this suit, playing the 10. Koeppel, sitting East, ducked smoothly, and South was left in the dark. He took another diamond finesse and continued the suit, establishing a winner.
East shifted to a spade, and after taking the ace, West led her remaining heart. South finessed the jack and went down to defeat. This defense was praised by the experts, but in theory it was wrong. If South judges the position correctly, he can arrive at this tricky ending after surrendering the fourth round of diamonds:
East must lead a spade, and if South plays the queen, he cannot be defeated. West does best to win and return a heart, but the declarer can win with the king and lead a spade from the dummy. East cannot prevent the dummy from taking three tricks, and South has nine.
But if East takes her heart queen at the third trick and returns a heart, the contract can be defeated. That is not easy to see.

HEADLINE: What Should a City Be? Redesigning an Ideal 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
What is the most pressing issue facing urban life? Debates over welfare, crime, arts financing and urban development have been relatively quiet of late. But when plans for the World Trade Center memorial were unveiled last week, a more fundamental tension was revealed: an unsteadiness and uncertainty about the nature of the public realm.
 Those memorial plans may even provide a perfect illustration of a fault line that has been getting more obvious after a century of efforts to understand and redesign the American city. The terrorist attacks, after all, were aimed at the city's public fabric. The mourning that followed was public mourning, binding citizens in vulnerability, anger and sadness. And the most heroic acts were those of public servants who sacrificed themselves out of public duty. 
 Yet the memorial's design is peculiarly focused not on the public but on the private and the personal. The idea of inscribing the name of every person killed echoes Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. But those engravings marked the deaths of soldiers -- a sacrifice demanded by the public in its own name. 
Here, at first, there were no plans to make distinctions between those who died in public service and the attack's other victims. The initial proposal would have even allowed private decisions about how names were to be listed. There have also been discussions about a private underground mourning area, something almost contrary to the function of a public memorial. 
Perhaps not much should be made of this seeming contradiction. After all, the memorial results from months of lobbying by various groups wishing to ensure that their interests are represented. The development of the surrounding downtown area will surely be even more riven by such debate. 
But now this kind of debate is typical of urban life. The city is a terrain wrestled over by competing private interests. The city's greatest achievement, it often seems, is the protection of the private realm and of competing private interests; about the public realm there is no clear understanding. 
This is far different from the utopian perspective enshrined by much urban planning and design of the last century, a succession of visions of an ideal public in its ideal home. In the early part of the century, the City Beautiful movement imagined an almost pastoral city where aesthetics and planning would help resolve the most grievous social problems. Another view, which fell in and out of favor, was that commerce alone could provide the engine that would eliminate crime, poverty and the slums that had developed after decades of industrialization and immigration. And finally there was the mid-century dream of urban renewal, in which federally financed housing, the destruction of slums and the careful management of zoning would end the poverty and racial tensions that had scarred the American cities of the middle decades of the century.
The failures of these movements -- and there seems to be widespread agreement that they were failures -- have led to new forms of discussion. But many of these efforts reveal new uncertainties about the nature of public life, some of them similar to the hesitations that haunt the World Trade Center memorial.
One new book, "Story and Sustainability: Planning, Practice and Possibility for American Cities" (The MIT Press), edited by Barbara Eckstein and James A. Throgmorton, argues that a successful American city should offer "stories" to its citizens that would accommodate competing claims and cultures. These could literally be narratives about city life, but they could also be figuratively embodied in buildings and designs that seem connected to a particular group's identity. As some of the book's contributors acknowledge, however, such urban "stories" do not in themselves create a wider public and in fact may do just the opposite.
In more utopian fashion, William J. Mitchell, in "Me++: The Cyborg Self and the Networked City" (The MIT Press), argues that information technology is bound to affect the landscape of the city, liberating its inhabitants, turning the city into a node within a worldwide web, creating a new kind of public. 
Mr. Mitchell, a professor of architecture at M.I.T., celebrates the populism and protest that might grow out of this connectedness, pointing, for example, to the worldwide protests against the United States's invasion of Iraq -- an outcry coordinated through the Internet and cellphones. But such networks, however geographically broad, are not necessarily broadly conceived, nor do they necessarily represent a public interest. They can even be inspired by narrow-minded concerns. 
The real consequence for the fate of the city, as the book's title implies, may be an almost privatized sense of citizenship. Each person chooses individual allegiances and alliances. There are no other claims to be answered or wider perspectives offered. No other public emerges. 
Is there a vision of the city that might offer different prospects? In Jane Jacobs's 1961 classic, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," the very texture of daily life and social interaction creates a sense of the "public." How is that sense to be cultivated today? 
In "City: Urbanism and Its End" (Yale University Press), Douglas W. Rae, a professor of political science at Yale, offers some sense of what might be possible and how difficult it might be to sustain. 
The book is an extraordinarily detailed study of New Haven, tracing the city's rise in the early part of the 20th century and its fall in the second half -- an almost archetypal tale of the American city. Mr. Rae has gone back to company payrolls, city property records and private correspondence, trying to illustrate the city's history in the movements and activities of a wide range of its citizens. Mr. Rae also has firsthand experience: he took an 18-month leave from Yale in 1990 to serve as New Haven's chief administrative officer.
Mr. Rae finds the very qualities of urbanism so often celebrated: close-knit neighborhoods of mixed populations and businesses, flourishing factories, communal and religious organizations, all of which helped create a sense of public affiliation. But that urbanism, he stresses, should not be idealized; it was accompanied by poverty and filth and social ills, and was a result of forces that cannot be replicated. 
During the second half of the 19th century, Mr. Rae points out, there were "accidents of urban creation," forces that favored high-density, centralized growth in particular locations. Among them were the rise of steam-driven manufacturing, the development of a rail system and a national marketplace, and sustained waves of immigration. But then came the disruptive centrifugal forces created by the introduction of the automobile and the AC electric grid, which ultimately helped bring urbanism to its end.
The crisis of the American cities in the 1960's and 70's is often ascribed to racial tensions. But Mr. Rae suggests that the problems were broader, that what was later called "white flight" actually began in the 1920's with the weakening of the city center. The tragedy, in his account, is that the great migration of blacks to Northern cities in the 1930's and 40's began at the very moment when the jobs and factories they were seeking were becoming less stable.
At the same time -- sometimes with the best of intentions, sometimes not -- the federal government began a series of initiatives. One was the New Deal's Home Owners Loan Corporation, which surveyed urban housing stock to guarantee loans to owners who could not otherwise obtain them. The lowest grade of housing -- and thus rated at the highest risk -- was the oldest housing in urban areas that were also losing their manufacturing base, conditions that condemned them only to further disrepair and disrepute. After the war, redevelopment demolished whole neighborhoods generally with still less success. Urbanism had come to an end.
Mr. Rae points out that since the 1980's there have been efforts to recreate urbanism in the architectural movement known as New Urbanism. As explained in "The Urban Design Handbook" (W. W. Norton) by Urban Design Associates, an architectural firm, the New Urbanism strategy is to create neighborhoods that imitate the traditional urbanism of the early 20th century. There, walking becomes more important than driving, blocks are designed for mixed use and diverse inhabitants, and emphasis is placed on public consensus. It is a form of artifice, of course, trying to recreate a world that never really existed in such a pristine, principle-driven form. It guarantees neighborhood loyalty, perhaps, but not the development of a public sensibility. 
New forms of urbanism have yet to develop. But in the meantime a clear sense of public life seems to exist only in the midst of cataclysm, and a public memorial is now fated to be saturated with private sentiments.

A federal judge said that she was generally satisfied with Microsoft's efforts to comply with the settlement terms in the government's antitrust case, after the software maker announced steps to make it easier for companies to license its technology.
 The judge's comments come a week after the Justice Department, along with 16 states and the District of Columbia, said the November 2002 decree had "fallen short" in nurturing competition in the industry. Page C14. 

Northwest Posts Operating Loss
Northwest Airlines posted a fourth-quarter profit on a gain from the initial public offering of its regional carrier, Pinnacle Airlines, but it had an operating loss without that benefit. Northwest reported net income of $363 million, or $4.18 a share, in contrast to a net loss of $488 million, or $5.68 a share, a year earlier. The airline said that huge operating losses were not sustainable and that it still needed to cut labor costs to remain competitive. C2.

Chiding America Over the North Korean Uproar

NORTH KOREA
Another Country
By Bruce Cumings
241 pages. New Press. $24.95.
 Communism collapsed. Well, not exactly. Not in Cuba and not across Asia. It did give way in Mongolia and Afghanistan, both Soviet satellites, but indigenous Communist regimes persist in China, Vietnam and North Korea. In the American imagination though, Pyongyang stands apart. 
 Kim Jong Il's neighbors cannot ignore his saber-rattling and refugees, but Japan, China, Russia and especially South Korea have not seemed overly panicked. So what's the fuss in the United States? Could North Korea's alleged nukes and misfiring missiles really menace the American homeland? As for Pyongyang's possible proliferation, why not help reinvigorate the International Atomic Energy Agency? Must the United States police the planet? And must all countries come to resemble the American system? Why not let those in the neighborhood confront or engage the addled workers' paradise?
North Korea, insists Bruce Cumings, is indeed an American concern -- a stance he shares with his bete noire, axis-of-evil antagonists. But whereas hawks urge a toppling, he writes of the North Koreans that "it is their country, for better or worse -- another country." And yet, he contends in six timely essays (some familiar from his many expert books), the United States contributed mightily to the North Korean predicament and Americans should acknowledge this forgotten responsibility and negotiate a permanent peace. A benevolent hegemon? Such paradoxes twist the book into a double helix of top scholarship and over-the-top commentary.
In some of this compact volume's most effective passages, Mr. Cumings quotes prominent American journalists on the showdown with North Korea -- C.I.A. estimates of one or two bombs, doomsday alarms to act now -- before he reveals that the quotations come from 1991-94. Today's hullabaloo is a rerun. He counters the hype with an instructive history.
One chapter documents the roots of the North Korean revolution in the 1930's anti-Japanese guerrilla war in Manchuria, which more than Soviet tanks brought Kim Il Sung and his cohort to power. Another examines the dynastic succession of his son, Kim Jong Il, who works at home in his pajamas, like an information economy habitue, but in public sports polyester leisure suits, pointy-toed elevator shoes and oversize sunglasses of malevolent tint, like a throwback idol. Meanwhile, his illegitimate son craves a Ferrari and his adopted daughter scorns Communism's tedium for Switzerland's high life -- hints of elite defection.
These insights are served up with liberal doses of anti-American-imperialism castor oil and North Korean sugar tablets. "On my infrequent visits to the country," Mr. Cumings writes, "I have been happy," adding that "empathy for the underdog is something I can't help, being a life-long fan of the Cleveland Indians."
Penal colonies hold 100,000 to 150,000 people, over half of them political prisoners, Mr. Cumings reports. But he deems the gulag both smaller than usually asserted and survivable, partly because detainees' families are incarcerated with them. Free adults face military induction for eight-year terms, the first six without home leave. It's a garrison state (7 million of its 23 million people are in the army or reserves), but he points out that conscripts labor in construction or agricultural brigades. A multiyear famine continues to starve and kill. What holds it together?
Politically, North Korea "is not a nice place, but it is an understandable place," Mr. Cumings writes, "an anticolonial and anti-imperial state growing out of a half century of Japanese colonial rule and another half century of continuous confrontation with a hegemonic United States and a more powerful South Korea." In other words, the country's staying power as well as its "deformations" (the author's euphemism) supposedly emanate not from Communist ideology and censorship but from its historical crucible, especially the holocaust, as he puts it, that the North underwent during the Korean War.
In 1950 "Koreans invaded Korea," Mr. Cumings writes. "What do we make of that?" What he makes of it is that in 1945, by designating the 38th parallel to demarcate American and Soviet occupation zones, the United States was inviting a war. Thus, he suggests that it was not Kim Il Sung or Stalin who incited hostilities but Dean Acheson and Harry S. Truman.
Still, he comes close to endorsing the 1951 ejection of the invading North from South Korea by arguing that the proper response was not a bloody rollback to the Chinese border but a job-done halt at the 38th parallel, which is where matters wound up in 1953 anyway. In the interim, he writes, the United States blanketed civilians with napalm. Three million North Koreans, one million South Koreans, nearly one million Chinese and around 50,000 Americans died. "This was Korea, 'the limited war,' " Mr. Cumings writes with fury. American-led forces moonscaped industrial Northern and Central Korea, leaving snowy emptiness and a determined nation that survived in caves.
Mr. Cumings damns the Bush administration -- "the greater evil" -- for refusing the pleas of this "shrewd" despotic regime to lift it out of its post-Soviet soup and protect it from being swallowed up by the South.
He salutes South Korea's Sunshine Policy because like detente it embraces coexistence and evolutionary change. Yet of the reforms under way in North Korea, Mr. Cumings skeptically points out that the bureaucracy divides into incommunicative fiefs while the dominant military reveres and profits from the status quo. Perhaps the biggest obstacle is the pride of elites stuck on the memory of how, until the 1970's, the North outperformed the South. Trapped in a time warp, the system awaits an inescapable generational change.
Timeworn predictions of collapse and verbal threats of regime change notwithstanding, North Korea endures. One native Communism, Cambodia's Khmer Rouge, was overthrown from without by Communist Vietnam. Homegrown revolutions were cashiered from within in the two ethnoterritorial federations, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the latter cataclysmically. Even where Communism cracked itself up, however, it left behind gigantic shards, like obsolete factories and the K.G.B. China's managed changeover is already a quarter century old. The end of Communism is a protracted process.

HEADLINE: India's Lofty Ambitions in Space Meet Earthly Realities 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon, 40 college engineering students, an all-male menagerie of sweaty palms, thick eyeglasses and short-sleeve button-down shirts, emerged from a tour of India's satellite manufacturing plant in the technology boom city of Bangalore. To a man, they burst with ambition, vision and confidence.
 All expressed the same hope: to work for India's prestigious national space program. And all dismissed a simple question: why should a country with as many poor as India spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a space program when it could use satellites from Europe or the United States? 
 "We will not depend on others," declared Raj Shecker, 21, an engineering student. "It's just an Indian feeling." 
Forty years after the launching of a small American-made rocket marked its humble beginnings, India's national space program bills itself as thrifty space exploration for the common man.
With a budget of only $450 million a year -- one-thirtieth of NASA's $15.5 billion annual budget -- India has 13 satellites in orbit, produces some of the world's best remote imaging satellites and is planning to send a satellite to the moon by 2007 or 2008.
But unlike space programs in other developing countries, including Brazil, low costs have not meant catastrophic launching failures. Only 6 of India's 37 satellite launchings have failed.
This month the national newsmagazine The Week ran a grandiloquent cover story that captured the country's infatuation with its space program and its self-image as an emerging power.
"Every space power is trying to develop launch vehicles and spacecraft to colonize the moon," the article declared. "India, too, is racing ahead."
Less than a week after China became the third country to put man in space last October, India launched a satellite into orbit and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared India a world leader in "applying space technologies to development."
In Bangalore, the headquarters of the space effort, offices brim with optimism reminiscent of NASA during its golden age in the 1960's, as Indian engineers breathlessly describe how they use space technology to improve the lives of tens of millions of average Indians.
Satellites reclaim farmland, they say, bring medical care to remote villages, predict natural disasters and help planners control the country's explosive urban growth.
"Our program is entirely oriented toward applications for the national development," said Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian program, formally named the Indian Space Research Organization. "Water management, satellite television, phone links, telemedicine."
One of the clearest examples of how the program benefits average Indians is in the village of Majhgawan Karan, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Using satellite imagery, technicians have helped 175 villagers reclaim 40 acres of barren land in an area long haunted by hunger.
Alok Mathur, a project manager at the Remote Sensing Application Center of Uttar Pradesh, said farmland could be reclaimed by simply pouring gypsum on it. He said the gypsum set off a chemical reaction in the soil, which had too much sodium in it. Barren farmland is transformed into rich farmland, and the lives of subsistence farmers are changed.
Mata Prasad, a young Dalit, or untouchable, one of India's outcastes, stood beside his tiny but verdant one-acre plot of wheat and rice. He was pleased. For years the land was barren, he said, and his family's primary concern was getting enough to eat. Not any more.
"Earlier, I used to worry about food," Mr. Prasad said. "Now I worry about the education of my children."
Forty miles to the northeast lies another example of the space program's benefits. Doctors in the basement of the main public hospital in the city of Lucknow, the state capital, chatted over a live satellite link with doctors in rural hospitals hundreds of miles away.
Dr. S. K. Mishra proudly explained how he and his staff examine dozens of patients a day in remote corners of India via satellite. Color monitors allow face-to-face conversations with patients. Test results, X-rays and echocardiograms from the rural hospitals are all transmitted instantly to Lucknow.
But even these showcase projects have their limitations. Space officials estimate that the farming project has helped 500,000 farmers reclaim 667,000 acres of farmland in 3,100 villages. In Uttar Pradesh, a state of 160 million people, that is a drop in the bucket.
Doctors said that being able to offer a diagnosis by satellite had helped tens of thousands of people. But they conceded that it would be far too expensive to equip India's hundreds of thousands of rural hospitals with satellite dishes. They predicted that in the end, cheap Internet access in rural areas, not expensive satellites, would revolutionize communications between hospitals.
"For technology to be used by everyone it has to be cost-effective," said one doctor. "Not every small hospital can have a satellite."
The euphoria over the space program is by no means universal.
In the last five years, Indian rockets have successfully launched two German, one South Korean and one Belgian satellite in orbit. But with the commercial space market flooded with heavy lift rockets from the United States, Europe and particularly Russia, the Indian program, whose rockets remain smaller, has not attracted droves of customers and has not proved the moneymaker originally promised.
And privately, Indian officials concede that they remain dependent on foreign components. While India's satellites are assembled in India, a majority of electronic components for India's satellites continue to come from the United States, Europe and elsewhere, they said.
Some Indian space analysts say the moon probe, which is expected to cost $84 million, is the first sign that the space program is moving away from its practical roots and becoming politicized. Reports in recent months of plans for expensive manned missions have only deepened concern.
Despite an economy that is expected to grow by 8 percent this year, India is home to the world's largest concentration of poor. Three hundred million of India's one billion people live in poverty.
Gopal Raj, a journalist and the author of a history of the Indian space program, "Reach for the Stars," questioned the scientific value of the moon probe. The satellite will spend two years making a three-dimensional map of the moon's surface and surveying its soil for minerals.
"Frankly, I think this has more to do with prestige than anything," Mr. Raj said. "I am not convinced about anything else."
American space experts warn of problems as well. They accuse Indian managers of not spending the money they should on projects and leaving unnecessary debris in space.
There are also questions about whether India is planning to mount a military effort in space. After China launched a man into orbit last fall, the head of the Indian Air Force was quoted as saying that India was developing space-based weapons. Within days the country's civilian leaders forced him to retract the statement.
For many years, in fact, the United States viewed the Indian program as a proliferation and security risk, despite its civilian oversight. Remote sensing satellites that can track erosion and crop yields can also act as spy satellites.
Indians vehemently deny the charge, but American analysts say rocket technology produced by the civilian space program, as well as some of its top engineers, have ended up in the military's ballistic missile program. They include even the country's president, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.
"A space program and a missile program tend to go hand in hand," Theresa Hitchens, vice president of the Center for Defense Information in Washington, said in a telephone interview. "The technologies are the same. A rocket is a rocket is a rocket."
Those concerns appear to have eased of late. In early January the Bush administration announced that it would lift a ban on the export of some civilian space technology to India. Indian space officials said they did not know exactly what bans would be lifted and did not know the full significance of the move.
As a result of the sanctions, and an urge for independence after 300 years of British colonial rule, Indian space officials have furiously worked to make sure their program does not rely on foreign technology. In many ways they have succeeded.
In 1992 the United States pressed Russia not to give India the technology for a cryogenic rocket. Two weeks ago, on Jan. 10, Indian engineers announced that they had successfully tested an Indian-built cryogenic engine.
Pride in that kind of independence and initiative is shared by many, including the prospective young engineers who visited the satellite plant. "It's a benefit for ourselves," said Srinath Hanaji, a 21-year-old engineering student. "We will not depend on others."
This is the last of three articles on the expanding space race in the developing world. Earlier articles examined China's rising challenge to the United States and a setback for Brazil.

PERSON: Bob Keeshan 

HEADLINE: Bob Keeshan, Creator and Star of TV's 'Captain Kangaroo,' Is Dead at 76 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
Bob Keeshan, who delighted millions of children and their parents for three decades as television's gentle, patient Captain Kangaroo and before that as the original Clarabell the Clown on the old "Howdy Doody Show," died yesterday in Vermont, his family said in a statement to The Associated Press. He was 76. 
 No cause of death was announced, but he had had heart problems since the 1980's. 
 Captain Kangaroo, a round-faced, pleasant, mustachioed man possessed of an unshakable calm, was both unique and welcome when his show had its premiere, on Oct. 3, 1955. 
"Not only does it keep little ones occupied, but it also does so without being noisy," wrote John P. Shanley when he reviewed the show in The New York Times. He praised "Captain Kangaroo" as "civilized and absorbing fun" and ventured that parents were finding their weekday mornings "more bearable because of the delightful artistry of a television performer named Bob Keeshan." 
Mr. Shanley wrote that the show charmed the toddlers. That charm never faded: Captain Kangaroo was one of the most enduring characters television ever produced. The program's roster also included Hugh Lumpy Brannum, who had been a successful string bass player in jazz bands and in the Fred Waring orchestra but who really came into his own as Mr. Green Jeans, a man who loved nature and got children to understand and respect it; Cosmo Gus Allegretti, who gave life to animal characters like Mr. Moose, Bunny Rabbit and Dancing Bear, as well as the Magic Drawing Board and Grandfather Clock; character actors like Debbie Weems and Carolyn Mignini; Ruth Manecke, an expert on animal behavior who coached the cast; and the puppeteer Kevin Clash.
They were all part of the family that was an unrivaled success on the CBS television network for nearly 30 years, a success later paralleled on public television by Fred Rogers, of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," who died last year. But the show always revolved around Mr. Keeshan, who began to call himself Captain Kangaroo after someone fashioned an outsized jacket for him, a preposterous affair with pockets rivaling kangaroos' pouches. 
For much of its run, the show was on the air six days a week for an hour starting at 8 a.m. It always drew a large audience, even though from Monday to Friday it ran opposite NBC's popular "Today" program. "Today" had a loyal following among adults, but the kids knew it didn't have Tom Terrific, Mighty Manfred the Wonder Dog, the Banana Man and all the other characters Mr. Keeshan offered. 
Unlike his old boss, Buffalo Bob Smith of "The Howdy Doody Show," Mr. Keeshan never played to a studio audience. There might have been a few children in the studio from time to time, but Mr. Keeshan told his director, Peter Birch, that he primarily wanted to talk to the child at home, one on one. 
"The children should never be excluded from what I am doing and should never have the feeling of being part of an audience," he told Birch.
Asked on one occasion by Richard F. Shepard of The Times whether, given his success with children, he would fancy a future in adult television, Mr. Keeshan replied, "Not for me," explaining, "Just as actors are afraid of child audiences, because they're so honest, I would be scared stiff of going before the big folks."
And so for more than 9,000 performances, Mr. Keeshan stuck with children. When they grew up and had kids of their own, the new kids became Captain Kangaroo fans, too. And more often than not, the parents who had been kids watched the captain with the new generation.
Mr. Keeshan never pretended to have any secret formula for dealing with children, except that he never patronized them and always assumed they were bright and would appreciate him and what he was doing. And so they listened when he talked about taking care not to cross the street without looking and why it was important to respect animals as well as playmates. He ran cartoons like "Tom Terrific," but he also featured children's classics, like "Curious George," showing the turning pages of an actual book as he read. 
"We have respect for our audience," he told Steven V. Roberts in The New York Times in 1965. "We operate on the conviction that it is composed of young children of potentially good taste, and that this taste should be developed."
He emphasized over the years that he disapproved of parents who used television as a baby sitter with a result that they really didn't talk very much with their children. Nothing could take the place of conversation, he insisted.
"Back in the old days, when I was a child, we sat around the family table at dinner time and exchanged our daily experiences," he wrote in The Times in 1979 under the byline Captain Kangaroo. "It wasn't very organized, but everyone was recognized and all the news that had to be told was told by each family member. We listened to each other and the interest was not put on; it was real."
"A child needs to be listened to and talked to at 3 and 4 and 5 years of age," he continued. "Parents should not wait for the sophisticated conversation of a teenager."
Robert J. Keeshan was born on June 27, 1927 in Lynbrook, N.Y., on Long Island, the son of Joseph Keeshan, a manager for the local Daniel Reeves grocery store chain, and the former Margaret Conroy, a homemaker. They were Irish on both sides of the family and Bob Keeshan always remained close to his roots.
When he was quite young and the Reeves chain was acquired by Safeway, his father lost his job and the family was forced to move into a more modest house in Forest Hills, Queens. 
In school, Mr. Keeshan became interested in radio and began to produce plays broadcast over the school's loudspeaker system. In 1943, his mother died of a heart attack. 
The next year, asa high school senior, he succeeded in getting a coveted $13.50-a-week night job as a page at NBC Studios in Rockefeller Center, seating audiences for popular radio shows. 
In 1945, as he completed high school, he enlisted in the Marines, but the war ended before he could be sent into combat. It was just as well. "I was the least aggressive Marine in the history of the Marine Corps," Mr. Keeshan later told Lawrence Laurent of The Washington Post.
In 1946, returning to his old job at NBC, he enrolled at Fordham and thought he might become a lawyer.
NBC assigned him to the fourth floor receptionist's desk, next to the tiny office then occupied by Buffalo Bob Smith, who had only recently come to New York City from upstate and had an early-morning radio show on WEAF, NBC's flagship station in New York. For a few extra dollars, Mr. Keeshan helped on research. 
Smith then got a Saturday children's morning show and Mr. Keeshan soon found himself seating the children in the studio audience and handing out prizes.
By 1947, Buffalo Bob Smith was the star of a new afternoon show with a puppet that eventually became famous as Howdy Doody. Smith asked Mr. Keeshan if he'd be willing to dress up as a clown on what was quickly becoming "The Howdy Doody Show." Mr. Keeshan made his acting debut on Jan. 3, 1948 as Clarabell, a clown who said nary a word but who jumped around the stage a lot and, to the delight of the members of the Peanut Gallery, frequently sprayed Smith in the nose with his seltzer bottle.
Finally, NBC gave Mr. Keeshan a raise to $35 a week, more than twice what he had been receiving as a fourth floor receptionist. 
By 1950, "Howdy Doody" was a big attraction on afternoon television and Mr. Keeshan was quite happy as Clarabell. But a misunderstanding developed when Smith came to believe that he and other actors were trying to form some sort of union. Mr. Keeshan was fired and Clarabell was taken over by another actor.
He was unemployed for months, but then ABC called him and asked him if he would become Corny the Clown on an afternoon children's program called "Time for Fun." There he was not silent, but talked to the audience of children about all kinds of things. They loved him and he loved them; he was on the show for two years.
In 1954, he appeared on the ABC show "Tinker's Workshop," and within a year CBS offered him a children's show. That was the beginning of "Captain Kangaroo."
To play Captain Kangaroo, Mr. Keeshan had to catch the 4:20 a.m. train from Babylon, on Long Island, to be at CBS by 6. He lived in constant fear of oversleeping and employed three alarm clocks plus a phone service. He never missed a broadcast. 
In the beginning, he would do "Captain Kangaroo" live twice a day, an 8 a.m. broadcast for the East Coast and then, after a break of less than a minute, a repeat of the whole show for the Midwest.
Over the years, the show changed time slots and had some changes in tone and format; the captain's nautical coat was even "modernized" into a red blazer. The show ended in late 1984, after a run just nine months short of 30 years. He said that CBS had eased him out so it could expand the time allotted to its news division in the morning. 
Captain Kangaroo shows ran in modified versions and as specials on CBS, and later on public television for six more years, but he was no longer the morning staple for millions. Mr. Keeshan later sold the rights to the character he created.
Mr. Keeshan also found time, over the years, to devote himself to civic causes on Long Island. He was a member of the board of education of West Islip from 1953 to 1958. When he was elected, one distraught resident was heard to exclaim, "My God, look what they've done -- they've elected a clown to the school board!" He often said his service on the board brought him some of his most satisfying experiences.
He also wrote. Among his books were "Growing Up Happy," (1989), a semi-autobiographical work in which he also spelled out his feelings about child rearing; "Good Morning, Captain: 50 Wonderful Years With Bob Keeshan, TV's Captain Kangaroo" (1996), a picture book filled with his reminiscences, and "She Loves Me . . . She Loves Me Not" (1963), a book for young people. 
He made recordings for both Golden Records and Columbia Records, in which he introduced children to all kinds of music.
Mr. Keeshan married the former Anne Jeanne Laurie in 1950; she died in 1990. He is survived by their three children, Derek, Laurie and Maeve Jeanne, and by six grandchildren.
Asked on one occasion how he could star in his own show, engage in lecturing, volunteer, study French and still spend time with his family and his hobbies of photography, fishing and sailing, Mr. Keeshan replied, "One of the big secrets of finding time is not to watch television."

HEADLINE: Anti-Americanism May Be Fading, but Forum Is No Love Fest 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
At a lunch on Friday, part of the World Economic Forum here, speakers were invited to answer a simple question: what advice would they give the next president of the United States?
 "Listen to others," said Thierry de Montbrial, head of a French policy research institute. Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty International, said: "Look around the world. And remember the impact of your power." 
 These two remarks evoked some of the profound mistrust of Washington in Europe and many other places, and the sense of impotence against American might that was conjured up by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the campaign against terrorism.
But there was another voice, suggesting that compared with one year ago, when the forum became a bitter joust between America and opponents of war in Iraq, some of those skeptics and foes have begun to acquiesce in Washington's exercise of power, or at least to acknowledge that this new world order would not simply be wished away.
"It's a lot more comfortable this year," said Representative Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, who spoke at the same lunch. "There's a better environment for a better dialogue." 
The shift is partly atmospheric and partly fatigue, and does not hide the chasm that opened before the invasion of Iraq.
"Last year it was the United States that was in the dock, not Saddam Hussein," said Rabbi Arthur Schneier, head of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation and a participant in the forum, a gathering predominantly of the business and political elite. This year, Rabbi Schneier said, there are "reduced decibels, a less belligerent anti-American mood."
But even now, many critics of the United States say that while some of the rawest emotions may have dissipated, many basic perceptions of the Bush administration as brusquely disregarding the rest of the world remain, albeit in a muted way.
"We may be getting used to the idea" of America's exclusive hold on global power, said Nabil Shaath, the foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority. "But that doesn't mean we change our views."
Mr. Shaath's appeal to the next American president was for a quick effort to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Indeed, it is the collapse of the administration's latest Middle East peace proposal last year that seems to have left many from that region as distressed with Washington as they were over the war in Iraq. 
"Why are we assuming that there's less anti-American feeling?" asked Samer Majali, a high-ranking Jordanian executive. "If anything, there is more," because of continued upheaval in Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate.
In Europe, too, Mr. Monbrial suggested, many still feel that Washington not only exercises power unilaterally, but wields it inconsistently in areas like human rights. "Try to have a more positive attitude vis-a-vis international law," he counseled. "Try to learn to and expect to have respect for others."
But in the corridors and lounges of the Congress Center, there was a sense among some that opposition to the perceived American juggernaut had given way to other calculations, suggesting that beyond the forum, people had begun to adjust to the realities of American power. In the business world, said Bjorn Edlund, head of corporate communications for ABB Ltd., the Swiss-based engineering giant, "they understand that there's a way to maneuver through the monopolar world."
Of course, during last year's conference, the United States and Britain had not yet invaded Iraq and both countries had embarked on a campaign to broaden their coalition against Saddam Hussein. 
"Last year they were bidding for moral authority," said Andrew Williams, a British investor. This year, he said, "I don't think the United States comes across with any sense of moral authority."
Conversely, the relative speed of the formal military victory in Iraq, the capture of Mr. Hussein and the effort to transfer power to Iraqis has given some Americans a sense that they are in a stronger position to put forward a case that, as Attorney General John Ashcroft said on Friday: "The United States is not an aggressor. It doesn't seek to consume territory or build empires." 
Against that, Kamal Kharrazi, the Iranian foreign minister, declared at a separate session: "As long as the message is, 'You are either with us or against us,' there will not be a solution to global problems. We need to talk to each other, work together on security and not use axis-of-evil threats." 
Mr. Kharrazi also said Iran would put a dozen jailed Qaeda suspects on trial, Reuters reported, the first such announcement by Iran. Washington immediately opposed this plan, demanding instead that the captives be handed over to their countries of origin.
Still, said Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior envoy at the State Department, "the talk of a crisis in trans-Atlantic relations is more muted; it's the most low-key Davos in five years."

HEADLINE: A Year of Worry for Cambodia's Garment Makers 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia 

 BODY:
Clothing manufacturers here dread New Year's Day 2005. That will be the first day they have to compete with China, no holds barred, to supply their most important market, the United States. 
 A decades-old system of American textile import quotas is due to expire at the end of 2004 -- a system that capped China's share of the market and effectively assured manufacturers in smaller nations that they would receive some American orders. 
 Now, American trade officials are warning that of the 50 nations exporting clothing to the United States, perhaps only 10 may be able to withstand untrammeled competition from China, with its almost limitless supply of cheap labor and its capacity for high-volume production. And Cambodia, they say, might not be one of them. 
 At factories clustered in a new industrial zone on the south side of this capital city, manufacturers acknowledge that they will not be able to beat China on price. Production costs here, though much lower than in North America, are nonetheless about 25 percent higher than in China, the manufacturers say, citing a host of reasons: electricity costs are three times those in neighboring Thailand or Vietnam; it takes 18 days for a freight container to wend its way here from the country'sonly major seaport at Sihanoukville, 115 miles away; and monitors sent by Nike, the Gap and the International Labor Organization are always breathing down their necks, the garment manufacturers say, insisting that workers receive overtime pay, bathroom breaks and union representation.
 But in the scramble to find shelter from the Chinese storm, this year's liability may be next year's asset. Gambling on the social consciousness of American and European consumers, Cambodian garment makers say they believe they can carve out a role as Asia's labor-friendly producer.
"We are looking at a niche market," said Ray Chew, secretary general of the Garment Manufacturers' Association in Cambodia. "We are trying to create a niche that builds on Cambodia as a safe producer -- that this garment is made in a country that respects labor rights."
 Cambodia's clothing manufacturers have been operating since 1999 under an inspection program directed by the International Labor Organization. to be eligible to ship goods to the United States -- the destination for about two-thirds of Cambodia's clothing exports -- a factory must participate in a working-conditions improvement program devised by the organization, a United Nations affiliate. To reward its progress under the program, the United States has given Cambodia a larger quota and lower tariffs. 
 As a result, Cambodia's clothing industry has mushroomed. Production for export has quadrupled, to $1.5 billion, over the last five years. In 2003, exports rose 11 percent, helping the nation's economy as a whole to grow about 5 percent.
Employment at Cambodia's 200-odd garment manufacturers has tripled since 1999, to 235,000 workers -- almost all of them women -- whose earnings help support one-tenth of the nation's 13 million people.
 "We are all worried" about China, said Tep Rany, a 21-year-old seamstress who was relaxing at home on Jan. 7, a national holiday commemorating the 1979 expulsion of the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh. Speaking under the shade of a plastic tarpaulin outside her house, she said that she and her sister Sophal, 20, each earned $55 a month making clothes, helping to support their family of 12. Her father, she said, made only $10 to 20 a month as an electrician.
 If the garment factories lose to Chinese rivals, women from rural districts can fall back on field work. But for urban women, the only employment alternative may be as a bar hostess or prostitute.
 "Working in the factory is much, much better than working in a karaoke bar or a nightclub," Miss Tep said. "In the factory, we have prestige. We make more money."
 China already looms large in Phnom Penh. Signs using Chinese characters have largely replaced those using French, the former colonial tongue, as the ones most often seen in the garment district (after those in Khmer and English). Many of the investors whose capital built the industry came from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Cambodia's own ethnic Chinese minority of about 300,000 people. Now, though, China has new connotations for many workers: a threatened flood of cheap goods. 
 "Competing with China would bring a lot of problems, because Cambodia is a small country with a small population," said Long Sareth, a neighbor of the Teps whose daughters work in garment factories. "You can see products from China sold here that are cheaper than products from our own region."
 Nations far from Asia are also feeling the heat. In Mexico, Chinese imports have been blamed for a loss of 200,000 jobs in apparel and other industries since 2001. In 2003, the United Statesbought more goods from China than from Mexico for the first time.
 Seamstresses interviewed here said that they wanted the United States to go on giving preferential market access to Cambodian goods. While that is unlikely to happen, the United States has reserved the right to extend some restrictions on apparel imports from China through 2008. Last November, under pressure from domestic textile manufacturers, the Bush administration said it was considering the imposition of new quotas on Chinese dressing gowns, brassieres and knitted fabrics. Now, European manufacturers are pressing the European Union to take similar steps. 
 Even without trade preferences, Cambodia may be able to keep some garment work simply because it is not China. "We have always tried to spread our sourcing across the globe," said Alan Marks, a spokesman for Gap, which has its clothes produced in about 50 countries. Gap is by far the Cambodian industry's largest customer, taking about 40 percent of its exports, mainly for the Banana Republic and Old Navy brands. In a telephone interview from San Francisco, Mr. Marks stressed the need for diversity of sources to cope with unexpected problems, citing the outbreak of SARS in southeastern China last spring as an example.
 "With a diversified global sourcing bases, we can easily shift production and not disrupt our supply chain," Mr. Marks said. Though Gap gets one-sixth of its clothes from China, he said, "Cambodia has been an important market for us, and in the near term will continue to be."
 As for developing labor friendliness as a competitive advantage, the consensus here is that factory conditions have improved under the International Labor Organization inspection program. 
 "In the last three years, it has gotten a little better," said Chea Vichea, president of the Free Trade Union of Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia, an umbrella labor group with links to the opposition Sam Rainsy Party. "We are better than Vietnam and China -- we have the right to strike, to negotiate with employers. In Vietnam and China, there are no free trade unions."
 One of the most important improvements in Cambodia, Mr. Chea said, was the organization of an arbitration council, which has managed to broker settlements of a number of disputes that might otherwise have led to wildcat strikes and stone-throwing clashes with police, much like the incident that led to 2 deaths and 26 injuries last June. 
 On Jan. 22, a few days after this interview, a gunman walked up to Mr. Chea as he was reading a newspaper and shot him three times in the chest, killing him. His death, presumed to be connected to his union work, is expected to cloud Cambodia's efforts to market itself as labor friendly. 
 A rival labor group, the pro-government Cambodian Union Federation, has also hailed the mediation efforts. "The arbitration panel has played a good role; they do their job, not like a normal court," said Chuon Mom Thol, the president of the federation, alluding to the widespread corruption in the country's judicial system. "Compared with two years ago, there have been very, very few strikes" this year, he said.
 Under the inspection program, 11 field monitors -- Cambodians working for the International Labor Organization -- visit factories regularly to check on labor-law violations. Every four months, the team compiles and publishes a report, which is also available online. The program's $750,000 annual budget is financed by the Garment Manufacturers Association and by grants from the governments of the United States and Cambodia.
 Accordingto the most recent report, monitors found no forced labor, child labor or discrimination problems at 61 factories they visited. But overtime work was not always voluntary, the report said, and many factories kept poor payroll records, failed to make clear to workers how their pay was calculated, and often paid them incorrect amounts, in some cases using slips written in a language they could not read. 
 In general, though, conditions are improving, said Lejo Sibbel, the director of the inspection program. 
 Still, Mr. Sibbel stressed that his program could not provide what Cambodians wanted most: a seal of approval for their labor practices. "The I.L.O. is not in the business of certifying countries or factories," he said. "We do not say if it is good or bad."
 So the government is seeking validation elsewhere, perhaps on the model of the privately run certification programs for "fair trade" coffee, "dolphin safe" tuna or "sustainably harvested" hardwood lumber.
 "We need to find an inspection company acceptable to the buyers, that all the players can trust," Cham Prasidh, the commerce minister, said in an interview. "We need a green label, something like 'Cambodia: Free of Sweatshops."'
 But Ineke Zeldenrust, the international coordinator for the Clean Clothes Campaign, a European advocacy group that aims to improve working conditions in the garment industry, said that was premature.
 "Labeling is the final stage of an ethical program," she said in a telephone interview from the Netherlands. "You have to make sure standards are O.K., and there is compliance -- only then can you start labeling. If Cambodians were to come up with a label now, we would ask, How credible is this?"

HEADLINE: Battle Is Looming Over Cotton Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
An international court case in Geneva could force a resolution of the global battle over agricultural subsidies, which has pitted rich nations against poorer ones for decades.
 The case comes as anger in the Third World over the $300 billion in annual farm subsidies provided by the United States, European countries and other wealthy nations has blocked progress on regional and global trade negotiations over the last year. 
 Brazil now has the first case challenging these subsidies before the World Trade Organization, accusing the United States of breaking trade rules by giving American cotton growers and agribusinesses $1.54 billion in annual subsidies. 
 American cotton growers -- the world's largest cotton exporters -- say the case threatens their livelihood and the entire American farm subsidy system. The Brazilians say that the overproduction caused by American subsidies is destroying their export markets and undermining the livelihoods of their farmers. 
 To the consternation of the administration and the American cotton industry, Brazil has relied almost exclusively on data from the United States Agriculture Department and American agricultural experts to make its case.
 This week, in a sign that the United States has grown weary of Brazil's tactics, the administration refused to turn over documents that could bolster its own defense, saying the information would compromise the identity of farmers who receive the money. 
 Experts on the relatively new W.T.O. dispute settlement system said that refusing to give the information could look suspicious to the three members of the panel hearing the case and bolster the chances of a ruling against the United States. But with so little precedent in this eight-year-old global legal arena, experts are watching the case carefully, anxious about the precedents it will set.
 "This is a groundbreaking case -- a whole new area -- and a tough case for the United States," said Claude E. Barfield, director of trade studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a trade adviser during the Reagan administration. "Even though I am very much opposed to the existing farm subsidies of the United States and Europe, I worry about the potential here for a substantial backlash. This is a highly political and volatile issue."
 A decision in the case is expected in early spring.
 In closed hearings, Brazil has aggressively asserted that the United States has broken trade rules by using cotton subsidies to grab a larger share of the export market and pushing down world cotton prices, according to documents submitted by both countries.
 In moving its battle to the courtroom, Brazil knew that it was raising the stakes. Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, sent letters this month to more than 100 trade ministers saying he wanted to revive global trade talks that would require progress on these agriculture issues. But a ruling in this case could upset those talks.
 "You have to understand we are fed up with these farm subsidies and hearing for 25 years that things will get better," said Aluisio G. de Lima-Campos, an economic adviser at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington. "The only way to deal with it is to turn this into a make-it-or-break-it proposition."
 Brazil, along with China, India, South Africa and a dozen other developing nations, altered the global trading balance last year when they banded together at trade talks in Cancun, Mexico, as a bloc determined to reduce rich-nation farm subsidies. They argued that the subsidies not only hurt their exports but also ruined the livelihoods of their poorer peasants and farmers, creating huge social and political problems in addition to the economic ones.
 The United States has defended its cotton subsidies, which have helped make it the world's top cotton exporter with more than 40 percent of the world market. Officials argued that Brazilian cotton consistently undercut the price of United States cotton in export markets and that even without the subsidies, American farmers would grow the same amount of cotton and that world prices would be unaffected.
 Administration lawyers also said in their submissions that they had kept subsidies at levels determined in earlier agreements and were thereby protected by a "peace clause" that prohibits challenges of the fairness of farm subsidies at the W.T.O. 
 "Our cotton program complies with our W.T.O. obligations," said Richard Mills, the spokesman for the trade representative.
 The United States cotton industry is more fearful and describes the case as the "center of the storm" threatening its livelihood and the entire American farm subsidy system.
 "If this panel finds against the United States, it may force radical revisions in U.S. commodity programs," said William A. Gillon, legal counsel to the National Cotton Council, a trade group.
 Mr. Gillon and the administration were especially critical of the work of Daniel A. Sumner, professor of agricultural economics at the University of California at Davis and the former assistant secretary of economics at the Agriculture Department during the first Bush administration.
 Hired as a consultant by Brazil, Mr. Sumner created an economic model showing that American cotton subsidies did lead United States farmers to plant more cotton, causing increased American exports and pushing down world prices. Had the farmers not received the subsidies, he wrote in a thick submission for the W.T.O. panel, United States exports would have declined on average by 41.2 percent and the world price of upland cotton would have increased by 12.6 percent.
 The United States countered with its own submission that critiqued Mr. Sumner's analysis, saying it was flawed and failed to factor in the normal ups and downs of the world market.
 Several members of the cotton industry met with Mr. Sumner and told him he was a turncoat. 
 "One person told me that if this were a military question, what I did would be treason," said Mr. Sumner, who said he stood by his work.
 "I don't come at this sort of thing for any reason but that the best possible evidence is entered in this dispute process," he said. "I am a very strong supporter of multilateral efforts, and I want the dispute process of the W.T.O. to be as fair as possible."

HEADLINE: Not Yet Airborne, and Ted Is in a Fare War 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
When United Airlines unveiled plans for Ted, its latest attempt to compete in the low-fare airline game, United deemed the carrier so perky that it could wink. 
 Yesterday, Ted proved that it could blink, too. 
 Three weeks before Ted is scheduled to make its first flight from itshome airport in Denver, United said it would lower Ted's most expensive fares, pushed into the move by recent fare-cutting by its chief rival, Frontier Airlines.
 United said fares on Ted, which begins operations Feb. 12, would cost no more than $299 each way, plus a $10 fuel surcharge. That matches a $299 cap that Frontier placed on walk-up fares -- those sold at the last minute, with no restrictions -- to cities Ted is also scheduled to serve. 
 That $299 fare is also the most that the leading low-fare carrier, Southwest Airlines, charges for its tickets, although Southwest does not fly to Denver.
 The move underscores the brutal competition within the airline industry, especially in the low-fare segment, which now comprises 25 percent of flights within the United States, measured by the number of passengers carried.
 United, part of UAL, introduced Ted late last year as its entry into the increasingly crowded low-fare segment, which includes Song, started last year by Delta Air Lines, and JetBlue Airways, the Queens-based carrier that has become the biggest airline at Kennedy Airport. 
 Ted will arrive several years after United's last attempt at an airline-within-an-airline, the Shuttle by United, failed to sustain passenger interest. Given that, some analysts have looked skeptically at Ted, saying that its odd name suggests "the end of United."
 In its inaugural phase, Ted will fly from Denver to 14 cities, including Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix, as well as destinations in Florida. Eventually, United officials say they plan to expand Ted flights to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Dulles International Airport near Washington, two of its other hubs.
 Although passengers can connect on Ted to other United flights, and will collect United frequent-flier miles, Ted is getting its own peppy identity, in a quest to compete with the frothy approach of other low-fare airlines.
 Ted's planes have been painted bright blue and marigold while its inflight entertainment system, Ted TV, will feature comedy programs. There will also be an official Ted beer, the brand yet to be selected.
 In introducing the airline in late November, Sean Donohue, a United vice president, said Ted would offer a friendly, casual flying experience, adding that if it could wink, it would. 
 But Ted's initial fares, from Denver to cities on the West Coast as well as Florida, caused some scowls. Despite its low-fare claim, walk-up fares on Ted were initially as high as $414 each way. 
 To be sure, restricted fares were lower, and surveys by Denver newspapers found Ted to be competitive on advance purchases with other carriers serving the city.
 Nonetheless, by capping fares at $299, plus the $10 fuel surcharge, United removed the biggest complaint about Ted. Moreover, the move was an admission that United cannot command a premium for Ted flights simply because a big-name carrier is behind the airline, said Michael Allen, president of Back Aviation, an industry consulting firm.
 Given its experience with the Shuttle by United, the airline should not have tried to charge so much, Mr. Allen said.
 "They're not going to be able to launch a new service as a low-cost competitor offering fares that would make them a high-cost competitor," Mr. Allen said. "I'm glad somebody came to their senses."
 A spokesman for Frontier said the airline had expected United to match its move, the second time in a year that Frontier has capped its fares. In 2003, Frontier reduced its highest walk-up fares from $499 to $399. "The economic situation has generated that kind of response," said Frontier's spokesman, Joseph I. Hodas. 
 Mr. Hodas, speaking by phone from the annual National Western Stock Show and Rodeo in Denver, where Frontier is an exhibitor, said Ted had not affected his airline's advance bookings. 
 Kevin P. Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate travel departments and business travelers, predicted even lower fares ahead as the traditional airlines try to prevent low-fare competitors from taking passengers, no matter the cost to profitability.
 "They're going to do everything they can to stop the market share shift, even if it kills them," Mr. Mitchell predicted. "It's a great year to be a consumer."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Finish Mixed as Investors Await Earnings Reports

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue chips fell yesterday, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index edged higher, as investors digested strong gains in recent sessions and struck a cautious tone before a torrent of earnings reports next week.
 Technology stocks pared gains from the morning, although shares of Microsoft, an industry bellwether, rallied after it lifted its revenue forecast Thursday. 
 Next week will be one of the busiest in the quarterly reporting period. Though earnings reported so far have generally been strong, analysts say many companies have not delivered bullish enough forecasts to justify the steep rise in stock prices. 
 "The good earnings reports don't really create a stampede of buyers," said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's Marketscope. "The market expected to see good earnings, and here they are. So now what do we do? What's next to lift prices?" 
 The major market indexes are likely to remain stuck in a narrow range in the next few weeks until Wall Street starts to focus on the next quarterly earnings period, he added.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.89 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,568.29. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,141.55. The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.86 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,123.87.
 For the week, the Dow slipped 0.30 percent, breaking eight straight weeks of gains. The Nasdaq fell 0.78 percent, breaking a six-week winning streak. But the broader S.&P. rose 0.15 percent, its ninth consecutive week of gains.
 "People are primarily taking profits today," said Cary Nordan, vice president and equity analyst at BB&T Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C.
 "Over all, the tone has been positive, but investors are looking ahead to the next 6 to 12 months and concerned there's going to be a deceleration in earnings growth relative to last year."
 Volume was heavy, with roughly 1.57 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, and about 2.24 billion shares traded on the Nasdaq. 
 Microsoft topped the Nasdaq's most actively traded list, rising 47 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $28.48. On Thursday, it reported a 17 percent drop in quarterly earnings because of a change in its stock compensation plan, but it raised its revenue outlook based on stronger demand for personal computers.
 Shares of Morgan Stanley fell nearly 1 percent, after it cut its previously reported earnings. It said it would take a $27 million after-tax charge to reflect a damage award by a court in Paris in connection with the firm's research on LVMH, the French luxury goods group. Morgan Stanley said it would take the charge in the fourth quarter of 2003, lowering its previously reported results by 2 cents a share. Its shares fell 57 cents, to $59.29.
 On the mergers front, Regions Financial and Union Planters agreed to merge in a $5.9 billion deal that would create one of the largest banks anchored in the Southeast. Shares of Regions jumped $2, or 5.3 percent, to $39.75, while those of Union Planters gained $1.31, or 4.2 percent, to $32.67.
 Treasury prices fell yesterday after a spike in the dollar stoked fears that foreign central banks' appetite for United States government debt might falter.
 The 10-year Treasury note fell 31/32, to 10113/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.07 percent from 3.95 percent on Thursday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 119/32, to 10613/32. The bond's yield jumped to 4.95 percent from 4.85 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: In Newark, Arena Pursuit Drives On Without Nets 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Few could accuse Newark politicians of faintheartedness this week after the sale of the New Jersey Nets to a developer who plans to move them to Brooklyn.
 City officials are trudging on with their bid for a Newark arena minus the Nets. The basketball team, with its playground heroes, would have been the marquee anchor for a two-team arena that Newark officials still envision as the crown jewel of the city's revitalization. Newark officials insisted on Friday that they could still make a scaled-down version of their proposed arena economically viable with just one team, the decidedly un-urban New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League, whose players are more likely to be heroes to those skating around suburban ice rinks. 
 But in order for any such arena to be remotely workable, said Richard Monteilh, Newark's business administrator, it would have to attract a host of other events through the year such as Bruce Springsteen concerts, the Ice Capades, the circus and all manner of trade shows. 
 And in order to do that, he said, the Continental Arena at the Meadowlands, 12 miles away, where the Nets and Devils currently play and which would compete for such events, would have to close. This would require the approval of Gov. James E. McGreevey and George Zoffinger, the president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.
 "The governor has said from the beginning that he will support wherever in New Jersey the state's sports teams want to go," said Mr. Monteilh, noting that Devils management and one of the team's principal stockholders, Raymond Chambers, wanted to move to Newark. This week, Lou Lamoriello, the team's president and general manager, spoke in favor of a new arena in Newark.
 Mr. Monteilh added, "Well, we have a team in the Devils, and Continental Arena doesn't have a sports team."
 As of this week, Mr. Zoffinger had no plans for closing Continental Arena and was talking about repositioning it in the marketplace to compete for other, non-sports events. 
 "Whether the Meadowlands arena closes or not is a decision that the governor and George Zoffinger have to make," said Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo. He added, "I see a Newark arena as a New Jersey arena and it should be here in Newark because it is just more convenient with the public transportation and the roads widening."
 Years ago, when momentum seemed to be with the idea of a Newark arena for the Nets and the Devils, it was envisioned that the Meadowlands arena, which both teams considered lacking in many of the money-making amenities of newer arenas, would be torn down. It was this prospect that drove Governor McGreevey to promise, and eventually deliver, a new economic engine for the Bergen County sports complex in the form of Meadowlands Xanadu, a $1.4 billion family entertainment, sports, retailand office complex unveiled last month along with a long-promised rail spur to the Meadowlands.
 The momentum has now shifted in favor of the Xanadu project, with Mr. Zoffinger insisting that such a development would also help make a refurbished Continental Arena an attractive site next door.
 Rick Thigpen, a former executive director of the state's Democratic Party who is a lobbyist and political consultant, said that from the beginning, white and black New Jersey residents were of very different minds about a Newark arena, according to polls.
 "White New Jerseyans did not want to come to Newark for sports events, and they didn't want to spend public money to help keep teams in the state," said Mr. Thigpen. "Because of the public opinion polls and the racially distinct viewpoints, it has had a significant political impact on the governor's behavior. And it has tied the state's hands on putting public money into the effort."
 The same dynamic could affect any decision about closing Continental Arena, said Mr. Thigpen, noting that it sat there "like a mountain."
 Newark Councilwoman Gayle Chaneyfield-Jenkins added that from the beginning, "the pink elephant standing in the middle of the room that no one wants to acknowledge in all of it is race." But she added that the governor should be able to argue that there is no need to treat Newark "like some welfare case or some child that needs taking care of" because the city has its own resources to bring to the table.
 Those resources are working in Newark Mayor Sharpe James's favor. They amount to nearly $200 million in cash, which the city has on hand to aid any arena project. The money is an upfront payment growing out of a recent renegotiation of the city lease with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for Newark Liberty International Airport. Consequently no state money is likely to be needed to aid in the construction of the arena.
 But at the same time, an arena with only a hockey team might not look as compelling to Newark residents who argue that the money could be better spent on city neighborhoods, schools and property tax relief. Many members of the City Council, which can reject any arena plan, may see the mayor's case for an arena as weakened by recent events.
 "I don't think people would see this as his failure politically," said Mr. Thigpen. "But it is a loss of an opportunity for the mayor to have a big success."

HEADLINE: Studying Abroad (in Greenwich Village); 
A Semester in New York, Filling in for N.Y.U. Students Overseas

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The single-digit temperatures did not faze Michael Alvarez, a 20-year-old with spiky dark hair from Los Angeles Valley College. He danced around excitedly during a tour of New York University last week, tucking his gloveless hands in his pockets. His mind was not on the weather, but on the plays he hoped to see and the directors he hoped to meet during a semester at the university.
 "I've always wanted to come to New York," he said. "I want to be the youngest director ever to win a Tony Award. That gives me eight or nine years, and New York is the right place to be. I'm like a kid in a candy store." 
 Mr. Alvarez is one of 31 college students from around the country attending a new N.Y.U. program called Spring in New York. The university's immediate goal in creating the program was economic: to fill classroom seats and residence hall beds vacated when 700 of its own students spend the spring semester abroad. (Only half that number study abroad in the fall.) 
 For Mr. Alvarez and his spring-semester classmates, the thought of living in New York and exploring Broadway and the Metropolitan Museum of Art was as intoxicating as getting to know the Champs-Elysees and the Louvre. 
 "It's like study abroad, but it's not abroad," said Mimi Cave, 20, a student from Colorado College who said she had traveled to Canada, Mexico, Italy and Belize. "New York is not like any other place I've been to," she said.
 New Yorkers often take their surroundings for granted, but the spring-semester students see the city for all its possibilities. 
 "You can walk across the street or go uptown and see real van Goghs," said Sarah Bair, 19, an art history major at Utah State University. "At home, you have to look in a book." 
 She called New York the best place to study art in the United States. Her goal, she added, is to visit at least one museum or gallery each week.
 New York has long been a magnet for college students, and applications to N.Y.U., Columbia and other city campuses have shot up in the last decade. But the idea of packaging college in New York in smaller chunks grew out of a brainstorming session among N.Y.U. officials last spring. 
 The Tisch School at the university already ran a more narrowly focused program for students in the arts. But the university thought it could attract students interested not only in art and theater, but also in writing, architecture and culture. They would take courses centered on New York's museums and galleries, Broadway musicals, skyscrapers and literary works like E.B. White's paean, "Here Is New York."
 Many of the students said they had thought about attending college in New York. Some applied to N.Y.U. but were rejected. Others decided that New York was too cold, too far away, too imposing or too expensive. Some did not even think about New York when they were graduating from high school, but found that it fit their interests now.
 "I didn't know whether I wanted to live in Manhattan, so I went to the mountains," said Ms. Cave, who is from the Chicago area. "This offered me a taste. But the good thing is that I get to go back to Colorado College."
 N.Y.U. is not the only campus capitalizing on its location to attract students from other American colleges. For example, Simmons, a women's college in Boston, recently began offering women at other colleges a Boston Semester to focus on urban issues. American University in Washington draws about 1,000 students a year to a growing range of politically focused programs. 
 The Washington semester participants are interested in "making contacts and building their resumes," said David C. Brown, dean of American's Washington semester program, adding that he expected students to choose N.Y.U.'s program for similar reasons.
 "These programs give students a credential," he said. 
 He said his university benefited, too, attracting students it would not otherwise have, building its prestige and revenues.
 Last week, the N.Y.U. students were racing to absorb the city on their own terms before classes began. Mr. Alvarez, the Los Angeles Valley College student, took in two shows, "Hairspray" and "Rent." Over the weekend he tried to see "Wicked" but was unable to get tickets.
 Kathryn Long, 23, a journalism and film studies student from the University of Georgia, started by roaming Greenwich Village, learning the subway system and trying to find "the best and cheapest" cup of coffee near N.Y.U. 
 A film buff, she was also beginning to log hours in movie theaters. She has seen "Lost in Translation" twice since she arrived, and also saw "American Splendor" and "The Fog of War" -- both films she had already seen at the Cannes Film Festival. The Metropolitan Museum and a Diane Arbus photography exhibit at N.Y.U. topped her art agenda.
 Many of the students said that N.Y.U. offered a breadth and depth of academic opportunities not available on their campuses. Examining a Tisch catalog, several students marveled at its specialized offerings: Hollywood Comedy in the Great Depression. Documentary Traditions. The Vampire Film. 
 "There are so many things here that my school doesn't have," Ms. Long said.
 N.Y.U. is offering the spring-semester students a selection of courses from five of its schools, including the College of Arts and Science, the Tisch School of the Arts and the Stern School of Business. (Stern is offering both the Business of Producing and Entertainment Marketing.)
 "I didn't want to develop a concentration in a field like chemistry, where a student would spend all his time in lab," said Sharon Weinberg, the N.Y.U. vice provost who developed the program.
 For many of the students, even a semester at N.Y.U. is a costly luxury. Tuition and fees amount to $14,248, and the residence hall costs $5,430 more. Some students said the financial aid programs at their home colleges would have covered study abroad but did not cover N.Y.U., and some said they had taken out loans.
 Although N.Y.U. carefully promoted the program as a one-semester visit, not as a transfer program, some of the students are already dreaming about the possibility of staying.
 Mr. Alvarez, the California theater student, said he had begun to pump N.Y.U. officials about how to transfer, and over lunch in N.Y.U.'s Kimmel Center last week, he offered to share phone numbers and Web addresses with his new classmates. 
 "Being here in the city now," he said this week, "I just feel very right."
 He has even bought a pair of gloves.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL; 
The Picture Doesn't Tell the Story for Duke's Tillis

BYLINE:  By VIV BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C. 

 BODY:
James Tillis has never set foot in Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke, but he is there every day, his picture taped to the locker of his daughter, Iciss Tillis.
 Twenty-two years after he lost to Mike Weaver in a World Boxing Association heavyweight title fight, Iciss is now the family's world-class athlete, a 6-foot-5 senior forward for the Duke women's basketball team who won a silver medal last summer with the United States team at the Pan American Games. 
 Her father's picture is a constant motivator as she pushes herself to help the Duke women win their first N.C.A.A. title. The top-ranked Blue Devils are 15-1 heading into Saturday night's showdown against No. 2 Tennessee. 
 But the picture is not a tribute. It is a reminder of all Tillis hopes she will never be.
 "This is the year to win a national championship," she said recently. "I just feel like I'd be such a failure. I'd feel like I didn't finish if we didn't win one before I left and that bothers me, because every time I don't finish something, I feel like I'm regressing back and I'm going to end up like my dad: a nobody."
 Quick Tillis, as he was known, was somebody back in the 1980's. He lost the title fight to Weaver in 1981, shortly before Iciss was born. In 1985, he had a small role as the boxer Buster in the movie, "The Color Purple." And in 1986, Tillis became the first boxer to go the distance with a young Mike Tyson, lasting 10 rounds before losing a unanimous decision.
 But Iciss Tillis says her father never went the distance for her. After her parents divorced when she was 6, James Tillis severed his relationship with her.
 "Their relationship hasn't been the best," said her mother, Melanie Hughes-Morris, in a telephone interview. "Especially from the age of 13, the formative years, when she really realized during those years what kind of dad he really was, not really being there."
 James Tillis remains in Tulsa, Okla., where he earns a living working on ranches. He rarely sees his daughter. He has never attended a Duke basketball game, even when the Blue Devils played in Tulsa last season.
 "I told her I did the best I could," Tillis said in a recent telephone interview. "Tell her that I love her.
 "I'm going to see her play when I'm able to; I've got a lot of pride. I've seen her on TV playing. I told her the sky's the limit."
 Iciss Tillis has already shown that at Duke, and not just on the court. It's not just about her height. It's her look: the dreadlocks, the outfits, the baby oil gel she puts on before games so she can shine on the court, the Jimmy Choo and Manolo Blahnik designer shoes she buys in bulk. She once strolled around campus in a blue unitard and white-spiked heels. She is majoring in economics and plans to play in the Women's National Basketball Association and attend law school. She also wants to become a Victoria's Secret model, she worships Oprah Winfrey and is a faithful follower of the show "Sex and the City."
 "She's brought great fashion sense to our team," Duke Coach Gail Goestenkors said with a laugh.
 Not to mention campus recognition. In four years, Tillis and guard Alana Beard have lifted Duke to the upper echelons of women's basketball. The Blue Devils have reached the Final Four the past two seasons. Tillis and Beard were named to the Kodak all-American first team last season.
 Tillis is quick like her father, quicker than the other post players in the women's college game. She is also an outside threat -- she is just as likely to launch a 3-pointer as she is to post up an opponent in the paint.
 "We had a game the other night and she hit a 3 and two plays later, she tried to dunk the ball," Goestenkors said. "And then she hit a 15-foot jumper and then she made a really beautiful pass to somebody for a layup. And I thought, 'How many people in America can do what she just did?' "
 Perhaps nobody else has that combination of size, skill, quickness and vision in the women's college game. Yet few would rate Tillis ahead of the top two players in the country: Connecticut's Diana Taurasi and Beard. Sometimes Tillis's performance does not match her ability.
 "When you have that much talent, there comes an expectation," said the former player and coach Nancy Lieberman, now an analyst for ESPN. "I think it's something Iciss has to recognize and accept. When you're that good, when you're one of the elite players, it's going to come with a different price."
 Tillis would be the first to say she struggled in last year's N.C.A.A. tournament, particularly in the semifinal game against Tennessee, when she had 9 points and 5 rebounds.
 Tillis is trying to spend more time in the post and is working to become more of a physical player, despite a reputation for avoiding contact. She is averaging 11.4 points this season; she was averaging 18 points before a six-game scoring slump. But she broke out with 21 points against Maryland on Thursday night.
 "Am I ever going to be good enough?" she said. "That's the thing I'm going through right now -- the frustration. I feel like I have to come out and have a triple-double, dunk the ball over-the-head-360 and maybe people will be like, 'Oh, she's not that bad.' "

HEADLINE: Bush Deficit-Cutting Plan Draws Doubters 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Even as President Bush sets a modest goal of reducing the federal deficit to about $200 billion by 2009, many budget analysts and economists doubt he can achieve it. 
 Under fire from Democrats as well as conservative Republicans for allowing the deficit to reach more than $400 billion this year, White House officials say Mr. Bush's budget for next year will hold the growth in domestic discretionary programs to less than 1 percent. 
 That would amount to a budget cut for many agencies, after adjusting for inflation, and it would be a sharp turnaround from the increased spending Mr. Bush has supported or condoned for the past three years. 
But Mr. Bush's budget proposal, to be unveiled on Feb. 2, is likely to omit several huge costs that would derail his projections if they were included.
Administration officials said his budget plan will not include the costs of supporting American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond this year because administration officials say those costs are unknowable. 
The cost of maintaining 100,000 soldiers in Iraq, which would be a decrease from the current troop levels, has been estimated at $50 billion a year. Even a significantly smaller force could cost tens of billions of dollars in 2005.
President Bush is also unlikely to include the cost of fixing the so-called alternative minimum tax, a set of provisions that will lead to big tax increases for millions of families unless the law is changed. 
Lawmakers in both parties want to prevent that from happening, but analysts across the spectrum say the cost will be more than $100 billion over the next five years and more than $400 billion over the next 10 years.
"The budget will cut the deficit in half in five years only on paper and not in the real world, and only by omitting roughly $200 billion in costs for 2009 that the administration has itself indicated it favors and will request," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington.
Meanwhile, President Bush will also face enormous difficulties on the spending front. Congressional Republicans are already pushing for a large increase in spending on highways and mass transit over the next six years.
In a rare display of bipartisanship, House Republicans and Democrats are jointly pushing to spend $375 billion over the next six years on highway and mass transit, while Senate leaders have proposed $311 billion. Fuel taxes are supposed to pay for those projects, but Congressional analysts estimate that fuel taxes will at most supply $265 billion -- leaving a shortfall that could total $110 billion. 
The good news for the administration is that the economic recovery is now beginning to generate additional tax revenue, after three years of declining revenue.
But forecasters in the administration and in Congress had already been assuming an increase in tax revenues, so the added revenue may do little to offset the cost of extra spending and additional tax cuts that are not in the administration's official proposal.
On Friday, the Pentagon announced it would seek 7 percent more money next year, or $401.7 billion. But that increase does not include money for Iraq or Afghanistan, which administration officials say they will seek in supplemental funding if they need to do so next year.
Administration officials are already looking for ways to squeeze spending in many domestic programs. They are also quietly prodding Republicans in Congress to drop billions of dollars in proposed tax cuts from the energy bill that was narrowly defeated last year. 
Mr. Bush's Democratic opponents blame some tax cuts passed since 2001 for much of the problem. But conservative critics are fuming that Mr. Bush has allowed government spending to soar. 
Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, estimates that government spending climbed twice as fast under President Bush as under President Bill Clinton, and that only about one-third of that increase came from defense spending and homeland security.
On Friday, the administration showed its own numbers to refute the criticisms, saying that nondefense discretionary spending -- from parks and museums to the Energy Department -- has grown more slowly in the last three years and will climb only 4 percent in 2004.
"This president is helping to rein in the growth in government spending by the budgets that we have put forward, and he remains committed to doing that," said Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman.
But even if Mr. Bush does hold down the growth of domestic spending, he will have trouble cutting the deficit in half by 2009 and even bigger deficit problems in the five years after that. The reason is that Mr. Bush has vowed to make most of his tax cuts permanent, rather than allowing them to expire.
"It is a tall order, and after five years you have very big hurdles," said Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs, which predicts that the federal government will run up deficits totaling more than $5 trillion over the next 10 years if the tax cuts become permanent. 
Analysts at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning research organization, predict that the budget deficit will remain above $400 billion a year for the next five years and climb to $687 billion a year by 2014.
"There is no doubt they're going to claim the budget meets their goal," said William Gale, a longtime budget expert at Brookings. "The queston is how are they going to pull the rabbit out of the hat."
The Brookings analysis assumed that spending would grow more slowly than it has in the past three years, but slightly faster than the rate of inflation. It also assumed that Congress continues all expiring tax provisions and fixes the alternative minimum tax. 
Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the core problem is spending rather than tax cuts.
"The deficit is a manifestation of the real problem, like sneezing when a person has the flu," Mr. Nussle said. "Spending growth over all is the issue here."
Mr. Nussle has been pressing the administration to include cost estimates for military operations in Iraq in its budget request, and he expressed frustration at the probability that Mr. Bush would once again wait until he has to make a supplemental funding request.
"It's time to stop using the excuse of not knowing the future," Mr. Nussle said. "We know things we didn't know two years ago. We know the costs of the war. We know we're in a war."

HEADLINE: Brazil's Moment 

 BODY:
A year after assuming Brazil's presidency, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a longtime labor activist, has displaced Vicente Fox of Mexico as the most influential Latin American leader, and he is an increasingly powerful presence on the global stage. The repercussions of Brazil's ascendancy for the Bush administration are clear: better ties with the rest of Latin America now hinge on a closer relationship with Brasilia.
 Brazil's retaliatory fingerprinting of visitors from the United States in response to new American security measures is an indication of longstanding frictions in the relationship. Despite being the largest country in Latin America, Brazil has usually stood apart from its Spanish-speaking neighbors. And Mr. da Silva's leftist world view is often at odds with that of the Bush administration. 
 His growing clout reflects a broader shift in the continent's center of political gravity in the last three years. In the absence of robust economic growth, Latin American governments eager to follow Washington's lead on trade and economic policy have been replaced by more populist ones, which are wary of American intentions. From Hugo Chavez of Venezuela to Nestor Kirchner of Argentina, Latin leaders are looking less to Mexico and more to Brazil to provide regional leadership. 
Our relations with Brazil, a country little understood by Americans but which sees itself as the United States of South America, have always been complicated. A medium-size industrial power and an agricultural superpower, Brazil does not rely on trade with the United States to the same degree as most Latin American countries. Brasilia is more interested in cementing a close-knit South American bloc than in buying into a Washington-dominated hemispheric arrangement.
Brazil led the entire developing world last year in opposing the further liberalization of global trade until and unless the United States and Europe stop giving their farmers subsidies that provide them an unfair advantage on world markets.
Still, Brazil's president is hardly a reckless firebrand. Wall Street applauds his prudent fiscal policies, which helped stave off a potential debt and currency crisis that could have affected all emerging markets. Moreover, President da Silva has acknowledged that it is important for Colombia to defeat its drug-trafficking guerrilla movements.
So long as Washington moves beyond outdated notions that Latin America must march behind us in lock-step unity on every issue, there is reason to believe that a more constructive relationship can be cultivated with Brazil. It's important to try.

Ratner Signs Contract To Complete Nets Sale

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
At a news conference yesterday that was filled with hugs, jokes and unabashed good cheer, Bruce C. Ratner announced that he had officially signed a contract to take control of the Nets, whom he plans to move to Brooklyn in about three years. 
 It was Ratner's birthday and a host of New York politicians -- who had joined him at the Brooklyn Academy of Music -- said there could have been no better gift than having his $300 million purchase of the Nets completed. 
 To house the team, Ratner plans to build an 800,000-square-foot sports arena with 19,000 seats in an unused railroad yard that lies between Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues. 
Brooklyn has not had a major league professional sports team since Sept. 24, 1957, the day of the Dodgers' last game in Brooklyn before Walter O'Malley moved them to Los Angeles. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg reminded the crowd that it was 46 years, 3 months and 29 days ago.
"It's the right place to put it," Bloomberg said of the arena. "It's a huge win for Brooklyn."
Bloomberg said that he expected the arena to generate about $400 million a year through various economic activities. He said construction of the arena would create about 10,000 jobs and that its operation would create a few thousand more. In addition, Ratner plans to build some 2.1 million square feet of office space over the railroad yard. His plan also calls for the construction of about 4,000 housing units, from low-income properties to luxury apartments.
Among the public officials who spoke at the event were Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, Bloomberg, Gov. George E. Pataki and Senator Charles Schumer. 
The self-deprecating Markowitz said the closest he had ever come to playing basketball had been holding coats on the sideline of games at his alma mater, Wingate High School in Brooklyn.
In what became a recurring joke, Markowitz said that he and Bloomberg, who are relatively short, were bucking for slots on Ratner's new team.
Pataki, who towered above his fellow politicians, suggested a game of two on two: Markowitz and Bloomberg versus him and Bernard King, the four-time N.B.A. All-Star forward, who was also at the news conference.
Ratner, who is the development partner of The New York Times Company in a new building for the newspaper's headquarters, spoke about his desire to include community residents in his building plans. About 100 families may have their homes seized for the project through eminent domain, and Ratner said that he would listen to their concerns.
Assemblyman Roger Green, who represents the neighborhood, spoke about the relationship between Branch Rickey, the onetime executive of the Dodgers, and Jackie Robinson. Green said he hoped that Ratner would show the same racial sensitivity and sense of social responsibility in his construction plans.

Pilots in Europe Look Askance at Marshals

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
DO guards with guns protect airplanes and their passengers from terrorist attacks? For many Americans, long used to the association of law enforcement with weapons, the answer might seem an obvious yes.
 But since the United States ordered foreign airlines to deploy sky marshals on some flights to the United States, the question has stirred passionate arguments among airline pilots in Europe, particularly those in Britain, who remain apprehensive about such a role. On Jan. 16, Asa Hutchinson, the United States under secretary for border and transportation security, held inconclusive talks in Brussels with European civil aviation officials, but most of them were not in favor of deploying sky marshals, Gilles Gantelet, a spokesman for the European Commission, said later. 
 Even in those lands where the governments have accepted the American view -- like Britain -- pilots and their managers remain unconvinced and want strict ground-rules covering the way armed guards are deployed. "My starting position has always been that guns and planes don't mix," said Rod Eddington, the chief executive of British Airways, which flies 72 flights a day to and from the United States. 
The dispute began in late December, when the United States secretary for homeland security, Tom Ridge, said that foreign airlines would be asked to deploy sky marshals on specified flights to, from or over the United States if intelligence information indicated a potential threat. Airlines that did not comply, officials said, could be denied access to American airspace.
The use of armed guards as a deterrent to hijackers has been common in the United States for decades. El Al, the Israeli airline, has long used armed, plainclothes marshals on all its flights, and some European airlines, like Lufthansa, have deployed them on selected flights, particularly since 9/11.
But in Britain there has been strong resistance to the idea. Armed police officers are still relatively unusual here, and most plainclothes and uniformed officers conduct routine business without weapons. Indeed, security experts in Britain say prevention efforts on the ground before a flight are more effective than intervention in the air. 
"Americans have a particular view of how to provide security, and many in the world do not share that vision," Amit Chanda and Kate Joynes of the World Markets Research Center, a private political and economic analysis group, wrote in the International Herald Tribune. 
"The history of the United States gives it a level of comfort with firearms that most in the world do not share," they said. "Hence the lobby of British pilots opposed to flying with sky marshals on board. This is not simple anti-Americanism; it is a fundamental disagreement about what makes us safe."
The pilots themselves have more practical considerations, too, according to Keith Bill, a spokesman for the British Airline Pilots Association, which represents 8,050 of the country's 9,200 airline pilots: Who would be in charge of the airplane in the event of an attack -- the captain or the sky marshal? Who would be legally responsible for death or damage if a gun were fired?
Pilots also ask: Who should be aware of a sky marshal's presence? What if terrorists seized the marshal's gun for use in an attack? What kind of weapons and ammunition would be used?
Airlines in Portugal, South Africa, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland have said in public statements that they would not use sky marshals. Air France, which canceled six flights to Los Angeles in December because of United States concerns over the identity of some passengers, said its airplanes would not take off if there were a specific terror threat. 
In Britain, where a British Airways flight to Washington was delayed for several hours on four consecutive days in early January because of terror concerns of American officials, the opposition to the deployment of sky marshals is tempered by financial considerations. The trans-Atlantic route is a major earner for British airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, which was the first to agree to the United States demand for armed guards on its flights.
"We had a choice to make," said Mr. Bill of the pilots association, which is negotiating the marshal issue with the British government. "If we say we will never ever fly a sky marshal, the result would be the loss of trans-Atlantic business, and that would damage the whole industry."
In negotiations with the government this month, British pilots insisted that if deployed, sky marshals would be under the command of the airplane'scaptain. Moreover, their identities and seat numbers should be made known to crews. And along with technical issues related to the training of guards and the type of weapons they would use, the pilots also sought an indemnity against any damage or loss of life caused by a sky marshal's gun. 
The United States has not responded specifically to those ideas.
It may be, though, that the chance of sky marshals' flying on British planes will remain limited because, in Britain at least, pilots would still rather ground flights seen as seriously threatened than deploy armed guards. "We believe that they may never be used," Mr. Bill said.

HEADLINE: Ordered to Loosen Up, Davos Buttons Down 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
A DECADE after Chinos and golf shirts became common in the American workplace, the World Economic Forum is trying to bring the dress-down culture to its annual gathering of corporate titans, heads of state and other worthies at this Alpine ski resort.
 The organizers posted a sign outside the meeting, declaring it a tie-free zone, and fining those starchy enough to wear one 5 Swiss francs ($4.30), to be given to charity. The francs piled up in the collection box. 
 Casual Fridays, it turns out, don't go down well with the kind of people who hang out at the Trilateral Commission.
By the end of last week, the no-tie rule was being widely flouted, usually with mumbled excuses that the scofflaw in question was speaking and wouldn't look dignified in an open-neck shirt. Those men who went tie-less still wore tailored suits and monogrammed cuff links, lending the conference a faux casualness that made one wish for a maitre d' at the door, to hand out the missing paisley.
Klaus Schwab, the Swiss-German academic who runs the conference, said the new dress code was a way to pull Davos back to its roots after three years of being burdened by weighty geopolitical issues, from the war on terrorism to the war on Saddam Hussein.
"Last year, we were very pessimistic," said Mr. Schwab, who wore a beige cotton button-down. "This year, it's back to business."
The trouble is, the world in 2004 is anything but normal. At a time of uncertain economic prospects, political tumult and persistent dangers of a terrorist attack, the businesspeople and public officials who came to this year's conference were hardly in a mood to let down their hair.
The hostile tone of last year's meeting, which fell during the American buildup to the war, has given way to a deep-seated feeling of unease -- a sense that the old rules no longer apply, whether in statecraft or commerce. Corporate bosses did not dwell much on Al Qaeda or the rebuilding of Iraq, but only because they are burdened with their own ineradicable threats.
"The combination of the Internet and globalization has led to an era of hypercompetition," said Sir Howard Stringer, the chairman of the Sony Corporation of America, who wore a tie. "White-collar jobs are flowing overseas. Nobody has time to worry about international terrorism."
Even subjects that once generated enthusiasm at Davos have taken on a more menacing edge. China, with its vast population and heady economic growth, used to be seen here as a potential bonanza for American multinational companies. Today, it is viewed by many as a giant factory floor with cut-rate workers who will suck skilled jobs out of the United States.
Zhu Min, an economic adviser to China's president, spent the week fending off questions about when his country would allow its currency to float, which would take some pressure off the falling United States dollar and throttle back China's roaring export engine. He found himself in the odd position of reassuring Americans that China would not grow this fast forever.
"We are a big country, but we are not strong," Mr. Zhu said to an audience that clearly doubted him. Maybe it was his tie.

 AMERICAN SUCKER
By David Denby.
337 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. $24.95.
 IF David Denby, amateur investor and film critic for The New Yorker, had managed to achieve the goal he set for himself about four years ago -- to make $1 million in the stock market so as to buy out his departing wife's share of their beloved Upper West Side apartment -- he might have been happier, for a time, but he wouldn't have had much of a book. Instead, like countless other Americans who had their own reasons for adding their hot breath to the mammoth bubble in equities whose bursting still echoes in the nation's ears even as the market is puffing up again, Denby fell short, he fell sickeningly short, but he did reap disaster's perennial dividend: an interesting sad story with a moral.
The midlife crisis that led to Denby's financial crisis (in "American Sucker" the two are treated as one, reminding us that economics, at bottom, is always home economics) began the day his wife of 18 years, the novelist Cathleen Schine, announced that she intended to leave him. Their marriage, which Denby describes in shorthand, reserving his longhand for his money troubles, was gratifying, stable and productive -- a model of bright metropolitan domesticity. He wrote his movie reviews, she wrote her books, and the couple's two boys grew up healthy, smart and sane. The turn for the worse, when it came, was jolting and mystifying but not so harshly dramatic or destructive that it couldn't be faced in the thoroughly modern manner: by living apart while maintaining a joint bank account and working patiently toward an amicable settlement. Denby the divorcing husband was a cautious, slightly melancholy optimist.
That had been his investing style, too: go with the flow but don't get too far ahead of it. Buy bonds and sock away the interest. Buy stocks, but diversify to limit risk. Trust in growth and slowly grow in trust. Denby, when young and living in California, had been something of a radical, dancing to the Grateful Dead and defiantly pitting culture against commerce, but he'd mellowed into a propertied intellectual who sneakily admired the system for its ability to supply the good life even to those who held it in partial contempt.
What changed all of this was an upsurge of desire. Above all, this is a book about desire, not only for handsome material wealth and a comfortable, familiar home, but for love, sex, fame, fine objects (namely, a shining blue Audi sports sedan that functions as Denby's mechanical Helen, seductively beckoning him toward catastrophe and putting him on the wrong side of the old gods) and even aesthetic pleasure. In sketching his own intensely crosshatched character, so ripe for exploitation by Wall Street hucksters who played on his heady hopes about the market while suavely anesthetizing his intestinal doubts, Denby the critic reveals his tricky feelings about the movies he makes his living writing about. Mostly they disappoint him, deeply, chronically, and the soulless industrial process that creates them outrages his lofty sensibilities; but at the same time he's realistic enough to know that without the underlying profit motive the screen would go dark. Denby strikes a worldly compromise, meticulously sifting through the dreck for big-budget films that also succeed as art, then aggressively, sincerely promoting them. The system depresses him, but the system is all he has.
But suddenly, destabilized by loss and yearning for a return to wholeness, he learns to love the system -- at least as it's embodied in his portfolio. The obsession starts late at night at a computer, as so many obsessions do these days, and occasions much moving writing on loneliness in the age of interconnectivity. While searching the Internet for investment news, Denby also finds himself sampling its porn sites, and in no time he's doubly addicted, buffeted by greed and lust at once. Greed's hold is surer, though, which ought to tell us something about the nature of sin these days. Our private parts aren't our major source of trouble; it's our wallets that we can't keep in our pants. Denby cuts out the porn in favor of human girlfriends, but his hunger for stock tips only sharpens.
What results is a classic cautionary tale, complete with learned references to the Bible and Aristotle's "Ethics," and featuring not one but two suave arch-deceivers who whisper in Denby's ear: Henry Blodget, the whiz-kid Merrill Lynch analyst who talked up weak tech stocks in public while sneering in private and ended up paying huge fines for his bad faith, and the Gatsby-ish C.E.O. of ImClone, Sam Waksal, whose A-list SoHo parties were well attended but whose sentencing hearing for securities fraud failed to attract a single celebrity friend.
Since Denby is a self-flagellating moper, as nervous and self-conscious as he is eager and never so wholly caught up in the euphoria that he stops gnawing his educated fingernails -- he doesn't spring for that Audi, for example, just does a lot of reading in sociology to justify his wish to own it -- his book needs these two highfliers to give it energy. Blodget is the duller of the two, a self-serving golden boy in over his head, and Denby sees through him easily, if reluctantly. Waksal is a star, though, with a charisma that Denby perfectly captures, maybe because it never quite stopped charming him. Waksal pretends to be out for more than money; he wants to heal the masses with Erbitux, ImClone's fledgling cancer drug, and shower the proceeds on a grand salon of artists, politicians and media types.
As Denby's pile fluctuates his exact gains and losses are quoted in the chapter subheads, but the chapters themselves are an eccentric mix of often lacerating confessions about his rocky love life and seminarish meditations on capitalism, conspicuous consumption and the psychological roots of greed. His tone can be pedantic, but his intention -- to freeze and analyze the mental gyrations that allow a deep thinker to become a shallow speculator -- is worthwhile and appropriate. Denby even drops in snippets of movie reviews he wrote at the time to help show us where his head was at, but they don't add much. Nor do his journal entries, which disclose a steady stream of worries that he was somehow powerless to act on.
Denby's financial frenzy, in the end, comes off as a form of emotional paralysis. He doesn't plow just his capital into tech stocks, but his anger, his fouled-up libido, his regrets and his wounded pride. He knows this at some level, but pushes on, whipsawed by exuberance and self-loathing. The crash is a relief for him, if anything, and that's a lesson worth remembering now that the Dow and Nasdaq are chugging back. Life resumes after the market closes.

HEADLINE: A New New Deal

 BODY:
 FOR THE SURVIVAL
OF DEMOCRACY
Franklin Roosevelt and
the World Crisis of the 1930s.
By Alonzo L. Hamby.
Illustrated. 492 pp. New York:
Free Press. $30.
 IT was eight years ago this month that a Democratic president proclaimed in a State of the Union address that "the era of big government is over." Now comes the first major work of scholarship to show a similar skepticism toward the era when big government began. And just as Bill Clinton made his pronouncement with a cadre of angryand aggressive right-wing Congressional warriors at his heels, Alonzo L. Hamby, who has enjoyed a long career producing mostly affectionate portraits of liberalism in its heyday, has published his more tempered assessment at a moment of right-wing stirrings on the battlefield of historiography. A standard piece of conservative folk wisdom has begun to find scholarly expression in works like Jim Powell's "FDR's Folly: How Roosevelt and His New Deal Prolonged the Great Depression." If that book tells a Newt Gingrich kind of story, "For the Survival of Democracy" is a history of the New Deal in the spirit of the Democratic Leadership Council.
Hamby, a distinguished professor at Ohio University, knows exactly what he's doing here. The generation that created his field, he writes in an epilogue, "established a tone that still dominates the study of American politics in the 1930's: a near-adulatory perspective, occasionally nagged by a sense that F.D.R. was too 'conservative' to lead us entirely into the promised land of equalitarian social democracy." He also notes the inconvenient fact that hobbles them: it's impossible to argue that the New Deal accomplished what it set out to do, namely, to produce a genuine economic recovery.
But it is not in answering the question "Did it work?" that Hamby ventures his most aggressive contribution to this discussion. He's more interested in what there was to admire in Roosevelt's attempt. He concludes: not too much.
Hamby navigates his path through the inquiry by way, to appropriate a Clintonian metaphor, of triangulation: charting the fortunes of the world's largest economy in comparison with the ones in second and third place, Britain and Germany. This makes for an awkward narrative. A stock-footage retelling of the dramatic collapse of Weimar democracy alternates with pages on England's colorless march toward "a vigorous policy of social benefits to the extent that fiscal responsibility allowed it." The effect is akin to watching sequences from a Hollywood battle epic intercut with stretches of televised golf.
The comparative method works better for another of the author's purposes: it constructs a judgment seat from which to indict the New Deal. Britain's response to the Depression, a civilized diet of national sacrifice, balanced budgets and a lack of charisma, Hamby finds splendid. "A dynamic force can be a very terrible thing," declared Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, the nearly forgotten figure who is this book's unlikely hero, and Hamby quite agrees. The grim spectacle of Hitler provides the counterexample. So where does that place Franklin Roosevelt? In a rather awkward spot, as it turns out: closer in many of his economic policies to Hitler than to Baldwin, Hamby suggests. That the New Deal approached the status of fascism was a common if "crude libel" of Roosevelt's enemies at the time, Hamby says at one point. But faint echoes of that libel can be found in this book.
Hamby builds part of his case on one word, "corporatism" -- an economic system driven by the planning decisions of large cartels. The early New Deal experimented with corporatism, Hamby points out. And he goes on to show that corporatism was a feature of the economy ruled by Hitler. Hamby hedges the comparison. Yet Roosevelt's traditional enemies would have found much to applaud in statements like: "The Nazi recovery program organized the economy in ways that bore a clear surface resemblance to the early New Deal." 
What is more, Hamby displays an insensitivity to Roosevelt's leadership style. The president liked farming out the same task to more than one bureaucratic rival, Hamby correctly observes, adding, "The tactic, more suited to a dictator fearing overthrow by a lieutenant than to a democratic leader, simply created friction and inefficiency." Later he adds a stiletto thrust: "Both Roosevelt and Hitler . . . seem to have consciously played off subordinates against one another as a means of preserving their ultimate power."
But there is another, less accusatory explanation for Roosevelt's management technique. It points not to Roosevelt's will to power, but to his maturity. As the law professor Cass Sunstein has argued, Roosevelt assigned projects to multiple subordinates of opposing opinions in order to mitigate one of the problems of democratic governance: it let him hide his own preferences so that his aides would not simply tell their boss what they thought he wanted to hear. In that way, Roosevelt avoided surrounding himself with yes men. Democracy survived the Great Depression in part because the president remained, despite temptations, despite lapses, a thoroughgoing democrat.
Hamby also makes some scholarly omissions. To take one example, his criticism of Roosevelt's "100-proof soak-the-rich" tax politics is oblivious of work arguing that Roosevelt was actually employing opportunistic rhetoric to obscure tax policies that were on balance regressive. And by repeating the orthodox wisdom about the universality of classical liberalism in American political culture, Hamby fails to acknowledge recent demonstrations that, for instance, American labor law before Roosevelt was in fact based in feudalism. Before the passage of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, courts habitually struck down laws reforming the workplace by following common-law doctrine -- that the "master-servant" relationship could not be interfered with through legislation. It is therefore false to claim, as Hamby does, that American trade unions achieved justice and benefits only for their members.
Making that point may take us into the realm of ideology. But that's just fine. Some interpreters of the New Deal lean left, some are centrist, others right-wing, and this is all to the good: let a hundred flowers bloom. Liberals should welcome the opportunity to test their received opinions against new, less positive interpretations of the New Deal. But this book is not likely to be the one that will persuade them to change their "near-adulatory" opinions about Roosevelt.
