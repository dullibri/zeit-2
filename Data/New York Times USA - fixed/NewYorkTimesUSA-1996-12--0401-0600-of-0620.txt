HEADLINE: Netcom to Seek Profitable Niche: Internet Access Just for Business

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Netcom, one of the country's largest Internet access providers, said yesterday that it would phase out the "all you can eat" pricing model next year and would concentrate instead on offering higher-quality, higher-priced services for business users.
By announcing the shift in strategy, to take effect next February, Netcom, based in San Jose, Calif., is bucking a trend that it started three years ago when it offered unlimited Internet access for $19.95 a month. 
 So far this year, three of the four largest domestic access providers, America Online, the Microsoft Network and AT&T Worldnet Services, have adopted the flat-rate plan, and many smaller network providers have followed suit. But as millions of Americans piled onto the Internet to take advantage of the relatively inexpensive rates, the services were bogged down with busy signals, bad connections, slow service and interminable waits for customer support.
"We made a decision that there is a significant market out there that is interested in a higher level of service," said David W. Garrison, chairman and chief executive of Netcom On-Line Communications Services Inc., which has more than 550,000 customers. He said Netcom would focus its efforts on customers who use the Internet for business, and are willing to pay more for guaranteed access, prompt customer support and such custom services as setting up World Wide Web sites for customers.
Analysts said the move made sense.
"You can't make money providing dial-up Internet access to consumers when you are billing $19.95 for unlimited use," said Ulric Weil, who analyzes the on-line industry for the investment banking firm Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Company in Arlington, Va. "You have thousands and thousands of customers, and each one tends to require handholding. They don't know how to log on; they question their accounts when they get billed, and they are expensive to service."
Dr. Andrew B. Whinston, a professor of computer science, economics and business at the University of Texas at Austin, said a move to a multiple-level pricing model for Internet access, with lower rates for recreational use and premium-priced access for businesses, was an alternative to spending as much as $100 billion in the next few years to add network capacity, which many people believe is necessary to decrease network congestion.
"One way to deal with congestion is to throw more bandwidth at it," Dr. Whinston said, "but the other is to use a more intelligent pricing scheme that recognizes that there are users who have priority needs -- people with businesses to run, financial traders and others."
Earlier this year, two other large access providers, Compuserve, owned by H & R Block Inc., and Psinet Inc., also said they were moving away from the consumer market to focus on business services.
Mr. Garrison of Netcom said his company was making the shift rather than try to survive in the increasingly competitive consumer market with rich companies like AT&T and Microsoft. That market is characterized by "increasing usage, declining revenue and increasing cost of acquiring subscribers and providing customer support," he said.
Mr. Garrison said yesterday that as a result of its new focus on a smaller but more profitable subscriber base, he expects the company to grow at a 40 percent to 50 percent annual rate in 1997, compared with a 300 percent growth rate this year. He said Netcom would achieve profitability in its fourth quarter, which ends on Dec. 31 -- at least a quarter earlier than many Wall Street analysts expected.

HEADLINE: Charities Debate Tactic To Limit Gifts' Life Span

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

 BODY:
When 1996 dies at midnight on Dec. 31, so will New York's Aaron Diamond Foundation -- on schedule and in keeping with its strategy for using up its more than $200 million within 10 years to finance ambitious projects, including a Manhattan laboratory that has been in the forefront of AIDS research.
In Miami, the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust will dissolve next June after 14 years, its officers confident that the $506 million they have awarded to finance biomedical research at universities and to support the work of young scientists will spur advances in medicine. 
 In San Diego, the Jacobs Family Foundation, which will eventually be endowed with $100 million to support community and economic development in Southern California and the Middle East, plans to dismantle itself when the last of three daughters of the founder, Joseph J. Jacobs, dies, probably in about three decades.
By electing to "spend down" substantial chunks of their assets each year until the principal is gone, these benefactors are spending themselves out of business. They are doing so in the belief that by disbursing their vast sums in a finite number of years, they will have a greater impact on the societal problems they were created to address.
Their approach is not typical, nor has it won many converts among the nation's 38,807 grant-making foundations who, in 1994, held $195.8 billion in assets and made grants of $11.3 billion. Indeed, the strategy renounces two tenets of modern philanthropy: that a foundation should operate in perpetuity and give away only a small portion of its wealth each year.
But with their against-the-grain approach, these foundations have put an area of philanthropic strategy -- once reserved for board rooms and other cloistered venues -- into public debate. The question is: How can donors insure that their money has the greatest possible impact?
Setting a philanthropy's life span ought to be dictated by the donor's perspective and values as well as by the nature of the problems the donor chooses to address, said Peter Goldmark, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, an international foundation that in 1995 had $2.54 billion in assets and made grants and other awards of $94.9 million.
"Suppose you were going to make your problem global warming," Mr. Goldmark said. "I don't think you would pick a spend-down policy. But suppose your target were going to be to clean up the Hudson River. You would have made a lot of progress by now. You might have started 20 years ago, and you might have had a 20-year policy and you know what, you'd be just about right."
Earlier this week, Brooke Astor, who has given away $175 million through the Vincent Astor Foundation, decided to fold the foundation and give away its last $25 million by the end of next year. Mrs. Astor, who is 94, said she was taking this course in part because she wanted more time to travel and write poetry.
For some philanthropists, the choice is more a matter of philosophy.
Some conservatives, for example, are drawn to such time-limited philanthropy because they believe some major foundations, including the Ford Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trust, have evolved into liberal institutions that have strayed from the intent of the donor.
"There are distinct advantages" to a time limit, said Terrence Scanlon, president of the Capital Research Center, a conservative research group in Washington, that studies the nonprofit sector. "Donor intent is the principal one. A donor generally leaves his or her money for said purposes and often during the course of the lifetime of a foundation, particularly when you get into the second or third generation, the donor intent goes down the tubes."
Mr. Scanlon called the Ford Foundation "the most egregious one in everybody's eyes" and asserted that Ford's officers were straying far from the founder's conservative intent, "putting beaucoup bucks into every politically correct project that can be devised."
The Ford Foundation, America's largest philanthropy by virtue of its $7.5-billion portfolio and $314 million in annual grants and loans in fiscal 1995, was designed by its founder, Henry Ford, with a broad mission to make "advances in human welfare."
Susan V. Berresford, the Ford Foundation's president, said the foundation's charter reflected its donor's intent. "The donor had total freedom as to how to write that charter," she said. "And what later generations of people ascribe to that donor may or may not be correct. But what is absolutely clearly correct is what the donor said when he or she wrote the charter."
With the vast number and variety of issues that foundations take an interest in, Ms. Berresford said, it should not be surprising that some donors chose to dispose of their portfolios.
But, she added, "my hope is that all would not choose to spend down."
There is by no means a consensus among conservatives in philanthropy about the value of time-limited philanthropy. "People on the conservative side of things see foundations as very problematic," said Michael S. Joyce, president of the Milwaukee-based Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation and a board member of the Philanthropy Roundtable, which perceives itself as a conservative alternative to the Council on Foundations, the major umbrella group of the foundation world. Rather, he said, conservatives see foundations "as agents of centralization and the welfare state."
Mr. Joyce said foundations constantly evolve. Time-limited foundations, he said, will not protect donor intent. "All it does is transfer assets from one set of stewards to another unless you require consumption" of the grant by the recipient, he said.
Some major foundations also see conservatives' focus on donor intent as something of a canard. In the case of the Pew trust, the majority of the foundation's board are family members and many have life terms, said Rebecca W. Rimel, Pew's president. "They are very active and very involved," she said.
Aaron Diamond, a New York real estate developer, and his wife, Irene, had planned to make their philanthropic decisions together, but he died in 1984, just as they were activating the foundation. "We both had a feeling if we stuck with our priorities and really hit hard with money, we would probably be able to make a difference, and I think we have," Mrs. Diamond said.
Mrs. Diamond's most famous philanthropic wager involved investing $25 million to create the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center. In 1995, its director, Dr. David D. Ho, was one of two researchers widely credited with uncovering how the AIDS virus fights with the immune system. Had Mrs. Diamond behaved conventionally, giving away $6.5 million to $7 million a year, creation of the laboratory would have been delayed for years while it searched for other foundations to be partners, said Vincent McGee, the foundation's executive director.
"Because we were spending out in a 10-year period, we have given at least $20 million a year once we got going," he said. "The guiding principle was 'let's not hold this up because we have to find money somewhere else.' And you can only do that if you are biting into capital."

HEADLINE: Isolating Myanmar Would Only Cause Hardship for Its People

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The logic of "Doing Business in Myanmar" (editorial, Dec. 16) and its call for Unocal to withdraw from Myanmar escapes me. If history has shown us anything, it is that economic isolation only causes chaos, suffering and hardship for the people it is intended to help. It does nothing to improve living standards, promote democracy or advance human rights. 
 But the Yadana natural gas pipeline project between Myanmar and Thailand is doing just that. It is creating jobs, new industries and new opportunities for the 35,000 people who live in the pipeline area, an extremely poor and undeveloped region of Myanmar. Unocal and its project partners are providing improved medical care, new and refurbished schools, electrical power and agricultural development programs.
The project -- a joint venture of Unocal, Total of France, Thailand's PTT and Myanmar's MOGE -- has adhered to strict standards on employment practices. Contrary to some reports, there has been no forced or conscripted labor on our project. You imply that a railroad has been built by conscripted labor to "transport Government troops to protect the pipeline." But there is no connection between this railroad and construction of the Yadana pipeline. The railroad right-of-way runs perpendicular to the pipeline, and the railway itself will not be completed until long after the pipeline is up and running.
Unocal's withdrawal from the project would reduce United States influence in Myanmar. It would also further marginalize American influence with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other Asian countries that have commercial and diplomatic contact with Myanmar. Our departure would certainly not foster democracy or improve human rights. The best way for America to advance Myanmar's transition to democracy is to remain involved in the nation's economic development.

HEADLINE: Isolating Myanmar Would Only Cause Hardship for Its People;
Forget Sanctions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Doing Business in Myanmar" (editorial, Dec. 16) was reckless in its disregard of not only the impact of unilateral sanctions on American companies, but also the impact on the targeted governments. Foreign manufacturers are more than willing to fill the void left when American companies are not allowed to export to, or invest in, some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. 
 The National Association of Manufacturers recently commissioned a study cataloguing United States economic sanctions for foreign policy objectives. A preliminary analysis of the data reveals that from 1993 to 1996, more than 50 American laws or executive decisions were adopted imposing unilateral sanctions. An astonishing 31 countries were specifically targeted during this four-year period, together representing more than 60 percent of the world's population, 20 percent of the world's gross domestic product and 22 percent of the world's export markets.
It is often asked, "Does American business support human rights?" The more appropriate question is whether or not denying American manufacturers the ability to export is an appropriate and effective response to human rights violations abroad. It is clear that United States sanctions outside a multilateral framework simply lead to lost American exports and jobs, with little or no impact on the targeted governments.

HEADLINE: Guerrillas in Peru Threaten to Kill Hostages

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Thursday, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Marxist guerrillas continued to hold hundreds of international dignitaries hostage in the Japanese Ambassador's residence here today after saying on Wednesay that they would begin killing their prisoners one by one unless the Peruvian Government agreed to release the rebels' jailed comrades.
President Alberto K. Fujimori, whose Foreign Minister and other top officials were among the 490 hostages taken in a meticulously planned raid, rejected a demand that he meet with the rebels. 
 As the tense standoff continued into Wednesday night, the guerrillas allowed four diplomats to leave the compound to negotiate on their behalf with the Peruvian authorities. The Ambassadors of Greece, Canada and Germany, as well as a French cultural attache, met with Peru's Education Minister, Domingo Palermo, who is serving as the chief negotiator for the Government, at the presidential palace 20 miles away.
The Canadian and German Ambassadors returned to the residence shortly after midnight, then left an hour later. The Canadian Ambassador, Anthony Vincent, read a short statement suggesting that the two sides were talking.
"We have transmitted to the Government a message from the M.R.T.A.," he said referring to the rebel group by its Spanish initials, "in a confidential, unofficial mediation through a representative of the Red Cross. The negotiations will continue."
Inside the residence, the hostages included Ambassadors of Japan, Brazil, Bolivia, Cuba, South Korea, Austria and Venezuela, and about six officials from the United States Embassy.
Peru's Foreign and Agricultural Ministers, six members of congress, the president of the Supreme Court, Mr. Fujimori's brother and dozens of Japanese business people were also reported to be inside.
The attack was a stunning coup by the Tupac Amaru rebel group, which has been overshadowed by the Shining Path guerrillas. It also posed the worst crisis of his Presidency for Mr. Fujimori, who built his popularity on an unbending war against terrorist insurgency.
The guerrillas appear to have singled out the Japanese Ambassador's residence because Japan has been a staunch ally of Mr. Fujimori, whose family is part of a small Japanese immigrant community here.
A rebel leader said in a telephone call to a local radio station on Wednesday that a Japanese diplomat had been chosen as the first to be killed.
The heavily armed guerrillas seized control of the Ambassador's house just as a reception began on Tuesday night in honor of Emperor Akihito's birthday.
Police officials said about 25 rebels stormed the fortified compound from two fronts: some slipped past security by posing as waiters carrying bottles of champagne and hors d'oeuvres, while others used dynamite to blow a hole in a retaining wall from an adjacent house.
After a one-hour gun battle in which the police captured five rebels and injured two, the guerrillas forced the police outside the compound. Several hours later, the rebels released about 170 hostages, mainly women and the elderly, including the mother and sister of Mr. Fujimori.
In telephone calls to local television and radio stations, the rebels said they were prepared to execute hostages, particularly Ambassadors, if the Government did not release several hundred Tupac Amaru members who have been jailed. One of those members is Lori Helene Berenson, a New Yorker who was convicted of treason last year by a secret military tribunal and is serving a life sentence in Yanamayo Prison.
The seizure poses a difficult problem for Mr. Fujimori. He crippled the Shining Path movement by bold military measures, but the Japanese -- who are a leading foreign investor and who have traditionally preferred to negotiate with terrorists -- are urging him to put the safety of the hostages first. Because the residence is Japanese territory, Mr. Fujimori would theoretically need Japan's permission to storm the grounds. Some police officers said they had retreated from the compound during the fighting because they were unsure of their jurisdiction.
The appointment of Mr. Palermo as chief negotiator was both puzzling and troubling to many in diplomatic circles here who said that he has no experience dealing with terrorists and that they believe Mr. Fujimori is considering a commando-style raid to free the hostages.
The seizure sent shock waves throughout the international community, which condemned the attack but encouraged Mr. Fujimori to show restraint. The United States offered to give the Peruvian Government whatever help it needed to resolve the crisis, while insisting that no concessions should be made to win the hostages' release.
"Terrorists should not be rewarded for their crimes," said the State Department's spokesman, Nicholas Burns. "Terrorists should not succeed in their crimes. And our policy is, we won't make concessions. And that's our very strong advice to foreign governments."
The American Embassy in Lima said four of the Americans being held worked for the United States Agency for International Development, the department that dispenses foreign aid overseas.
The attack comes a year after the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement re-emerged when the police arrested 25 members who they said were planning to take the Peruvian Congress hostage. The group was believed to have been defeated two years ago after its top commanders were captured. Experts on terrorism said the assault was perhaps the most significant in the 16 years since the guerrilla groups launched a civil war that has killed more than 30,000 people.
"This is the most spectacular advance by terrorists in the history of Peru's civil war," said Fernando Rospegleose, an expert on terrorism. "Not only did they capture the home of the Japanese, which are a major Fujimori ally, but look at the way they did it. They walked right through the front door."
The reception at the Japanese Ambassador's house was scheduled to begin at 7 P.M. Sometime before that terrorists posing as waiters entered the compound with weapons and gas masks. The United States Ambassador to Peru, Dennis Jett, arrived at 7:15 P.M. and left at 7:45 P.M. for another appointment.
The siege began at 8:05 P.M. when the guerrillas, who had gained access to a house adjacent to the residence, blew a hole in a retaining wall and came onto the grounds close to a tent set up for the reception.
Meanwhile, four or five terrorists walked to the front gate and began throwing grenades at guards. The terrorist began shouting "Live M.R.T.A., Live M.R.T.A.," and entered the compound, where their comrades dressed as waiters gave them with weapons and gas masks.
The police then shot tear gas canisters into the compound, but the terrorists were protected by their masks and only the guests suffered. "I was shaking uncontrollably because I thought I was going to die," said the wife of Peruvian diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
After about an hour of shooting, the Red Cross workers were allowed to enter the compound to check on the condition of the hostages. The hostages were then divided into two groups: the women and elderly were sent to one room and the men to another.
The terrorists then asked for a cameraman to film their demands to be broadcast on television. After a video was broadcast, they began to release the women and the elderly at about 10 P.M.
Among them were Mr. Fujimori's mother, Rosa, and his sister, Juana. Police officials said they believed that Mr. Fujimori's younger brother, Pedro, was still inside the residence.
Government officials, who insisted on not being identified, said they believe that the terrorists would begin releasing many of the 490 hostages because they are too numerous to maintain.
The attack is a major setback for Mr. Fujimori, who had claimed victory over terrorism after waging an aggressive five-year battle in which he seized near dictatorial powers in this country of 24 million people.
Mr. Fujimori was re-elected to a second term last year but has seen his popularity decline in recent months as the economy slowed and his Government failed to address high unemployment and poverty.
Tupac Amaru was never as powerful or as violent as Shining Path, which nearly toppled the Government in the late 1980's, but experts had warned that the group, while weakened, was still dangerous.
Tupac Amaru is estimated to have 300 to 600 members and operates mainly in the upper Huallaga Valley, an area in eastern Peru controlled by guerrillas and drug traffickers. Named for an 18th century Indian leader who fought Spanish colonial control, it took up arms in 1984.
The group had been led by Victor Polay, who was former President Alan Garcia's college roommate in Paris in the early 1970's. Mr. Polay was captured in June 1992 and is serving a life prison term.
Shining Path, which follows a Maoist doctrine and has about 2,000 active members, considers Tupac Amaru a traitor to Communism and the two groups have often warred with each other for "taxes" from cocaine smugglers in the Huallaga. Abimael Guzman, Shining Path's founder, was captured in 1993.

DIXIE RISING
How the South Is Shaping American Values, Politics and Culture
By Peter Applebome
385 pages. Times Books. $25.
 Peter Applebome is a journalist who has spent most of his adult years dissecting the South for The New York Times and a couple of journals published in Texas (which may or may not qualify as a Southern state). He has toured the Elvis-a-Rama in Branson, Mo. He joined in the procession from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., on the 30th anniversary of the famous march for voting rights that helped to shape the civil rights movement of the 1960's. He once sat at George Wallace's bedside as the former segregationist talked about Holy Scripture, repentance and Elvis. And he ate chow mein with the Louisiana Klansman David Duke.
None of which makes him authentically Southern, however, despite his patent liking for the place. By his own admission, Mr. Applebome has never read "Gone With the Wind." And he doesn't write much about washin' down Moon Pies with slugs of warm RC Cola while sittin' under the kudzu vines in the sorts of picturesque Southern backwaters described in the memoirs of professional Southerners, like humorists and country singers. 
 Instead, he argues in his new book, "Dixie Rising," that the South is no longer that strange, peculiar, horrifying yet beguiling place that is, or was, a kind of foreign nation inside our borders -- the South, the Deep South, as opposed to the United States. When Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind" was published in 1936 the South was, in Franklin D. Roosevelt's words, "the nation's No. 1 economic problem."
The South was also a jumble of wildly contradictory images: white-columned mansions, sullen poverty, segregation enforced by draconian Jim Crow laws, the mighty dams and power lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the go-go business-and-boosterism ethos of Atlanta, exemplifying the New South.
But slowly and surely, while we weren't paying much attention, sometime between then and now -- between Scarlett O'Hara's first flouncy appearance on the front porch of Tara and Newt Gingrich's rise to power in Cobb County, Ga. (a 90 percent white, suburban outpost of Atlanta where Scarlett's latter-day cousins aspire to dwell) -- America was batter-dipped and Southern-fried. They became us.
Air-conditioning made the region south of the Mason-Dixon Line habitable by Yankees: cool artificial breezes have created a viable Sun Belt, where everybody wants to live these days. That's where the jobs are, too. Factories have moved southward in the last 20 years, lured by the historical absence of labor unions. The unorganized Dixie work force reflects the same Southern independence of mind that gave us Jefferson Davis, states' rights and a festering mistrust of government -- now almost universal, from Maine to Florida.
The solid South of the New Deal era is mostly Republican and suburban today, just like the rest of the country. Politicians of all stripes thump Bibles just like old-time Southern preachers. Country music straight from Nashville is the anthem of the middle-aged and the middle class everywhere. The President of the United States is a bubba from Arkansas. And the racial prejudice once attributed exclusively to white Southerners is a national scandal, seen in its purest form in the California courtrooms where trials related to the Rodney G. King beating, the Los Angeles riots and the O. J. Simpson murder case play themselves out in anger, pain, dashed hopes and mean-spirited recriminations.
Out of the words of virtually any Southern leader of note in the last 40 years, Mr. Applebome has marshaled impressive firsthand evidence to prove his point. But beneath the slick political surface of his argument lurks a corrosive cultural crisis that has not been so much analyzed as viewed in passing, from the front seat of a speeding pickup truck. Like many of his sources, Mr. Applebome sees the character of the South ebbing away in the cul de sac suburbs of the 1990's and the gentrified inner cities that all look just alike, whether they're in Nashville or Charlotte, N.C., or Boston.
In Charlotte, it's cookie-cutter office towers with atriums (a mark, of course, of a "world-class" city). In Nashville, it's the venerable old Lower Broadway music dives being nudged into oblivion by the global sophistication of Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock Cafe. It's a sense of community that's missing now, or the pre-sweetened nativism evoked in films like "Fried Green Tomatoes" and "Steel Magnolias."
The underlying issue in all of this is not the South, although the gracious, friendly mint-julep-on-the-front-porch South may be an antidote. In their all but identical tract houses in neighborless suburbs, Americans as a whole feel disconnected and rootless and all alone. Today we long to live, if not in the old South, then in some other Shangri-La that looks suspiciously like Beaver Cleaver's hometown, circa 1953. Mr. Applebome is really describing a troubled nation rummaging through the attic of its own history in search of solace.
Each chapter of "Dixie Rising" takes its title and character from a Southern town: Selma, Ala.; Columbia, S.C.; Honea Path, S.C., and so forth. Chapter 6, on Charlotte, tells the story of an American city caught between the charms of a moonlight-on-the-magnolias yesterday and a bleak tomorrow. It isn't just a matter of style, Southern graciousness versus the kind of Yankee enterprise that blights the landscape with office parks clad in mirrored glass.
Charlotte is a complicated town where old racial conflicts seemed about to be eradicated in the 1970's. School integration worked so well there that Charlotte schoolchildren were sending letters of encouragement to kids in Boston, urging them to reject the politics of hate. But like cities in the Midwest and the North, Charlotte sprawled into urban chaos in the 1980's and 90's, busing became impractical, the old fervor burnt itself out and Charlotte now relies on magnet schools to keep the idea of multiracial education alive. When a black minister was installed in a traditionally white church in 1994, his congregation simply melted away.
Charlotte today, in Mr. Applebome's telling, sounds less like the fabled South and more like Boston or Minneapolis or Los Angeles, a collection of interest groups in search of a sustaining vision of community. The South is us, and it's a pity.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Yen Weakens And Trade Deficit Declines

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened yesterday on new fears of economic weakness in Japan, a surprise drop in the United States trade deficit and a rebound on Wall Street.
The combination of a spill in the Tokyo stock market and rally in this country suggested that more Japanese investors were moving holdings out of Japan and converting yen to dollars, raising demand for dollars. 
 "There's an asset shift from Japan to the United States," Thomas Arnold, a trader at the New York branch of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said. "That would be my suspicion."
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 114.04 yen from 113.69 yen on Wednesday and its first close above 114 yen since Dec. 2. The dollar rose to 1.5572 marks from 1.5518 marks. The pound fell to $1.6647 from $1.6748.
The dollar increased early on deepening pessimism in Japan over the economic outlook there. On Wednesday, the Government forecast a growth rate of 1.9 percent in the next fiscal year, the lowest projection since World War II.
The forecast reinforced a view that interest rates in Japan, at record lows since September 1995, were not likely to rise well into next year. The low rates have contributed to a rising outflow of investor money from Japan and a weak Japanese stock market.
"The Japanese have got a lot of money to throw around, and a lot of it is coming this way," Jan Alvarez, chief foreign exchange dealer at Corestates Bank in Philadelphia, said.
The dollar was bolstered further after the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit shrank by 30.2 percent, to $7.99 billion in October, a much bigger decline than expected. A shrinking deficit helps the dollar because it means there are fewer dollars held by foreign exporters that must be converted to their own currencies.
Although the data showed the United States deficit with Japan actually rose to a 14-month high, traders shrugged it off because most of the increase reflected a temporary surge in auto imports.
Traders said there was little or no reaction in foreign-exchange markets when the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged at its last meeting of 1996. That decision had been widely expected.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Declined Sharply in October

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit declined sharply in October despite widening gaps with Japan and China, the two nations that have been the focus of American trade policy, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department reported that the deficit fell by 30.2 percent, to $7.99 billion -- the lowest figure since March -- from $11.44 billion in September. 
 Exports rose to a new monthly record of $71.73 billion, up 4 percent for the month, driven by foreign sales of aircraft, telecommunications equipment and semiconductors. Imports declined seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $79.72 billion, partly because of a strike against the General Motors Corporation in Canada that reduced shipments of cars and parts to the United States.
The October figures brought the deficit for the first 10 months of 1996 to $94.47 billion, about $2 billion more than the amount at the same point last year, making it all but certain that the total for 1996 will surpass last year's deficit of $105.1 billion.
While much of the growth in the deficit has been caused by the higher price of imported oil, a rise in the deficit for all of 1996 would be the fifth consecutive annual increase.
The deficit with Japan in October rose to $4.96 billion from $3.79 billion in September, largely reflecting a surge in automobile imports at the beginning of the model year. For the first 10 months of the year, however, the deficit with Japan is down 24 percent compared with the corresponding period in 1995.
But the deficit with China, which rose to $4.90 billion in October from $4.73 billion in September, is running 16.7 percent higher so far this year.
The overall decline in the deficit was larger than economists had expected. Analysts said that the rise in exports during October suggested that the economy could be growing faster in the fourth quarter than they had expected.
Clinton Administration officials said they were heartened by the increase in exports, which have been stagnant or down for most of this year after growing steadily in previous years and contributing significantly to the economy's health.
"There was some concern last month that exports had dropped slightly and were not growing at the same rate as in the last two years," said Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor. "Now it looks like they're growing again at a fairly rapid clip."
Mr. Kantor said the jump in the deficit with Japan was not surprising because it tends to shoot up every October as Japanese car companies ship their new models to dealers in the United States. But he called the rising deficit with China, which has now become the single biggest concern of the Administration's trade policy, just further evidence of China's recalcitrance in opening its market despite constant prodding from Washington.
Among the nation's other big trading partners, the deficit with the European Union widened, while the deficits with Mexico and Canada narrowed.
The increase in exports suggested that American industry was producing goods and services at a somewhat greater rate than economists had been predicting. As a result, some economists said they were raising their projections about economic growth in the fourth quarter.
Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said he was now estimating that fourth-quarter growth would be between 2 percent and 2.5 percent, up from his earlier estimate of 1.6 percent. The economy grew 2 percent in the third quarter.
Economists said it was unclear whether the rise in exports in October would carry over into figures for the rest of the year. Aircraft deliveries, which accounted for nearly half the increase, jump up and down from month to month.
And some exporters, including the auto makers, continue to complain that the resurging strength of the dollar this year has made them less competitive because it makes their products more expensive in foreign-currency terms while giving imported products a relative pricing advantage in the United States.
But David Orr, an economist at the First Union Corporation, said that there should not be any widespread harm to American exporters unless the dollar strengthened to 130 Japanese yen from its current level of slightly less than 115 and to 1.80 German marks from its current level of 1.55.

HEADLINE: The Enduring Espionage Wars

 BODY:
The spy games of the cold war have proved more durable than the cold war itself. A few weeks ago a fast-rising officer of the Central Intelligence Agency was charged with selling secrets to Russia in recent years. Now a supervisor at the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been arrested and accused of similar misdeeds in the late 1980's and early 1990's. No doubt the C.I.A. has been working just as feverishly in Moscow to learn the secrets of the Russian intelligence services. All this espionage activity seems excessive.
It would be unrealistic and naive to expect the United States and Russia to cease all spying on each other, even after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. There is still secret information about Russian conventional and nuclear forces that Washington needs to know to protect its interests and allies, and Moscow wants to learn more about American foreign and military policies than it can pick up in the newspapers. But the intensity of espionage activity, particularly the elaborate chess game still being contested between the intelligence agencies of the two countries, seems out of proportion to the threat either nation now represents to the other. 
 At a time when the United States is assisting Russia with the dismantling of its nuclear weapons, buying highly enriched uranium from Russian warheads and supporting international financial assistance to Moscow, it is baffling that the C.I.A. and its Russian counterpart are still trying to outfox one another as if the cold war had not ended. The game itself seems more important to its practitioners than the reasons for it. The Byzantine maneuvering cannot help but sow suspicion between the two countries. The Russian efforts seem especially energetic, but that may be only because American agents in Russia have not been caught. Earl Edwin Pitts, a 13-year F.B.I. veteran, was charged on Wednesday with selling information to the Russians from 1987 to 1992 for $224,000. Federal prosecutors say Mr. Pitts gave Moscow a good look at how the bureau tries to combat Russian espionage in the United States, including a full list of Russians suspected of spying here and the names of the F.B.I. agents investigating them.
This betrayal was not as damaging as the hemorrhage of secrets engineered by Aldrich Ames of the C.I.A., or the more recent activities of another agency officer, Harold Nicholson, which suggested how eagerly Moscow is still trying to get past the defenses of the C.I.A. and F.B.I. For such a small investment -- $180,000 in the Nicholson case -- the opportunities for mischief must seem enticing to Russian intelligence officials.
The F.B.I., for its part, has been busy trying to turn Russian officials based in New York and Washington into American spies. It first learned in 1995 that Mr. Pitts might have worked for Moscow from a Russian who once worked for the Soviet Mission at the United Nations.
Not so long ago the American Government needed intelligence agencies to monitor every aspect of the Soviet Union, from the state of the Soviet economy to the health of the Soviet leader. These days when the Russian President has heart problems, an American surgeon is summoned to Moscow to help diagnose the ailment. There may be a lesson in that for Russian and American spy agencies.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Mets Show a Strong Interest in Jays' Olerud

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Toronto Blue Jays snatched Roger Clemens out of the Yankees' grasp a week ago, but now they are on the verge of sending one of their players to New York. He is John Olerud, and the Mets are seriously discussing a trade that would make him their first baseman.
Gord Ash, the Blue Jays' general manager, yesterday confirmed a report from the general manager of another club that Ash and Joe McIlvaine, the Mets' general manager, have been negotiating a trade for Olerud, who won the American League batting title in 1993 by hitting .363 but who has steadily declined in the three seasons since. 
 "I think it's fairly serious," Ash said by telephone from Toronto. "This is a deal not untypical of deals in baseball today. A lot centers around his salary. We're pretty well set on players. It's just a matter of talking about the rest of it. The economics of this deal are enough to make or break it."
McIlvaine did not deny he had spoken with Ash, but he declined to confirm or deny that the talks have been about Olerud, who bats and throws left-handed.
"I'm looking for another hitter in the lineup," he said.
Ash declined to identify the players the Blue Jays would receive from the Mets, but acknowledged that the matter to be resolved deals with how much money the Blue Jays would give the Mets to help offset Olerud's $6.5 million salary next season.
In recent trades of high-salaried players, the teams trading the players have included money in the deals. The Detroit Tigers did it when they traded Ruben Sierra to the Cincinnati Reds, and the Pittsburgh Pirates did it last Friday when they traded Jeff King and Jay Bell to the Kansas City Royals. In those instances, the trading teams made the deals to shed salaries.
"I would suggest that probably is the area of greatest concern," Ash said of the amount of money that would be included. "We do not view John as a player who would be a dump job. We think John can still contribute to our ball club, especially since the dynamics of our club have changed over the last couple weeks."
Ash referred to the acquisition of Clemens and catcher Benito Santiago as free agents and second baseman Carlos Garcia and Orlando Merced in a trade. The Blue Jays had viewed Merced as a right fielder, but he could become their first baseman if they trade Olerud.
The Mets traded their first baseman, Rico Brogna, to Philadelphia on Nov. 27 for two relief pitchers whom they expect to bolster their bullpen. They since have said that Butch Huskey would play first base. But no one, including them, seemed to feel comfortable with Huskey as their only option.
Olerud, 28, made a run at batting .400 in 1993; he was at that figure as late as Aug. 2, but he batted only .290 the rest of the season and wound up at .363. After driving in 69 runs by the All-Star Game, he knocked in only 40 more.
The drop-off was ominous. The next season he hit .297, then slipped to .291 and fell to .274 last season, in which he also hit 18 home runs and drove in 61 runs. If the Mets acquire him, they would do so hoping that baseball's walk-year magic works. Olerud is entering the last year of his contract and can be a free agent a year from now. Players with that status often have outstanding seasons, just in time to attract lucrative offers.
Ash said he and McIlvaine first talked about Olerud last Thursday and continued their conversations Friday, Tuesday and yesterday. He said he expects that they will talk again today.
 
INSIDE PITCH
Major League Baseball officially released the 214-game interleague schedule for 1997, the first time teams from each league will play each other during the regular season. The first set of games will be played June 12 between teams in the two West Divisions. The Mets will play at Yankee Stadium June 16-18. The Mets' first interleague games will be against Boston at Shea Stadium on June 13-15. The Yankees will play the Marlins in Florida those same days.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Surge As Inflation Remains Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury market surged yesterday, amid more signs that the economy is slowing and inflation remains low. Market enthusiasm was lifted by a report on manufacturing and by a solid Treasury auction. Interest rates in general fell near the levels of a week ago.
The Treasury's 30-year benchmark bond, the barometer by which most lending rates are set, was up 116/32 , to a price of 9829/32 , and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was down to 6.58 percent, from 6.70 percent on Wednesday. The yield was the lowest since 6.57 percent last Friday, and bondholders yesterday made about $15 per $1,000 of bonds held. 
 Bond prices rose sharply after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported its index of regional business activity. The index of current business conditions fell to minus 2.2 points in December from plus 6.4 in November, suggesting that factory operations were slowing. The prices paid component, an indicator of inflation, was 13.9 points, down from 14.6. Bond prices generally respond positively to signs of economic slowing because they indicate a reduced threat of inflation.
The market had been beaten down recently by signs of strength in housing, concerns about strong holiday retail sales and the large supply of debt coming to market from the government and the corporate side. Analysts, however, said that one difference between yesterday and Wednesday, when bonds fell sharply, was that fewer corporate issues, which compete with government securities, were put on the market.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the economic statistics were continuing to point to more modest economic growth than was recorded in the summer. He pointed to a separate report on initial jobless claims for last week, which rose somewhat. The claims were up by only 1,000, to 351,000, but a sharp upward revision to the prior week's filings resulted in the highest four-week average in the last five months, 340,250.
"While far from being a perfect guide to upcoming payroll data," Mr. Fine said, "at the same time, the initial claims figures are certainly not suggesting overly rapid economic growth."
He said the Fed bank's report also suggested slowing growth, though "the Philadelphia Fed index is known to be quite volatile, and thus these results must be interpreted with caution."
The Treasury's auction of five-year notes yesterday went well, traders said, helping bond prices climb over all in the day's trading. The five-year note was awarded at a high yield of 6.165 percent, up from 5.950 percent last month and the highest since Oct. 23, when the yield was 6.325 percent.
Also contributing to the strong rally was short-covering, in which traders are forced to buy securities to cover mistaken bets that prices would continue to fall.
The rise of the dollar against foreign currencies also helped. A strong dollar makes investments like United States Treasury securities more attractive.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Labor Statistics Chief Takes Issue With Critics of Inflation Index

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
In the first formal response to calls for a reduction in the index that measures inflation, the head of the agency that compiles the statistic said today that no significant remedies could be adopted before 1999.
"There is not a lot, in the short term at least, for us to be doing," Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said at a briefing about the conclusion of a Congressionally appointed panel that the Consumer Price Index exaggerates inflation by 1.1 percentage points annually. 
 Although a few refinements of the C.P.I. are under way, Ms. Abraham's statement means that if the index is to be changed to produce significant savings, Congress rather than the Government will have to do the job. Such changes might be deemed too politically risky to attempt.
Congress would have to mandate, say, a "diet COLA" -- a reduction in the cost-of-living adjustments made in the payments to tens of millions of recipients of Social Security and other Federal pension programs. While that would cut the budget deficit, it would do so at a direct cost to important political constituencies.
About 30 percent of the Government's spending is tied to the index, as are income tax brackets and the size of personal exemptions.
As is customary for an official of a bureau that jealously guards its reputation for nonpartisan professionalism, Ms. Abraham refused to make any recommendations on how the Government should proceed.
Indeed, she said it would not be possible for the bureau to move much faster in making the index a closer approximation of the cost of living.
Besides a lack of specialist expertise, Ms. Abraham has pointed to knotty conceptual problems, such as unquantifiable subjective judgments about such things as whether substitutable products are equally satisfying to consumers.
The five-member commission, made up mostly of academics, was appointed by the Senate Finance Committee and was headed by Michael J. Boskin, a Stanford University professor who was the chief economic adviser to President George Bush.
Ms. Abraham was critical of certain recommendations by the panel, but welcomed others. She also tried to correct what she called misimpressions by the public. The bureau does, for example, make adjustments for changes in the quality of goods, such as durability, she said.
One objection was to the idea of applying some kind of empirical formula to an issue called substitution bias, which arises when consumers switch to other products in response to price changes. "Our initial reaction," she said, "is negative."
But the Commissioner added that "we are receptive to the spirit" of a recommendation to create a new, supplemental cost-of-living index that would be published annually. It would employ a so-called "superlative" formula that would allow revisions to reflect fresh data, including new products.
She also said the bureau was changing the methodology for gauging hospital inflation by looking at the bills of actual patients rather than asking hospitals what they charge for individual items.
The issues raised by the Boskin commission "are not new problems," Ms. Abraham said. She pledged specifically to pursue recommendations to investigate using more leasing data for automotive prices, directly pricing health insurance policies and collecting more prices on weekends when goods often go on sale.

HEADLINE: Late Payments on Credit Cards Are Down

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Late payments on credit cards dropped to a seasonally adjusted 3.48 percent in this year's third quarter from an all-time high of 3.66 percent in the second quarter.
It was the first decrease in two years, the American Bankers Association said this week. 
 "We hope that the drop is a sign that consumers are taking control of their finances, rather than just taking a quick break before hitting the next holiday sale," James Chessen, chief economist of the association, said.
The new data, if they become a trend, are a positive sign in a consumer credit situation that has troubled banks, Federal regulators and credit card companies.
Banks, for their part, appear to be showing restraint after years of bombarding consumers with credit card offers.
This comes as Americans are declaring bankruptcy in record numbers. Bankruptcy filings were up 26 percent, to 1.11 million, for the year ended Sept. 30.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 126.87; Point Increase Is 2d Best Ever

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Driven by a decline in interest rates and trading in the futures market, the Dow Jones industrial average raced to its second-best point increase in history yesterday, surging 126.87 points, to 6,473.64. But in percentage terms, the Dow's jump of 2 percent was just the 47th best since the 1987 crash.
Yet, coming on the top of gains on Tuesday and Wednesday, the rally may help dispel some of the chill from the early December selloff that brought the Dow down 4.3 percent from the record high it hit at the end of November. Yesterday's spurt left the Dow 74 points below its closing high. 
 But figuring the longer-term direction of the market may have to wait until next week or the beginning of the year.
The best Dow point performance was a surge of 186.84, or 10.15 percent, on Oct. 21, 1987, two days after the 508-point crash.
Traders and market strategists said that yesterday's surge was in part fueled by the fact that the stock market's major futures and options contracts expire at the end of this week. The trading around those expiration dates can make the market volatile but not always give a true indication of market sentiment or where it is going.
Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, which manages about $25 billion in mutual funds, said he did not think the clear shift in sentiment witnessed in the last two days presaged a run-up like that of November, when stock prices rose about 8 percent.
"This is a continuation of the pattern that has been frustrating portfolio managers," with the gain in a few Dow Industrial stocks outweighing the gains in the broader market. Four Dow stocks -- Procter & Gamble, Merck, General Electric and Du Pont -- accounted for more than a third of the Dow's gain yesterday. Procter & Gamble surged 4 1/8, to 108 1/4, while G.E. jumped 3 1/2, to 102 3/4. Merck soared 4 3/8, to 81 1/4, and Du Pont added 3 1/8, to 96 1/8.
Mr. Herrmann attributed the sharp, sudden rally to recent economic news, including yesterday's report of rising jobless claims and a narrowing of the trade deficit, which cheered bond market investors. In addition, expectations of continued low interest rates in Japan might bring capital from that country to the United States, he said.
"This is a big interest-rate rally put into overdrive by triple witching tomorrow," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, referring to the day on which the three major futures and option contracts expire.
The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 6.58 percent yesterday from 6.70 percent the day before, possibly ending a rate surge that had pushed yields from their post-election low of 6.35 percent.
Yet Mr. Shulman noted that the stock market rallied Wednesday, when interest rates jumped. "The test of the market is next week or after everyone comes back from the holidays," he said.
Michael Schwartz, chief options strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, said, "There is no way to indicate from this where the market goes tomorrow." The investors trying to profit on the difference between current stock prices and those reflected in the futures market "don't care where the market goes," he added. "They are just taking advantage of the spread."
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 14.22 points, or 1.94 percent, to 745.76. But the techology-laden Nasdaq composite index, which led the market higher on Wednesday, did not fare as well. And the same was true for stocks of smaller companies. The Nasdaq index rose 10.48 points, or 0.82 percent, to 1,295.86, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller capitalization stocks climbed 3.02 points, or 0.86 percent, to 356.10.
"We've had a big change in psychology on a very short notice," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at the John Hancock Funds.
In recent weeks, as Wall Street's big brokerage houses trotted out their market strategists to offer up forecasts for 1997, a drumbeat of restrained expectations fed the pessimism that was already gathering within the equity markets.
Just as the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, warned of "irrational exuberance," many market analysts reminded investors that back-to-back gains of more than 20 percent in stock prices were rarely followed by a third such increase.
Many mutual fund investors apparently listened to those warnings, Mr. Freedman said. Cash flows into equity funds have all but dried up this month. "We're seeing a lot of activity in our mutual funds from people who seem to think they can move in and out and time the market," he said.
Thomas McManus, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said that "this might be the beginning of another up move." But, he added, "one person I doubt is buying is Alan Greenspan."

U.S. Trade Deficit Dropped By 30.2 Percent in October
The nation's trade deficit declined sharply in October despite widening gaps with Japan and China. The Commerce Department reported that the deficit fell by 30.2 percent, to $7.99 billion -- the lowest figure since March -- from $11.44 billion in September.
Exports rose 4 percent to a new monthly record of $71.73 billion, while imports declined seven-tenths of 1 percent to $79.72 billion. Still, the October figures brought the deficit for the first 10 months of the year to $94.47 billion, about $2 billion more than the amount at the same point last year. [Page D2.]
 
Prices Surge in Treasury Market
The Treasury market surged on signs that the economy is slowing, and inflation remains low. The 30-year bond climbed 116/32 , to a price of 9829/32 , pushing its yield down to 6.58 percent, from 6.70 percent on Wednesday. [D18.]
 
Former Lazard Partner Sentenced
A Federal judge in Boston sentenced Mark S. Ferber, a former partner in Lazard Freres, to 33 months in prison and fined him $1 million, ending one of the biggest criminal cases in municipal finance. At the same time, Mr. Ferber settled fraud allegations with the Securities and Exchange Commission by agreeing to pay an additional $650,000 and to be barred from the securities industry. [D6.]
 
No Revision in C.P.I. Before 1999
In her first formal response to calls for a reduction in the Consumer Price Index, which critics contend overstates inflation, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, the agency that compiles the statistic, cautioned that no significant remedies could be adopted before 1999. Many cost-of-living-adjustments, like those for Social Security, are based on the index. [A25.]
 
G.M. Talks Down Earnings Outlook
General Motors, suffering from Japanese and European competition, is encouraging analysts to reduce their estimates of its fourth-quarter earnings. It has cited a variety of marketing, sales and production costs, including higher rebates, heavy spending on advertising, slowing car sales, slightly heavier loan losses and the after-effects of two large strikes. [D2.]
 
Cruise Line Accused of Pollution
Royal Caribbean Cruises, a huge cruise line based in Miami that has advertised its commitment to protecting the environment, routinely dumped waste oil from five ships for years and falsified its logbooks to hide its activities, a 10-count felony indictment by a grand jury in Puerto Rico says. [A26.]
 
French Drug Stocks Surge
French drug stocks surged as Elf Aquitaine S.A. proposed that its pharmaceutical unit, Sanofi S.A., form a strategic alliance with another company. Sanofi rose 6 percent. [D4.]
 
Toyota Considers Aircraft Business

Shares in Protein Design Labs Up
Shares of Protein Design Lab have gained nearly 25 percent since it disclosed on Monday that it had been awarded a broad patent covering the production of so-called humanized antibodies in mice, and analysts are still bullish. Market Place. [D6.]
 
Charges Filed in Amcor Tax Case
Eight years after the I.R.S. began investigating Amcor Capital -- certain that its agricultural tax shelters were frauds costing the Treasury up to $1 billion -- the first criminal charges were brought in the case. Those charged, however, were not Amcor executives, but a man who had given a tip to the I.R.S. and an associate. [D4.]
 
TV Ratings System Introduced
Network television executives introduced the new rating system that the industry will begin using in January with labels ranging from TV-Y (for all children) to TV-M to alert parents to increasing levels of sexual or violent subject matter.

HEADLINE: A Casino Boat Sails From Brooklyn, Leaving Debate Ashore

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
The roulette wheels spun, the chips clicked and clacked and the gamblers pleaded with the dice. But the tipoff that this was not Monte Carlo, or even Atlantic City, was on the waitresses' trays. Beside the glasses of scotch and white wine were little purple-and-white packets of Dramamine.
So it was on the maiden voyage of the Liberty I, the 162-foot luxury yacht and floating casino that sailed last night from controversy ashore into choppy seas. The vessel will make daily five-hour trips from a pier in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, taking gamblers beyond the three-mile limit of state laws to try their luck. 
 Besides the concern of city officials about a possible proliferation of such boats, and the complaints of Sheepshead Bay neighbors about potential parking and traffic problems, the operators of Bay Cruises last night had to contend with the fickle North Atlantic winter weather. As a cold mist swirled outside, at least a dozen of the 200 gamblers aboard fell seasick soon after the vessel got under way.
But while the seas, at three to five feet, were slightly higher than cruise organizers had anticipated, they said they had not interfered with the floating casino's operations. "I think it's really going off without a hitch," said Michael Kornblum, a real estate developer and one of the owners of Bay Cruises. "I think we're giving people the kind of leisure activity they want. They feel at home."
And most of the gamblers hovering around the yacht's 146 slot machines and dozen gambling tables seemed to agree.
Eddie Azar, a 43-year-old sales representative for a home furnishings company who started with $400 worth of chips, threw the first roll on the craps table at 8:20 P.M., just as the yacht sailed beyond the three-mile limit. After his roll, a four and a two, he said: "I think it's great. I mean, it's not a great night for it tonight, but even with that, it's a lot better than Atlantic City, right?"
While overnight gambling cruises are already operating from New York, the Sheepshead Bay venture is the only one in the city to offer short day cruises, with prices ranging from $29 to $49. Operators hope the boat will lure thousands of gamblers who might otherwise head for Atlantic City or the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut.
But the boat has quickly become a lightning rod for controversy, signaling what some believe could be the start of a burgeoning new industry along New York City's waterfront and accelerating an age-old debate about whether casino gambling should be allowed in New York State.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced this week that he was creating a commission to oversee operators of gambling ships that sail out of New York City. And yesterday, he advised New Yorkers not to take the cruises on Liberty I until city officials complete background checks on the casino's operators.
The Mayor said he had no indication that the boat's owners had done anything improper, but added: "My warning to people would be not to use this service until it has been checked out, until the background of the people involved has been looked at."
"We have no idea whether or not they're treating people fairly," Mr. Giuliani added.
But despite the Mayor's warnings, tickets for last night's voyage were sold out yesterday morning. Andrew Stengel, a Bay Cruises spokesman, said: "We hope the Mayor changes his mind once he gets to know our operation and the people behind it The principals of Bay Cruises have unblemished records."
From the Rockaways to Niagara Falls, communities throughout New York State have sought gambling ventures with the hope that they would bolster their economies.
Developers introduced a proposal last year to sail gambling cruise ships from the former Navy home port in Staten Island, a plan that is being reviewed by the city's Economic Development Corporation. And the State Legislature will consider a measure next year to legalize casino gambling in the Catskills and Niagara Falls regions.
But it was a surprise to many community residents, local politicians and industry watchers when casino gambling suddenly emerged in Sheepshead Bay, sidestepping the broader debate about whether it should be allowed in the state, and in particular New York City, where it has been banned since the 1840's.
"This is a test case and I think a lot of people are watching to see if it can work," said Councilman Jerome X. O'Donovan of Staten Island.
"Within one year, if it's profitable, I think you'll see a new industry being born. It takes three hours to get to Atlantic City, five hours to get to Las Vegas, and 20 minutes to get to Sheepshead Bay."
The owners of Bay Cruises said they deliberately kept their venture low key out of fear that larger gambling interests in Atlantic City and Connecticut would try to interfere with their operation. But the secrecy with which the operation was prepared, and the fact that it falls below the radar of regulations, have alarmed some politicians and local residents.
"If a private operator operating from a private pier can set up shop in Sheepshead Bay without regulation, and without any level of public consultation, there doesn't seem to be any obstacle to their doing the same in City Island or Staten Island," said Councilman Anthony D. Weiner, Democrat of Brooklyn, who represents Sheepshead Bay.
But gambling executives and community representatives say there are several potential obstacles that might discourage an expansion of such gambling junkets along New York City's waterfront, ranging from community opposition to such ventures, to limited space for parking lots, to the choppy waters that might discourage customers.
Jason Ader, managing director for Bear, Stearns & Company and a senior gambling industry analyst, said such boats have enjoyed success in Florida but failed in Galveston, Tex.
"There's a lot of infrastructure constraints in developing these cruises in terms of locations," he said. "The ability to get into international waters, finding the dock space, and again the market for that product is more limited than that of a land-based casino."
The Liberty I is already encountering some resistance. The city's Parks Department canceled a temporary permit that would have allowed Bay Cruises to do some work in preparation for putting in a 150-space parking lot near the pier. Mr. Giuliani and the chairman of the area's community board have said that the company had not fully disclosed its plans, a charge that company officials deny.
But such concerns did not seem to trouble the gamblers aboard last night. While there were a few complaints about having to pay for drinks -- $5.75 for cocktails, which are generally free in landlocked casinos -- and the length of the cruise -- the $49 admission was supposed to buy a four-hour trip, but the ribbon-cutting and the need to funnel 200 people through one metal detector cut it to three hours -- most guests appeared to enjoy the hors d'oeuvres, the music and, of course, the action. The blackjack tables, which had minimum bets of $5 and up, were mostly full.
Paul Boritzer, 32, who owns a scrap metal company in Manhattan, started the evening with $200 in chips at the craps table. After the boat returned to Brooklyn early this morning, he said, "I lost just about everything but I still had fun."

HEADLINE: A Cuomo Seen as One of 4 Final Cabinet Picks

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
President Clinton plans to round out his selection of a new Cabinet on Friday with the announcement of his choices for several remaining openings, including that of Andrew Cuomo, the eldest son of the former New York Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Administration officials said today.
The other selections that aides said would be announced on Friday are Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena, who would move to the Department of Energy; Rodney Slater, the Federal Highway Administrator, who would replace Mr. Pena, and Alexis Herman, a White House aide, who is to be nominated as Labor Secretary. 
 Mr. Clinton met with the four this evening, and they agreed to accept his nomination, the officials said.
While Mr. Cuomo had said recently that he would be returning to New York, where he was being mentioned as a possible candidate to oppose Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in 1998, friends said he would not be able to resist a Cabinet post and a chance to shape the nation's housing policy.
For Mr. Cuomo, who is Assistant Secretary of Housing, the appointment would cap a career that began more than a decade ago when he began serving as an unpaid adviser to his father.
While he remained his father's most trusted political adviser, he left Albany to chart his own course, founding Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, or HELP, now the nation's largest private provider of interim housing for the homeless.
Despite tensions between Mr. Clinton and Governor Cuomo in 1991 and 1992, when the Governor was trying to decide whether to run for the Presidency, the younger Mr. Cuomo joined the Clinton Administration as its chief proponent for the homeless. And he managed to develop a constituency at the White House, helping to sell the idea of empowerment zones, a $6 billion program intended to lure businesses into the inner cities through tax incentives and Federal spending.
Mr. Cuomo would replace Henry G. Cisneros.
Officials said that Aida Alvarez, the director of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight at HUD, would be named the choice for director of the Small Business Administration if its current director, Phil Lader, leaves as expected.
Mr. Clinton is also expected to nominate Janet L. Yellen of the Federal Reserve Board to replace Joseph Stiglitz as head of the Council of Economic Advisers, two Administration officials said.
The President has announced his choice of Madeleine K. Albright as Secretary of State, Senator William S. Cohen of Maine as Defense Secretary and Bill Daley as Commerce Secretary.
Mr. Clinton plans to formally extend the terms of Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Last week, he extended the stays of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, Attorney General Janet Reno and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala.

HEADLINE: Inflation Is More Than a Pocketbook Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The graph accompanying David Hackett Fischer's Dec. 15 Op-Ed article on the history of inflation and its interactions with political stability reflects a truism about the unique character of recent economic history. The chronological rate of the increase of prices, and presumably the rate of occurrence of concomitant political upheavals, has been much faster in the 20th century than that of any earlier "price revolutions."
If the compressed time scale is taken into account, relationships of recent trends to economic and political antecedents may become clearer. For example, the virtual abandonment of progressivity in our income taxes, culminating in the Reagan tax cuts, is much more pervasive in its pernicious influence than the mere fact that it increased the national debt sixfold. 
 Mr. Fischer writes that his research identifies growing inequality between rich and poor as a dominant influence in causing the destructive climaxes to previous price revolutions. Since our government and culture have promoted such inequality through tax laws favoring the well-to-do, any analysis of what we are doing to ourselves should start with our elitist tax policy.

HEADLINE: Inflation Is More Than a Pocketbook Issue;
Compared to What?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The study of price increases in England by David Hackett Fischer in "Micro, Macro and Way Beyond" (Op-Ed, Dec. 15) is flawed. He attributes the rise in his index of prices to "waves" or "cycles," which are meaningless as causations.
Studying the exchange rate between the English currency and gold shows that prices of goods and commodities have remained almost constant since 1200. What Mr. Fischer sees as a cyclical price increase is simply a result of currency devaluations by the British crown. 
 The longest period of price stability occurred between 1717, when Sir Isaac Newton fixed the sterling-gold exchange rate in putting Britain on the gold standard, and 1933, when it went off gold. Roy Jastram, in his classic 1974 study "The Golden Constant," showed that producer prices were the same in 1933 as in 1717.
There is no logic to saying prices have risen over such and such a period, as Mr. Fischer asserts, without saying in relation to what. There must be a reference point.
If we use gold as a reference point, Mr. Fischer's point that the Consumer Price Index may not be overstating inflation is demonstrably correct. The Boskin Commission, which tries to demonstrate that inflation has been overstated, is equally flawed because it, too, lacks a credible reference point. Using gold, it would be clear that the C.P.I. understates inflation.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Are Lower In Day of Weak Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were weaker yesterday, with volume down considerably. Foreign investors, retail traders and money managers stayed mostly on the sidelines ahead of the forthcoming holidays.
Despite new evidence of sluggish growth and low inflation, which is generally favorable to the bond market, further market losses are not out of the question, traders said. Investors who want to avoid risk may still decide to cash in on the recent run-up in prices, and, of course, there is still plenty of supply available from recent corporate issues, a situation that is likely to limit any rise in prices. 
 The 30-year bond fell 6/32 , to a price of 9823/32 , yielding 6.60 percent, up from 6.58 percent on Thursday.
Hamilton Davis, vice president of government trading at Everen Securities in Chicago, said the bond market appeared indifferent to yesterday's economic news. "About the only things released today, which were largely ignored, were the second revision of third-quarter G.D.P., and the November import-export price data," he said.
Mr. Hamilton said the market was mostly supported by the strength of the dollar and investor optimism about the economy and the market itself, as well as expectations that there would be no further government issues of securities until late in January.
Yesterday, Treasury securities briefly slipped lower after the Federal budget for November was released, showing the $37.88 billion budget gap wider than the $36 billion that had been forecast. But the market recouped to show only a small loss.
Mr. Hamilton said he was surprised that the stock market was doing so well after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had expressed concerns that caused the market to tumble two weeks ago. "I won't be surprised if he starts keeping a closer eye on the stock market," Mr. Hamilton said, "and use it as reason for tigthening. But that is not likely to occur until the first quarter" of 1997.
"We do get new supply in January, and next week is quiet," Mr. Hamilton said. "The November durable goods report on Friday is expected to be flat, so expect the market to make more year-end-type trades, which are tied to window dressing" (moves by portfolio managers to tidy up portfolios to appeal to buyers). He continued: "I think we will be dealing with relatively thin markets, as trading desks cut manpower in half. Consequently, if someone does have a big program trade one way or another, you could see more price movement than would normally be expected.
"We did see some buying this afternoon when the market came off its lows, so it looks as if there is still some bid left in this market."
Bruce Steinberg, a manager of macroeconomics at Merrill Lynch, said yesterday's final revision of the third-quarter gross domestic product was not impressive, but, he added, the fourth-quarter G.D.P. figure is likely to be a bit stronger.
"Looking ahead, we do expect the U.S. economy to grow around 2 percent during 1997, consistent with a stable inflation rate," Mr. Steinberg said. "Indeed, growth could probably be as strong as 2.5 percent without leading to higher inflation."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Flat to Slightly Down As Traders See Pause in Rally

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the German mark and was little changed versus the Japanese yen yesterday, in what traders described as a pause in the dollar's rally.
"As we go into next year, the dollar is poised to move higher," said Thomas Benfer, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal. "Stocks are strong, bonds are healthy, and we have the strongest economy on the face of the globe." 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5513 marks from 1.5572 marks on Thursday. It traded at 114.30 yen, up from 114.04 yen. The British pound rose to $1.6720 from $1.6647.
The dollar's fortunes this week were closely tied to financial markets in the United States as currency traders kept one eye on swings in stocks and bonds. The dollar finished the week about where it started.
"The stock and bond markets will certainly be a strong consideration for us," said Kevin Lawrie, manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "They're underpinning the dollar."
At the root of the steady climb that lifted the dollar 10 percent against the yen and 8 percent against the mark so far this year is the strength of the American economy. That has kept interest rates higher than in Japan and Germany, making investments in dollars attractive.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the economy grew at a 2.1 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. The report's price deflator -- a measure of inflation -- rose only 1.7 percent, its smallest increase since 1992, suggesting the dollar is losing less of its value even as the economy grows.
By comparison, "the Japanese economy is still weak, and the only way Europeans seem to be able to get their economies improving is through devaluing their currencies," said Hillel Waxman, manager of foreign exchange at Bank Leumi Trust Company.
While the Bank of Japan said in its monthly report yesterday that Japan's economy was gradually recovering, the central bank needs time to confirm whether the recovery is strong enough to be led by private demand, said Masayuki Matsushima, head of the bank's research and statistics department.
Those comments reinforced expectations that the central bank would leave interest rates at their record low levels for some time.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL AGREEMENT REACHED TO WIDEN LAW ON COPYRIGHT

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Negotiators from some 160 countries reached agreement in Geneva yesterday on the most sweeping extension of international copyright law in 25 years, the chief United States representative said, paving the way to broaden protections for the creators of art, software and music into cyberspace.
Supporters of the two new treaties, which must be ratified by the United States Senate and other lawmakers around the world before they can go into effect, say the changes will encourage record companies, computer programmers, and -- farther down the road -- even television and movie studios to distribute their wares over the Internet. 
 A contentious third proposal, which would have extended copyright protection to computerized data bases that provide sports scores, telephone listings and the like, was abandoned because of objections from other countries. The United States delegation gave in on that issue to make the agreement possible.
In an 11th-hour deal, telephone companies, Internet access providers and free speech advocates persuaded negotiators to delete wording that would have treated even temporary computer copies automatically created to view graphics and other information from the Internet as possible violations of international copyright law.
"These treaties we've been working on will be the cornerstone of international economic law for the information and technological age of the 21st century," Bruce Lehman, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks and the lead American negotiator, said at a news conference in Geneva.
Negotiators reached the deal late last night after three weeks of talks under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization, a United Nations body. To make original works easily and widely available, the treaties are aimed at balancing the interests of writers, artists and other creators of copyright material against those of users and distributors of digital information.
Once ratified, the two treaties -- one covering literary and artistic works including films and computer software, the other covering recorded music -- would grant copyright owners protection for distributing their work in digital form. As strong as United States law may be, the global nature of the Internet has given some companies pause.
"This treaty would for the first time create international recognition of rights already in U.S. law," Mr. Lehman said in a telephone interview. "If instead of going down to Egghead or Blockbuster to buy a piece of software or rent a movie, you want to download it to the computer, that's not covered" under today's international treaties, he said. "If you're a big content provider and you're planning a big marketing strategy to distribute product on the Internet, you're not going to do it if there's no law. Now there will be."
The United States, worried that American music, movie and software producers could be harmed because digital information can be so easily duplicated and distributed around the world, led the campaign for tightening international copyright laws. Mark Traphagen, vice president and counsel for the Software Publishers Association, said piracy costs the United States software industry $13 billion each year in lost revenue.
"From the incidents we've seen, Internet piracy can really have a devastating effect on a company, because so many copies can be downloaded for nothing," Mr. Traphagen said. "That's why this treaty is so important. We want to make sure that all these countries building information infrastructures are on board for protecting software."
The Recording Industry Association of America estimates that illegal copying costs the $40 billion American music industry as much as $2 billion each year in lost revenues. While little of that piracy now occurs on the Internet, Hilary B. Rosen, the association's president, welcomed the agreement an an important bulwark against future threats.
"I think it's a very good deal for American music lovers and Internet users and it's a very good deal for artists and record companies," Ms. Rosen said. "When copyrights are strengthened, the U.S. really benefits because we are the largest exporter of music. We're completely satisfied."
To reach the deal, experts said, the Clinton Administration was forced to retreat from what it had originally sought. An array of academic, scientific, consumer and technical organizations expressed concerns that attempts to extend copyright protection too rigidly in cyberspace could interfere with access to data and stifle the growth of the Internet.
"What they came up with protects everyone involved," said Julian S. Millstein, a lawyer representing several Internet access providers. "I think the treaties are very good."
The Patent and Trademark Office, with strong support from Hollywood, circulated a proposal last winter that could have granted copyright holders increased rights over what are known as transitory copies, which are made automatically by computers while downloading material from the Internet. But that idea fell flat on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers objected to the proposal. During the Geneva negotiations, the American delegation revived the concept, only to provoke a blast of criticism from civil libertarians and the computer industry.
"Before substantial pressure was brought to bear on the U.S. delegation, that delegation was trying to do an end run around Congress," Pamela Samuelson, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said. Even though the new agreements do not contain those provisions, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sounded a cautionary note about ratification. "I have been very interested in these treaty negotiations," he said in a statement. "There have been concerns that the Administration might agree to more than Congress is able to deliver. Accordingly, I look forward to learning more about the details."
But most of those closely involved in the debate appeared satisfied with the final compromise.
"We've done a lot of good here for the Internet," Peter Harter, a representative of the Information Technology Association of America, told Reuters News Service.

GRAPHIC: CHart: "Making Copies in Cyberspace"
Representatives from 75 countries reached an agreement on two treaties supported by the Clinton Administration, which are intend to extend copyright law to cover material that can easily be copied digitally and distributed over computer networks. In the United States, treaties would need to be ratified by the Senate before going into effect. Here are the main elements:
 
Current international copyright laws protecting recorded music would be specified to include computer-generated copies of recordings.
 
ON-LINE MATERIAL:
*International law would would specify that copyright protection includes the right to control the on-line distribution of copyrighted materials, as well as the right to prevent others from making unauthorized copies.
 
 *"Fair use" -- the tradition of allowing individuals to make a limited number of copies for non-commercial purpose, or to use brief excerpts in news reports or artistic criticism -- would still apply in cyberspace.
 
*In a compromise meant to defuse one of the harshest criticisms of the treaty, negotiators agreed that making a temporary copy of material on a computer's hard disk, when downloading it from the Internet, would not constitute a "copy" as defined by copyright law.

HEADLINE: Revision Gives Growth Rate A Slight Lift

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Fatter inventories cushioned the economy's third-quarter slowdown, the Commerce Department said today, holding the economy on a path of modest expansion that seemed set to carry into 1997.
Gross domestic product, the total production of goods and services, grew at a revised 2.1 percent annual rate in the quarter, less than half the 4.7 percent pace of the second quarter, but a bit higher than the 2 percent rate estimated a month ago, the department said in its second and last report on the third quarter. 
 Analysts said that the quarter's slower growth was healthy and that while future growth would probably be modest, that was good, too; faster growth could fuel inflation.
"A very flat economy with very high employment and very low inflation -- what a deal," said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses.
During the third quarter, businesses of all types increased inventories by $34.5 billion instead of the $32.8 billion previously estimated, the department said. That was nearly five times the $7.1 billion inventory buildup in the second quarter and helped to buoy growth.
But the revision did nothing to change the picture of an economy that cooled during the summer after a sizzling first half.
"Growth was markedly lower in the third quarter than in the second, and most components contributed to the slowdown except business investment in structures, equipment and inventories," the report said.
Robert Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said the third quarter was "a payback quarter" -- consumer spending slowed after a spring surge while Government spending picked up after a sluggish second quarter.
"But it's a quarter that was eminently satisfying," he added. "Growth is in line with what the economy's long-term potential is perceived to be, inflation is well contained and there are no significant distortions."
Early signs point to a slight pickup in the current quarter, although no official estimate of performance will be available until a month from now.Mr. Dederick estimated a 2.7 percent annual growth rate based on stronger consumer spending.
Mr. Dunkelberg said a survey of his group's members in November showed that 11 percent expected more vigorous economic growth by mid-1997 but about 21 percent saw weaker growth. On balance, expansion was expected to continue at a 2 percent to 2.5 percent rate.
That should keep interest rate changes on hold.
Apparently convinced that growth was tame enough to contain inflation, the Federal Reserve held rates steady on Tuesday at the final meeting this year of its policy makers, The policy panel next meets in early February.
If the economy starts growing much faster than its presumed long-term cruising speed of roughly 2.25 percent and inflation picks up, the Fed is likely to raise rates. Growth much slower than that would make a rate cut more likely.

HEADLINE: In November, Fed Held Rates Steady by a Unanimous Vote

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in holding steady an important interest rate target at their Nov. 13 meeting, minutes of the session showed today.
The minutes show that Fed officials found wage pressures to be "muted and somewhat less than anticipated," adding, "There was no broad evidence of rising price inflation." One reason they cited was the inability of producers to pass on price increases to their customers. 
 At the most recent meeting on Tuesday of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed policy makers also left the overnight bank lending rate unchanged as the economy continued to grow slowly with little evidence of accelerating inflation.
At the November meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the vote was 12 to 0. The vote left the target for the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, at 5.25 percent.
Gary Stern, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, was the lone holdout for a rate increase at policy meetings in August and September.
While the Fed officials found "further moderate economic expansion" likely, they expected a rebound in consumer spending driven by increases in consumer confidence, employment and incomes. Higher stock prices and easy availability of credit also contributed to this outlook, according to the minutes.
At the same time, the Fed said that "a correction in the stock market" was a possibility, and that would hurt consumer spending.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: Woman in the News;
Social-Worker Roots and Political Experience Lead to Labor Post: Alexis Margaret Herman

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
For a time this past week, it seemed as though Alexis Margaret Herman's beginnings as a social worker developing jobs for Southern women, and her later experience as a Labor Department official in the Carter Administration, would be overlooked in her quest to be Secretary of Labor.
To many labor leaders, she was better known for her more recent work as a skilled Democratic political operative and as the owner of a business that did labor consulting with large corporations. And so some supported her rivals. 
 But a broad range of her friends worked hard to dispel any misgivings labor leaders might have. And with her nomination to the Cabinet post yesterday, Ms. Herman drew wide praise from once-wary labor figures as well as from the black political and civil rights figures who had pressed for her appointment.
"I just tried to remind labor leaders of her role before she took on this political identity," said Ray Marshall, the former Secretary of Labor who in 1977 brought Ms. Herman into the Carter Administration as director of the Women's Bureau in the Department of Labor. "In the end she wasn't a tough sell. Plus they knew she would absolutely have the ear of the President."
Ms. Herman's nomination was also a tribute to the political skills she has honed over the years in which she has been called "the queen of schmooze" by friends and admirers. She managed the convention forces for the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988; handled the nuts and bolts of the Democratic National Committee for three years thereafter, and took on the logistical nightmare and ego-soothing task of planning the party's 1992 convention.
In addition, the nomination reflected Ms. Herman's ability to bring together disparate groups -- a task she performed in the first Clinton Administration as director of the White House Office of Public Liaison.
One fan from those years is Kweisi Mfume, head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and former head of the Congressional Black Caucus, with which the Clinton Administration has often had rocky relations.
"She's always been a clear thinker," Mr. Mfume said, "a good listener."
Similarly, in her role in building support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, she earned the respect of business figures as a savvy, trustworthy operator.
"The business community respects her and likes her," said Robert L. Healy, chief Washington lobbyist for the Atlantic Richfield Company and an active Democrat.
Mr. Healy said Ms. Herman had communicated corporate views clearly to the President over the years and through many tough issues and had developed a demeanor that made it difficult for factions to fault her for problems.
The 49-year-old Ms. Herman was born on July 16, 1947, in Mobile, Ala., where she got an early education in civil rights and political activism. Her father sued the state's Democratic Party to gain blacks the right to vote in party elections, and he eventually became the state's first black ward leader.
While she was a sophomore at Heart of Mary Roman Catholic High School, a black school in Mobile, Ms. Herman publicly confronted a diocesan official on why black students were unable to participate in an annual religious pageant that students at the white parochial schools participated in. The questioning earned her a suspension, which in turn sparked a protest among parents of other black students at the high school. She was re-admitted after a week.
Years later, after her 1969 graduation from Xavier University in New Orleans, Ms. Herman returned to Mobile and participated in successful efforts to desegregate the city's parochial schools.
Ms. Herman began her career as a social worker with Catholic Charities, developing job opportunities for the unemployed at the shipyards of Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss. She later moved to Atlanta, where she directed the Southern Regional Council's Black Women's Employment Program, which was intended to place minority women in managerial and technical jobs.
She then joined the R.T.P. consulting firm in New York, where she directed 30 city programs to get apprenticeships for women in nontraditional jobs, an effort that attracted the attention of Mr. Marshall and led to her appointment in the Carter Administration.
After leaving the Labor Department in 1981, Ms. Herman started her own consulting firm, which helped businesses develop training programs. It was this involvement with businesses that made some labor leaders wary of her, said Mr. Marshall and Mr. Jackson, both of whom met privately with labor leaders to assure them of her commitment to working people.
While serving as Mr. Jackson's convention floor manager in his 1988 bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination, Ms. Herman came to the attention of Ronald H. Brown, who hired her as his deputy chairwoman and chief of staff when he became national head of the Democratic Party.
While Mr. Brown was out raising money for the party, Ms. Herman took over the less glamorous job of "making the trains run on time," Mr. Jackson said.

HEADLINE: Vast Plant For Tanks Has Closed

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

 BODY:
Longer and broader than the Statue of Liberty is tall, the vast tank factory in Warren, Mich., helped give the Detroit area its nickname as the Arsenal of Democracy, and contributed to the legend of Rosie the Riveter, the model woman worker in the arms industry during World War II.
But with that war, the Korean War and the Vietnam War just memories, the Persian Gulf war finished quickly and even the cold war over, this factory -- which built tanks for each of those conflicts -- is receding into the nation's history. The Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant in suburban Warren shut down yesterday, 44,512 tanks and 55 years after it opened. 
 With Detroit now working overtime to build mini-vans and Jeeps, and with the General Motors Corporation building Chevrolet Blazers in Russia, the closing of the factory -- a year after a Government commission recommended that it be shut down -- marks the end of an era. "When our country needed us, we were the arsenal of Democracy, and we will be again if we are ever needed," said Mayor Dennis W. Archer of Detroit in an interview.
Inside the factory this week, nine hulking, sand-colored tanks awaited shipment to Kuwait. Mostly silver-haired men drove yellow carts across the dim expanse of cement and wood-block floors between the few remaining machines still churning out tank parts. A light blue steel lathe stood silent near a tan drilling machine. Yellow metal beams -- the disassembled pieces of an overhead crane that used to lift more than a ton -- rested in a pile on the floor.
The two remaining questions are what will become of the factory and what will become of the fewer than two dozen workers who do not have the seniority to retire.
Michigan's Governor, John Engler, designated the factory's 153-acre site as one of 11 "Renaissance Zones" around the state, areas that are eligible for state and local tax breaks to encourage investment and redevelopment. And with the Michigan economy flourishing and unemployment low, the hope is that the younger workers here will be able to find jobs in other area factories.
One remaining worker who will be able to retire, after 29 years and one month in the factory, is Jerry J. Griffin, 51, who paused from his duties as a fork lift driver to talk about his time here.
"When you've been here as many years as most of us have, it's a loss," said Mr. Griffin, who wore a thick red-and-black flannel shirt over his lighter blue-and-grey plaid flannel shirt. "Your second home is gone."
During World War II, Detroit stopped building cars and began building the Army's guns and the Air Force's planes. The Ford Motor Company's Willow Run factory turned out B-24 bombers; Ford also built armored cars, Jeeps, troop carriers and gliders. Chrysler made tanks, mine exploders and trucks, and General Motors built antiaircraft guns, planes, diesel engines for submarines and aircraft engines.
Indeed, in September 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the tank factory here to cheer on the workers. Still today, legend here has Roosevelt coining his Arsenal of Democracy phrase within the factory's walls. But according to President Roosevelt's library in Hyde Park, he first used the term in December 1940 in a "fireside chat."
The Chrysler Corporation began plowing under cornfields to build the factory in September 1940, and seven months later the first tank rolled off the production line here.
The factory almost outlived its builder. Chrysler ran the Government-owned factory for four decades, but sold the division managing the factory during a near-fatal cash crunch in 1982. The General Dynamics Corporation bought the division and has operated the factory for the Government ever since.
As recently as 1987, during the Reagan Administration's military buildup, the Detroit Arsenal had nearly 3,000 workers on three shifts, building nearly 950 tanks a year.
But in 1991, it stopped building entire tanks and began making only tank parts. The factory has been shedding workers for years, with just 305 remaining by 1994 and only 75 now. The 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the Detroit Arsenal be shut down, leaving the nation's slimmer tank-building responsibilities to a factory in Lima, Ohio.
Some said the factory's closing symbolizes a more peaceful world. Adam Cardinal Maida, Archbishop of Detroit, said that while he had some nostalgia for America's preeminence at the end of World War II, "as we look back on that era, we pray that it never comes again."
Workers at the Detroit Arsenal said they have been praying that dozens of their co-workers will find other work when the tank factory shuts its doors.
Paul W. Caudle Sr., 53, said he planned to retire and perhaps start his own business after working at the factory for 29 years and three months. "I hope and pray they'll work something out for the rest of the men," particularly since so many have worked here all their lives, he said.
Indeed, Mr. Caudle recalled the rough times during the 1980's, when workers at the plant gave up some hard-fought union benefits to help Chrysler stay afloat. Mr. Caudle pulled his navy, paint-smattered cap down over most of his grey curls and asked a visitor to bring a message to Robert J. Eaton, the chairman and chief executive of Chrysler, which has since recovered and is earning record profits.
"Maybe Robert Eaton might have some compassion and hire some of them back," Mr. Caudle said gently. "Since we helped them then, maybe they can help us now."

160 Countries to Extend Copyrights to Cyberspace
 Paving the way to extend copyright protection for art, software and music into cyberspace and around the world, some 160 countries agreed on the most sweeping extension of international copyright law in 25 years, the United States negotiator said. 
 Supporters of the two new treaties, which are subject to ratification by the United States Senate, say they open the door for record companies, computer programmers and perhaps eventually movie studios to distribute their products over the Internet. A controversial third proposal was abandoned. It would have extended copyright protection to computerized data bases like sports scores and telephone listings. [Page 1.]
 
Japan Overstated Foreign Share
Japan said it had unintentionally but significantly overstated the share of its market held by foreign semiconductor companies in the first quarter of the year, when the United States and Japan were negotiating a new computer chip trade agreement. [38.]
 
G.D.P. in Slowdown at 2.1% Rate
Fatter inventories cushioned the economy's third-quarter slowdown, the Commerce Department said, holding the economy on a path of modest expansion that seemed set to carry into 1997. Gross domestic product grew at a revised 2.1 percent annual rate in the quarter, less than half the 4.7 percent pace of the second quarter. [39.]
 
Jury Says ABC Defrauded Food Lion
A Federal jury in Greensboro, N.C., found producers of the ABC show "Primetime Live" defrauded officials of Food Lion Inc. by submitting fake resumes to gain jobs in the meat section of one of the company's stores. The employees then used hidden cameras to film the store and in a November 1992 broadcast said that Food Lion sold rotten meat, doctored fish and produce retrieved from dumpsters. Its stock plunged. [8.]
 
Fed Unanimous on Steady Rates
Federal Reserve policy makers, seeing no inflationary dangers, were unanimous in holding the important Federal funds rate steady, at 5.25 percent, at their Nov. 13 meeting, minutes showed. [39.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities slipped in slow pre-holiday trading. The 30-year bond fell 6/32 , to a price of 9823/32 , yielding 6.60 percent, up from 6.58 percent on Thursday. [39.]
 
Prices of Home Heating Oil Climb
Prices of home heating oil have reached their highest level since the gulf war of 1990-91, averaging $1.33 a gallon in the New York area last month, up from $1.09 a year earlier, and worrying homeowners and landlords. [1.]
 
Natural gas prices surged to $4.573 for a thousand cubic feet, the highest closing price since the New York Mercantile Exchange started the contract in April 1990, on concern that frigid weather would cut production in Texas and Louisiana. [36.]
 
Bigger Underwriting Role for Banks
Banks will be able to move more vigorously into the underwriting of stocks and bonds under a rule adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Some analysts expect the rule to lead to a new round of mergers. [39.]
 
2 for New Rocket
Lockheed Martin and McDonnell Douglas won a race over Boeing and Alliant Techsystems to develop prototypes for the Air Force's next family of rockets. Called evolved expendable launch vehicles, they are to provide low-cost, reliable access to space, replacing three missiles now used, the Titan, Atlas and Delta (at left). The two companies are to receive $60 million each in a program that could be worth $10 billion to $15 billion by 2020. [38.]

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: THE DECISION;
Clinton Fills Cabinet After Scramble to Diversify

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
President Clinton filled out his Cabinet for his second term today after a last-minute scramble to give the team more racial and ethnic diversity.
The President's final decision, made in a meeting that lasted until after midnight on Thursday, was to pick Federico F. Pena to be Secretary of Energy. Mr. Pena, who has been Secretary of Transportation for the last four years, had begged out of that job and had expected to leave Washington next month. 
 To replace Mr. Pena at the Transportation Department, Mr. Clinton chose Rodney E. Slater, the current head of the Federal Highway Administration.
The other Cabinet choices announced today were Alexis M. Herman, a White House staff assistant, to be Secretary of Labor, and Andrew M. Cuomo, a son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Andrew Cuomo is now an Assistant Housing Secretary.
Mr. Pena was apparently selected because of the President's concern that without him the 14-member Cabinet would have no Hispanic member. Polls of voters leaving the polling places last month showed that Mr. Clinton won 72 percent of the Hispanic vote, which made up 7 percent of his total vote. Groups representing Hispanic interests in Washington have made that point prominently in recent days.
At a brief news conference at the end of the announcement ceremony, the President was asked today whether he had felt pressure from interest groups to diversify his Cabinet.
"No," he replied, "the pressure was pressure I put on myself. I believe that one of my jobs at this moment in history is to demonstrate by the team I put together that no group of people should be excluded from service to our country and that all people are capable of serving. So I have striven to achieve both excellence and diversity."
In the 1992 Presidential campaign Mr. Clinton promised to have a Cabinet that looked like America, but he did not emphasize that point in this year's campaign.
Mr. Slater and Ms. Herman are black; Mr. Cuomo is white. The Cabinet now has 10 white members, 3 black ones, 1 Hispanic one. Fourteen of the members are women, three of them white.
The President named his foreign policy and economic teams earlier this month.
Mr. Clinton's new Cabinet consists of familiar faces, almost all of whom were already in the Administration in some capacity. This seemed to indicate that the President was satisfied with the way things have been going and did not anticipate any sharp departures from past practices.
Some top members of the White House staff did not learn of Mr. Pena's selection until they arrived at work this morning, and Mr. Pena himself was said to have been surprised by the turn of events.
When his turn came to speak today, Mr. Pena said, "I think perhaps the first thing I will be doing is taking down the For Sale sign that is in front of our house."
But lobbyists for Hispanic interests remained dissatisfied.
"We're not happy," said Charles Kamasaki, national vice president of the National Council of La Raza. "After an election which demonstrated a watershed in terms of Latino turnout and support for the President, we have a reduction in the number of Cabinet members. And the remaining Cabinet member is with an agency, which is energy, which has marginal influence over the key domestic policy issues of importance to us."
The current Cabinet has a second Hispanic member, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, who is leaving the Government.
Perhaps sensitive to the criticism, Mr. Clinton made a point today of announcing the nomination of Aida Alvarez to be director of the Small Business Administration, generally a position of secondary importance.
Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who is Hispanic, has been picked to be the United States representative to the United Nations, a top-level post but not technically part of the Cabinet.
By picking Ms. Herman to be Labor Secretary, the President sided with the candidate favored by women's groups and civil rights organizations and against the one preferred by organized labor, former Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Clinton said he had considered "a number of superbly qualified people" for the position and mentioned Mr. Wofford and Representative Esteban Torres of California. Mr. Torres was favored by Hispanic groups.
In addition to his Cabinet choices, Mr. Clinton announced these other selections today:
*Janet Yellen, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
*Thomas F. McClarty, Mr. Clinton's first chief of staff and now counselor to the President, to be a special envoy to Latin America.
*Bruce Reed, a deputy assistant to the President, to be the chief domestic policy adviser.
The announcement ceremony proved a bit awkward at the outset with 26 people lined up on the stage of the auditorium of the Old Executive Office Building across the street from the White House. They included officials who were coming into the Administration, those who were being replaced and several who are staying on in their current jobs, including Attorney General Janet Reno.
They were ushered onto the stage about noon, when the ceremony was scheduled to begin, but Mr. Clinton kept them waiting for nearly half an hour.
The delay was too much for one of Mr. Cuomo's twin daughters, Cara, who will be 2 years old next month, and she began to cry while Mr. Clinton was talking.
"Relax," the President said, "this is a pro-family Administration."
When his turn came to speak, Mr. Cuomo apologized for his daughter's crying and said, "I hope that's not an omen."

HEADLINE: God and Toothpaste

BYLINE: By Douglas S. Barasch; Douglas S. Barasch is a freelance writer living in New York.

 BODY:
IN THE SECOND STORY OF A WOODEN LODGE OVERLOOKING A MEADOW AND POND VEILED by mist, Tom Chappell, the C.E.O. and co-founder of Tom's of Maine, exhorts his 75 employees to contemplate nature. Normally these workers would be churning out fennel toothpaste, calendula deodorant, honeysuckle shampoo and other aromatic aids to personal hygiene. But on this overcast Tuesday morning, the company's executives, salesmen, toothpaste mixers and warehouse workers are gathered at an off-site location to discuss the company's commitment to the environment as articulated in its "mission statement." Attendance at the meeting is mandatory; Chappell has shut down the company's plant, at a cost of more than $100,000, to insure that everyone is present.
A tall, lean 53-year-old, Chappell kicks off the morning program with a brief homily that traces his own environmentalism back to a childhood spent among idyllic river valleys and mountain ranges near Pittsfield, Mass., and on the coastal islands of Maine. "I didn't belong to a pro-environmental advocacy group -- I didn't take environmental studies in college," he tells them, signaling that he's not some ex-hippie, just an old-fashioned Yankee. In a resonant baritone that blends the earnest zeal of a minister with the smooth persuasion of a salesman, he suggests that everyone turn to their neighbor and briefly describe their own relationship to nature, which they all proceed, self-consciously, to do. 
 Next, the employees participate in a 90-minute game that uses a computer model to simulate a local fishing industry. Competing in teams for imaginary ships, cash and troves of fish, they plunder and inevitably destroy the fragile ecosystem. In the aftermath of their collective remorse, they are asked to discuss, in small groups, ways to improve Tom's environmental stewardship, then to present their ideas (an environmental audit of the company, for instance) to the entire gathering. The morning concludes with a poem by the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Mary Oliver, read lullingly by Kate Chappell, Tom's wife of 30 years and the company's co-founder: do you think there is anywhere, in any language,/a word billowing enough/for the pleasure/that fills you,/as the sun/reaches out,/as it warms you. . . . / or have you too/gone crazy/for power,/for things? As the meeting adjourns, everyone strolls outside for a company picnic, set beside a hillock of evergreens beneath a luminous gray sky.
 THIS IS THE SORT OF GATHERING THAT LEAVES TOM'S LESS touchy-feely employees mystified, even a bit unsettled. The exercise might seem ludicrous if it weren't so utterly sincere -- and if not for the fact that Tom's of Maine, a small but robust $20 million company, has stolen market share from industry Goliaths like Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, claiming as much as 5 percent in especially receptive locales like San Francisco and Boston.
Chappell, who in 1991 received a theology degree from Harvard Divinity School (and whose name is pronounced "chapel"), has staked his company on the belief that you can run a business as both a "capitalist and a moralist." In his 1993 book, "The Soul of a Business: Managing for Profit and the Common Good," he declares: "The ultimate goal of business is not profit. Profit is merely a means toward the ultimate aim of affirming the health and dignity of human beings and their families, affirming aspirations of the community and affirming the health of the environment -- the common good."
Chappell's message has drawn the attention of business associations, schools and Fortune 500 companies. Ralph Larsen, the chairman and C.E.O. of Johnson & Johnson, a $20 billion monolith with 87,000 employees worldwide and 160 subsidiaries -- most of them larger than Tom's of Maine -- says that Chappell is "charting a new course" and recently invited him to address his top management team at the company's New Brunswick, N.J., headquarters.
But as the president of a small, family-owned business whose annual revenues are the equivalent of a rounding error for some of the nation's largest companies, can Chappell sell his radical brand of "common-good capitalism" to the titans of American commerce -- those C.E.O.'s of public corporations who answer to tens of thousands of shareholders and whose financial performance is scrutinized on a quarterly basis? Can his socially responsible practices be justified on the bottom line? Is Chappell, after all, just an oddball who thinks he can upend the Darwinian laws of the free-market system?
Whether or not such a thing is possible, or even desirable, a growing number of corporations have begun to take notice, in part because evidence suggests that these policies may indeed make good business sense. At the very least, it has become apparent to many corporate managers that a happier, well-treated, well-paid employee is more productive, that staying a step ahead of environmental regulations can reduce fines and clean-up costs later and that consumers are attracted to goodness, or at least to the appearance of it, when they purchase products and services, as demonstrated by the growth of such paragons of socially responsible (at times self-righteous) entrepreneurship as Ben & Jerry's, the Body Shop, Stonyfield Farm, Patagonia and Working Assets.
Corporations of every size, from Corning to Starbucks, were falling all over themselves to offer evidence of the above at the White House Conference on Corporate Citizenship this past spring. Against this backdrop, in an election year pervaded by antibusiness sentiment (caused, in part, by highly publicized downsizing), Chappell begins to look less like a corporate apostate and more like a shrewd entrepreneur who understands that the moral high road can be paved with profits.
 CHAPPELL IS A 6-FOOT-3 FUSELAGE OF ENERGY with a long face, a small mouth and blue eyes framed by thin-rimmed glasses. Seated in his sparsely appointed office, with its spare, blue-upholstered wood furniture, exposed brick walls and 20-foot ceiling, Chappell explains in a carefully modulated, pedagogical tone, "To be as concerned with goodness or environmental protection or education requires different ways of doing things." Indeed, Tom's, despite its diminutive size and limited resources, manages to give away 10 percent of its pretax profits to charities (1.6 percent is normally considered generous). It offers its employees three months of paid maternity leave, provides child-care subsidies and encourages workers to spend 5 percent of their paid work time doing volunteer service. (Nearly 80 percent participate.) Most of the company's products are packaged in recycled material and in recyclable containers and consist, by and large, of ingredients "found in nature." Each ingredient is described on the package, accompanied by illustrations of, say, a spearmint or a wintergreen plant and a chummy, informative note signed, a bit cloyingly, "Your friends, Tom and Kate."
The company is located in Kennebunk, Me., not far from the Atlantic coast. Inside its manufacturing plant, housed quaintly in an old converted railway station, aromas waft from steel mixing vats containing 3,000-pound batches of toothpaste, creating the olfactory sensation of being trapped inside a dentist's office. What is most striking about the plant is its small scale: the entire factory looks barely large enough to supply the hygienic needs of Maine. (Tom's produces 8 million tubes of toothpaste annually; Procter & Gamble, 250 million tubes.) Size notwithstanding, Chappell contends, "What we do here is transferable and educable."
Chappell founded Tom's of Maine in 1970 on the premise that a business enterprise could be both profitable and green. (Its first product, long ago discontinued, was an ecologically friendly phosphate-free detergent.) His environmentalism, his unbridled ambition, his religious zeal and his conservative politics (he was a Republican for most of his adult life until emerging from Harvard as a registered Democrat) all originate in a 1950's childhood spent in small-town, Norman Rockwell serenity. As an 11-year-old, Chappell actually served as a model for a Rockwell portrait of a choirboy.
By the mid-1970's, after a few false starts, Chappell was running a successful, progressive company. In the early 1980's, after years of selling products in natural-food stores, he hired a crew of M.B.A.'s to take Tom's mainstream, and the company grew at an exhilarating annual rate of 25 percent. But Chappell's success triggered a full-blown midlife crisis in which it became thunderingly clear to him that he was, after all, just selling toothpaste. "I didn't want 20 more years of building a bigger brand and making more money," he says.
Chappell seriously considered bailing out entirely and selling his company. Instead, with the encouragement of his family (he and Kate have five children, ages 13 to 30) and the reluctant assent of his board, in 1987 he enrolled in divinity school, commuting weekly to Cambridge, Mass., to attend part time while still running the company. "I went to Harvard with two questions," he says. "What is my role in relationship to God? And what do I do with my business?"
Answers came from unexpected sources. He discovered Immanuel Kant, Martin Buber and the 18th-century Puritan philosopher Jonathan Edwards -- all of whom he cites frequently in conversation -- as well as Hinduism and Buddhism. One or two nights each week, Chappell stayed at St. John the Evangelist monastery overlooking the Charles River, reimmersing himself in the spirituality of his own Episcopal faith. "I pray each morning on my knees for openness, to discern God's will," he says.
Divinity school enabled Chappell to re-engineer his business as a sort of ministry, bridging a deep internal rift between his fierce entrepreneurial ambitions and his religiously imbued social activism. "My responsibility is to use my gifts in service to God's work," Chappell says now, characteristically treading a fine line between sincerity and sanctimony. "I am ministering -- and I am doing it in the marketplace, not in the church, because I understand the marketplace better than the church."
Midway through his divinity studies, Chappell summoned his nine board members to a weekend retreat. He mailed them copies of Kant's essay "What Is Enlightenment?" and Buber's treatise "I and Thou," and invited Richard Niebuhr, Harvard's esteemed Hollis Professor of Divinity and recondite scholar, to do the heavy intellectual lifting. "I thought, boy, are they going to think I flipped?" Chappell says with a smile. But his directors -- who over the years have included an ethicist, a psychologist, a Native American Episcopal priest and an environmental lawyer --were already accustomed to meetings that sometimes devolved into group-therapy sessions. The board drafted a mission statement, which included the tenet, "To be a profitable and successful company while acting in a socially and environmentally responsible manner."
Chappell then set about impetuously, often clumsily, trying to convince his employees that all this was for real, with decidedly mixed results. "People in the company were writing notes on warehouse pallets like 'Mission Impossible,' " he recalls with a bemused look. Now, seven years later, the mission has mostly taken hold, though Chappell says that he still struggles to overcome his own autocratic tendencies and a volatile temper. This is in sharp contrast to his wife, Kate, the yin to his yang. "She is the reason Tom has not irreparably shot himself in the foot over all these years," according to one former executive. "She is as good a listener as he is a talker."
Other former employees report that Chappell has on several occasions summarily fired top managers with a head-spinning abruptness that left those dismissed as much puzzled as stunned. (Chappell denies this.) "Within his inner circle, he would just turn on someone," observes this same former executive. But even his worst critics admit that Chappell has come a long way. "There's a lot of soul-searching that goes on with Tom," one says.
The one time the company faltered financially has become enshrined as a sort of scriptural parable. In 1992, Tom's deodorant accounted for 25 percent of its business. Chappell reformulated the product for ecological reasons, but the new formulation, he now relates with a wry laugh, somehow "magnified the human bacteria that cause odor" in half its customers. Moreover, it seemed that the deodorant conked out daily at around 3 P.M. After much agonizing, Chappell ordered the deodorant taken off the shelves -- a recall that he estimates cost the company $400,000, or 30 percent of its projected annual profits for that fiscal year. Dissatisfied consumers were sent refunds or the new product, along with a letter of apology. "Normally, a business would change the formula and get it ready for market, but first sell through whatever was still out there in the system," Chappell says. "Then, when people bitch, you say, 'Oh, yeah, we fixed that.' " The company took nearly two years to regain profitability and sales growth. Revenues are now increasing again and are expected to spike back up to 25 percent annual growth this year, approaching pre-recall levels.
Of course, Chappell gets a lot of mileage out of the story: he discusses it at length in his book and often recites it at speaking engagements. Still, Tom's took the hit, just as it waited seven years to get the American Dental Association's seal of approval for its fluoride toothpastes, shelling out about 10 times the usual sum because the company refused to test its products on animals.
Chappell, who along with his wife owns a majority of the privately held company, says that such costly decisions ultimately distinguish Tom's of Maine -- certainly in the eyes of consumers. Which raises the fundamental question: Does Chappell's brand of socially responsible capitalism make economic sense for companies whose products aren't tied to a haloed corporate image? The outgoing Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, perhaps the Clinton Administration's leading booster for a "new corporate citizenship," says: "The debate that sounds as if it's about maximizing shareholder returns versus being socially responsible usually comes down to whether a top manager is paying attention only to very short-term performance or is taking a longer-term view."
That assessment is shared by Arnold Hiatt, the former president and C.E.O. of Stride Rite, which under his leadership (1969 to 1992) became one of the most progressive and profitable companies on the New York Stock Exchange. Reich and Hiatt, along with a number of like-minded C.E.O.'s, argue that social responsibility pays off particularly with employees. "How they feel about their role in the enterprise reflects, in many ways, on how they perform," says Hiatt, now co-chairman of Business for Social Responsibility, whose 800 member companies include Ben & Jerry's, Home Depot, Levi Strauss and Reebok. "Retention is higher and turnover is lower. Your choice of people in a pool of hard-to-come-by skills is much better. That's good business." He goes out of his way -- partly for rhetorical reasons, one suspects -- to make the argument for social responsibility based purely on the bottom line. "If you're responsive to the needs of the community, to the needs of employees' families, to workplace issues and to consumers, you're going to be responsive to the stockholders," he argues. "It just follows, as night follows day."
"Nonsense!" counters Albert J. Dunlap, who as C.E.O. of Scott Paper unapologetically downsized 11,200 workers, one-third of the company's employees, thus making it more attractive for a subsequent takeover by Kimberly-Clark. Dunlap, who is now wielding his ax at the ailing Sunbeam Corporation, asserts: "Business is not a social experiment. You're in business to make money for your shareholders. They take all the risk. They own the company. If you make the shareholder No. 1, you'll not only have a great company, you'll have the best employees, you'll have the best products, your suppliers will get paid and the communities where you live will have an opportunity through the tax structure to share in that success."
Dunlap's quite prevalent view represents the brand of economics that Chappell jettisoned long ago -- the notion that what's good for General Motors is good for the country. Yet now, whether motivated by altruism, profit, public opinion or some combination thereof, even General Motors is among hundreds of corporations that participate in organizations like Business for Social Responsibility, the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies and the Council on Economic Priorities, which bestows "corporate conscience" awards to deserving companies in its annual ceremony at the Waldorf-Astoria.
The true measure of Chappell's success, however, will be his company's survivability and profitability in the long run, which require that he either grow it or sell it. He recently weighed offers from several large corporate suitors and quickly learned how difficult it would be to sell his business while retaining its social values. "There was no party that would protect things as we built them. They didn't want to manufacture products in Maine, or they didn't want to use our marketing department because they had their own marketing departments." And yet these potential buyers, he says, "recognized a direct link between the company's monetary value and its values."
For now, Chappell will carry on as the company partriarch and C.E.O., though it's difficult to discern, finally, how badly he wants to be running a company at all. He's in the process of hiring a chief operating officer, who will eventually take over much of the day-to-day operations. He intends to write a second book, to teach, to lecture and perhaps to start his own educational organization to further disseminate his business philosophy. "The world of business today is one big accommodation for the sake of the bottom line, and people's souls are being sold right down the river for it," he warns. For capatalists seeking salvation, Chappell is happy to serve as a guide.

HEADLINE: Charity Begins at ... The Marketing Meeting, The Gala Event, The Product Tie-In

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin; Lisa Belkin, a contributing writer for the Magazine, wrote a profile of Paul Ellwood earlier this month.

 BODY:
THE 2,100 GUESTS AT THE SUSAN G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation's charity gala in Dallas in October expected a luncheon. What they got was an extravaganza.
First, the chandeliers in the huge ballroom dimmed, leaving the spotlighted dais looking like an oversize movie screen. Then the trumpets of the 14th Marine Naval Air Station color guard blared, and a local R.O.T.C. Saber Corp. snapped to attention, weapons aloft in an arc over the steps leading from the stage. 
 As an announcer boomed their names, representatives of corporate America marched under those crossed swords to their tables. J. C. Penney. Pier 1 Imports. Tiffany. Ford. Each stared solemnly ahead. A few looked slightly mortified. Most wore a small pink ribbon pin on their blouse or lapel.
New Balance Athletic Shoes -- which stitches a pink ribbon into the tongue of some of its footwear. Lifetime Television -- which used the pink ribbon as part of its logo during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, in October. American Airlines -- its ribbon can be found on its luggage tags. Titleist and Foot-Joy Worldwide -- its version is imprinted on the golf balls of two of its lines. Later in the program many of those executives would bow their heads slightly, as medals of appreciation were placed around their necks.
A bit much? Perhaps. But all part of what it takes to become the cause in the competitive world of causes; to remain the disease in an era when everyone, particularly during this season of giving, is trying to get attention for his or her disease. It is what it takes to elbow aside the previous hot crusade and find yourself being stared at and scrutinized by those who are blatantly waiting their turn to elbow you. Just yesterday, or so it seems, the ribbons were red and the cause was AIDS. Now, although money and empathy still flow to the AIDS cause, the pink team has pulled ahead in the philanthropic color war, and the cause is breast cancer.
"This is our moment, and we have to make it work for us," says Nancy Brinker, founder of the Komen Foundation, which has raised more than $65 million for breast cancer research, education, screening and treatment since 1982, most of it during the last five years. "It didn't happen overnight, and it didn't happen by itself."
How it did happen says a lot about the disease, which will be diagnosed in 184,300 women this year and will kill 44,300. But the fact that breast cancer is not the country's biggest killer (heart attacks will take nearly 500,000 lives this year) and that it is not its most hopeless (of the 177,000 cases of lung cancer diagnosed this year, 158,000 will be fatal) mean that the passion for this cause is about more than the disease itself.
It is about women, those who have breast cancer and those (can you hear them knocking wood right now?) who do not. To some extent it may be about their choices -- later childbearing, fewer children -- and their guilt-laced anger over those choices, which felt like progress at the time but might have made them more likely victims.
More than anything, it is about their fears. Heart disease and lung cancer -- those bring fear of death, yes, but breast cancer carries an even weightier load. To women, it is not only about mortality, it is about intimacy, femininity, sexuality and sense of self. Since the single greatest risk factor for breast cancer is not family history or environment or behavior, but simply being female, it makes women feel as if they are under attack just because they are women. The new visibility of breast cancer, therefore, is about rallying that fear and that anger, using it for ballast in the sophisticated tug of war for donations. Illness has always been about marketing -- long before there were ribbons, there were Jerry Lewis telethons and March of Dimes walk-a-thons. That is even more true today as Federal research funds shrink and diseases must compete with other needy realms, like poverty, education and the arts.
There was no single plan that brought breast cancer to the place it is now. But neither did it arrive by pure happenstance. Like most other things that work, it was a mix of serendipity and sweat -- the effort of a passionate few who found themselves in positions of influence at a sympathetic point in time. What they have done to shape those times provides a textbook in the new realities of American charity. What they do next will determine whether they can make the ephemera last.

T THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS only Nancy Brinker, and things did not go well. The low point, she recalls, was being thrown out of one bra manufacturer's office for suggesting that bras be sold with tags reminding women to get mammograms. "She said, 'It's negative advertising, and I'm in the business to make money,' " Brinker says.
That was in 1984, two years after Brinker created the Komen Foundation as a promise kept to her sister, Susan Komen, who died of breast cancer at 36. By 1984, when Brinker's own cancer was diagnosed, breast cancer was still "a silent epidemic," she says. Despite small flurries of attention when Shirley Temple Black, Betty Ford and Happy Rockefeller had mastectomies in the 70's, it was still "the rare exception when it was publicly talked about."
Brinker started her foundation with little in-depth knowledge of what she was getting into. What she did have was a wealthy, supportive husband -- Norman Brinker, chairman of what is now Brinker International, which owns, among other things, several restaurant chains. His first wife died of ovarian cancer in 1966, and he and Nancy were married in 1981. She cringes when his money is mentioned.
"I am not just some rich society lady," she says, displaying the fear of many wealthy Texas women of being dismissed as nothing but big hair and a slow drawl. "This is not about manicures and going out to lunch. I think a lot of people thought I'd do this, and do it for two years and then get tired of it. It took them a long time to understand the depth of my passion."
But though mentioning her husband's money may raise her hackles, she knows it also raises more money -- paying for her podium, making it more likely that she'll get her foot in the door. Her first Komen fund-raising event was held at Norman's polo club. Her first huge event came about when a friend of her husband's, the Texas real-estate magnate Trammel Crow, called Betty Ford and asked her to be the guest of honor at the first annual Komen luncheon. (Ford has been at nearly every Komen luncheon since then.)
And one of her defining breaks came in 1988 when Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife agreed to be honorary chairmen for the five-kilometer Race for the Cure in Washington, an event created by Komen. (Norman Brinker is a loyal Republican, and his personal political donations along with his corporations' totaled nearly $100,000 last year; Marilyn Quayle lost her mother to breast cancer.) That made Washington one of the first cities to be the host of a Race for the Cure, and from there the numbers grew. This year there were 63 races, with more than 324,000 runners, and Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were the honorary chairmen of the Washington race. Next year there will be 77 races.
Growth attracts attention, and attention breeds company, so although Nancy Brinker was the first, she was not alone for long. As the 80's ended, and the decade of excess gave way to its backlash, a measure of worth became not how much you earned, nor how much you spent, but how much you could raise. One at a time, a handful of powerful businesspeople, with more resources than Brinker dared dream, tried to make her cause their own.
One of the first was Ralph Lauren, who in 1989 teamed up with Katherine Graham, the former publisher of The Washington Post, and founded the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research at Georgetown University Medical Center. "I thought I could save her," Lauren says of Hyde, a longtime fashion editor at The Post who died shortly after the center opened. "I told Nina I would try my best."
Like countless other people around the country, Lauren was personally touched by the disease, but when wealthy people are touched, amazing things can start to happen. In the years since Hyde's death, Lauren has spent millions of his own dollars and raised millions more to support the center. He designed a T-shirt -- no pink ribbon, thank you very much, but rather a bull's-eye logo and the slogan "Fashion Targets Breast Cancer" -- which has raised $2 million.
And he is the honorary chairman of the annual Nina Hyde Super Sale, where impeccably dressed celebrities get to paw through racks of donated designer clothing, knowing that the proceeds go to breast cancer research. This year one of the 1,100 shoppers was the Princess of Wales, and the $500 tickets were the most sought after items in town.
Friendship also brought Ronald O. Perelman of Revlon into the breast cancer fight. In 1990, he founded the Revlon-U.C.L.A. Women's Cancer Research Program, after the disease entered the lives of his friends Lilly and Brandon Tartikoff. Lilly did not have breast cancer -- it was more complicated than that. Her husband, then the head of network programming at NBC, had been successfully treated for Hodgkin's disease by a U.C.L.A. doctor who was also deeply involved in breast cancer research.
The Tartikoff-Perelman expression of gratitude for that care now totals $20 million. Revlon's support of breast cancer research has become a mini-industry of sorts, including its own fund-raising runs and the seventh annual Fire and Ice Ball. When the Hyde Center upped the stakes and snared Lady Diana for their big event, Revlon presented a gleeful Bette Midler, fresh from her triumph in "The First Wives Club."
At about the same time that Perelman was becoming involved, another cosmetics giant, Evelyn Lauder, senior corporate vice president of the company that carries her mother-in-law's name, joined and therefore strengthened the trend. Estee Lauder Companies manufactures the Estee Lauder, Clinique, Aramis, Prescriptives and Origins lines; the advertising budgets of those companies give her influence in certain circles. She openly -- and successfully -- used it.
"By being fortunate enough to be an advertiser in all the big fashion magazines," she says, "I could go to all my friends who were editors in chief and persuade them" to run articles about breast cancer.
During a 1991 lunch with Alexandra Penney, then editor of Self magazine, Lauder says: "I started to tell her what I wanted to see if I had my dream come true. What articles should run, what information, what was important. She got all excited, and that fall they ran 10 pages." It was the first of what would become an annual special report by Self. A year after the first special report, Lauder remembers, "Alexandra had the idea to take the loop pin, from AIDS, and to make it in pink. I said, 'We could give away these pink ribbons at all the Estee Lauder counters all over the country.' "
The small fabric ribbons were in stores by the end of 1992 and are now in 40 countries. A fancier bright pink enamel pin is available in a gold boxed gift set, along with a Burning Rose lipstick and a bottle of Pleasures perfume. Proceeds from the gift sets, and from "The Seasons Observed," a book of Lauder's photographs, go to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which she founded in 1993.
What Evelyn Lauder has done is measurable. Why she has done it is more elusive. Although friends and breast cancer advocates all describe her as a breast cancer survivor, she has never publicly described herself that way. She is as uncomfortable talking about her health as Brinker is talking about her money.
"It's of no consequence," Lauder says, politely refusing to say whether she has had the disease. "I once listened to a woman at an event who was spilling out her heart and telling people about her own situation, and everybody was eating and talking. It was very painful for me to watch.
"So, it's of no consequence. This is about breast cancer, not about me."
 WEALTH AND PERSISTENCE CAN create a stirring, but not a sensation. (If they could, Steve Forbes might be President.) The reason breast cancer the cause seems to be everywhere, is that breast cancer the disease has hit a social nerve. Breast cancer is not hot just because Nancy Brinker, Ralph Lauren, Ronald Perelman and Evelyn Lauder willed it to be hot. Breast cancer is hot because it resonates.
"There's something about breast cancer that makes it very different from foot cancer or, for that matter, any other disease," says Amy Langer, executive director of the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, known as Nabco. "It's about body image, it's about nurturing -- it certainly is about femininity. It is loaded for women in ways that other health threats are not."
For decades that meant that people talked about it less. But as the world changed around the disease, the same things that once made it unspeakable became the very reasons people spoke about it more.
The 80's were the years when baby boomers, who had reshaped society around all their generational milestones, began getting breast cancer. Theirs was a generation of women proud of breaking taboos, recreating both family and workplace. They were more comfortable talking about sex, transforming "Our Bodies, Ourselves" into a self-help bible. And they were not cowed by authority.
"We grew up in the women's movement and the consumer movement, and to us doctors are not God," Langer says. "We don't need permission to speak out about something that we see as a threat to our lives. And when the women in their 30's and 40's spoke out, we gave permission to breast cancer survivors who are in their 50's and 60's."
Perhaps most important, the baby boomers came to assume that science would serve them. "It's a generation that is used to having a medical solution to its problems," says Karen Stabiner, whose book about breast cancer, "To Dance With the Devil," will be published in May. "The polio vaccine. Birth control pills. Then, when their needs were reversed, fertility drugs. Now they're getting something that for the first time has no cure."
Taking a lesson from their activist past, breast cancer patients began to organize. Nabco, for instance, was founded in 1986 as a network of breast cancer organizations whose goal is to educate the public about the disease.
But it was the lessons learned during the past decade that have made all the difference. If the disease of the moment is breast cancer, it is because the disease of a different moment was AIDS. Victims of that disease, and those who loved them, proved, and are still proving, that patients have to make it clear that they are also voters, and hell-raising consumers.
"We are absolutely following in the footsteps of the AIDS movement, where we've seen motivated patients and their families move mountains and change the face of the disease," says Langer. "We've learned that if you want your disease to be dealt with, you go and you talk about it and you market it and you visit and you stomp and you write letters and you do it."
In 1989, AIDS was killing an estimated 22,000 a year and receiving $1.6 billion in research funds from the Federal Government. Breast cancer was killing about 43,000 each year, and receiving only $74.5 million.
"Our message was never, Give us more money because you give AIDS more money," says Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, founded in 1991 to increase the financing for, and the political clout of, breast cancer. "We were emboldened by their success, by how successful a grass-roots advocacy could be."
The coalition's first campaign, in 1991, resulted in 600,000 letters to Congress and an additional $50 million for breast cancer research. In 1991, Visco testified before the Senate that "women had declared war on breast cancer, and they'd better find a way to fund that war." The next Federal budget included $430 million for research and one resulting Government program had an unprecedented stipulation that "consumers," which meant breast cancer survivors, could have a seat at the table when those funds were allocated. Federal financing is now more than $550 million annually. Every year, says Visco, "we go back and fight to keep that funding," with active lobbying and additional letter campaigns. One National Breast Cancer Coalition petition campaign, which received a corporate grant from Revlon, resulted in 2.6 million signatures sent to the White House, representing the number of women in the United States who are living with breast cancer.
With the gender gap larger than ever, breast cancer has understandably caught the attention of the country's most prominent politicians. During the last weeks of the '96 campaign, President Clinton, whose mother died of the disease, invited leading breast cancer advocates to the Rose Garden, where he pledged his continued support. Brinker was asked to speak at the Republican National Convention last summer. On the afternoon before her speech, she says, she learned that the five minutes she and several other speakers had been promised were being cut to one minute. She was allowed to practice the abbreviated version of her speech at the podium and, she says, was sternly told that "the green light meant talk, the yellow light meant wind things up, and when the red light went on that meant the mike would go dead in six seconds."
Leaving the podium after rehearsal, she was approached by a woman who introduced herself as a volunteer for the Race for the Cure in Kentucky. "And," the woman added, "I'm also the podium timer."
"The red light," Brinker says, "never went on."
 LIKE MANY A TALENTED PUPIL, BREAST cancer learned from AIDS and then did its teacher one better. In the last few years it has become what AIDS could not -- the darling of corporate America, which does not simply want to donate to the cause, but wants to embrace it completely.
Breast cancer could do this because it has an advantage over AIDS. From a marketing perspective, it comes with none of the potential baggage that support for AIDS may bring.
"There was no concern that you might actually turn off your audience because of the life style or sexual connotations that AIDS has," Langer says. "That gives corporations a certain freedom and a certain relief in supporting this cause." (Even the bra manufacturers have come around. When the intimate-apparel industry held its annual fund-raising dinner last year, it raised more than $197,000 for the Komen Foundation.)
If the first wave of corporate interest in breast cancer was personal and came about by happenstance -- Perelman's friendship with Tartikoff, Lauren's friendship with Nina Hyde -- the second wave of interest was more calculated. It came at a time when charity held new allure for corporations, which were attracted to the concept that customers will be loyal to companies that do good.
Called many things -- cause-related marketing, strategic philanthropy, social-issues marketing, passion branding -- the idea of doing well while doing good is not new. One of its first proponents was Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, who created a corporate ethos that still stresses things like local scholarships, environmental clean-up programs and Ronald McDonald House, where families of hospitalized children can stay while a child is being treated.
More recently, cause-related marketing is the theory behind American Express's Charge Against Hunger program, under which the company donates 3 cents to Share Our Strength every time an American Express credit card is used, with a maximum donation of $5 million. It is why Pizza Hut developed its Book It! program, giving a free pizza to a student who brings in a certificate from a teacher saying that the student read a required number of books. And it is the reason Home Depot has been involved in building more than 100 houses for Habitat for Humanity, donating the materials and encouraging employees to provide the labor.
Consumers say they like it. According to a recently released study by Cone Communications, which specializes in such campaigns, when quality and price are perceived as equal, 76 percent of consumers are more likely to switch to a brand associated with a good cause, a 10 percent increase over a similar 1993 survey.
If customers like it, businesses are willing to try it. Avon is one of them. Four years ago, Joanne L. Mazurki, a member of the marketing staff, was asked to develop a cause-related program. "We had done some cause-directed marketing," Mazurki says. "A little Statue of Liberty, a little something else. But nothing long-term or focused."
The only directions she was given was "to make it a women's issue" and make it something that would be linked to Avon in customers' minds. She turned to Avon marketing research, which included the results of a four-hour survey that Avon had conducted with 1,000 women. "When we asked, 'What health issues are you concerned about?' " she remembers, "breast cancer was No. 1."
A slightly different chain of events led the Lee Apparel Company in the same direction. Lee found that other jean companies were gaining market share, says Ellen Rohde, Lee's vice president for advertising and strategic planning, adding that since 85 percent of all jeans are purchased by women, "we made a major strategic initiative for 1996 that we wanted to focus a lot of attention on our female customers."
To decide the specifics of that attention, Rohde assembled two dozen women from around the country, most of whom had nothing to do with Lee business and marketing, and invited them to a health spa outside Tucson, Ariz. Between massages and exercise classes the women discussed what was on their minds.
When asked by a Lee board member, "What do you respect about companies?" the women said "they would be more loyal to a company that was helping women's lives," Rohde says. Breast cancer was ultimately chosen as a cause, she says, when it became clear that more than half of the company's core marketing committee members had had a personal brush with breast cancer. They either had the disease themselves or knew someone who did.
The company's search for a marketing tool resulted in Lee National Denim Day. Lee enrolled 650,000 employees from 3,000 companies in their "day," and for a donation of $5, each of those employees was allowed to wear denim to work on Oct. 25. Lee's goal had been $1 million, Rohde says. It raised $3.5 million in pledges.
Market-driven research fomented Avon's Breast Cancer Awareness Crusade, one of the largest cause-related marketing programs in history, which has already spent $20 million to finance community-based programs that make screening mammograms available to medically underserved women. The company has estimated that publicity about the campaign has created "700 million media impressions" -- opportunities for people to read, watch or hear about Avon's good works.
"That is what this is all about," Mazurki says, "making a good and a lasting impression for our company."
 DR. MARY-CLAIRE King, whose days in the lab are often too busy to allow time for lunch, sat among the well-dressed crowd at the Breast Cancer Research Foundation awards luncheon in late October in Manhattan. The menu included pounded paillard of turkey (no butter and almost no oil), accompanied by mango-and-papaya chutney. Her tablemates at the Metropolitan Club included Evelyn Lauder's husband, Leonard, the chairman and C.E.O. of the Estee Lauder Companies; Betsy McCaughey Ross, Lieutenant Governor of New York, and editors from Cosmopolitan, Mademoiselle and Vogue.
King is one of the world's pre-eminent cancer researchers. She was the first to prove that some breast cancers are inherited, leading to the discovery -- by a rival lab -- in 1994, of two genes linked to the disease. (The research that led to those discoveries was financed in part, Brinker boasts, by Komen funds.) The next step is to develop treatments based on those discoveries, and her life's goal, she says, is to eliminate breast cancer as a cause of death.
Looking around the ballroom, where a striking number of bare-breasted nymphs peered down from the ceiling murals, she understood the absurdity of being a scientist in a world of philanthropists. "I truly do not know how to put on makeup, and do not wear any," she says with a laugh. "Evelyn offered to help. I think next time I'll let her."
The growing corporate interest in breast cancer has changed the nature of breast cancer research. Before the surge, money for the disease was available mostly from huge, prestigious central givers like the National Institutes of Health and the American Cancer Society, or smaller corporate givers, like pharmaceutical companies, whose money some scientists feel uncomfortable accepting.
The new math, in which companies donate with the hope of making money by boasting of their donations, is fine with her, says King, who accepts no money from pharmaceutical companies. Grants from foundations like Brinker's and Lauder's are peer-reviewed -- screened by a panel of scientists -- she says, and the donors, whatever their motives, do not plan to profit directly from her results.
Where the new foundation money works best, scientists say, is as a first step toward larger Federal grants. A reality of medical research is that you can't get a grant without results, but you can't get results without a grant. Even for projects that qualify for Federal funds, the time between when the grant application is made and when the money is available can be months or years.
A small but immediate grant, therefore, can kick-start a project or keep it going until the heftier checks arrive. James T. Conroy, a senior vice president and special counsel of the company that owns Revlon, calls it "charitable risk capital."
When he and Ronald Perelman first met Dr. Dennis Slamon of U.C.L.A., Conroy says, the doctor was in the early stages of an attempt to apply gene therapy to breast and ovarian cancer. It was promising research, and was likely to receive Federal funds, but "the doctors made the case to us that turnaround to the National Cancer Institute meant they were two years away from advancing the research, and in those intervening two years, 100,000 women would die."
Revlon's initial donation of $2.5 million helped finance that research, among other projects. Now, six years later, Slamon's approach is being tested on patients, with the help of N.C.I. grants.
Even moderately small commitments, at a crucial time, can make an enormous difference, scientists say. King was at the Lauder luncheon to receive $25,000 that would allow her to start an epidemiologic study to determine what percentage of women who carry the breast cancer gene mutation actually develop breast cancer. The check Evelyn Lauder handed to King and her collaborator will allow her to start nearly a year earlier than she would have been able to if she had to wait for expected N.C.I. funds. "It will tide us over during a gap of several months," she says.
Research is not the only area in which the new corporate largess is showing results. Boston Market had no interest in financing research because too many companies were already doing it. So they supported a hot line instead. "We wanted to find a void that no one else was touching," says Robin Showkeir, a spokesman for the company.
Since 1978, the Y-Me hot line -- (800) 221-2141 -- has provided information and counseling not only for women with breast cancer but also for their families. Boston Market's commitment of $1 million worth of cash, goods and services in 1996 means that they can now provide a 24-hour computerized system that can match women all over the country with the support groups closest to where they live. Boston Market also created public service announcements with the hot line's number, along with business-card-size "Take One" displays at the chain's 1,100 stores.
This ability to spread the word is what Langer describes as the major benefit of a corporate partnership. "There's no way we could have put millions of brochures in the hands of women like they can through their sales force" of 500,000, she says of her group's affiliation with Avon.
The growing reliance on corporate money does cause some discomfort, Langer and others say. "There is concern of exploitation, that some motives might not be what we would hope."
Also of concern is the slippery subject of taste. There has been some biting of tongues lately among breast cancer advocates, as their benefactors come up with promotions that they might not have come up with themselves.
 MOST CONTROVERSIAL IS the billboard, sponsored by Kenar Enterprises, of a nude Linda Evangelista, one arm draped across her chest. A toll-free number on the billboard allows callers to make donations to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. "We got some negative letters," says Kenar's president and C.E.O., Kenneth Zimmerman. "We wanted to wake people up, and we did."
Several breast cancer advocates interviewed for this article said their discomfort was not with the nudity, but with yet another image of a perfect female body. Fear of imperfection is what keeps too many women from getting mammograms, the advocates say, because they worry that the treatment for breast cancer will leave them imperfect or sexually unappealing.
The ad certainly has its defenders, among them Evelyn Lauder, whose foundation received about $50,000 when the ad appeared on 60 billboards across the country last fall, including one, 20 feet by 40 feet, that all but stopped traffic in Times Square.
"I loved it," Lauder says. "Linda Evangelista had never posed in the nude before," she says, and only did so because her fiance's mother has breast cancer.
It is that practicality that overrides nearly all the nagging worries and niggling differences. The fact is, most of the money would not be there without the marketing programs that raise it.
"I don't care why they're doing it," says Betty Rollin, whose book "First You Cry," about her own mastectomy in 1975, has made her an unofficial spokesman for the movement. "It's a great thing to do. That they benefit is wildly beside the point."
What is of deep concern, therefore, is what happens when companies no longer see that benefit. What happens when the money stops?
Although most of the benefactors describe this as a long-term alliance ("It's a lifetime commitment," Showkeir says), and although most of the relationships are based not only on promises but also on contracts (Avon's is for five years; all Race for the Cure sponsors sign on for one year), this is, nonetheless, the world of marketing. And that is a realm without guarantees.
"There is something fragile about a corporate commitment to a cause," Langer says. "It does worry you that they will change their minds or find something different, or find that it becomes old news. It's like a new product introduction. At some point it looks very appealing to have a fresh new cause."
The new causes, to no one's surprise, are already out there, elbowing in the wings, watching breast cancer as breast cancer once watched AIDS.
Michael Milken, who founded Cap Cure (the Association for the Cure of Cancer of the Prostate), met with breast cancer advocates to ask for advice on how to bring a disease into the forefront. Similarly, Parkinson's disease was recently shown to have a genetic link, and advocates for that cause are hoping to use the resulting scientific excitement to motivate corporate givers.
And some of the most vocal heirs apparent hope to tap into the unity among women that gives the breast cancer cause its power. One of the countless events during Breast Cancer Awareness Month was a cocktail party at Mikimoto pearls on Fifth Avenue, of which Harper's Bazaar was the host. As representatives from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and the Nina Hyde Center stood at the front of the store preparing to accept checks, Liz Tilberis, the magazine's editor in chief, stood at the back of the room discussing her own battle with ovarian cancer.
"I'm fighting for the same recognition," she said of that disease. "Its time will come. We've not exposed it enough. We've not marketed the problem yet. These things take a little while."

Charts: "Charity Winners and Losers" -- Americans gave $144 million last year, or an average of just over $1,000 per contributing household, up 16 percent from 1993. More than $116 million of that came from individuals; the rest from foundations, corporations and bequests. America is more generous than other nations. One survey found that about 7 out of 10 Americans give, compared with about 4 out of 10 Frenchmen or Germans. To help spur giving, charities mount individual appeals, using personal solicitations, Salvation Army kettles, tele-marketers and direct mail. November and December are the peak giving months. With a healthy economy, people are increasingly likely to pull out a checkbook. But while there were increases in education, health and the environment last year, donations to human services and international aid were down. "All of the talk of the undeserving poor appears to be bleeding over into private giving," says Gordon Raley, executive director of the National Assembly of National Voluntary Health and Social Welfare Organizations. "If the poor are not worthy of paying taxes for, why give money personally?" Karen W. Arenson
 
Charitable international-aid groups had the biggest decline in contributions last year. The budget for Amnesty International U.S.A., the human rights group slipped from $20.9 million to $20.4 million. Virtually all of its money comes from individuals, mostly small donors, whose median gift is $35. It is working to cultivate more big donors. "We're trying to do a better job with a more narrow market," says an Amnesty spokesman, "rather than trying to widen the net."
 
Even as welfare rules change, and the number of people in need of food aid is expected to grow, donations to Second Harvest -- America's largest hunger-relief charity -- have shrunk, its first downturn since 1989. Financial contributions are up, but donations of food, which account for the bulk of its contributions, are down as food companies improve their processing and distribution and have less surplus to give away. Second Harvest is trying to find new ways to collect food -- by, for example, wooing companies to give even when there is no surplus.
 
WGBH, which operates public television and radio stations in Boston, was able to publicize the threat of Government proposals to cut Federal funds for public broadcasting and translate it into higher private donations. Contributions jumped 28 percent, to $35 million, in 1995, which the Chronicle of Philanthropy called the biggest gain among public broadcasting systems. This year, they have not managed another similar jump, but they have shown an increase of about 4 percent in membership fund raising.
 
The Republican takeover of Congress put new snap into environmental giving as donors feared anti-environment action. Reflecting that trend, The Rainforest Alliance, a small conservation organization that focuses on North American forests as well as forests abroad, saw its individual donations jump to $352,000 last year from $276,000 the year before. Foundations and corporations also raised their contributions to $835,000 from $538,000. (CHART FROM GIVING USA: THE ANNUAL REPORT ON PHILANTHROPY FOR THE YEAR 1995.

Kellogg's Six-Hour Day
By Benjamin Kline Hunnicutt.
261 pp. Philadelphia:
Temple University Press.
Cloth, $59.95. Paper, $24.95.
Americans have always believed in hard and steady work. During the early years of the Republic, "producers" with callused hands and plebeian manners condemned as "aristocratic" rich men who bought or hired others to labor for them. This year the public overwhelmingly backed an end to a welfare system that supposedly rewarded poor mothers who did no work -- although rearing young children seldom offers a life of leisure. 
 We do, however, have an alternative tradition -- of jobs as necessary evils, machine-driven regimens that slowly waste the soul in return for a wage. As Benjamin Kline Hunnicutt, a historian at the University of Iowa, points out in "Kellogg's Six-Hour Day," the labor movement's first great campaign was for shorter working hours. It was the responsible alternative to just skipping one's job or performing it badly. "Eight hours for work, eight hours for sleep, eight hours for what we will," was the chant of 19th-century unionists, few of whom were content to stop there. They asked, rhetorically, did not technological progress and the mounting abundance of goods make possible a steady decrease in time spent on the job?
W. K. Kellogg agreed. In 1930 the corn-flake capitalist, a visionary who burned to improve the economic order, announced that nearly all workers at his huge plant in Battle Creek, Mich., would henceforth enjoy a six-hour day. "We are going to start something that has been talked about for years, but nobody has had courage enough to do," a top Kellogg executive proclaimed. The company anticipated greater efficiency from contented employees, both male and female, who would now have enough time for their families and, perhaps, a bit of volunteer labor at a local church or school.
For nearly two decades it worked, according to Mr. Hunnicutt's many sensitive interviews with retired Kellogg wage earners, which rescue the text from being a dry, if original, academic narrative. Women, in particular, appreciated the "extra time" for gardening, canning, visiting and caring for sick relatives. Employees of both sexes welcomed the hiring of additional workers -- this was the Depression. And most seem not to have resented the dip in weekly pay that accompanied the shorter hours. One man remembers, "There was no complaints . . . as there were so many needy people -- I think perhaps, people as a whole were more human then." In the late 30's, a strong union did help boost overtime wages while preserving Kellogg's plan.
But in a work-obsessed nation, the idyll could not last. After World War II, Kellogg promoted a new ethic that tied higher wages to boosts in productivity. Most male workers, eager to take part in the consumer bonanza, began to demand an eight-hour day, and the union tended to take their side against "sissies" who clung to the old way. The stern gospel of higher wages for longer work gradually drowned out the sweeter, and now mostly feminine, hymns to "extra time." "Even the word "leisure" had become the butt of jokes and ribald comments, Mr. Hunnicutt writes. One worker even claimed that the short shift "was the reason for much hanky-panky going on in both sexes!" In 1985 the giant cereal company eliminated the last six-hour job.
This valuable case study should help speed a rethinking of the glorification of paid labor. It adds historical weight and precision to the more passionate writings of the economist Juliet Schor, the sociologist Stanley Aronowitz and the radical futurist Jeremy Rifkin, who similarly question why so many must toil so long for such modest reward.
Yet in his attack on the work ethic, Mr. Hunnicutt, who has certainly found his calling as a professor of leisure studies, ignores a major reason it survives. Paid labor has been and can still be a creative force, as well as an endless imposition. At times, machinists and journalists, nurses and teachers, priests, union organizers and many other workers tolerate long hours when their jobs are challenging, dramatic or essential to helping people they know and like. Mr. Hunnicutt doesn't explore whether some of the Kellogg men who favored eight hours were skilled craftsmen who found their work more pleasing than did the six-hour women, who were usually assigned to repetitive tasks.
He makes a compelling moral argument: no one should be expected to work harder and harder for less and less joy. But more time off is not a sufficient response. Why not redesign jobs so they offer workers an intellectual challenge and a greater degree of control? Automation can, over time, eliminate the most tedious occupations. But until life on the job gets as much attention as life at the mall, millions of Americans will continue to complain, as did one six-hour advocate in Battle Creek, that when you went to work "you left your mind at home."

HEADLINE: Blustery Seaport With a Soul

BYLINE: By KATHERINE ASHENBURG; KATHERINE ASHENBURG is the author of "Going to Town: Architectural Walking Tours in Southern Ontario" (Macfarlane, Walter & Ross).

 BODY:
NEWFOUNDLAND is not for everyone, which is perhaps why a guidebook to the island is called "Come Near at Your Peril." It is poor, with as many as 25,000 left unemployed by the current moratorium on cod fishing; its rocky topography, soil and climate could charitably be described as challenging. But Newfoundland's Never-Never Land combination of Ireland, Norway, Iceland and something irrepressibly its own is unforgettable.
Maybe it's the fact that it was a separate country with its own coins, stamps, national anthem and fierce sense of identity until joining Canada in 1949. Maybe it's the strongly Irish cast to the population, with Welsh and English additions. As the Canadian writer Sandra Gwyn notes, "Neither the Scotch nor the Loyalist ethic -- those twin wet blankets of the soul -- ever intruded here. No Loyalists ever turned up and there were never enough Scotch to matter." 
 Two recent American novels, "The Shipping News" by E. Annie Proulx, and "The Bird Artist" by Howard Norman, have given fictional life to the Newfoundland outport or fishing village. But the capital city, St. John's, which the writer Jan Morris called "the most entertaining town in North America," is still a new-found land.
Winter is changeable and intense in St. John's, where snow can be heavy, the mean February temperature is only about 25 degrees and the wind insinuates itself between the layers of your clothing. But the port looks its windswept best, the local people are delighted to have visitors, and there are plenty of places to keep warm. If the weather suits or you have a car, St. John's has some significant scenic walks and drives -- Signal Hill, Cape Spear (the easternmost point of North America), the in-town "pond" mysteriously named Quidi Vidi (don't ask; no one knows). But on my trip in January Iconcentrated on more downtown diversions.
Perched on vertiginous hills that sweep down to the sea, St. John's teeter-totters between somber stone temples of church and state and cheekily painted clapboard houses with mansard roofs. Known locally as Southcott houses, for the chief builder of the town's residential streets after the Great Fire of 1892, these quickly built Second Empire homes still have a temporary, theatrical look, as if a child with a new box of crayons had been asked to decorate the city.
The tourist office in City Hall, on New Gower Street, puts out a guide to city walks and drives, and the one on the historic East End is a good introduction to the stony official capital (the former seat of government, called the Colonial Building; the vice regal residence, called Government House), the lower-middle-class Southcott houses on Military Road, and the prosperous, more detailed Southcotts and voluptuous Queen Annes on Rennies Mill and Circular Roads.
Touring in a Newfoundland winter requires occasional to frequent thermal interludes. One of the best, close to St. Thomas Church and Government House as well as the residential streets, is in the Hotel Newfoundland. The Court Garden is an ersatz tropical affair of plants and rattan chairs. But outside the window there's something harder, colder and much more real -- the Narrows, with Cabot Tower on the top of the brown rock, and a straggle of colored houses along the twisting road called the Battery. Drink tea or something more potent and admire the dark gray sheet of water glinting between the enclosing cliffs.
ANOTHER respite from the cold in this neighborhood is Devon House Craft Center, on Duckworth Street, an urbane mansarded house where very un-urban crafts are sold. The Newfoundland and Labrador Craft Development Association purveys Native carvings, hooked mats resembling jewel-toned primitive paintings and handknit clothing. More unusual are tea dolls from Labrador, a tradition from the pre-1950's migrations, when everyone in the family, including children, carried their share of provisions to the hunting grounds. (The dolls held tea and returned stuffed with grass or leaves.) About 12 inches high and filled with about two pounds of loose tea, today's dolls are beaded and embroidered, with faces and hands of smoked caribou skin, and cost about $155 in United States currency.
Another St. John's walk begins at the harbor, with an inventory of boats. Even in the off-season, the doughty likes of the John Cabot, Terra Nova, Acadienne Gale and Northern Princess give you a taste of the port's salty origins. Proceed up to Water Street, where people have been doing business since the early 16th century; now admittedly seedy-looking, the street is still lined with no-nonsense 19th-century commercial buildings. Climb the Courthouse steps past the chunky rock-faced Romanesque Revival Courthouse, finished in 1901. To the right of the Courthouse on Duckworth Street, the Newfoundland Museum offers free warmth and appealing (if minimal) introductions to the province's wildlife, Native peoples and European settlers.
If you continue up Cathedral Street, past the Anglican Cathedral on the left and the almost scarily Baroque Masonic Temple (1897) on your right, you'll reach one of St. John's delights, Gower Street. It's a rainbow of Southcott houses, typically flat-faced working-class dwellings, their third-story dormer windows either peaked or bonnet-topped. The homogeneous shapes, combined with a near-manic color scheme of shiny reds, greens and blues make the street look slightly stagey and wholly irresistible. (Old-timers will tell you that St. John's vibrant and pastel colors with contrasting trim are only about 20 years old; before that, houses were painted brown, dark green, gray and red ocher without trim color.)
There's no use denying that, for the two main streets of a provincial capital, Water and Duckworth Streets offer shopping that looks more funky than utilitarian. The dearth of large stores is partly due to the North American drift to suburban malls, partly to Newfoundland's poverty. But while it must be frustrating for the inhabitants, the abundance of downtown music shops, cafes, bookstores and craft shops makes for offbeat shopping with a strongly local flavor. On Duckworth, Wordplay is the best bookstore for Newfoundland books, and Cod Jigger (named for the fishing technique of jiggling a hook on a line) has a good supply of hooked mats, chair covers and tea cozies as well as other crafts.
But for my money, one of the most alluring places in St. John's is a nonprofit cooperative store called Nonia, at 286 Water Street. Nonia, an acronym for the Newfoundland Outport Nursing and Industrial Association, has been selling weaving, handknit mittens, hand-smocked dresses and other crafts since 1920. But it's the more than 200 knitters and weavers around the province who really fuel Nonia, and give the store its poignant, workaday poetry.
Fat "thrummed" mittens, lined with tufts of lambswool, cost $22; fisherman's sweaters run about $115; chunky gray socks cost $12.30. Mittens beautifully crowded with snowflakes and caribou in various formations, in fine stocking wool, cost $12.50. Forgetting that a certain segment of Newfoundland lives in the continuous present, I hoped aloud that Nonia's knitters would never abandon their traditional patterns. The saleswoman looked bemused at the odd notion. Why in the world would they do that?
As with knitting patterns, Newfoundland preserves its traditional ways with food, but not often in St. John's restaurants. (An exception is the Thursday evening buffet in the Outport, in the Hotel Newfoundland.) When I found a cabdriver knowledgeable about fish 'n' brewis (pronounced brews), a concoction of salt cod, potatoes and hard tack, I asked where I could eat it. Baffled, he called his dispatcher, who had a characteristic answer: "She'd be some welcome at our house, but no one's there now."
Failing that, there are two good sources for browsing and buying Newfoundland foods. The first, Auntie Crae's on Churchill Square, is a food store in a very ordinary shopping center. The baking includes a few local specialties, but Auntie Crae's glory is its own line of jams produced from the unusual, Shakespearean-sounding berries that grow in Newfoundland's boggy barrens and sub-Arctic lands. When I visited the shelves were laden with bakeapple, partridgeberry, pincherry, dogberry, crab apple rosehip and marshberry jams. Just perusing the shelves can lift the spirits.
Ten minutes' drive south of St. John's on Highway 10, in a town called Goulds (known locally as the Goulds), Bidgood's Supermarket offers a crash course in Newfoundland food. In the alcove called "Bidgood's Cove" you can feast at least your eyes on seal flipper pie, caribou pie and moose pie, as well as seal sausages and great plastic tubs of salt beef (which with cabbage makes "jiggs dinner"). In the seafood case, virtually every part of the cod -- heads, tongues, cheeks -- is discretely packaged.
In a city where the memory of 19th-century bishops remains surprisingly vivid, a church tour is a good way to sample local history and architecture. Many churches are locked in winter except for services, so a visit timed for the 11 A.M. Sunday service is a good bet. St. John's oldest church, the Old Garrison Church, also known as St. Thomas Anglican, was built in 1836 for the soldiers at Fort William as well as the townsfolk. With its central tower and spreading wings painted a shiny charcoal, it's like a child's cut-out. Inside, its military plainness is interrupted only occasionally by memorial tablets to His Majesty's soldiers lost during the World Wars.
St. Thomas is on Military Road, as is the Roman Catholic Basilica of St. John the Baptist, but while the Anglican church takes its place demurely near Government House and the Colonial Building, the Basilica has been lording it over the entire city since its consecration in 1855. The biggest church in North America when it was built, St. John the Baptist is a two-towered basilica made of Galway limestone and Dublin granite, set high on the hill. The chief attraction of the interior is the coffered and bossed ceiling of deep teal and gold.
From the Basilica, head down Cathedral Street to the other church dedicated to St. John, the Anglican Cathedral. Described by Jan Morris as "authentically unfinished" (its tower remains unbuilt), it is also authentic in its return to 13th-century sources, the chunky cruciform shape, the interior credibly furnished with bunched columns, sculptured bosses and mostly green and blue stained glass in deeply recessed windows. The design of Sir George Gilbert Scott, one of England's great Gothic Revival architects, it was almost completed when the Great Fire of 1892 nearly destroyed it; it was rebuilt to the original design.
Just above the Cathedral is the Gower Street United Church, a very jolly galleried church from 1894, with plush red velvet couches for the ministers, charmingly anecdotal stained glass and a dark chocolate-colored hammerbeam roof. Up a steep hill is St. Andrew's Presbyterian, a big 1894 brick barn, whose inside is filled with light, gold Corinthian columns -- and nowhere to hide. Not a cozy kirk, but not unfriendly either.
If you have not yet exhausted your appetite for things ecclestiastical, you can visit the Convent of the Presentation (the 1853 stone building to the right of the Basilica as you face it) and ask to see a local landmark called the Veiled Virgin. Sister Theophane Curtis will take you to the drawing room where the Virgin, a tour de force sculptured head enclosed in a gauzy veil -- all in marble -- by the 19th-century Italian artist Giovanni Strazza is installed on a pedestal. Sister Theophane will also display, on request, the convent archive, which contains superb examples of liturgical embroidery and illuminated books. But the real treasure here is the 1850's chapel, a tiny jewel box, its plaster walls a fantasia of arches, faux marble columns and stars.
Church and convent tours may be somewhat specialized tastes, but pub crawls are not, especaially in St. John's. When I asked the saleswoman at Nonia why some of their gloves left the fingertips bare, she said, "It's for musicians who play outdoors." Sometimes it seems that everyone in St. John's plays music -- traditional Newfoundland, Celtic, jazz, whatever -- and one of the town's most reliable pleasures is a pub crawl on George Street, where there's live music at a handful of pubs at least on Friday and Saturday nights. The highly regarded Fat Cat Blues Bar on George Street holds a Newfoundland folk session every Monday evening. Another favorite, the Ship Inn down the alley at 265 Duckworth Street, presents Kelly Russell, one of Canada's finest fiddlers, on Saturday evenings. On a recent bleak midwinter night, Mr. Russell played an ageless-sounding Celtic song on the concertina, then moved to the fiddle. The bar filled up and it was, as they would say in St. John's, a grand way to pass an evening. Or, to quote a 19th-century visitor and the title of an anthology of views of Newfoundland, "Complaints is many and various, but the odd Divil likes it."

HEADLINE: ART;
Personal Styles Centered on Enigma

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
THE Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield hasn't done much photography programming, but its ground floor gallery has the right intimacy for showing photographs, and in the future it might be set aside for this.
The current show might be a test run. Jenny Lynn and Jill Mathis both work in black and white and, for this show, are considered to be working toward the same ends, defined as "Beyond Narrative." This is a problematic title because it implies a new direction. But photography ceased to be only, or even primarily, a narrative art a long time ago. 
 The Surrealists made major innovations in the way they linked disparate images in nonlinear or illogical ways, and Ms. Lynn seems very much in that mold.
After making peace with the show's title, viewers have to get by the artists' statements on wall placards. Instead of objective information about their work they substitute personal sentiment.
Excusing the packaging, viewers are left with the work itself, which is more complex and resonant than the title and statements portend. Ms. Lynn works small, by linking even smaller images together as photo collages, and the results are enigmatic; no firm meaning can be put on her strange content. Ms. Mathis's pictures are large and dramatic, and when they're enigmas it's because the image is deliberately out of focus.
Ms. Lynn was born in Tampa, Fla., and now lives in Philadelphia. She completed her photography education in New York City and California, and in her statement she says she is interested in contrasting the differences between the two coasts. But save for an occasional palm tree, the shift in climates is not a major sensation. What is stimulating about Ms. Lynn's endeavor is her economy. She seems to have a pack of images, like tarot cards, that she shuffles to make different compositions. These include a pyramid, thorny branches and a medical diagram of the inside of the human head.
The danger is that she can get too glib with her associations, sacrifice mystery and not catch the viewer. Her two most successful works are a succinct one and a rambling one. "Head over Heel" is the aforementioned diagrammatic head, linked by a thorn branch, which becomes a spinal cord, to a smart high-heeled shoe.
The more complex "Little Rituals" presents several examples of posturing and preening: a swan twisting its long neck to smooth the feathers on its back is engaging in an activity parallel to that of a man displaying his mostly bald head with his hand ready to run through his remaining hair.
Ms. Mathis is from San Antonio, Tex., a fact that informs her photographs, and now lives in New York City. Her subject is the rodeo, especially the moment of anticipation for both rider and animal while still in the chute. Usually clearly in focus is a metal bar of the chute, which a cowboy often grips tensely.
She gives the animals equal time: a bull's horns seem to be mud-clotted and sprouting vegetation emphasizing its earthiness, while the blurred head of a horse takes a while to interpret. The most readily identifiable feature is a set of ears pricked in anticipation.
Ms. Mathis also exploits the blinding glare of the rodeo arena, emphasizing its fleeting glory.
Like the two photographers at the Aldrich, Richard Lytle traffics in enigma. He gets beyond the traditional limits of two painting genres by amalgamating them.
In a group of oil paintings and watercolors on exhibit in the gallery of Norwalk Community-Technical College, Mr. Lytle, who is a professor of art at Yale University, combines conventional landscape with flower painting, and he does it so grandly that the results might almost be called operatic.
The landscapes he creates as a base are chilly ones, cold and windswept. Mr. Lytle seems to have borrowed from the bleak side of the Hudson River School, the one that favored blasted trees.
But it is usually difficult to see the desolate forest for the abundance of flowers he sets in front of them. For this component he seems to have shifted over to those Hudson River School painters who made trips to South America.
The flowers are especially animated. They engage in frequent histrionics, bending, leaves curling into corkscrews. Sometimes though, the flowers are placid, like the bunch of violet-colored ones set down in the foreground of "The Source," distinguished by a rugged, chalky headland in the distance rather like a moor in a Bronte novel.
The flowers are a sign that deep emotion informs the bleakness. No matter how much viewers try to interpret the floral part of one of these paintings as a tempering, or gladdening element, they are thwarted because the entire composition must be considered, and the overall mood is indelibly surreal.
At times the flowers are so overgrown that a painting has to be combed through carefully for other content.
In "Upstream" a sailboat can be made out, which offers the promise of escape from this strange, climatically impossible world.
But when viewers make their way through the blossoms that are like a curtain in front of "The Studio," they will recognize a skylight, and below that a self-portrait of the painter at work. This painting seems to declare, of course, that this is an fictional world; creating their own sphere is a privilege of painters.
"Beyond Narrative: Photographs of Jenny Lynn and Jill Mathis" is at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield through Jan. 5. "Works by Richard Lytle" is at the gallery of Norwalk Community-Technical College through Dec. 30.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Debbie Reynolds, Perky Long Ago

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
There is a moment in the trailer for "Mother," the new comedy by the director Albert Brooks opening Christmas Day, that says it all. Portraying one side of a telephone conversation about the movie, Mr. Brooks brags about landing the "legendary Debbie Reynolds" for the title role. A long pause ensues. A frown creases his face.
"No," he adds with a huff. "She's not dead." 
 For all Hollywood seemed to care, she might as well have been.
The last time Ms. Reynolds had more than a glorified walk-on in a movie was a quarter of a century ago in "What's the Matter With Helen?" Instead she did traveling plays, cruise ships, an autobiography, an exercise video. Ultimately, she retreated to Las Vegas, where she built her own hotel and casino, a museum of Hollywood memorabilia, a mausoleum of kitschy artifacts from the good old days. Ms. Reynolds was its star exhibit, performing a nightly cabaret act of tunes from her heyday in the 1950's to what she describes as a "sea of gray hair" and introducing herself in a way that elicited laughter despite its undercurrent of sadness.
"I'm Carrie Fisher's mother," she would say.
But as the show tune decrees, everything old is new again. And suddenly Ms. Reynolds, a woman long frozen in the past, has been given a shiny, gift-wrapped present.
"Mother" casts her as a subtly loopy, impossibly frugal and maddeningly aloof suburban matriarch whose befuddlement over call waiting is eclipsed only by her ineptness at comforting her neurotic son (played by Mr. Brooks, who also wrote the script, with Monica Johnson, and directed).
It's a juicy role for an older actress when there aren't many parts of that kind going around, and Mr. Brooks said it felt especially good to hand it to Ms. Reynolds. "The thrill for me was to provide an arena for someone who had had this great career to step back up to the plate," Mr. Brooks said.
Ms. Reynolds's reappearance in "Mother" is not only a long-overdue homecoming to the screen but also a testament to the persistent charms of one of Hollywood's most indefatigable creations.
"Every day I've had to shake my head," said Ms. Reynolds, who is now 64. "It's such a surprise for me." She was seated on a sofa in a suite at the Essex House in Manhattan, her temporary home last month during the shooting in the New York area of another movie, "In and Out." Since she finished "Mother," the offers have been steadily trickling in, and that is strange indeed to a woman long accustomed to drought.
"I felt that at my age, you don't have a comeback," she said in a tone of genuine amazement. "I almost feel like I'm starting over again."
Her deep-set eyes, valentine-shaped face and wistful voice are instantly familiar from "Singin' in the Rain," "Tammy and the Bachelor" and the many other sunny, sappy movies she made in the 1950's and early 1960's. But her chatter and darting movements betray an eagerness to please -- a hunger, almost -- that is unexpected, and can be attributed only in part to her well-honed reflexes as a performer. The rest boils down to gratitude and nerves.
"You want some ice?" she said after pouring her visitor a hot cup of freshly brewed tea. Then, before there could be an answer, she bolted to the kitchenette. "I'm going to get you some ice. You really need some ice."
Asked about a tangle of blue foam and metal in the corner of the living room, she said, "That's my ab cruncher" and, in the blink of an eye, dropped to the floor for a demonstration. "See," she said as her blond bouffant bobbed up and down. "It's working everything."
When she finally settled down, she confessed to feeling overwhelmed by the sudden reversal of fortunes. One part of her, she said, simply wants to head back to her life in Vegas. But another part relishes the chance to prove something in movies that she could not the last time around, when she was almost consistently typecast as a winsome icon of American innocence. She wants to show the people who forgot about her, and the people who never got to know her in the first place, that she can act.
"I don't feel old, but that is what I'm considered," she said. "And when I look around me and see that so many women my age have passed, it scares me." She ticked off names like Lee Remick and Audrey Hepburn. She paused, and when she next spoke, her voice was softer. "I want to take advantage of what I have left."
"Mother" tells the story of a grown man, played by Mr. Brooks, who is convinced that he will never find lasting love until he exorcises the demons of his relationship with Mom. So he journeys home, lays claim to his old bedroom and begins a fumbling attempt at reconciliation. Mr. Brooks said he wanted moviegoers to look at the screen and believe it was their own mothers they were seeing. For that reason, he did not want to cast anyone with a long list of similar roles.
"I didn't want somebody saying, 'That's the best mother she's ever played,' " Mr. Brooks said. "I wanted a clean slate." Better yet, Mr. Brooks added, "I wanted somebody you hadn't seen in a long time, because I wanted to make it as special as I could."
That nixed such dependable celluloid matriarchs as Shirley MacLaine, Anne Bancroft and Maureen Stapleton. Instead, he decided to approach Esther Williams, Doris Day, even Nancy Reagan. Ms. Reynolds made the list because Mr. Brooks had met her several times during his long friendship with Carrie Fisher.
When Mr. Brooks mentioned Ms. Reynolds's name to Scott Rudin, one of the producers of "Mother," Mr. Rudin was briefly hesitant. "I didn't know how good an actress she might be, if she could carry an entire movie," the producer said. "She hadn't been in a movie in something like 150 years. But I thought there was a lot of value in casting her -- that you could make some noise about bringing her back."
Mr. Brooks asked Ms. Fisher whether her mother would be interested in the part, and Ms. Fisher, who knew that her mother had grown increasingly intimidated by the prospect of returning to movies, took it upon herself to make sure Ms. Reynolds went for it. She mailed the script to her, and for several days Ms. Reynolds failed to retrieve it from the front desk of her condominium in Las Vegas.
"Have you read it?" Ms. Fisher recalls asking her mother repeatedly over the telephone.
"No, dear," Ms. Reynolds would reply. "I haven't gotten it from downstairs yet."
WHEN SHE FINALLY did, she was troubled by how few similarities she could find between herself and the character. Both she and Ms. Fisher say that while the mother in Mr. Brooks's film is repressed, fussy and critical of her son, Ms. Reynolds is ebullient, spontaneous and a cheerleader for her children.
But Ms. Reynolds, egged on by her daughter, flew to Los Angeles to run some scenes with Mr. Brooks. It was a trip laden with apprehension, because the last time she had read for a part -- for a sitcom in the 1980's -- an array of assistant producers in their 20's had asked her what previous acting experience she had had. But when she got to Mr. Brooks's office at Paramount, he was the only one there. She read two scenes, at which point he told her the part was hers.
"Albert, you can't just say that," she told him. "Where are all the other people?"
Mr. Brooks explained that he was calling the shots.
"You have to have me read another scene," Ms. Reynolds argued. "What about the restaurant scene? That's a very tough scene."
Brooks explained that she was only proving, with her niggling contrariness, that she knew exactly how to play his mother, and that she had basically done the equivalent of another scene. She left the meeting stunned, elated and petrified. Could she memorize all the lines? Who would negotiate her salary? She had been out of the picture for so long that she didn't even have an agent.
"I was nauseous," she said. "My stomach was destroyed by this movie."
Ms. Reynolds said she ended up being paid just $250,000. Afterward she acquired a movie agent, and her paycheck rose to $750,000 for "In and Out." She quoted that sum with a trace of awe, because she can still remember her modest dreams -- to go to college, to become a gym teacher -- before Hollywood discovered her.
Talent scouts plucked Mary Frances Reynolds from the stage of a Miss Burbank pageant in 1948, when she was just 16; within two years, she had been put under contract by Warner Brothers, which changed her name to Debbie. Learning along the way to sing and dance, she starred in a series of syrupy musicals and comedies in the 1950's. She married the singer and actor Eddie Fisher. And they became Hollywood royalty.
Then, in 1958, just after she gave birth to the couple's second child, Todd, Mr. Fisher abruptly left her to marry Elizabeth Taylor. An enormous scandal at the time, it only cemented moviegoers' affection for Ms. Reynolds, who in the public imagination was a trusting ingenue betrayed by a cad and a vamp.
But that affection was not strong enough to insulate Ms. Reynolds, or her career, from the changes in the movie industry in the mid-1960's, when Hollywood began to abandon the feather-light concoctions like "The Tender Trap" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" that were the jewels in Ms. Reynolds's crown. Ms. Reynolds, who was not regarded as a versatile character actress, slowly slipped from view, along with other actresses who served similarly iconic functions in their films.
"I didn't stop making movies," she said. "They stopped making me. They started making message pictures, and we were all out of a job: Kathryn Grayson, Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, Leslie Caron. We all bit the dust."
But Ms. Reynolds had to continue working. "I had no time to feel sorry for myself," she said, explaining that her second marriage, to the businessman Harry Karl, ended disastrously in the early 1970's, with him plunging into debt and Ms. Reynolds's formidable savings virtually depleted. "I had to survive. I had to raise children," she said, referring to Todd, who now runs her casino in Vegas, and Carrie.
So she took what she knew how to do -- sing, dance and crack a joke -- and hit the road.
Movie makers seldom courted her, and she was too scared of rejection to approach them. Only once, she says, did she pursue a role: that of the mother in "Postcards From the Edge," based on her daughter's semiautobiographical novel.
"I figured everyone was going to think it was me anyway, so I might as well play it," Ms. Reynolds said. The director, Mike Nichols, told her he had already settled on Ms. MacLaine.
It came as no surprise. "I was passe as far as film," Ms. Reynolds said.
"Mother" could change that. The title character is a deceptively frail-looking creature with an awesome talent for inadvertent insults; she is a 100-pound, size-4 assassin of egos with a fabulous dye job.
When Ms. Fisher saw the finished movie, "I almost wept with joy," she said, because she could tell it would give her mother an emotional and economic boost. A host of financial complications involving the Debbie Reynolds Casino had put Ms. Reynolds in a precarious position, and her third marriage, to Richard Hamlett, ended in divorce earlier this year.
"There is a part of her that just feels crushed sometimes from having to work, from having to support so many people," Ms. Fisher said, explaining that her mother takes care of her own mother, Maxene, 84, and several other relatives. "She's had a bad couple of years."
ON THE STRENGTH OF footage from "Mother" and Mr. Rudin's recommendation, Ms. Reynolds won her prominent supporting role in "In and Out," also produced by Mr. Rudin, a fictional story of a high school teacher teacher who is outed as gay. Kevin Kline plays the teacher, and Ms. Reynolds his mother. The movie is due in the spring.
Mr. Rudin recalled that one day, when a crowd of nearly 1,000 extras for "In and Out" were getting restless, Ms. Reynolds simply burst into 30 minutes of her Vegas act.
"She's an old ham, like Gleason," Mr. Rudin said. "They're whores to the audience in the most wonderful way."
Another day, Ms. Reynolds was nearly run over by a thirtyish woman who was thrilled about having just met Mr. Kline.
"Are you in this movie, too?" the woman asked, belatedly recognizing Ms. Reynolds as vaguely familiar.
For a fleeting moment, the actress looked insulted. Then her expression softened.
"Yes," she said, a touch of pride welling in her voice. "Yes, I am."

HEADLINE: Low-Income Housing in a Tourist Mecca

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: BRANSON, Mo.

 BODY:
When 40-year-old Janice Jones walked away from what she called a "controlling marriage," she and her three daughters moved to this booming entertainment town in the Ozarks, just 30 miles from their old home but light years away in hope and opportunity.
"After 18 years of marriage, I had to basically start over," she said. "I thought if I could make it anywhere it would be in Branson." 
 Starting over in Branson has meant working 40 to 50 hours a week as a waitress at Shoney's and earning about $1,400 a month, then coming home to the portable sewing machine on her dining table and making dolls and angels to sell at crafts shows and shops.
Difficult as things are, Mrs. Jones is upbeat and hopeful. Part of the reason is that the family found a new, two-bedroom apartment in Lost Tree, a pleasant garden-style complex with manicured grounds and a swimming pool, for a manageable rent of $330 a month. From the sofa in her living room, looking out across the deck to dense trees clinging to the steep Ozark terrain, she called it "a nice place where I can raise my girls without being scared."
Lost Tree and its affordable rents were made possible by the low-income housing tax credit program of Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. Branson is one of a number of entertainment-resort areas around the country that have found it possible to provide housing for their service-sector employees through the program. Others include Orlando and Kissimmee in Florida, Laughlin, Nev., and Cripple Creek, Colo.
In Branson's case, what was, until about 15 years ago, a simple village in the hills with a few local country music shows and some other rustic attractions has become a glittering entertainment and tourist mecca. Since the beginning of the 1990's, the Branson economy has grown by 20 percent a year, though civic leaders now think it is settling back to about 10 percent.
Entertainers ranging from Andy Williams to Boxcar Willie to Bobby Vinton and Mel Tillis have theaters in Branson. There are more than 50,000 seats for live theater and nearly 23,000 hotel rooms to serve 6 million visitors a year. Branson's boosters say it has more theater seats than Broadway and more hotel rooms than most major cities. It also has a number of outlet malls.
All of that requires many food servers, ushers, ticket sellers, cashiers, cleaners, cooks and busboys -- jobs that typically pay $6.50 to $7 an hour. Branson basically shuts down from January through March, during which time most of the work force goes on unemployment. Modest though they may be, the Branson jobs have attracted a labor force not only from the small towns in the surrounding hill country of Missouri and Arkansas but from all over the country. Most of the workers had a rude awakening about housing soon after they arrived.
Although Branson has a lot of good housing in the $100,000-and-up range, most of the workers cannot afford the down payment or monthly payment on that kind of house or condominium. Nor can they afford most of the decent rental housing.
Lost Tree was built by John L. Harpole, a Springfield, Mo., developer, with the real estate investment syndication firm of Boston Capital Services as equity investor.
Using the tax-credit program, investors are usually able to generate an after-tax return of 12 to 14 percent on equity over 10 to 12 years by reducing their Federal tax obligation. Corporate investors are able to earn 1 or 2 percentage points more because of their ability to use depreciation deductions that are generally unavailable to individual investors.
The equity is used to finance housing that benefits people earning less than 60 percent of the median income of a given area. Tenants' rents are held to 30 percent of their income. Income limitations for Lost Tree range from $13,500 for a single person to $19,320 for a family of four, and 132 units have been built, with 68 more planned.
"Before we built Lost Tree, a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment would rent for $600 a month in Branson," Mr. Harpole said. "A 25-year-old trailer might be $500 a month, and an old house with two or three bedrooms was $600 to $800. The first construction laborer we hired was living across the street from the site in a camper shell for $80 a month."
When the first 88 units at Lost Tree opened in January 1995 -- all with two bedrooms and two baths in 848 square feet, plus a deck -- they were snapped up. The second group of 44 units, which includes one- and three-bedroom apartments, is being rented. The 200-unit project is expected to cost $10.6 million.
Mr. Harpole, an accountant who says he does not know how to drive a nail, got into low-income housing in the early 1980's working for clients. Then he decided to give up his practice and become a full-time developer for the low-income market. Besides Branson, he has projects in St. Louis and Lawrence, Kan., and is ready to start one in Gardner, Kan.
The success of Lost Tree contrasts with the unhappy experiences of other developers in Branson who were drawn from other parts of the country by the boom atmosphere. Mistakenly thinking that the boom meant that home seekers would grab anything that came on the market, they paid inflated prices for land and developed housing that is not selling because it is priced beyond the market, according to Donna and Al Moon, brokers who have been involved in commercial and residential real estate sales in Branson since the early 1980's.
They traced the origin of the notion that Branson was a real estate boom town to a segment done by the CBS news program "60 Minutes" in December 1991. Branson was already a growing phenomenon as an entertainment center then, having just attracted its first noncountry singer, Andy Williams, to build a theater there, but Mr. Moon said the television program "didn't say that the jobs paid minimum wage and people were living in cars."
"Job seekers started to drive in here almost literally the following Monday," Mrs. Moon said, "and developers from all over started calling and coming. They threw money at anything without doing due diligence.
"People would see one of those developers and say, 'There goes a guy about to get Ozarked.' "
Mrs. Moon said one Florida developer bought "a beautiful piece of flat land," a rarity in Branson, and built a subdivision of 25 homes. But the exteriors were too plain for regional tastes, she added, and the houses lacked coat closets in the front hall, a standard feature in places where it is cold in the winter. She said the builder was now "desperate to get people to buy."
Mr. Harpole sees his apartments in Branson and elsewhere as vital for people just starting out in adult life, or, as in the case of Mrs. Jones, starting over. The tradition in this area is for people to own their own home from a young age, but many of those coming to Branson have neither a work record nor the down payment to obtain a mortgage.
But the below-market rents at Lost Tree, he said, make it possible for a disciplined worker to save a down payment. He is proud of the fact that 15 of the original 88 renters at Lost Tree have left because they purchased homes.
Such dreams are very much part of the planning of other Lost Tree renters, including Gabe Novak, 21, who makes $7 an hour plus commissions as a photographer on the showboat Branson Belle. Mr. Novak, who grew up in nearby Harrison, Ark., and started coming to Branson to work when he was 15, dreams of buying his own camera equipment and becoming an outdoor photographer.
And eventually, he promised, as he squeezed the hand of his girlfriend, Julie Morrison, they will buy the dream home they have discovered in these hills: a 4,700-square-foot domed house in the $200,000-plus range.

Every Man A Caligula

 BODY:
On Tuesday, Americans will begin a jag of holiday overindulgence that won't end until the last oily nacho is downed on New Year's Eve. But have you ever wondered how things might play out if you had serious money and a truly Sybaritic vision? Barnaby Conrad 3d has both. A 44-year-old San Francisco connoisseur, Conrad writes books celebrating high-end decadence ("Absinthe," "The Cigar"). We asked him to construct a dream menu for very discriminating guests.
 First wave: Serve 4-to-1 martinis. (Use Boodles gin, $18 a fifth.) Gobble beluga malassol caviar ($50 an ounce). Appetizers: Brittany oysters; accent with a pouring of sweet Chateau d'Yquem sauterne ($199).
 
 Main course: Venison medallions ($30 a pound), cranberries, sweet yams. Wine? Something "homey," says Conrad, like Grace Family 1984 vintage cabernet sauvignon ($229).
 Apres: Mesclun salad with Moet & Chandon Champagne vinaigrette; "down and dirty" cheeses like taleggio, a gushy Italian triple-creme ($10 a pound).
 Dessert: Miss Grimble's cheesecake; Delamaine Vespers Cognac ($100).
The "outlaw" moment: We can't recommend crime, but Conrad notes that bootleg absinthe is still smuggleable from Portugal and Andorra. Sip with Monte Cristo No. 2 cigars ($25 each).
 Recovery: Ease back into reality with coffee, a 20-quail-egg omelet, mimosas and multivitamins. Contemplate your decadence and total bill for a party of eight ($2,400) with an economical relaxing agent: Miller Lite, $12 per 12-pack at all your finer quick-marts.

Re "When the Marching Ends, Career Paths Hit Barriers" (From the Desk Of, Nov. 24): 
 The ironic, if not tragic, side of the barriers facing men and women departing the armed forces is that American businesses are crying out for workers with the skills and qualities these people possess. With few exceptions, businesses have not tapped into a resource represented by some 250,000 to 300,000 people leaving the military every year.
After serving 34 years in the Marine Corps, I started two companies that hired exclusively from the armed forces. Their success led me to start a business that recruits from the armed forces for some of America's leading companies. Although we recruit from all ranks, our core business is recruiting from enlisted personnel. Our clients have found:
* Those departing the armed forces with honorable discharges have no problems passing security background checks and all are in excellent physical condition.
* They are dependable, highly trainable team players who progress faster and seek opportunities for self-improvement.
* They are trained in basic skills that are easily convertible to civilian needs. Most are graduates of military educational programs that compensate for deficiencies in high school preparation.
* They have lived in the most successfully integrated sector of American society, and the most drug free. They bring these values to the workplace. A recent study by the Twentieth Century Fund, a research group, on racial integration in the military speaks volumes on what corporations like Texaco could learn simply by hiring the men and women who have lived and worked in a truly integrated society.
Then why do those departing the armed forces face barriers?
The most significant reason rests with the flip side of the advantages of the volunteer armed forces: there is no longer a universal understanding or knowledge of the military. Many hiring managers, often in their 20's, have no concept of military service or appreciation of the talents acquired in the modern military. This can translate into stereotyping and discrimination.
Of course, there is little opportunity to network while on a carrier or in Bosnia. And every job hunter knows the importance of networking.
The Defense Department transition program does not reach all the people departing the armed forces and is not user friendly for employers. It also lacks sufficient funds.
Of course, a small percentage of service people don't quite get it. What our clients want are people with the values of today's military, not "military people." No one wants employees who can't take the medals off.
But members of the armed forces can take heart. There are a few good businesses out there looking for a few good men and women and offering opportunities "after the marching ends" to continue to make a significant contribution.

Her Crop is Your Christmas

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

DATELINE: HAMPTON TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
NINE-YEAR-OLD Joseph Schwork, tramping through thick mud in the Douglas fir section of Beaverbrook Tree Farm, grabbed a limb of yet another scraggly four-foot specimen. "I want this one, I want this one," he said.
Shoulders hunched against the rain and raw wind, his father, Tom Schwork, was clutching a handsaw and clearly straining to keep the family outing from deteriorating. "Maybe next year," he pleaded. "Let's find one so we can go home and eat. Don't you want to play hockey?" 
 All over this farm's 174 acres of 50,000 trees -- Douglas fir, white spruce and Scotch pine -- families were roaming through hillsides of trees planted in grid patterns, sizing up each and cutting down one. Mary Ann Castimore, owner of the farm, had recruited her father, mother, aunt, brother and his fiancee, and various nieces, nephews and neighbors to work during this, her busiest weekend in her busiest month.
Last year, people around the country bought 37 million Christmas trees, for a sf total of $1.2 billion, according to the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group. Ms. Castimore sold 1,200 of them at prices ranging from $17 for Scotch pine to $37 for Douglas fir. This year she hopes to sell at least 1,500.
Having inherited a piece of her grandparents' dairy and cattle farm, Ms. Castimore began planting Christmas trees in 1985. Five years ago, she was able to begin selling the tallest. She was entering a competitive business; New Jersey has 800 tree farms, nearly all cut-your-own. Elsewhere around the country, a majority of farmers sell Christmas trees to businesses set up in malls, parking lots and city streets, frequently shipping them hundreds of miles. But in New Jersey, where farms are small and the population is dense, nearly all trees are sold locally. Farmers do not export trees to other states, and sellers import relatively few trees from big farms far away. Since 1907, when a Mercer County farmer, M. V. McGalliard, sold Norway spruce trees he had planted six years before -- perhaps the first cultivated Christmas trees -- Christmas tree farming in New Jersey has been a local business.
Like the Schworks, a high percentage of New Jerseyans opt for a choose-and-cut tree. The short walk in the woods, the selection of a living tree and the five minutes sawing it down is a bit of an adventure, preferable to a supermarket parking lot. Besides being fresher -- "like a vine-ripened tomato," said John Perry, executive secretary of the New Jersey Christmas Tree Association -- hand-chopped trees are usually a little cheaper.
In the 1980's, when real estate prices had soared and the state began giving tax breaks to working farms, the number of tree farms soared. "It was a fad," said John Perry, executive director of the New Jersey Christmas Tree Association. "There were a lot of farms all next to each other. And they all had to move that product."
The farms overwhelmed the market, and many went out of business. Inexperienced farmers attracted by the vision of profits by planting trees, doing nothing for 7 to 10 years, then cutting and selling them were especially vulnerable.
"Most people think you plant a tree and seven, eight years later you have a Christmas tree," said Ms. Castimore, 42.
Around 1980, Ms. Castimore, along with 23 relatives, inherited a parcel of the 3,500-acre farm where her father and grandfather had raised Guernsey dairy cows. The others sold their land. Ms. Castimore, whose idea of relaxing time off is climbing Mount Rainier, could not picture herself in an office. But she was not naive about farming. She prepared. She investigated seedlings and pine cones from thriving trees. She studied agricultural economics at the University of Florida, earning a bachelor's degree.
Gradually, over the years, she planted 50,000 pine trees, setting aside separate tracts for Douglas fir, white spruce and Scotch pine, mixing young trees with more mature ones. Producing shapely, full trees requires an annual routine: mowing, fertilizing, spraying for weeds and pests. Deer, which can kill thousands of trees by eating the top buds of seedlings, must be driven off. To form a wide-based triangular Christmas tree shape, which is not natural, the trees must be sheared annually.
Then there is selling. There are, she pointed out, a lot of Christmas tree farms, down the road and around Sussex County. She has a month to sell all her wares. So she offers hot and cold cider at the cash register. Like many cut-your-own farms, she sells wreaths and Christmas knickknacks of carved pine. She hand-writes notes to regular customers, beginning in August.
"I write everybody's name in red and their address in green," she said. "I send 1,500 postcards. People thank me for them."
The day after Thanksgiving kicks off the month of selling -- Fridays through Mondays, with Saturdays and Sundays jammed with customers.
"Everybody kind of gives me a hand at this point," she said. And indeed, genial, blond, outdoorsy-looking Castimores can be spotted around the farm, at every stage of the process. Mary Ann's brother, Sam, a veterinarian, drives the tractor, which carts down wagonloads of trees that customers have cut. This particular Sunday, his tractor is stuck in the mud. "My father's forgotten more about tractors than I ever knew," he remarks, awaiting rescue. His father, Emery -- who engages in requisite Castimore ribbing before lending his son a hand -- is an older but equally ruddy, hale version of his son and daughter. Lillian, Mary Ann's mother, greets customers heartily while she makes her way through the people milling while they wait for their trees to be baled. Each family member -- but especially Mary Ann -- looks at ease, at home on the farm, making wry remarks as they answer questions and bundle trees.
Customers, meanwhile, move through the process of acquiring a tree -- walking into the hills, inspecting, arguing, looking again. Finally agreeing. Sawing, dragging. Waiting, paying, tying to the car. And, long out of sight of the Castimores, placing in the living room and decorating.
"You come, pick a nice fresh tree from my daughter," Henry Castimore said expansively. "Take you 20 minutes. We give you fresh air and we give you mud."
And besides the tree, you take home a small piece of fresh family tradition.

To the Editor:
In the article "A Safety Net Wears Thin" (Dec. 8), Kit R. Roane managed to place a human face on the tragedy of homelessness. 
 He also showed how poorly paid, worthy citizens who live week to week on the economic brink can end up in a shelter at any moment. "The main problem is affordable housing" -- this phrase from the article gets to the crux of the matter.
In my opinion, none of our sociologists or urbanologists have noticed the connection between the reduction in the number of rooming houses and the increase in the homeless population. Granted, many of the homeless are families with children who are precluded from living in a rooming house because of the lack of private bathrooms and kitchens. But there are countless singles who, if rooming houses were available, could find affordable accommodations within their meager budgets.
In the '80s there were a few tragedies involving boarding homes in our shore communities in which residents died in fires. The furor over these needless deaths gave rise to a campaign to reduce the number of rooming houses. This was carried over to many of our municipalities, and so housing stock that was used to shelter poor people disappeared.
Neighboring New York City eliminated many hotels that catered to single room occupancy, further complicating the problem by converting these buildings into apartments for the middle class. Recently this was undone as the city fathers realized how this trend added to the problem of finding reasonably priced housing for poor people.
I would suggest a follow-up article dealing with the rooming house as an alternative to homelessness.

HEADLINE: From Her Lips to God's Ear

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
THE REV. JOAN J. BRIGHTHARP doesn't quite fit the traditional image of a black Baptist preacher. First of all, she's a woman -- with fire-engine-red nail polish, spike heels and sparkle in her wardrobe.
By her own admission, Ms. Brightharp can be a "pushy broad," if that's what it takes to get what she wants. She has defended Mike Tyson as a "young man who was done wrong," and criticized the New York City Police Department of being too quick on the trigger in the fatal 1995 shooting of Abe Richardson, 22, who had tried to flee on his bicycle as undercover officers arrested two other men on drug charges near a Lower East Side housing project. Mr. Richardson was wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying a loaded .38-caliber pistol that had been stolen, the police said. A grand jury declined to indict six officers involved in the shooting. 
 Ms. Brightharp also worked in the senatorial campaign of the Rev. Al Sharpton and is among the first female members of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Greater New York and Vicinity.
If the social activism that she finds so comfortable does not entirely cohere to some people's vision of what a holy life should be, that's fine with her. It is part of her urban ministry, which is knotted with the contradictions and controversy of life in the 1990's.
She knows people talk behind her back, questioning the propriety of a woman leading a Baptist congregation as well as the wisdom of her decision to leave a financially sound Harlem church to found, on little more than a frayed purse string and a prayer, the Greater New Hope Missionary Baptist Church of Christ on East Ninth Street five years ago.
But, she likes to point out, the little church with "that woman" as its preacher is about to enter its sixth year and although financially strapped, it is growing, at a time when many established ministries are struggling with dwindling congregations.
"There were no traditional Baptist churches here on the Lower East Side," Ms. Brightharp recalled one day recently in her small back-room office at the church. "God placed it upon my heart to step out on faith and start a church. I still have no idea where the Lord is going to lead me. But I know people down here are happy seeing a black Baptist church."
 
Soul Singer's Sequined Gowns
 A preacher's granddaughter from Augusta, Ga., Ms. Brightharp came to the Lower East Side in 1964 to pursue a singing career in a secular group called the Barbettes. She married a man whom she says abused her physically; they divorced in 1966, and she struggled, successfully, to keep her only child, Monroe, from yielding to the drugs and other destructive temptations that are a part of the neighborhood. She found clerical work at the State Department of Social Services. She continued to sing and her strong alto-soprano voice -- which serves her ministry well -- caught the ear of Eddie O'Jay of the rhythm and blues group the O'Jays. Mr. O'Jay agreed to manage her singing career, and she began writing songs for the soul artist Billy Paul and the producers Leon Huff and Kenny Gamble.
"I was into the music world, but not of it," Ms. Brightharp says, giggling like a schoolgirl as she flips through photographs of her with big hair and sequined gowns. "I was always a lady, even though I was socializing in a sometimes mean and cruel industry. But I never turned my back on God. I always made it to church. Being a Christian kept me out of trouble, and I decided to give my life over to God completely."
She attended the New York Theological Seminary and graduated from the College of New Rochelle in 1987 with a bachelor of arts degree in business and philosophy. In 1983, Ms. Brightharp became the first woman to be ordained as a minister at Mount Nebo Baptist Church in Harlem and was on the path to becoming an assistant pastor there. Instead, she remembers, she felt a calling to work in the neighborhood she calls home. She knocked on neighbors' doors to find parishioners, and her first sermons were delivered to a handful of people in the living room of her apartment along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.
When the number of worshipers exceeded the number of chairs, Ms. Brightharp walked block after block until she found an old brick bar with a for-rent sign at 618 East Ninth Street, between Avenues B and C, in 1992. In the dank room inside, the landlord, Henry Twigge, known throughout the neighborhood as Mr. Henry, drank with friends. He was looking to get $500 a month in rent until he learned that the fast-talking woman inquiring about his watering hole was a preacher looking for space.
Mr. Twigge says her sincerity and passion persuaded him to lower the rent to $250 a month for the first two years; the rent is still $500. Ever since, Ms. Brightharp said, she has kept him in her prayers, grateful for a landlord who understands that the offering rarely covers the rent and who willingly fixes a leaky toilet and loans the church chairs from his apartment.
"There are good people out here in this world," Ms. Brightharp says.
Her congregation -- a handful at first, 85 official members today -- are culled from the unchurched: mostly men and women who had lost touch with or turned their backs on organized religion when poverty or drugs or drink became so strong it took over their lives. Many will tell you they were raised in the church, but could not recall the last time they set foot inside one.
"It's bad when you've forgotten how to pray," Ms. Brightharp said.
"Most of the ministers in the area don't live in this neighborhood," she went on, "so they don't know the pain and suffering that people down here are going through. People in this community are hurting and they need somebody there that they can call on any time, day or night."
A few years ago, Elizabeth Sayles found solace in the bottle with the Johnnie Walker label. Today she is the head usher at Greater New Hope, and the church is her refuge in the landscape of tenements, abandoned storefronts and drug dealers. Ms. Sayles says when Ms. Brightharp knocked on her apartment door a few years ago, she did not know what possessed her to put her faith in the minister who offered prayer, hope and redemption. Today, she credits God.
"I've been sober now for six years and I ain't going back," she said, brushing a speck of lint from her white usher's uniform. "A lot of the people I hung out with when I was into the world are still drinking and drugging. They try to tempt me, but uh-uh."
 
Cot for a Homeless Man
 Walter Solomon remembers the bitterly cold December night two years ago when Ms. Brightharp visited the tent he was sharing with several other homeless people in Tompkins Square Park. She offered blankets and when she asked Mr. Solomon if he was in need of anything, he responded, "Who art thou?"
"I knew this was someone who had been raised in the church," Ms. Brightharp said. "I told him that I was the pastor of a Baptist church down on East Ninth Street, and he said he'd been looking for a church and wouldn't mind coming to Greater New Hope." He showed up at the next Sunday service, wearing a tie-dyed shirt and jeans. Ms. Brightharp was looking for someone to watch over the church at night. She allowed Mr. Solomon to stay, offering him a small cot in the back because she thought his presence would ward off anyone intent on stealing the church's meager possessions.
"She gave me my first suit and tie and taught me how to play this little old piano," said Mr. Solomon, who now wears a suit to Sunday services, even if it means washing it by hand and ironing it himself. "I started writing gospel songs and now I'm working in a studio recording. I love this church. It is my home."
Ms. Brightharp tells you that she could have walked into a wealthier church and been sitting pretty like some of those big-time male preachers she knows with their shiny new cars and nice houses.
"Believe me I had no problems walking into a church that was already organized," she said. "But where I am there is a need and it was a disgrace that we didn't have a traditional Baptist church to service the people on the Lower East Side."
She brings a practiced wit, an evangelist's anecdotal flair and a revivalist fervor to the dozens of sermons she preaches every year. Her many mentors, among them the late Rev. Dr. William D. Gardiner, who ordained her; the Rev. Alfloyd Alston, pastor of Antioch Baptist Church in Harlem, and Mr. Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, describe her as a devout urban missionary and a capable preacher, well-versed in scripture.
Mr. Sharpton said he first heard about Ms. Brightharp when she worked on his 1994 senatorial campaign.
He remembers thinking how courageous she was to have gone into "David's waters" as ministers say, because she chose an area where there was tremendous pain. "Few black churches have gone down there to try to turn the area around spiritually and tend to its social needs," Mr. Sharpton said. "For her to do that, she gained my respect. There has been sexism in various circles of the religious world and she has the double challenge of fighting both the fact that she is not coming out of the mainstream church and being a female in a male-dominated, sometimes sexist occupation."
When she talks about women and the Bible, Ms. Brightharp is part teacher, part preacher, philosophical and political.
"One of the reasons, so few recognize the contributions of women in religion is because nobody preaches about what women did in the Bible," she says. "They don't talk about Huldah in II Kings 22:14. Huldah was a prophetess who was consulted by priests to interpret the Book of Deuteronomy. They don't tell you about Deborah, a prophet and a wife, who in Judges 4:8, led the army to Kedesh, because Barak, a man, was afraid to do it alone."
 
$8 in the Collection
 To do God's work nowadays, you also have to play politics, Ms. Brightharp said as she gunned the engine of her bronze Cadillac along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive on her way to a meeting with Margarita Lopez, a Democratic district leader from the Lower East Side. She was 20 minutes late -- on time by her schedule.
"My sister in the struggle to improve life down here," Ms. Lopez says of Ms. Bright harp. "When I ran for district leader, she helped me establish a link with the African-American community; for me that was very important. Our community suffers from benign neglect. I see the effects of that when the Reverend is denied an opportunity to establish a church in a suitable place. She is right when she speaks of the church not being on solid ground."
From the raised stage that serves as her pulpit, Ms. Brightharp preaches a fiery brand of old-time religion, New Age spirituality and black pride. She is as likely to sermonize on Mike Tyson, Tupac Shakur and Hillary Rodham Clinton as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; as likely to preach about economic empowerment and family responsibility as redemption and salvation.
Many members of Greater New Hope's congregation struggle to put food on the table and clothes on their children's and grandchildren's backs and to have enough left for round-trip subway fare. So when the offering plate comes around on Sunday, they give what they can, which is little: mostly quarters and dimes, usually barely enough to cover the church's phone and light bills.
Ms. Brightharp preaches about the importance of offerings but also understands that in a Lower East Side of hard times and little hope, people do not easily part with their money; not even for God.
"Children, we've got to do better than this," she said one Sunday morning after the collection raised only $8. "I'm going to send the plate around again cause we've got to do better than this. The church can't make it on this, children." She seldom ventures far from Greater New Hope, tending to the needs of her congregation like a doting mother. She worries her parishioners may not be able to hold church without her.
"But I've been teaching them that Reverend can't do it all and they need to know how to conduct Sunday service in my absence," she said. "This is their church and it's important that we give our people a chance to lead, because they don't always get that in the real world."
The week before the church celebrated its fourth anniversary last September, Ms. Brightharp was out of town, attending the National Baptist Convention in Orlando, Fla. While she was away, someone entered the church and stole an unknown amount of money from the glass water jug that sits on a windowsill and holds the church's building fund. "Anybody that would break into the House of the Lord and steal. I'm scared of that person," Ms. Brightharp told the congregation the following Sunday morning. "That's a low blow to the church."
"Yeah, Reverend!" came scattered voices from the congregation. "Go on Reverend! Tell it like it is."
"Now it's Sunday," the pastor responded, "and I'm in church, so I'm not going to say what I want to say. But that is the lowest of low to come in and take from a church. Any church, but our little poor struggling church." Her amber eyes filled with tears as she embraced the amens from the congregants. She stood at the pulpit for what seemed like an eternity, struggling to regain composure.
"The Lord will make a way somehow," she sang softly. "The Lord will make a way somehow."
 
Prayer for a New Home
 Still, Ms. Brightharp knows that it is likely to take a miracle to get the church to what she is determined will be its future: a five-story building at 143-45 Avenue D at 10th Street.
For the last four years, she has had her eye on the building, owned by the city and vacant since 1982. Every other Sunday, she lays her hands upon the graffiti-covered brick walls and bows her head in prayer. It is a simple prayer: that God grant her the wherewithal to obtain the building from the city to build a new church home for Greater New Hope.
"I believe it will be done," she said as she stood near the edge of the curb to get a full view of the building. "I've placed it in the Master's hands and something tells me that He wants us to have this building for our Bible Institute and to house our center for youth, our nursery and the elderly center."
She smiles with the innocence of a child who has been assured that prayers can be answered, then continues: "I see this building as a sanctuary on the Lower East Side. A place where people can come for spiritual guidance; a place to be fed; to escape the madness on the streets and to enjoy themselves. I know a lot of folks believe I'm reaching for straws, even some in the ministry. But all you need is the faith of a mustard seed and. . . ."

Slowly Making Inroads in a Church Hierarchy
WOMEN have long been the backbone of black churches, attending, giving and offering their services in greater proportion than men. Yet women are still trying to overcome resistance to their presence as members of the clergy. Although most major religious denominations have been ordaining women for more than 20 years, many churches have been hesitant to elevate women to the position of pastor.
Black women say their plight has been intensified by the fact that the church has traditionally been the main vehicle for black men to exercise both religious and political power. Female ministers often meet opposition from older female church members who are accustomed to a male presence in the pulpit. Some theologians have argued that the Scriptures prohibit women from the clergy, a position that others say is open to interpretation.
Until a year ago, the Baptist Ministers Conference of Greater New York and Vicinity, an influential group representing more than 500 ministers, did not let women join. Today, 50 female ministers belong to the group, which was founded in 1898 to serve as a spiritual, social, civic and financial network for local clergy. But women still do not hold any of the group's major leadership roles.
In 1983, a group of the city's female ministers organized the Baptist Women's Ministers. The group disbanded after the Baptist ministers conference opened its membership to women.
"I believe more and more will become involved in the conference," said the Rev. Dr. Shellie Sampson Jr., president of the conference and pastor of Thessalonia Baptist Church in the Bronx.
Ms. Brightharp, a founding member of the women's ministers organization, has attended the Baptist ministers conference meetings for 15 years. She said she did not feel she had to be a member to enjoy the fellowship with her male clergy, many of whom have strongly supported her efforts.
"Not only do I feel fully accepted," she said, "I was one of the first women to preach at the order of the day at the conference's weekly meeting last July." Her topic: women in the Bible.
Last October, Ms. Brightharp became the first female candidate to be endorsed by a conference committee as correspondent secretary. She lost the general election but was appointed chairwoman of the women in ministry committee, the first woman to lead a conference committee. LENA WILLIAMS

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
The Door Reopens, But the Floor Is Gone

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
The Gabelli ABC fund reopens on Jan. 2, but without its minimum guaranteed return of 5 percent a year.
The fund, which started in 1993, originally offered a guarantee to help lure bank-account and certificate-of-deposit savers who were used to insured investments but were distressed by tumbling interest rates. There is now no need for that incentive, said Mario Gabelli, chief investment officer of Gabelli Funds in Rye, N.Y., and portfolio manager of ABC. He added, however, that "we may come back to this program when the markets come down sharply in a given year so that people would find a guarantee of 5 percent attractive." 
 ABC has also shown that it can achieve attractive returns under various market conditions, the company said in announcing its new status as an open-ended, no-load fund.
ABC returned 7.92 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended Nov. 30, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago. That performance lagged behind other domestic hybrid funds, which gained an average of 12.17 percent a year, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which had an average annual return of 19.07 percent.
Eight other funds started since the early 90's also carry guarantees. But the Kemper Retirement funds I through VI and the Smith Barney Principal Return 1998 and 2000 funds guarantee investors only a return of their principal if shares are held to maturity and dividends are reinvested. The Kemper funds have termination dates roughly 10 years after start-up; the Smith Barney funds have seven- and nine-year terms.
Like Gabelli ABC, these funds have had returns that trail their benchmarks in the last three years, but by slightly less, Morningstar said. All are also classified as domestic hybrid funds, Morningstar's new category for funds that mix stocks and bonds, and their three-year annualized returns range from 7.28 percent for Smith Barney 2000, the only return lower than that of Gabelli ABC, to 10.02 percent for Kemper Retirement I.
The concept of guaranteed funds hasn't been very successful, said Susan Paluch, managing editor of the Morningstar Investor newsletter. "That more funds didn't come out and that they gathered so few assets speaks for itself," Ms. Paluch said. The group together holds about $930 million.
The Gabelli fund, with $31 million in assets, closed to new investors after its first day, guaranteeing the return for them for one year; similarly, it was only open one day a year after that to new investors.
The fund can invest in almost any domestic stocks or bonds, while the Kemper and Smith Barney funds own a mix of zero-coupon bonds plus equities.
The performance of the Kemper and Smith Barney funds has probably been hurt by their zero-coupon bonds, which are very volatile in reaction to interest-rate shifts, Ms. Paluch said. She noted that 1994 was a difficult year for bonds, and that this year had been rough, too. As for the Gabelli fund, it no doubt was hurt over the three years by heavy cash holdings that ranged as high as 76 percent and averaged at least 30 percent, Ms. Paluch said.

A Midas of Funds Sells His Coins
On Dec. 3 in Manhattan, a large group of collectors participated in the auction of the ancient coin collection of Michael F. Price, the value investor who sold Heine Securities to Franklin Resources this year for more than $600 million. But did Mr. Price's famed touch for value that he has consistently shown in managing his Mutual Series funds get him top dollar for his coins?
His collection, of gold and silver Greek and Roman coins, was assigned a presale value of $1.5 million to $2 million, but some analysts conjectured it could bring even more.
In fact, Mr. Price collected $1.5 million for the coins, on the low side of the estimate, said Harvey Stack, whose Stack's Rare Coins conducted the auction. And that amount is very close to what Mr. Stack's son, Lawrence, an official of the auction house and a friend of Mr. Price since childhood, estimated that Mr. Price had paid for the coins over the years.
The auction results were shaped by some adverse market conditions, Harvey Stack said. The strengthening United States dollar weakened the buying power of Asians and Europeans, traditional big buyers of ancient coins, he said. And recent excavations increased the supply of certain coins, pushing down prices.
Several hundred investors from around the world participated in the sale, Mr. Stack said, "one of the largest audiences that we've had for a world-class collection." Nonetheless, the prices paid "didn't establish a new record," he said.
 
Tax Information
Scudder, Stevens & Clark has set up two automated telephone lines to give year-end tax information to shareholders of its Scudder and A.A.R.P. mutual funds. Scudder shareholders can call (800) 343-2890 for preliminary estimates of their funds' distributions; A.A.R.P. fund shareholders should call (800) 631-4636. Actual distribution amounts will be posted in the first week of January.
The Vanguard Group has prepared a 30-page booklet titled "Taxes and Mutual Funds," with information on how funds are taxed, how funds' investment strategies can affect taxes, how investors must calculate and report their taxes, and more. A free copy is available by calling 800 523-7721. Copies are also available on Vanguard's Web site (http://www.vanguard.com) and on Vanguard Online on America Online (keyword: Vanguard).

New Fund
The Boston Partners Large Cap Value fund seeks long-term capital growth, with current income a secondary objective. It invests in stocks of companies with market capitalizations of $1 billion or more and low price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios, among other value characteristics. The minimum investment for institutional shareholders is $100,000, and $10,000 for individual investors who buy either directly or through financial planners or other advisers.

New Managers
Don Hoelting, former chief investment officer for the trust department at Jefferson National Bank in Charlottesville, Va., took the reins as lead manager of IAI Value from Douglas Platt, who remains co-manager. Mr. Hoelting also picked up IAI Growth and Income from Todd McCallister, who remains as an equity portfolio manager with the firm.
Bettina Doulton, who manages Fidelity Puritan and co-manages Advisor Income and Growth and Advisor Annuity Income and Growth, picks up Equity-Income II from Brian Posner, who left the firm.

When the Gabelli ABC fund drops its guarantee of a 5 percent annual return in January, it will leave eight funds offering guaranteed results. Unlike Gabelli, however, the other funds only guarantee the return of the investor's principal over the life of the fund. Total returns listed are for periods through Dec. 13.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
From Risk To Inflation: A Reader's Bull Market

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The economy was in trouble. "Real wages and industrial prices were depressed, while the cost of food and fuel climbed higher, and also became highly unstable -- rising and falling in sharp surges of increasing amplitude." While most workers failed to keep up with inflation, "returns to land and capital continued to advance. Wealth became increasingly concentrated in a few hands."
Is that a description of the recent American economy, from the high inflation of the late 1970's to the soaring stock market of the 1980's and 1990's? Not at all. It's about Europe in the late 16th century. 
 It is drawn from this year's best book for investors, "The Great Wave," by David Hackett Fischer. Too often, historical perspective on Wall Street means going back a decade or two. Mr. Fischer instead traces inflation data from medieval times forward, finding evidence of repeated long patterns of rising prices, followed by long periods of stability. In the process, he demolishes some theories of what causes inflation. Monetarism, in particular, suffers because the evidence is that monetary growth is often a result, not the initial cause, of a price explosion. Inflationary cycles are more likely to begin in response to the demand for goods, resulting from a sudden surge in population.
Mr. Fischer is hesitant about forecasts, but if he is correct, a 100-year-old inflation cycle may be ending. And deflation may arrive within a few years.
In tracing the historic patterns, Mr. Fischer, a Brandeis historian who writes with style and aplomb, occasionally seems to be choosing facts to support a thesis. But the thesis is both believable and fascinating, and so is the book.
If anything, 1996 was a better year for readers than for investors, and it was a fine one for investors. In "Against the Gods," Peter L. Bernstein, who specializes in making obscure investment principles both understandable and interesting, has written a history of our understanding of risk. He starts with the Greeks and goes through the discovery of simple probability all the way to things like the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which provided the theoretical underpinning for diversification of assets.
"The science of risk management sometimes creates new risks as it brings old ones under control," Mr. Bernstein writes. "Institutional investors tend to use broad diversification to justify higher exposure to risk in untested areas. But diversification is not a guarantee against loss, only against losing everything at once."
It is the possibility of loss now, when markets have performed so well for so long, that preoccupies James Grant, the author of "The Trouble With Prosperity." No one knows 20th-century financial history better than Mr. Grant, and it shows as he glides through eras when investors thought everything was wonderful, only to be stunned when something went wrong.
The best part of the book is Mr. Grant's tale of a New York building, 40 Wall Street, conceived in the 1920's and now being renovated by Donald Trump, who got it after Citibank sold it for a fraction of the loan it had foolishly made to a front man for Ferdinand Marcos, the late Philippines dictator.
Along the way we see tenants of the building prosper and then fail as the world changes in unanticipated ways.
Mr. Grant has a gift for storytelling. But he also has a point that may be the hardest lesson investors will learn in coming years: Risk is greatest when financial markets are high and investor fear is low.

HEADLINE: End of an Ideal;
The Shield for Exiles is Lowered

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
THE images, once again, are vivid. Long columns of Rwandans bearing small bundles of their worldly goods trudge on in the thousands, along narrow roads that lead them to an uncertain fate back home. Nobody knows what reprisals these Hutus face for genocide committed in their name two years ago. A first group, fleeing fighting in Zaire, returned to Rwanda weeks ago. Now Tanzania, another country where they sought refuge, no longer wants them either, and its policy is being enforced by troops with guns.
On the sidelines, someone representing the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stands by and notes cheerfully, "They're moving in the right direction." 
 And so another refugee crisis ends. But as the columns of Rwandans fade into history so does one of the great humanitarian principles enshrined in international relations since World War II: that the right to freedom from fear also covers exiles. Spelled out, the doctrine declares that nobody should be forced to return to a homeland where he has reason to fear persecution.
While much is in dispute about why more than a million Hutus fled Rwanda and under what circumstances they remained in Tanzania and Zaire -- just as there are questions about why Bosnians resist returning home from Germany or why Haitians risk a treacherous sea to reach American shores -- some facts are facts.
 
 
 
Times Change
 During the cold war, the right to political asylum was a rallying cry, and some of the great exoduses -- from Vietnam, from Hungary, from Cuba -- were applauded. Now that the war is over, political asylum has been stripped of its propaganda value. But mass migrations, within and across national borders, have only grown, and they now tax almost beyond endurance the world's capacity to respond, or sometimes even to care.
So the rights of people to decide when they feel endangered and to be shielded from forced return to a place they fled have rapidly eroded. That is what was so clear last week in the forcible repatriation of the Rwandans from Tanzania.
Not that the world as a whole ever quite lived up to its fine rhetoric on asylum. Nations, especially powerful nations, never really conceded the prerogative to make decisions on such questions when their own national interests were at stake.
Viewed through the prism of moral choices, it often seemed inexplicable why some people were let in and others kept out. Viewed through the prism of domestic politics -- the Cuban vote in Florida or anti-immigrant xenophobia in France -- the answer was obvious.
Even in the days of the Duvalier family dictatorship, for example, Americans detained Haitians in stark and uncomfortable conditions in Puerto Rican camps and in mainland prisons both to curb and deter unsolicited immigration, on the much-debated premise that most of the Haitians were economic migrants rather than true refugees. Vietnamese were sent back to Vietnam when no other country would accept them. This year, the French police have been rounding up Africans for expulsion. In recent weeks, Germany has begun deporting Bosnians to Sarajevo.
But the epochal moment may have come in 1991, when Turkey closed its borders to Kurds fleeing persecution by Saddam Hussein. Governments and international organizations, led by the Turks' American allies, responded with a makeshift plan to protect and assist the Kurds on their own territory in defiance of their own Government, rather than give them a more secure shield of refugee status in exile. One expert called it "the beginning of the end of classical asylum."
Traditional reasons for asylum are also changing and broadening. It is no longer just a matter of fleeing the K.G.B. or Argentina's generals. The United States has admitted men who fear persecution because they are gay and women who are struggling to evade genital mutilation. Congress has written amendments to immigration legislation that would restore the right to asylum (though for a limited number) for Chinese forced to undergo abortions or sterilizations.
Many believe a natural and welcome evolution is taking place in the way the world looks at refugees -- more practically and less legalistically. Mark Malloch Brown, a World Bank vice president, told a conference sponsored by the International Peace Academy last summer that the U.N. refugee agency, for one, was trapped far too long in an overly narrow definition of its role. But others disagree strongly.
"This is the end of an era in refugee protection," said Arthur C. Helton, director of migration programs at the Open Society Institute in New York. "The U.N.H.C.R. and the nations that are its principal donors have sought to transform the agency from a guardian of refugee protection into the humanitarian branch of the United Nations. But who will now be the guardian of refugees' human rights?"
 
 
 
The Bosnia Syndrome
 The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a unique organization among international agencies, was established in 1951, with memories of Nazism still fresh and Stalin's Soviet bloc looming over Europe. Moscow opposed its creation and had no contact with the organization until the 1970's. For those who backed the founding, though, the world was filled with good places and bad, even evil, places.
"So it was obvious for those who founded the organization to write into the refugee convention as its key point, the fundamental, cardinal principle of refugee protection: that nobody should be forced back," said Soren Jessen-Petersen, who now heads the U.N. refugee office in New York after having served as a special representative in Bosnia.
It was in Bosnia that the High Commissioner's officetook a critical step toward the transformation Mr. Helton described. Faced with the enormous suffering of people displaced within their own country -- who until then would not have been considered refugees -- the High Commissioner, Sadako Ogata, took on the problems of getting aid to them. However noble the motive, the agency was accused of assisting ethnic cleansing or supporting populations bent on endless war.
"Times have changed," Mr. Jessen-Petersen said. "Over the last six or seven years, people are no longer crossing borders in the same way. Now we are basically dealing with refugees from internal conflicts.
"At the same time, there has been a lot of pressure recently on the whole concept of asylum," he added. "Poorer countries are now saying, 'Why should we provide asylum to hundreds of thousands if the richer part of the world cannot even receive 100?' "
The situation that results disturbs Robert P. DeVecchi, president of the International Rescue Committee, which was founded to help escapees from Nazi persecution. Its executive committee met on Thursday to be briefed on the current crisis zone in Africa, an area known as the Great Lakes region.
"I see this period right now as a kind of watershed," he said. "There is a certain loss of innocence that Yugoslavia and the Great Lakes have brought into pretty high relief."

HEADLINE: The Charge Is Murder;
An Infant's Death, an Ancient Debate

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
DISCORDANT images from a Wilmington, Del., courthouse last week:
Two chipmunk-cheeked college freshmen, blushing, tearful, whispering as they sit at the defense table. After the hearing, their fingertips brush in farewell. 
 Then both are returned to prison, having just pled not guilty to the intentional or reckless murder of their newborn son, found abandoned last month in a motel Dumpster.
Their lawyers say the baby was brain-damaged and did not survive delivery. But if, as prosecutors say, the infant was born healthy and died from a fractured skull and from being shaken, the couple committed a stark act of incomprehensible immorality. Yet it would be only the latest example of neonaticide, or the killing of an infant within the first 24 hours of life.
Many early civilizations, including the Greeks, left ailing babies on hillsides to die. Eskimos would kill one of most sets of twins; the Chinese would sacrifice an infant daughter to save the cost of a dowry.
As ancient and as much-debated as neonaticide itself is the question of how society should view it. Throughout history, many cultures have uneasily sanctioned the act as a response to severe social, emotional or economic stress.
The English grappled with the not-uncommon killings of newborns by poor mothers and unmarried servant girls. In the early 19th century, according to one scholar, juries were reluctant to send such women to the gallows: "Those juries knew that at or about the time of birth, dogs, cats and sows sometimes kill their own young. They were not prepared to extend less compassion and concern to a mentally sick woman than they would to an excitable bitch."
Since 1922, England has had an infanticide law providing that mothers who kill babies up to a year old should face charges of manslaughter, not murder. Such women are given psychiatric treatment and rarely serve prison terms.
American law is not so forgiving. It does not carve out lenient exceptions in its homicide statutes for certain victims, "regardless of whether they are one second or 50 years old," said Joshua Dressler, a professor at the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento.
While the facts of neonaticides are often similar, a prosecutor has great discretion over how to charge each case. If Brian C. Peterson, Jr. or Amy S. Grossberg, whose son was found in a trash container outside the Comfort Inn in Newark, Del., are convicted of first-degree murder -- lesser charges were not included in the indictment -- they could face life in prison or the death penalty. But in the case of a New York college student whose conviction for killing her newborn was upheld last month, prosecutors charged her with manslaughter, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide and she was sentenced to one-and-a-third to four years.
 
 
 
Young and Isolated
 Tracking this crime is difficult, because many corpses are never discovered. Using Justice Department statistics, one estimate puts the number at about 250 a year. Dr. Phillip J. Resnick, a professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve medical school, who coined the term "neonaticide" in 1970, said that the number is on the decline because of the availability of birth control and abortion.
Typically, neonaticides are committed by young, isolated women in severe denial of their pregnancy. If they have irregular menstrual periods, they may not realize that they are pregnant soon enough to have an abortion. Doctors say that small, fit women may not develop a belly; one mother said she had seen her teen-age daughter naked the night before she gave birth and had not noticed anything remarkable about the girl's figure.
Profoundly unprepared, the women find themselves giving birth in department store bathrooms and college dorms. The trauma of delivery, followed by the crying of a newborn, crashes through the thickest walls of denial. Women try to stifle the wails by strangling the baby, stuffing tissues down its throat, drowning it in the toilet. Then they throw the tiny corpses in trash compactors, leave them in dresser drawers, even toss them out windows.
Such acts are shocking to a society that cherishes the concept of bonding that begins in utero and prompt many to see neonaticide as the most inhuman of murders. But Dr. Resnick said a woman who desperately does not want to be pregnant can mentally foreclose attachment. "This is a foreign body going through her, not a baby, and the bonding never occurs," he said. "She doesn't think of it as her child but as an object to get rid of."
Some psychiatrists believe many of these women are legally sane and should be charged with some offense, since a mother's attempt to hide the body shows that she knew what she did was wrong. Powerful postpartum depression brought on by riotous hormones can be the basis of an insanity defense but it does not set in until days later, some doctors say.
But Dr. Margaret Spinelli, the director of a maternal mental health program at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, said that women she has treated describe a corrosive breakdown. "They're dissociated from pregnancy, intercourse and reproduction," she said. "Then they deliver and they panic because they're not sure what's happening. It's like driving down a highway but not remembering how they got there: they're charged with killing their child and they don't even have their memories as their own defense."
The case of Ms. Grossberg and Mr. Peterson has confounded many experts not because of their privileged background but because the act is almost always done by a woman alone.
Rarer still is an indictment for capital murder for such a crime. Dr. Resnick questioned whether this is appropriate for two people without prior records. Though he takes a stern view of neonaticide, he added, "they're being charged as if they did something worse than robbing a 7-Eleven store and shooting the clerk."

HEADLINE: The 'Oldest Old,' 80 and Over, Are on the Increase Globally

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Joseph Chamie is a demographer who pores over statistics for hints of the world to come. But he also sees the future in a new kind of cap on medicine bottles, in wider car doors, more off-the-rack eyeglasses and shorter risers on stairs in many new houses.
All are designed to make life easier for an aging population, says Mr. Chamie, director of the Population Division of the United Nations economic and social policy research department. 
 "The reality of demography being destiny is correct, and the business community is more sensitive to this," he said.
He recently brought together demographers, economists, social scientists and policy planners from around the world to talk about a new concept in population -- the emergence of a distinct category of people 80 and older -- and what this means in areas like health care, consumer marketing and voting behavior.
The United Nations conference was co-sponsored by the United States Census Bureau and the American Association of Retired Persons, whose officials were eager to put their concerns in a global context.
Demographers call the 80-plus group the "oldest old" and say it is one of the fastest-growing population segments around the world.
Traditionally, demographers have divided populations into three major groups, with variations from country to country: people under 20, the working-age population from about 20 to 60 or 65 and older, and the post-60 or post-65 segment, largely retired people. But the 80-plus group is now seen as needing to be reckoned with separately.
The debate over how to repair the Social Security system in the United States is mirrored in other countries' concerns, especially in Europe, over the need to adjust benefits now paid out over decades.
But other problems may be unique to some societies. What, for example, happens when each Chinese child, the result of a one-child policy, grows up to find herself or himself without a social security system but with four elderly grandparents and two parents to care for?
In Singapore, where people have fewer children despite official efforts to keep the population growing, the Government has tried to solve the problem of lonely old age by giving financial incentives to younger people who buy apartments close to their parents and by setting aside 5 percent of public housing for multi-generation extended families.
"It is clear that populations are aging around the world," said Samuel Preston, director of the Population Studies Center at the University of Pennsylvania, who took part in the United Nations meeting. "The reason they are aging is that both fertility rates and mortality rates are declining."
Antonio Golini, professor of demography at Rome University, said the reduction of the working-age population would play into future migrations of jobs and labor. In 1950, he said, India and Europe had about the same number of working-age people: 160 million. By 2050, he predicts, the European Union will have 150 million people of working age and India will have 870 million. No immigration laws will be adequate to deter these large populations in search of work.
Demographers disagree about whether a solution to problems created by a reduced working-age population is a later retirement age and the hiring of more older people. Mr. Golini thinks those ideas are unrealistic. "The fact is that the market is pushing away people in their 50's and 60's," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Takes Low Profile In Lima Hostage Talks

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Holding firm to its policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists, the Clinton Administration is playing a quiet, backstage role in trying to resolve the Peruvian hostage standoff.
Of the estimated 350 hostages held by about two dozen Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement rebels, six are believed to be middle-level American officials who serve various political, economic and law enforcement functions in the United States Embassy here. While the names and partial titles of the Americans have been published in the Peruvian daily El Comercio along with those of captive diplomats and dignitaries from over a dozen countries, Administration officials have pleaded with reporters in Washington and Lima to refrain from identifying the American hostages. 
 "We have been trying hard not to focus on them, and we are asking reporters not to name them or bring attention to them in any way," said a senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The more you focus on the Americans the more of a problem it will be for them."
The United States Ambassador, Dennis C. Jett, has offered President Alberto K. Fujimori whatever security advice and resources the Peruvian leader might need, but so far he has been rebuffed by Mr. Fujimori, who is closely keeping his own counsel. A security team made up of military, intelligence and law enforcement personnel was flown in from the United States, but so far its functions have been limited to giving advice to the Ambassador, American officials said.
Frederick La Sor, an American Embassy spokesman, refused to say how many people were in the security team, what their functional abilities were or even which Government agencies they represent.
"Basically what they are here for is to tell Ambassador Jett what resources the U.S. Government has that can be useful" both inside and outside Peru, he said, adding, "If the Peruvian Government comes to him and asks him about specific capabilities, then he will know."
President Clinton has publicly stressed his concern for the safety of the hostages, and President Fujimori sent him a message assuring that the well-being of the captives was his primary concern. Mr. Jett met with Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda of Japan for 50 minutes on Friday, after the Japanese official urged Mr. Fujimori to seek a negotiated solution and refrain from storming the compound.
But Mr. Jett, who left the reception at the Japanese Ambassador's residence Tuesday night just minutes before the rebels stormed the compound, has played a secondary role in mediation efforts. So far diplomats from Canada, Greece and Germany have taken the lead, although their efforts have amounted to little more than facilitating deliveries of supplies to the hostages.
United States diplomats here have not publicly acknowledged that any Americans are being held in the Japanese Ambassador's residence, although they privately say that they were assured by diplomats released on Friday night that none of the six had been harmed. It is not clear whether the rebels have fully identified the Americans and their official functions, because American diplomats formerly stationed in Peru said diplomats in sensitive intelligence or military roles are customarily trained to hide their identities.
"We're not acknowledging the presence of any Americans inside," Mr. La Sor said. But he added that if there were Americans inside the compound, "Our policy is unchanged vis-a-vis terrorists. We think it is not good to negotiate with them. We recommend not to negotiate with them and we as a Government will not negotiate with terrorists and will not meet their demands."
Washington's hard-line public approach is in contrast to the private comments of Japanese officials, who have suggested that a negotiated safe passage to Cuba for the rebels would be welcome. Still, officials from both countries have denied that a rift between the countries exists over how to resolve the crisis.
Whatever diplomatic strategy evolves in Washington, diplomats here say that Mr. Fujimori is likely to follow his own advice and that of his military high command. A tough no-compromise policy against terrorism has been a hallmark of his Government, but Japan is likely to have considerable influence over him because of its heavy commitment to Peru in private investment and Government assistance.
The American concerns for the safety of the American officials are rooted in the longstanding hostility Peruvian guerrillas have shown toward the United States. The Shining Path guerrillas, a competing rebel group, bombed the United States Embassy and the American Ambassador's residence in 1992 and 1993, forcing Washington to open a new, bunker-style embassy in 1995.
The Tupac Amaru rebels, a Cuban-inspired group founded in 1983, have made repeated bombing attacks on American-affiliated enterprises, including Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants, a Pizza Hut and branches of Citibank. In 1992 the same rebel group launched three mortars at the American Ambassador's residence, and in 1993 three unidentified people fired three rifle shots at an American Airlines aircraft as it taxied on the tarmac of Lima's international airport.
The United States has traditionally been influential in Peruvian affairs and developed strong ties to the Peruvian security forces, especially in antidrug efforts. But the United States' sway here is more limited than in some other Latin American countries because of Mr. Fujimori's fiercely independent streak and because the Peruvian military is still dependent on Russian weaponry and training rather than aid from the United States.
Last month Peru bought 12 new Russian MIG-29 fighter bombers against the advice of the United States, which strongly criticized the purchase. The Peruvian ties to Russia go back to a leftist military regime here in the 1970's that was strongly anti-American.

HEADLINE: Apple Hopes Its Founder Rediscovers His Old Magic

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
In May 1985 a dejected Steven P. Jobs stood at the back of a small company meeting at Apple Computer and said, "I guess I don't wear the right kind of pants for this company anymore."
Mr. Jobs, who had become a jeans-clad American hero by helping found Apple in a Silicon Valley garage in 1976, had collided with a buttoned-down executive and lost one of the most dramatic battles for corporate control in history, just a year and a half after the introduction of the Macintosh computer. 
 On Friday night, more than 11 years after he was deposed by John Sculley, the man he had hired in 1983 to help him run the computer maker, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., Mr. Jobs was welcomed back to Apple's corporate campus by Gilbert F. Amelio, a veteran manager who had taken over as chairman of the company earlier this year in an effort to save it from a deep financial crisis.
But can anyone, even someone with the sheer force of personality of Mr. Jobs, save Apple?
In acquiring Mr. Jobs's company, Next Software Inc., for $400 million, Apple hopes to get back on course by developing an operating system program that will again provide it with a technological lead over its main competitor, Microsoft Corporation.
Mr. Jobs, who will retain his role as chairman of Pixar Inc., the computer animation company he bought after leaving Apple, will be given the title of adviser to the chairman and will help Apple chart its course.
Although Mr. Amelio hailed Mr. Jobs at a hastily convened news conference last night as a "visionary" whose return will help lead an Apple "renaissance," whether Apple is actually ready to welcome the mercurial Mr. Jobs back into the fold is yet to be proven.
While he publicly expressed his enthusiasm for the project, privately Mr. Jobs has told associates that he is not coming back to run Apple and that he is not certain whether he will be comfortable with the executives who now run it.
At the news conference, Mr. Jobs played down the formidable technical challenge of taking his Next software and revamping it to run on Macintosh computers that are running existing Macintosh software programs at the same time.
Indeed, it is not clear that Mr. Jobs, as a part-time consultant, will be able to work the same magic that he did in the early 1980's when he took a small group of computer hackers and set up shop in a remote building on the Apple campus flying a pirate flag. In 1986 he repeated that technical success with the Macintosh, when he took another group of young engineers and developed the Next Computer, a computer work station fashioned as a stark black cube, which he hoped would reinvent the computer industry.
Although the Next Computer achieved a cult following it never caught on in the mainstream of the computing industry.
With the personal computer industry increasingly dominated by Microsoft and overshadowed by the explosive emergence of the Internet, it has recently lacked much of the excitement and turmoil that marked the late 1970's and early 1980's.
Under Mr. Amelio's leadership Apple has appeared to be technically and financially stagnant, not ready to collapse, but not showing any of the signs of innovation that once characterized the company.
But it is possible that this may be just the kind of situation in which Mr. Jobs will thrive.
"He's wily like a fox," said Paul Saffo, a computer industry consultant at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. "He can do something that Microsoft can't do: he can start with a clean slate."
Indeed, the sheer size and scope of its operating system and its application software may prove to be Microsoft's Achilles' heel. Despite its rapid about-face to grapple with the threat posed by the Internet, the Redmond, Wash., software publisher confronts some of the same problems that faced I.B.M. in the mid-1980's when it appeared to have unassailable control over the industry.
And then of course there is Mr. Jobs himself, who has long been set apart from his competitors by his passion, his abilities as a salesman and what at times has appeared to be a charmed life.
While competitors like William H. Gates of Microsoft and Andrew Grove of Intel have suffered through embarrassing system crashes at major product introductions, Mr. Jobs has had legendary good fortune.
For example, at the introduction of his Next Computer, held in front of several thousand people in San Francisco, the still raw Next computer performed flawlessly, only crashing as the curtain came down for an intermission. Next's young hackers frantically brought it back to life, the curtain lifted and Mr. Jobs finished his demonstration without a visible glitch.

HEADLINE: Two Huge Industries, But Only One River

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 21

 BODY:
In the evening, the big ships are an awesome sight. Larger than almost any man-made, movable thing on this earth, they glide down the Mississippi River and past the city's downtown, the diesel engines at a dull throb, the black hulls all but invisible in the gloom except for the running lights, so impossibly far apart.
People, even people who live in this port city, pause and stare, wondering where the ships are going, where they have been and what treasures they carry. In a way, they are as much an attraction as an oyster po boy at Felix's in the French Quarter, as much a part of life here as the blare of a trombone at Donna's Bar and Grill on Rampart Street. 
 But the freighters are not a prop in the stage play that is New Orleans. Long before tourism became this city's economic salvation, these gigantic ships plowed the treacherous currents here, carrying grain, oil, everything, deep into America's heartland, or out to sea. New Orleans, where the river and all that it carries meet the Gulf of Mexico and the rest of the world, exists because of ships.
"The river has been the livelihood for myself, my father, my father's brothers, for many years," said Roy Trosclair, a 54-year-old tugboat captain who makes his living guiding these giant ships into safe dockings. "It's our lifeline. I've never hated the river," he said, even when it is running high, swift and mean. But he never forgets the power of it or of the massive ships that travel it.
As tourism, not river commerce, has become more the focus of the city, developers have built shopping malls, condominiums and hotel rooms on the wharves, and lined those wharves with floating casinos and cruise ships.
Last week, the Bright Field, a freighter the length of two football fields, loaded with 60,000 tons of grain, went out of control and smashed a 200-foot section of prime riverfront development, including one of this city's popular tourist attractions, the Riverwalk mall, and part of the Hilton hotel.
To some people here, the accident that injured 116 people but, somehow, did not cause a single death, was a warning to New Orleans to consider the wisdom of merging its tourism and maritime commerce on a single stretch of river.
"Nobody thought about this building being as vulnerable as it is, but I guess they will now," said the retired Roman Catholic Archbishop of New Orleans, the Rev. Philip Hannan, who helped plan the Riverwalk in the 1980's and was at the Hilton when the accident occurred.
Robert Tucker sits on the Port of New Orleans Board of Commissioners. "We have never had any discussions" about the probability of such a disaster, he said, but that will certainly change now. "This is an area of heavy river traffic and of great congestion, and up until now we've just been lucky that something like this hasn't happened before."
In a way, the freighter's crash into the tourist industry was as if the city's past had knocked hard on the door and said: Remember me?
In the three minutes that the Bright Field slid largely out of control down the Mississippi, its power and steering impaired by a mechanical failure, the freighter's pilot narrowly avoided hitting two crowded cruise ships and slammed into the wharf just 70 feet short of a gambling boat loaded with 800 passengers. In all, 1,700 people were in harm's way aboard the docked vessels; more than 1,000 were in the mall. The ship's pilot, Ted Davisson, was called a hero by some maritime officials because of the way he parked the Bright Field between those docked vessels.
The crash was a freak accident, some city officials said. But the series of events that led to it is common. On Tuesday, just three days after the crash, three other freighters lost power going downriver and had to anchor and await repairs. Two other pilots refused to take vessels through the river past New Orleans because of fluctuations in power.
Nearly 6,000 oceangoing vessels passed through this same stretch of river last year and made the difficult turn through the crescent that gave New Orleans its nickname. But for nearly a mile, the riverfront is covered in casinos and paddle wheelers. Freighters and cruise ships share the channel.
Port officials and economic experts saw that as progress. For the good of the city, economically, there had to be a happy coexistence of shipping and tourism.
"It has been a pleasant marriage of the two," said Jim Reese, the assistant president of the Port of New Orleans.
The freighter struck what had been the heart of the old Port of New Orleans. As the city grew, handling cargo in what amounted to the center of its downtown became impossible. The shipping industry moved its wharves farther up and down the river, to avoid the crush, and "gave up this property for other types of development," Mr. Reese said.
"Things like our passenger cruise terminal, the Riverwalk, the aquarium, World Trade Center, even a condominium," he said. "We have been able to turn wharves over, make revenues and leases where we have no longer found doing cargo business a viable thing."
Timothy Ryan, dean of the business school at the University of New Orleans, called that development "a very rational one, one that put New Orleans into the major league of tourist destinations."
"Before 1984, we really weren't," Mr. Ryan said, despite Mardi Gras and other festivals, and the construction in the 1970's of the Superdome -- the site of several Super Bowls, including this season's.
The passing freighters are part of the romance of the waterfront. "I think one of the charms of the riverfront is that it is not Disney World," Mr. Ryan said. "It is real working vessels. It is a fascinating view.
"Obviously what this accident shows is that there is some potential cost to that."
Indeed, tourism has not shoved shipping aside, but has, as Mr. Reese said, only nudged it away from the city center.
Shipping provides about 51,000 jobs, port officials said, while tourism accounts for 57,000, according to the Greater New Orleans Tourist Commission.
But it is the tourism industry that is booming, with a new cultural center among the projects being planned. If all the hotel expansions announced in the last 18 months are completed, the number of available rooms will increase by almost a third.
The wreck of the freighter will force city and state officials to reconsider ways to make sure future developments are safe, although some city officials said such accidents were beyond control. Some maritime officials have talked of a much more rigidly controlled traffic system, as in airports.
Three months ago, Congress rejected a Coast Guard plan for such a system -- one designed to prevent accidents like the freighter crash -- as too expensive.
Mayor Marc Morial, meanwhile, said that to shy away from riverfront development now would be like refusing to build along a highway because a truck skidded into a store.
But maritime officials say that this is no ordinary stretch of river. "It's the busiest and most treacherous stretch," said Lieut. Verne Gifford of the Coast Guard. "You're talking about the river taking a bend of more than 90 degrees and a current as strong as 9, 10 miles per hour pushing water through there. On top of that, you have traffic going upstream, downstream and back and forth."
Add to that the unpredictable nature of the freighters, which have pilots and crews who sometimes cannot communicate because of language differences.
In the hours after the wreck, city officials led reporters on a tour of the destruction. Abandoned beers and half-eaten po boys and plates of red beans and rice still sat on the tables, as if the customers had just stepped away for a minute.
In a way, they had. The lure of the river, the romance of the giant ships, is too strong.
"You can just sit for hours and watch," said Mr. Ryan, the dean. "I still think these two uses are compatible. But what it is going to lead to is greater safety, which we should have had earlier."
For now, the crash site is the city's newest tourist attraction. The ship, held in place by tugboats, remained pressed up against the wreckage that it caused. People have thronged to get a glimpse of it, the ultimate mingling of tourism and shipping.

HEADLINE: Signs Suggest a Return Of Timber Wolf to Maine

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ELLSWORTH, Me., Dec. 21

 BODY:
The caller told the game warden, Debbie Palman, that he had killed a very large coyote, but when Mrs. Palman saw the animal she knew right away that it was something else.
The big chest, long body, large head and the weight -- almost 82 pounds, more than twice that of the average coyote -- and other markings appeared to identify the animal as a timber wolf or a wolf hybrid. 
 Its presence on remote timber land several miles north of here in a sparsely populated part of northeastern Maine has fueled speculation about whether timber wolves are migrating down from Canada, more than a century after they disappeared from the state.
If genetic tests under way at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's forensic laboratory in Oregon determine that the animal is a timber wolf, generally known as the gray wolf, it will be the second one killed in Maine in recent years. In 1993, a bear hunter in northwestern Maine shot what tests later identified as a female wolf.
Wildlife biologists plan to conduct tracking surveys this winter to look for more signs of the animals.
Game wardens have also asked hunters to look carefully before shooting anything that appears to be a coyote. "If our department had suspected there might be wolves in Hancock County," Mrs. Palman said, "we could have done a better job educating hunters and trappers."
Gray wolves are on the Federal endangered species list in the 48 contiguous states except in Minnesota, where they are listed as threatened. Killing an endangered wolf is punishable by a year in jail and a fine of up to $100,000.
About 75 miles, including farmland and the St. Lawrence River, separate Maine from the nearest wolf packs in the Laurentian Highlands of Quebec, said Craig McLaughlin, a biologist with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Although icebreakers keep the St. Lawrence open in the winter, it can freeze over at times, which would allow a small group of wolves to cross.
Wolves feed on moose, deer and beavers -- all of which Maine has in abundance, said Daniel Harrison, an associate professor of wildlife economy at the University of Maine in Orono, who has studied both wolves and coyotes.
Private groups are already actively promoting the restoration of the wolf's population. One of them is Defenders of Wildlife, an organization based in Washington that spearheaded the successful campaign to reintroduce gray wolves into Yellowstone National Park, has advocated their reintroduction into New York's Adirondacks and parts of New Hampshire and Maine.
While the program in the West has angered ranchers who fear for their livestock, the idea of bringing wolves back to Maine has been opposed by hunters who do not want more competition for game. Some hunters seem to feel differently about wolves that arrive on their own.
Phil Phillips, a gunsmith at Willy's Gun Shop in Ellsworth, where the wolflike animal was killed, said he had never seen a wolf but would not be surprised to learn that the elusive creatures were here. "It wouldn't be so bad to have a few around," he said. "It might be kind of neat."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Prepares Campaign, Eager for Lasting Impression

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Expressing enormous confidence about the strength of his re-election campaign, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says he needs another term in office to cement his policies into the bedrock of New York City government. Otherwise, he says, any of his opponents would need only a year to undo his work reducing crime and redefining the welfare system.
"One of the reasons I was elected was, people wanted the city reformed, cleaned up, changed, straightened out," he said in an interview on political themes in his office late last week. "And I think we've done a lot of that. All of that could change in a year, with a different political direction. 
 "So what I want to do is to root those changes into the institutions of city government, so that the levels of safety that we've achieved, the city can hold for the next 10 or 15 years. So that the city of New York is never again a city that sets records for murder."
His opponents scoffed at the idea that they would raise the falling murder rate in the nation's largest city, but Mr. Giuliani sounded increasingly confident that they would never get the chance. As he enters the final year of his term, the Mayor says he believes himself to be in a more dominant position than any incumbent mayor in recent times, rejecting suggestions that New York City voters remain ambivalent about his performance. He said his huge fund-raising lead -- he has raised twice as much money as all of his opponents combined -- demonstrates the uphill battle they will have to fight and is one of the reasons several politicians have chosen not to challenge him.
"I think that it would almost have to be a prejudiced observation, on the numbers that exist, to say that it's anything but a very strong candidacy," he said. "Which is the conclusion that professionals have come to. That's why candidates who at least were touted as stronger candidates have dropped out."
Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that political fortunes could change, and said he planned to run as if he were 30 points behind. But the campaign he sketched out was the classic playbook of the self-assured incumbent: one based on consolidating the accomplishments he has made rather than branching out into new directions. The agenda will be largely the same as that in 1993, he said, with a few outgrowths from existing plans. He said that he would eventually talk about the future and sketch out a new vision for his second term, but that he was not yet ready to do so.
His strategy in regard to his challengers has now become unmistakable: he will place them in a class of "professional politicians" tied to old-fashioned Democratic regimes, painting them as antagonists of every major change he has made, including those in law enforcement. None, he says, know the city as well as he does, nor have they any vision other than to attack him.
"It's very hard to think of who could credibly make the case that they would have done more than I've done," he said. "Or that in the future they could be trusted to do more than that, since they were all proponents of the prior administration." For that reason, he held out the possibility that some other candidate might still enter the race, although he refused to speculate about names.
The Mayor's two leading opponents, Ruth W. Messinger and Fernando Ferrer, the borough presidents of Manhattan and the Bronx, say his brash confidence in his re-election highlights precisely the aspect of his personality they plan to campaign against.
"My grandfather always said, 'pride goeth before the fall,' " Ms. Messinger said. "And I would add, arrogance goeth before the comeuppance." She noted that many incumbent mayors and presidents were ahead of their challengers a year before the race, only to be defeated.
Mr. Ferrer called "absurd" the suggestion that he would work to raise the crime rate, but did not deny he would try to undo some of the Mayor's other actions.
"The Mayor is half right," he said. "I will try hard to undo the damage he has done to public education, public health, parks and playgrounds."
The Republican Mr. Giuliani may be calculating that his public declaration of self-assurance may keep the Democratic field from growing further, and it may also serve to obscure the various difficulties his campaign is likely to face over the course of the next year. He has yet to assemble a full-fledged campaign organization. He is searching for a media consultant, an effort that included a recent approach to Dick Morris, who worked for President Bill Clinton and Mr. Ferrer. Black voters remain strongly suspicious of him, and he is likely to face an opponent with a sizable built-in campaign machine and a much larger base of registered party members. (He beat David N. Dinkins's formidable grass-roots organization in 1993 by just 2.9 percent.)
His approval rating in several New York City polls has hovered around 50 percent, with higher marks given to his handling of crime and lower marks for his handling of education. He is ahead of Ms. Messinger and Mr. Ferrer by 11 to 14 points, but both candidates are currently distant figures outside their boroughs and have a year to improve their citywide recognition.
Asked why he is not higher in the polls given an improved economy and a much lower crime rate, he said such an expectation was unrealistic.
"I would think you'd look at it and say, what Republican mayor has ever been in the shape that I've been in, coming up to re-election?" he said. "In a city that is 5-to-1 the other way, how is it that my approval rating is so strong? It's not 60 percent but it's still strong, and I'm ahead of any potential candidate by double digits."
Mr. Giuliani is most proud of his law enforcement record, of course, and at one point in the interview, he reached into a desk drawer and pulled out a piece of notebook paper on which he is keeping a handwritten tally of the murder rate, which seems likely to drop below 1,000 for the first time in 28 years. The polls appear to show, however, that a safer city is not necessarily a ticket to re-election. Large numbers of people who approve of his handling of crime do not approve of his overall performance. That drop-off is attributed by Giuliani aides to a substantial group of Democratic voters who will never vote for a Republican, but his challengers have said it stems from a confrontational personality that does not sit well with many voters.
Ms. Messinger, in particular, has criticized the Mayor for the often-hectoring tone of his public discourse, and his inability to form lasting relationships with other governmental bodies, including the City Council and the State Legislature.
By now, Mr. Giuliani has heard the criticisms of his personality so often that he rolls his eyes at the subject, and aides say he doesn't mind if the public thinks of him as occasionally maddening. He argues that voters will judge him on results -- on safety, on economic opportunity, on their overall sense of the city -- rather than on his style.
"I think the alleged peculiarities of someone's personality have never won or lost an election, and when someone is subjected to having to campaign that way, it probably allows you to demonstrate that they don't have much of a substantive position," he said. "Most people want to see results in their lives, and as long as the way in which those results are being brought about is honest and honorable and in conformity with the law, people will be satisfied. That is how a big, broad election gets decided, not on whether this person is happier than that person, or is this person friendlier than that person."

HEADLINE: Front-Runner for Iran Presidency Works on Image

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The campaign for Iran's presidential election next summer has only just begun. But one man is talking as if he had already won: Ali Akbar Nateq-Noori.
The 53-year-old conservative cleric has used his power base as Speaker of Iran's Parliament and his frequent television appearances to enforce stricter Islamic rule, block President Hashemi Rafsanjani's economic reforms and attack the United States and Israel. 
 But as his global public profile rises in anticipation of the election, he seems to be struggling to tone down his statements and repackage himself as a status-quo statesman who will follow the line of Mr. Rafsanjani, his political rival, who is not permitted to run again.
"There will be no basic or fundamental changes in the policies," Mr. Nateq-Noori said this week in an interview in a reception hall in the Parliament building. "The construction of the country started by the President will continue. The five-year economic plan shall definitely be continued in my term too. And in foreign policy, the strategy has already been defined."
Mr. Nateq-Noori played only a marginal role in the revolution that led to the proclamation of the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979. Nor does the Speaker enjoy much popular support. He is regarded by many of Iran's more senior religious leaders as a second-tier cleric who holds only a bachelor's degree in Islamic philosophy and has never written an important religious work.
But Mr. Nateq-Noori is no ordinary mullah. He wears elegantly tailored and crisply pressed robes and does not lower his gaze when conversing with women. A father of eight, he smiles a lot -- a plus for any politician, even in Iran.
And he has won the endorsement of the Combatant Clerics, an alliance of socially conservative clergymen that holds the majority in Parliament.
Mr. Rafsanjani is barred by Iran's Constitution from running for a third four-year term, and there is no other strong candidate in the race. That has made Mr. Nateq-Noori a front-runner, at least for the moment.
But repackaging takes time, and sometimes Mr. Nateq-Noori cannot seem to stop himself from speaking his mind, even if he contradicts himself in the process. Despite his religious credentials as a hojatolislam -- one rank below ayatollah -- he lacks the popular following of Mr. Rafsanjani. Nor is he considered much of a political strategist.
That lack of clarity about his positions and intentions has made speculation about a Nateq-Noori presidency a favorite parlor game at diplomatic dinners in Teheran, where the consensus seems to be that he would demand stricter adherence to Islamic rules in Iranian society.
But there is no agreement on whether he would be more or less hostile to the West or whether the clerical establishment would curb his ability to make fundamental economic and political changes.
Mr. Nateq-Noori's remarks on Iran's relationship with Germany, by far Iran's best friend in the West, illustrate how mercurial he can be.
Just a month ago, hundreds of demonstrators pelted the German Embassy in Teheran with tomatoes and eggs after the prosecutor in a criminal trial in Berlin charged that Iran's leaders had been directly involved in the assassination of Kurdish dissidents in 1992. Since then, both countries have worked hard to lower tensions. In any case, a verdict in the trial is not expected for at least three more months.
But in the interview this week, Mr. Nateq-Noori threatened to break diplomatic relations with Germany if the verdict concluded that Iran's political leadership was responsible for the killings.
If the verdict also finds Iran's supreme spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, culpable, the consequences will be much worse, Mr. Nateq-Noori said.
"If there is a statement regarding our Government, the reaction is predictable," he said. "We will sever our relations." But if Ayatollah Khamenei is also named, he added, "We would not be able to predict or prevent what would happen, either inside or outside Iran."
Asked whether there could be attacks against German embassies or diplomats if that happened, he replied: "It would be such an unwise move I could not imagine it would happen. I would find it quite difficult to believe that the German authorities would not give sufficient attention to the matter."
Mr. Nateq-Noori is also struggling -- with mixed results -- to tone down his anti-American remarks.
In an interview last year, he called President Clinton a "simpleton who slipped on a watermelon peel" because of the Administration's punitive policies toward Iran. When asked this week whether he still felt that way, Mr. Nateq-Noori laughed and said: "Well, he has not slipped this time. He got re-elected."
Last month, in a speech in front of the former American Embassy in Teheran on the 17th anniversary of its seizure by Iranian militants, Mr. Nateq-Noori called the United States "a blood-sucking wolf who was slapped in the face by us on this historic day."
"There can never be a friendly relationship between a lamb and a wolf," he said.
But this week he made an effort to sound more conciliatory and denied having made those remarks, even though they were quoted at the time by the state-run news agency.
"I did not say a blood-sucking wolf," he insisted. "I just said our relationship is a relationship between the wolf and the lamb. This 'blood-sucking' has been added on in the distance it has traveled to the United States."
He declined to say that Iran would never again have relations with the United States, which were broken after the seizure of the American Embassy in 1979, saying only: "We do believe that America's approach is a hostile one. If you believe there has been any change in Clinton's policies, then we would decide to change our attitude toward him."
He also said he would have "no problem" if American sanctions were lifted and American companies could once again do business in Iran.
Certainly Mr. Nateq-Noori gives no indication that there would be any change in Iran's support for groups and activities that the United States defines as terrorist. He scoffed at mounting evidence by American and European intelligence agencies of Iran's complicity in international terrorism.
He even offered to debate Mr. Clinton and other leaders who have charged that Iran is involved in such terrorism.
"We do call for a televised live debate before our nation and their nation, so that they can judge for themselves what is being said," he said. "Not just Mr. Clinton, but whoever would be making such allegations."
But Mr. Nateq-Noori may be getting ahead of the race in speaking as if he had already won. Politics in Iran, as in many countries, is a tough, often nasty game of horse-trading, alliance-building and back-stabbing. And one key to whether Mr. Nateq-Noori can consolidate his position if he is elected President will be whether Mr. Rafsanjani can continue to control a power base of his own after he leaves office.
Mr. Rafsanjani is not saying what his plans are. But Faezeh Hashemi, Mr. Rafsanjani's daughter and an outspoken member of Parliament, is determined to stop Mr. Nateq-Noori from becoming President. She said in an interview this week that the Servants of Construction, the political faction that supports her father, would nominate its own candidate, but that it wanted to wait long enough that the more conservative religious establishment would be unable to find a way to disqualify the candidate.
"They want a monopoly on power," she said of Mr. Nateq-Noori and his group. "But all types of thinking should be able to exist in government. And when there is only one candidate, it is not a real election."

HEADLINE: At Baghdad Airport, Proof Life Can Go On in a Vacuum

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 20

 BODY:
As in any other capital, the road to the international airport is boldly marked on highway signs in Baghdad.
And like Heathrow and Kennedy, Saddam International Airport employs a gigantic staff. Among its workers is Saad Ghazar, whose job is to drive the car that plies the runway bearing the injunction "Follow me." 
 There is just one problem. Not one plane has taken off or landed in more than six years. Nowhere in Iraq, in fact, has there been a single commercial flight.
"It's very difficult for us," Mr. Ghazar said. At the Saddam Airport, he and other workers are simply marking time. Virtually every plane in the Iraqi Airways fleet was scattered to Iran, Jordan or Tunisia at the time of the gulf war, and none has ever been returned. The few still here have been grounded either by the United Nations sanctions, which prohibit all international flights, or by the United States and its allies, which enforce no-flight zones in the country's north and south precluding the old domestic routes.
Instead of an easy half-hour flight, the journey from Baghdad to Mosul in the north, or to Basra in the south, now takes 6 hours by car, 10 by rickety train. And Iraqi airline offices that once booked direct flights to Paris and Rome can now offer only to arrange "smooth surface transportation" to the nearest working airport -- in the Jordanian capital, Amman, some 600 miles away.
But none of that has dissuaded Mr. Ghazar and airport workers like him, who report six days a week to jobs that offer nothing to do. In Iraq these days, the comfort of a certain paycheck outweighs the misery of boredom, no matter how remote the chance that Iraqi planes will soon again take to the skies.
"We have been doing nothing at all for six years," said Khalid Abdel rahman, general manager for Iraqi Airways' internal operations. "We are cut off from everything. Can you imagine it?"
Even Iraqi military planes remain constricted to a narrow band over central Iraq. That zone was narrowed this fall as the Clinton Administration moved the northern boundary of the southern no-flight zone to the 32d parallel from the 33d. Only United Nations personnel are exempted from the United Nations rules. They are able to shuttle in and out of Baghdad aboard special planes that fly from a separate military airstrip to Cyprus and Bahrain.
Baghdad's commercial airport, which opened in 1982, now lies behind military checkpoints and is rarely visited. The Ministry of Information, which closely supervises visiting journalists, has shunted aside repeated requests, saying such a tour would be "unusual" and "difficult" to arrange.
But one curious diplomat who managed to arrange a private tour found that the physical damage wrought by allied bombing in the 1991 war has long since been repaired. Along with employees and others, the diplomat describes a clean but hauntingly empty structure, where the escalators run and the motor pool stands ready.
"We are still alive, and our airport is still alive," said Salah Mukhtar, editor of Al Jumhuriya, an official Baghdad daily. "At any moment, it is ready to receive jets." With a $400 fee imposed for every exit visa, few Iraqis have the means to travel overseas these days. Those who can afford a vacation head to Mosul, itself a replacement for resorts in the northern part of the country, which is now under Kurdish control.
But after enduring sanctions for so long, even people like Mr. Abdel rahman, once the Iraqi Airways representative in Rome and Geneva, now say they have grown so weary and dispirited that they rarely stray from their offices and homes. Along Saadoun Street, tour operators now rely almost entirely on Shiite Muslim pilgrims from India, Pakistan, Iran and Lebanon, who travel by bus to visit holy sites in the cities of Najaf and Karbala. To do business in a country with no airport and a unsavory reputation, they say, has hardly been easy.
As Ahmed Radif, head of Basra Travel, put it: "It is very difficult to convince travelers to cope with a 17-hour trip from Amman, to come to a country that suffers a shortage of clean water, food and medicine, and to forget about the image given to Iraq by bad publicity."
A few shops down, Faisal al-Hassan of Abadeel Travel said darkly: "Tourists will come when the Americans stop attacking us and there are no aircraft buzzing over our heads." Offices once made maddening by ringing telephones are silent.
In downtown Baghdad, 50 employees of the Iraqi Airways office still troop into the two-story office each morning at 8 and leave again at 2 P.M. But without computers, faxes, telexes or long-distance telephones, they lack the tools to book even the simplest of tickets, and they have become so isolated from the international aviation community that they no longer received its regular bulletins.
Mr. Abdelrahman, for one, still puts on a coat and tie six days a week. But he has little to do but open the mail, and he says that the 2,000 employees he supervises at the airline's offices around the country can only chat and wait.
"A human being can't live without hope," he said. "So you must always hope. Even the worst things in the world must come to an end."

HEADLINE: To Save Jobs, Painters' Union Agrees to Relax Its Rules

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
If a featherbedding Olympics were ever held, the gold medal might go to the New York City painters' union, with its rule banning the use of paint rollers wider than 9 inches and another requiring afternoon coffee breaks even though the workday ends at 3:30.
Then there are the rules requiring that painters receive double pay for any work exceeding seven hours a day, and a full day's pay even if they come for just 30 minutes to touch up a ceiling. 
 Deterred by these harsh rules, apartment buildings have increasingly turned to nonunion painters, throwing a third of the city's unionized painters out of work. Stung by this harsh reality, the New York branch of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades has decided, in what union leaders and real estate officials call a historic shift, to jettison its most onerous work rules, at least on some jobs.
The union agreed to these changes after its membership in New York slid to 5,000, from 10,000 in the mid-1970's, a slide hastened by the recent plunge in office construction. The old restrictive rules will continue to apply to new office and home construction -- about 20 percent of the current work -- while the new rules are geared specifically to repainting and renovations in apartments and office buildings in New York City and Westchester County, and on Long Island.
"Anything that could be construed as restrictive, we did our best to eradicate," said Michael Monroe, a vice president with the union, who negotiated the new rules as part of a four-year contract.
So out go the union's limits on roller widths and the virtual ban on paint sprayers. Out, too, goes requiring double pay for overtime; now it will be time and a half, even for new construction. Also disappearing is a rule requiring time-and-a-half pay whenever painters work past 3:30 P.M., even if their shifts begin at that time. The new rule will be straight pay for late work.
Real estate officials said the new rules could set an anti-featherbedding precedent for the city's construction unions, which have some of the highest costs in the nation.
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the landlords' association, hailed the new rules as good news for tenants, and not just because they cut the cost of union painters by about a third -- to $25 an hour, including fringe benefits, down from $36.
As a result of the new rules, landlords are expected to hire more union painters. For tenants, this means painters who are usually more dependable and more skilled than nonunion ones. And union painters guarantee their work.
Deborah Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board, said the new rules would not save landlords or co-op boards money so much as give them better quality for about what they had been spending.
"The quality of the paint jobs many people get now is notorious," she said. "With this agreement, the quality of the end product will be superior."
Real estate executives estimate that more than three-fourths of the repainting in apartment buildings goes to nonunion painters. Many landlords do not even entertain bids from contractors employing union painters because nonunion contractors usually make bids 30 to 40 percent lower.
"Some people say the new contract is good; some say it's bad," said Steve Vitrano, a union painter, during a break while working on the 18th floor of an office building on 54th Street. "But I like it because a lot more people will get an opportunity to work now. It's better than unemployment." Those who complain are unhappy about losing double pay for overtime, he said.
Jack Rudin, a leading New York landlord who has committed his company to hiring union labor, worked with the Real Estate Board to push the union and painting contractors to reach a new contract.
"We were wondering, how do we help these thousands of men get back to work?" he said. "We were concerned that a lot of people were hiring painters who don't have health insurance or workers' comp."
Union officials said the new contract, which also covers drywall, glass, carpet and linoleum workers, does not cut the cost of union labor to the level of nonunion painters.
Even so, Mr. Monroe, the union vice president, said: "We should be able to be competitive with any legal contractor, someone who is paying workers' comp."
Under the agreement, the painters' hourly wage for repainting work will fall to $20 before fringe benefits, from $25. And from now on, if landlords need a painter or window installer for 30 minutes, they will have to pay for only four hours' work, not a full seven-hour day.
Other changes including eliminating the ban on using poles longer than six feet to paint ceilings, a restriction that created more hours of work by often forcing painters to use scaffolding, which is slower than working from the floor. Out, too, goes a ban on using long-handled brushes to paint ceilings, which encouraged slower work from ladders.
Also gone is the mandatory afternoon coffee break, which workers usually took at 1:30 after returning from lunch at 12:30.
J. Brendan Murray, president of the Association of Master Painters and Decorators, the contractors' group, said: "Coffee breaks were supposed to be 10 minutes, but it usually took 30 -- 10 minutes to go to a coffee shop, 10 minutes drinking the coffee, 10 minutes getting back. It was a disaster. Often no one did any painting after that."
The union agreed to the changes after working with the Real Estate Board and the contractors to research the cost of nonunion painters.
Mr. Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board, said he would urge landlords to seek bids from contractors using union painters. A big advantage, he said, is that unionized painters guarantee their work and will return if it is unsatisfactory.
"Building owners want to say, 'I can bring in a better quality and more security for almost the same price,' " Mr. Spinola said.
Landlords say theft problems are worse with nonunion painters. The new contract requires union painters to wear identification badges and their white uniforms so landlords and tenants know they are not getting fly-by-night workers.
"This new agreement," Mr. Rudin said, "will mean buildings will hire painters who are professionals, painters who offer better insurance, better security and better quality."
Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, an association of 1,938 cooperatives and condominiums, said her members would probably use more union painters now.
"Any progress that stands to help people get quality work more economically is good news," she said.
Mr. Monroe said the old contract included high wages and tough rules because it was geared to the boom in commercial construction that ended in the early 1990's.
"It wasn't that the wage and fringes were unrealistic," he said. "They were negotiated for a special part of the market in boom times. They didn't make sense for another part of the market. We walked away from refurbishing and remodeling, our historic market."
He denied that the union had made concessions in the agreement, which he said would be a model for other cities. "Now that we have properly priced a different market to capture it, a market where we're not doing work, what did we concede?" he said.

HEADLINE: Loophole in Law Permits States To Put Off Cuts in Food Stamps

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Because of a loophole in the new Federal welfare law and a mistaken economic analysis underlying it, many of the hundreds of thousands of the nation's poorest men and women who were to have lost full food stamp benefits will continue to receive them for at least a year.
As a result, budget savings from the food stamp program could be as much as $2 billion less than the $5.1 billion projected over the next six years, the Congressional Budget Office said. 
 State officials, fearful of the onset of winter and of overtaxed shelters and soup kitchens, have found that they can spare some of their single and childless food stamp recipients, age 18 to 50, from cuts. There are about one million such recipients across the country and up to 40 percent may be exempted.
These people, mostly jobless and unskilled, have always been eligible for food stamps. But with the law that President Clinton signed in August, Congress cut that entitlement to just three months of food stamps every three years, unless the recipients work, look for work or engage in work-related activities like job training at least 20 hours a week.
Now, 13 states, including Illinois and New Jersey, have asked the Department of Agriculture, which manages the food stamp program, to exempt recipients in hundreds of cities and counties from the three-month, three-year provision. In interviews, officials from 6 of 16 other states, including Pennsylvania and Missouri, said they would apply, too.
The exemptions, initiated by governors, are possible because of both the miscalculated economic analysis and a Clinton Administration interpretation two weeks ago of an eligibility provision in the law that Congress left unclear.
Under the exemptions, some large cities, including New York and Philadelphia, might be able to continue giving food stamps to single and childless men and women.
Some states, notably Michigan, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Tennessee and New Mexico, say they will not seek exemptions. All argue that it is unfair to make exemptions for single adults when mothers with young children, also faced with benefit cuts, do not have the opportunity for similar exemptions.
New Jersey has already obtained waivers for most of its cities, including Newark, Trenton and Camden, preserving the benefit for 24,000 of the 39,000 affected recipients.
Illinois, which has obtained waivers for about 16 percent of 60,000 recipients, is appealing a rejection of an exemption for the entire city of Chicago, which would bring the level above 70 percent.
Twelve of Washington State's 39 counties have been exempted, and the state is seeking the same for 24 others. If it succeeds, food stamps would continue uninterrupted for all but 7,600 of the 38,000 recipients who were to have been cut off. Rhode Island, which has yet to apply, says it wants a statewide waiver. West Virginia, where 41 of 55 counties have been exempted, is applying for exemptions for the rest.
Another big welfare state, California, with 208,000 affected recipients, is considering a request for exemptions. "We just got the Federal guidelines a week ago," said Bruce Wagstaff, California's deputy director for welfare programs. "We're actively looking at this issue, and we're moving on a very fast track."
The position of New York is unclear. Gov. George E. Pataki has asked for authority to exempt people in communities where the unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent, but he does not plan to use the exemption yet. New York City, where the unemployment rate is about 7 percent, would qualify on other grounds. But Mr. Pataki has not sought an exemption for the city.
The surge of applications for exemptions has come so quickly that Congress has not yet reacted. Representative E. Clay Shaw, a Florida Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee that wrote the law, said he was unaware of the numbers of adults exempted from the food stamp provision.
"But there will be glitches that come to light from time to time," Mr. Shaw said, "and Congress, working with the states, will have to look at them. People who were not committed to welfare reform will try to dismantle it as time goes on. But the basic structure of welfare reform, encouraging work and discouraging idleness, Congress is not going to dismantle."
These 18- to 50-year-old food stamp recipients are often characterized as loitering inner-city men, and many are.
But Yvette Jackson, a deputy administrator at the Agriculture Department who directs the food stamp program, said 41 percent are women who are either childless or who have become ineligible for the more generous welfare program, called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families under the new law, because their children have grown.
Unlike families on welfare, these adult recipients are excluded from all other Federal safety-net programs, including Medicaid and housing assistance. To qualify for food stamps, their assets cannot exceed $2,000, and their annual incomes cannot exceed 130 percent of the poverty line for a single adult, or $10,062. The department also says 19 percent of the recipients have jobs of some kind or participate in training programs, but the average income of all recipients is just $2,200.
"The risks are very, very high with this group," said Jerry Friedman, an assistant secretary in Washington State's Department of Social and Health Services.
Ms. Jackson said, "This group is the poorest of the poor."
In requiring that this group, like all other adults, go to work to keep receiving benefits, Congress nevertheless acknowledged that some live in places where jobs are difficult to find. So the law exempts them from the three-month, three-year provision if they live in communities with unemployment rates exceeding 10 percent or in areas -- not necessarily the same ones -- with insufficient numbers of available jobs.
The law does not specify how states should classify "insufficient jobs" areas and instead left that to the Agriculture Department. In early December, after four or five states had applied for exemptions for cities and counties with more than 10 percent unemployment, the department issued instructions to guide states in invoking the second criterion.
It said they could use a variety of approaches, particularly one the Labor Department uses to identify "labor surplus" areas among the 5,000 in the nation that it monitors. Areas are designated as having a surplus of job seekers if they have unemployment exceeding the national rate by 20 percent for two consecutive years.
During 1994 and 1995, the years on which the exemption requests are based, the national unemployment rate was 5.9 percent. Nearly 1,400 areas with an unemployment rate 20 percent higher than that, or 7.1 percent, qualified. This definition of job scarcity means that many cities with unemployment rates below 10 percent, including New York and Philadelphia, can seek exemptions.
"We would accept that as evidence of insufficient jobs," Ms. Jackson said. Five of the 13 states that had formally applied for exemptions by this weekend -- Illinois, West Virginia, Kentucky, Vermont and Ohio -- have invoked the insufficient-jobs criterion, and officials of at least six others said in interviews that they would do so, too.
In writing the welfare law, Congress used a calculation by the Congressional Budget Office showing that only 2 percent of the recipients who are subject to the provision live in high-unemployment communities. An official of the budget office said the figure was "a mistake."
Ms. Jackson said the Administration was granting the waivers for a year. But the law does not set a time limit, which could give the Administration the freedom to extend them indefinitely as long as unemployment remains high, or jobs scarce, in the affected communities.
She added that the Administration was interpreting the law as it understood Congress to have written it, although she noted that it considered the provision for single adults, with most losing their food stamps at the end of February, too harsh.
"The President identified that as a provision that went too far," she said. "The concept that anyone who can work should work, we have no problem with. But those who live in areas where there are no jobs, this is the only program there is."
Larry E. Temple, deputy director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said that officials in his state "absolutely can't see the justice" in requiring single mothers to go to work and not the able-bodied adults without children. "We do not see the fairness in two standards," he said. "If there ever was a group that was mobile enough to go to where the work is, it's them."
South Carolina, which has a waiver request pending to exempt 4,000 of its 20,000 affected recipients under the 10-percent unemployment criterion, has similar misgivings.
Peter Leousis, an assistant secretary for human resources in North Carolina, which has not decided whether to seek a waiver, added that economists would question the utility of subsidizing people to remain in areas of high unemployment and that the exemption could lure people into poor communities from other areas where they were denied food stamps.
But Mr. Friedman of Washington said the issue was one of timing and pragmatism. "Our position is, we embrace self-sufficiency," he said. "We embrace work." But devising programs to help the food stamp beneficiaries find jobs or get into training programs before they are cut off in February isn't easy. "The exemptions give us time," he said.

Knicks in the Old Days Had a Knack for Working Hard Together

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
THEY were seated at a long table, autographing a book about themselves, one of the most beloved of all New York teams. To save time, there was an agreement that nobody would write personal messages for the fans, but one of them broke the pact, holding up the production line.
Suddenly, the old coach turned his head, and with the caustic tone from a long-ago practice, Red Holzman snapped, "Monroe, you still won't pass." 
 Earl Monroe laughed. Willis Reed laughed. Dave DeBusschere laughed. Dean Meminger laughed. Bill Bradley laughed. They laughed as a team the way they used to flick the ball around the court until somebody was open. They had to laugh -- or else Red Holzman might have sent them running laps around the clean, well-lighted bookstore.

 They are still a team, not only because of the championships of 1970 and 1973, but also because of their character, developed in part by the long time they played together. Nowadays, athletes become free agents, sell their services to the highest bidder, move on.
You could call it indentured servitude, but Willis Reed, the captain, played 10 years with the Knicks, and Walt Frazier played 10, and Earl Monroe played 9, and the eventual Senator from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, played 10, and Phil Jackson played 10, and Dave DeBusschere played 6, and Dick Barnett played 9 and other vital cogs played 3 and 4 years at a time, long enough to know each others' moves.
By contrast, the warm-and-fuzzy 1996 Yankees won a World Series and promptly scuttled Jim Leyritz, their senior player, with five full seasons and bits of two others. And two important pitchers, Jimmy Key and John Wetteland, took the free-agency walk.
If the 1996 Yankees should be reassembled a couple of decades from now, one can envision them introducing themselves, like strangers who once sat together on a transcontinental flight: "Hello, I'm John Wetteland." "Right, right, I'm Charlie Hayes. We met in 1996."
The current Knicks are still making their introductions, on the job, in front of paying audiences. Maybe they'll be teammates by April, maybe not. But the old Knicks are teammates for life.
You could feel the love in Barnes & Noble at Union Square on Thursday night as they signed copies of "The New York Knicks: The Official Fiftieth Anniversary Celebration," published by Macmillan, the photographs of George Kalinsky, with text by Phil Berger.
The photographs are not just of the great moments, but also of the great people who worked the Garden -- including Joe Lapchick, the coach; John Condon, the announcer ("THAT . . . was GOAL-tending!"); Feets Broudy, the humble timekeeper with the heavy thumbs who could make clocks slow or fast depending on who was winning; Danny Whelan and Mike Saunders, the trainers, and all the broadcasters, as well as the loyal fans who pay their way, like Woody Allen, John McEnroe and Spike Lee.
A week earlier, Kalinsky, Monroe and DeBusschere had gone to New Jersey for the official farewell speech by Bradley, who has retired as Senator after 18 years. Afterward, Monroe had hugged Bradley and said, "I'm honored to know you."
In his first week of unemployment, Bradley came back to sign autographs free. The six Knicks were supposed to sign for an hour but they stayed two and a half, cutting off at 750 books. (Frazier had to cancel because of the death of his sister. Barnett was not around. Jackson works in Chicago these days.)
Like members of the old Brooklyn Dodgers, or the four-time Stanley Cup champion New York Islanders, these old Knicks know that character was part of the equation.
"The nucleus was already here when I arrived," said Monroe, who came over in 1971-72. "Bill Bradley was exactly the same person then as he is now. We used to talk about social ills then. He was always asking, always learning."
Bradley said he thought of himself as an athlete rather than a Senator because "my attitudes were formed in the locker room."
"There was a mutual dependence," he said.
Does he ever see a team that reminds him of the Knicks? Bradley praised the 1977 champions, the Portland Trail Blazers, and added, "Chicago, on some nights, after Michael realized, after six years, that you have to move the ball around to win."
Captain Willis said the old Knicks were strong because "Red had four different starters move the ball upcourt."
"The only people who were not allowed to dribble were myself and Phil," Reed said. "I listened to Red, but Phil had reasons why he could dribble. The reason he's a great coach is that he's heard it all before."
After running the Nets, Reed said he did not think there would ever be a team as deep and as tight as his Knicks. "Free agency will prevent that," he said. "It's all controlled by the agents. It's what they want."
One token fan -- the aforementioned Lee from Brooklyn -- was invited to a reception before the signing. "I was at Game 7," Spike said, referring to the classic 1970 final game when the Captain limped out with damaged knees to battle Wilt Chamberlain. "My father's lawyer came up with a ticket in the first promenade. My father was giving a concert that night near Carnegie Hall, and I had to choose, but I went to the Knicks game. My mother was mad, but my father understood.
"I used that in 'Crooklyn,' " Lee added, referring to his film about childhood.
"My father used to play at the West Boondocks in Manhattan," Spike continued, "and I'd wake up in the morning and my father would have Walt Frazier's autograph for me and he would say, 'Clyde was there last night with a sharp hat, looking good.' "
To children and adults, those Knicks were epic heroes. The players are united by knowing what they were. And one sharp phrase from Red Holzman keeps them all on the same page, literally.

HEADLINE: Don't Distort Flaws In Canada Health Care;
Painful Price Tag

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Doctor, What's the Prognosis? Crisis in Canada" (news article, Dec. 15) misdiagnoses the health-care problems in Canada. Canada is simply one of many countries straining to maintain a universal health insurance program at a price tag near 10 percent of its gross domestic product. Physician concerns about eroding quality of care (exaggerated in your article) are chronic symptoms of Canada's success, not symptoms of its failure. 
 Canada teaches us that balancing a health-care budget causes pain. Tough decisions need to be made about allocating scarce resources. This means fewer hospitals, less technology, lower pay and rising unemployment among health-care workers (including physicians), and ultimately slowing the advance of medicine. If Americans think our prognosis under managed care is any different, then our collective diagnosis is delirium.

HEADLINE: RUSHING AWAY FROM TAXES: Preserving the Legacy -- A special report.;
For Wealthy Americans, Death Is More Certain Than Taxes

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and DAVID CAY JOHNSTON; Floyd Norris and Diana B. Henriques contributed to this article, a continuation of a series that included articles on deferred compensation, which appeared on Oct. 13 and 14, and on capital gains taxes, which appeared on Dec. 1.

 BODY:
Martin M. Shenkman, who is 40 years old, knew that by the time he and his wife died and their house in Teaneck, N.J., went to their three children, hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes would be owed before the children could inherit it. But as a tax lawyer, he also knew a way around those taxes.
Using a popular strategy, the Shenkmans are giving the house to their children, the oldest of whom is 11, in exchange for permission to live there rent free for 25 years. 
 It is all perfectly legal. In fact, Mr. Shenkman advises clients to take the sophisticated steps necessary to pull it off. And it is typical of a host of techniques that are being promoted aggressively so that affluent Americans can transfer much of their wealth to heirs while avoiding or deferring taxes.
A decade after Congress closed some of the biggest loopholes in the tax on wealth handed down from one generation to the next, the Federal estate tax has become so easy to avoid that some experts believe that much of it is voluntary, at least for those who start planning early.
"I think the estate tax is voluntary in two senses -- how much you eventually need to pay within a family and when you pay it," said William D. Zabel, a New York estate lawyer and the author of "The Rich Die Richer and You Can Too." "I wouldn't say all of it, but you can eliminate much of it."
Techniques for circumventing the estate tax vary widely; some of them are extraordinarily elaborate and creative. All together, they form a broadening pattern of tax avoidance that Congress sought to halt only 10 years ago, and they include these strategies:
*Corporate executives have found ways to pass millions of dollars worth of stocks, and options to buy stocks, to their children without owing estate taxes.
*Investors are putting every sort of property, from vacation homes to stock portfolios, into partnerships for their children so that they are valued for tax purposes at 30 to 70 percent less than what they would be worth in the marketplace. Any rise in the property's value escapes the estate tax, and a separate gift tax is reduced.
*A Long Island widow has bought a $60 million share of her children's inheritance, shielding the proceeds from estate taxes and allowing the family to pay less to the Government. Tax counselors long insisted that nothing could be done after the death of a benefactor to reduce estate taxes. Now, perhaps, death is no obstacle.
*Some of the nation's wealthiest individuals have organized their financial affairs in a manner so intricate and impenetrable that the I.R.S. on occasion has given up its claim to higher estate taxes.
Conceived after the turn of the century, in an era of dynasties like the Rockefellers and the Du Ponts, the estate tax was designed to reduce the concentration of wealth. Today, some analysts say, the proliferation of avoidance strategies is having the opposite effect.
Though the estate tax has never gone as far as its sponsors envisioned in leveling wealth, it "makes a significant contribution to whatever progressivity exists in the nation's tax system," said Michael J. Graetz, a Yale Law School professor who served as a Treasury Department tax policy official during the Bush Administration.
"It's demoralizing to the average citizen that the wealthiest people in the country can so easily avoid this tax," he added.
The vast majority of Americans are either too poor or too shrewd to worry about the estate tax. As of 1993, the most recent year for which data were available, only 1.5 percent of adult deaths -- 32,000 -- involved individuals whose estates were worth at least $600,000 and were taxed.
There is no way to calculate just how much wealth is escaping estate taxation. Many of those who exploit the techniques are in middle age, and the loss of tax revenue will not be significant until they die.
What is most striking, experts say, is what could happen in coming years. The nation stands on the cusp of the largest transfer of wealth in its history, the $5 trillion to $10 trillion in assets that belong to the generations preceding the baby boomers. A significant share of that wealth could pass untaxed, some economists note, if the estate tax remains so easily circumvented. That could contribute to what several studies show is a growing concentration of wealth among the most prosperous 5 percent of households.
"The wealthy already have huge advantages," said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University. So "it is important to put teeth into the estate tax system now because otherwise this transfer of wealth will just exacerbate inequalities."
But other people say the real problem is the estate tax itself, which they see as destroying incentives to work, save and invest. A recent report by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, contended that the tax reduces economic growth and is thus "hurting the jobs and incomes of the very people that wealth redistribution was intended to aid."
Congress has done little to examine most of the new ways of avoiding the estate tax. And while the Internal Revenue Service has questioned some of these maneuvers, it has often lost in court. In some cases, judges have chastised the I.R.S. on the ground that the law gives taxpayers wide latitude.
Meantime, the wealthiest Americans are less likely to attract scrutiny by the I.R.S. In 1986, when Congress attempted to tighten estate tax rules, the agency audited almost 21 percent of estate returns, while last year it audited 14 percent. Last year, fewer than half of the returns filed by estates worth more than $5 million were audited, compared with nearly three-quarters a decade ago. Moreover, the I.R.S. almost never checks to see whether large estates simply failed to file required tax returns.
The law now allows individuals to give tax-free gifts of up to $10,000 a year to as many people as they want. A married couple can give $20,000 yearly. And since 1987, each taxpayer has been allowed to pass on $600,000 tax free at death. However, prior gifts that exceed the annual limits would reduce that exemption dollar for dollar.
Many married couples have been able to use simple trusts, legal devices that hold property on behalf of others, to avoid having the estates of the husband and wife merged when one spouse dies and leaves property to the other. That has allowed them to easily pass on $1.2 million in assets tax free. Many heirs and benefactors have also provided for likely estate taxes by buying insurance that can help pay the bill, but that can involve hefty premiums over a period of unpredictable duration.
Avoiding taxes if you legally can is a favorite American pastime. Taxpayers would be foolish to pay more if they could find a legitimate way not to. And many, including Republican Congressional leaders, believe that estate taxes -- 37 percent to 55 percent on estates worth more than $600,000 -- should be repealed because they penalize hard work and thrift while costing jobs. Affluent parents, also mindful of inheritance taxes in many states, are bitter at being barred from giving freely to their children and grandchildren.
Small businesses and farmers, complaining angrily that they are least able to use the most effective tax avoidance strategies, fear that their enterprises will have to be broken up or sold to pay estate taxes.
Federal estate and gift taxes together brought in $15 billion last year, twice as much as a decade earlier, but that amount has remained about 1 percent of all Federal tax revenue. Estate taxes accounted for four-fifths of the total. Mr. Wolff estimates that the Federal Government could collect perhaps three times as much in estate taxes if it could eliminate ways to avoid them.
Twenty years ago, the percentage of American adults who died with enough wealth to require paying estate taxes was much higher than it is today. In 1976, when the exemption was $60,000, the number peaked at 7.7 percent -- or 139,000 individuals. Then Congress raised the exemption in several steps.
But with the exemption frozen at $600,000 for a decade, the number of Americans whose deaths result in estate taxes is growing quickly from its 1987 low of 18,000, or just under 1 percent of adult deaths. Though they may not think of themselves as particularly affluent, 7 percent of households fall above that threshold, compared with 4 percent a decade ago. They form a receptive market for tax avoidance strategies being promoted heavily through books, seminars and private meetings with clients.
"Reduce your estate tax costs up to 90 percent," urges one tax counselor in full-page newspaper ads. Over the last five years, John Hancock Mutual Life has doubled sales of one type of insurance commonly used in estate planning, and it is now writing more than $2 billion worth of policies a year. Even H& R Block, best known for mass-marketing of basic tax help, is seeking affluent clients by offering estate planning at 600 offices around the country.

Stock Options
A Gift Grows With the Market
 Since Eugene M. Isenberg became chief executive of Nabors Industries, an oil drilling company in Houston, in 1987, he has taken a $325,000 salary each year and received the rest of his pay in stock and in options that gave him the right to buy more shares at a set price.
Stock options have long been a way for executives to amass great wealth. If their companies' stocks soared, as that of Nabors has, they could buy shares at a bargain price agreed upon years earlier, paying income taxes on the difference.
But, as Mr. Isenberg is demonstrating, a new feature being added to some options makes them valuable as a way for executives to pass on wealth to their heirs while giving less to the tax collector.
The powerful new feature that came with Mr. Isenberg's options was the right to give them away to his children and grandchildren, either directly or by putting them into trusts for their benefit. Mr. Isenberg is able to give a gift whose value could grow greatly, paying taxes on what it is worth today rather than what it could be worth down the road.
Transferable stock options illustrate an important theme of sophisticated estate planning: It is better to give away property, especially something that is likely to appreciate, while living than to wait until death. That is true even though gift and estate tax rates are the same.
The idea of making stock options transferable took off after Thomas McGraw, a tax lawyer, and his colleagues at J. P. Morgan sat around a lunch table in September 1990, discussing ways to help executives reduce taxes and pass their fortunes on to their children. They explored the idea of letting executives give their stock options to family members and to family trusts.
With the I.R.S. and the Securities and Exchange Commission having blessed their invention as entirely legal, J. P. Morgan has been quietly promoting the strategy.
With transferable options, "you have given an asset of incredible value to your heirs at virtually no transfer cost," said Barbara Nims, a securities law partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell, which assisted Morgan.
In recent years, about 100 companies, including Allied Signal, McDonald's, H. J. Heinz, Pepsico and W. R. Grace, have quietly amended their benefits for executives to let them give stock options to their children, grandchildren or family trusts.
Gifts of transferable stock options to any one child are subject to gift taxes if their value is greater than $10,000. The I.R.S. has given no guidance on how executives should value stock options, but interviews with estate lawyers suggest that executives are being advised to place very small values on options that they transfer.
In any case, options are worth less than the stock they can be used to purchase. Thus, the transferable options are an attractive way to reduce or avoid gift taxes. Once the gift is made, the option can be exercised, generating profit for the child without further gift or estate taxes. If an executive exercised the options himself and gave the stock to his children at his death or before, substantially higher taxes could be due.
If an executive assigns a relatively low value to the options and the I.R.S. does not challenge that value, a large number of options can be transferred with the payment of minimal gift taxes -- or, alternatively, by using up part of the $600,000 exemption.
When options transferred to children are exercised, income taxes are due on the profit, but the I.R.S. has ruled that executives, not the children, must pay the income taxes because the profit was part of their compensation. As a result, children can pocket the entire gain on the stock option, while the payment of the income tax reduces the size of the parent's fortune, reducing estate taxes the heirs will owe when the parent dies.
Some executives simply give options to their children. But Mr. Isenberg set up trusts that allowed him to transfer more options while paying less in gift taxes.
In the last two years Mr. Isenberg transferred options to buy 2.25 million Nabors shares to trusts for his two daughters and his grandchildren. Those options were exercised in October and November, producing a gain of $29.7 million, on which Mr. Isenberg is responsible for paying the income taxes.
The gift to the trusts had strings attached that, according to law, made it less valuable for gift tax purposes. Those strings are that, over the term of the trusts, Mr. Isenberg must get back the value of the assets he placed in the trusts, plus some annual rate of income. The minimum rate of income is set by the I.R.S. Whatever is left in the trusts after those payments to Mr. Isenberg will flow to his daughters, without being subject to gift or estate taxes.
In this case, Mr. Isenberg was able to transfer substantial wealth to his daughters with a much smaller tax bill than he would have incurred had he simply given them the money as a gift or left it to them in his will.
But what would have happened if the price of Nabors shares had fallen and the options had not been exercised? The options would have been returned to Mr. Isenberg by the trusts. No income taxes would have been owed by Mr. Isenberg because he would have been getting back his own property. But he would not have been able to recover the legal and accounting fees he paid to create the trusts nor any gift taxes he paid.
While Mr. Isenberg has locked in big gains for his heirs with transferable stock options, not every executive is so fortunate. Earlier this year, James L. Donald, chief executive of DSC Communications, a maker of telephone switches in Dallas, was awarded options on two million shares that could be transferred to a family trust. But DSC shares have fallen so sharply that Mr. Donald's options are of minimal value today.
Still, all is not lost on the tax front. If Mr. Donald now transfers the options to his children, he can place a very low value on them for gift tax purposes. Later, if the stock price soared, the gains made possible by exercising the options would belong to his heirs without an estate tax.
 
Real Estate
Give Away the House But Keep the Keys
 After Martin Shenkman, the tax lawyer, and his wife, Shelly, completed construction late last year on their brick colonial home in New Jersey, there was still more work to do: the work of avoiding taxes.
Only months after the last nail was hammered, Mr. Shenkman had devised a way to transfer the house to their three children entirely free of estate taxes.
The Shenkmans' plan has gained popularity among many homeowners in the 1990's because it has survived tax-reform efforts intact. Such strategies "are being used frequently by people to transfer their homes, often vacation homes," said Tom Abendroth, a partner at the Chicago law firm of Schiff, Hardin & Waite.
In giving the house to their children, the Shenkmans did not just turn over the keys. The parents intended to keep living there, and the children would grow up there.
Mrs. Shenkman, who held title to the $539,000 house to insulate it in case her husband was ever sued, placed it in a trust on behalf of her children for the next 25 years. The Shelly P. Shenkman Personal Residence Trust is the cornerstone of the family's tax shelter.
The move has huge estate tax advantages: If the value of the house appreciates 4 percent a year, it will be $1.4 million when the trust lapses in 25 years. As long as Mrs. Shenkman, who is 39, is alive at the end of that period, the house will pass to the children without any estate tax.
While this looks like a wonderful gift to the children, the law treats it as something less than a great deal. Because the trust allows the Shenkmans to keep living there rent free, from the perspective of the tax code the children are landlords stuck with a house without a rent-paying tenant.
So the value of the house for calculating the gift tax can be slashed, in this case to $83,750, or roughly one-seventh what it is today. (The longer the duration of the trust, the less the house is worth for gift purposes.) The law makes no allowance for the fact that the children -- the youngest is 5 -- will be growing up in the house.
Mr. Shenkman chuckled about that. The lower value that the law allows to be placed on the house for gift taxes, he conceded, is "obviously a fiction."
But does Mrs. Shenkman have to pay taxes on the gift to her children, even though it is only valued at a bargain $83,750? No, because she has agreed to reduce her $600,000 estate tax exclusion by that sum.
And what if Mrs. Shenkman dies before the trust ends in 25 years? While title to the house would become part of her estate and taxes could be due on its value, the Shenkmans figure that they have made a solid bet. Statistics show that a 39-year-old woman today has a 9 in 10 chance of living to age 64.
Most older people who create these personal residence trusts choose periods of 5 to 15 years, lessening the chance that they will die before the term of the trust ends.
The tax maneuver was particularly attractive to the Shenkmans. Because they had paid cash for the house and had no mortgage, they were passing on an especially valuable asset. When such a deal involves parents making mortgage payments, the children must repay the principal on the mortgage to the parents when the trust lapses. If the house price rises even modestly over the years, however, that should be no problem if the children sell or refinance it.
People with two houses can get at least twice the benefits: The I.R.S. permits an individual to set up two personal residence trusts.
But what happens when the trust period lapses on the parents' primary home? They can stay in the house and pay rent, or, if there has been a falling out, the children can kick them out. Mr. Shenkman said most parents with other assets would have a big weapon to counter that. "If your kids do want to throw you out," he said, "you just tell them they won't get any more from you."

Family Businesses
At a Discount, Heirs Get Some of the Parts
 Like many people who have their own businesses, Bill and Judi Williams had to struggle at the start. She worked without pay for the first two years. Their son, Wayne, joined them straight out of high school.
But prosperity was not too long in coming. Their business, Telect, based in Spokane, Wash., started making fiber optic telephone cables and other communications equipment just as that industry was about to explode.
Now Telect has 700 employees and annual sales of more than $72 million, and the Williams family has a new worry. How should they pass what they have built to their son and two daughters without a tax bill so big that the business would have to be broken up to pay it?
The family has resorted to various estate planning strategies, among them one of the hottest -- a gift-giving technique that the I.R.S. grudgingly approved three years ago and yet would like to be able to stop.
The I.R.S. allowed people who own family corporations and partnerships to turn over a piece of those enterprises to their heirs while valuing those stakes for gift-tax purposes at a discount.
Previously, a gift of one-tenth of a family enterprise would be valued by the I.R.S. at one-tenth of the total value of the business. Now it can be valued at something less -- often a lot less. Wayne Williams, now Telect's president, said his parents had shifted nearly half the company to their children even as they discounted the value of some of their gifts by 35 to 40 percent.
The rationale for allowing such discounts is that anything less than 50 percent of a business is worth less than it might seem. People who own small stakes usually have little control over how a business is operated. When they want to sell, potential buyers typically offer less than what is nominally full value because they are buying assets over which others exercise control.
But while the I.R.S. had long accepted such an analysis in deals involving unrelated people, it had bristled at using it for gifts of ownership within a family. Family members were treated differently from outsiders because their goals were often different.
Seeking to keep a business intact, family members may have no interest in selling out. After receiving repeated gifts from parents, children may be headed for control of the business step by step. Some family members, like Wayne Williams, may be actively involved in running the company.
For decades, the I.R.S. went after family businesses when such gifts were discounted. And the Federal Tax Court, which hears tax disputes, initially agreed with the agency. Over four decades, however, the court shifted and ruled several times that family members were just as entitled to such discounts as anyone else was. And in 1987 the judges lashed out at the I.R.S. for continuing to dispute a point on which it had "lost for more than 40 years" and ordered the agency to pay one taxpayer's legal costs.
As a result, the I.R.S. issued a ruling in 1993 authorizing the discounts. Business owners like the Williams family got a break, and the floodgates were opened to others who have resorted to more aggressive measures.
Many investors are now creating partnerships and using them as repositories for vacation homes, stock portfolios and other investments. They are then handing ownership shares to their children and discounting the value of the gifts, often by 30 to 70 percent.
The I.R.S. is not pleased. Last May the agency contested a gift report filed by a 91-year-old investor in San Antonio, in what is expected to be a crucial case.
Court papers show that the investor, Charles C. Clark, placed $2 million in stocks and bonds into a partnership in 1992 and 1993. He gave ownership shares to 11 children, in-laws and grandchildren, discounting them by 30 percent for tax purposes.
The I.R.S. disallowed the discounts, contending that Mr. Clark had no valid business reason for transferring the assets into the partnership. In essence, it contended that the move was a sham, taken solely to claim the discounts.
Mr. Clark declined to be interviewed. But his son John E. Clark, a former Texas appeals court judge, said that his father had set up the partnership to encourage others in the family "to become more active in the managing of investments." The portfolio includes blue-chip stocks like Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Walt Disney. Though the family does not do "a whole lot of trading," John Clark said, "I have become a much closer student of the market since then."
Some lawyers say the I.R.S. was right to make the challenge. Such partnerships "are a scam because there is no legitimate business purpose served by letting you discount the value of your securities portfolio or your house," said Lee A. Sheppard, a lawyer who writes for the magazine Tax Notes.
But other lawyers, like S. Stacy Eastland of Baker & Botts in Houston, said Mr. Clark might prevail in Tax Court on the ground that he had a valid purpose in assuring that his assets were properly managed if he was unable to oversee the investments himself.
On the issue of whether the partnerships serve a legitimate business purpose, the I.R.S. "is going to have some victories," Mr. Eastland said. "But most of the time they are not going to have victories."
 
After Death
Despite the Will, There's a Way
 William Olsten of Old Westbury, L.I., the founder of the nation's third-largest temporary help agency, died five years ago, leaving his family $115 million, control of the Olsten Corporation and a problem.
"Before my father's death there was virtually no estate planning," said Mr. Olsten's son, Stuart, now the company's president.
That turned out to be an obstacle, but not an insurmountable one. And the ingenuity in overcoming it within two years of the patriarch's death is a source of continuing intrigue among tax advisers who are mulling over whether they should counsel clients to do the same thing.
William Olsten had left half of his fortune in Olsten stock outright to his wife, Miriam, and half to a trust that would be inherited by their children, Cheryl Ashburn and Stuart, when Mrs. Olsten died.
As a consequence, Mrs. Olsten controlled the company. The value of the stock left in the trust, as well as the stock she held outright, would have been subject to Federal estate taxes of 55 percent on her death.
Stuart Olsten said he feared that when his mother died and the estate taxes came due, the family would have to sell so many shares to pay the estate taxes that it would lose control of the company.
Over the next two years, as the value of Olsten stock nearly doubled, Stuart Olsten started searching for ways to reduce the estate tax liability. "I started interviewing lawyers," he said, "and most them said it was too late and we would just have to sell half the stock and write a check."
Then he met a New York lawyer who came up with a novel solution. The lawyer recommended that Miriam Olsten buy her children's right to inherit from the trust. The lawyer, Richard B. Covey of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, reasoned that the children could sell that right to their mother. With an eye to I.R.S. regulations and past court cases, they placed a value on that right of roughly $60 million. In payment to her children, Mrs. Olsten handed over that sum in Olsten stock she had inherited from her husband.
To be sure, that transaction was not free of all taxes. The children had sold an asset, their right to inherit, which was worth more than when they had first received it on their father's death. Therefore, they owed capital gains taxes of 28 percent on the increased value of that asset. Similarly, their mother owed capital gains taxes on the rise in Olsten stock from the date she inherited it until the date she used it to pay her children.
But the bulk of the $60 million purchase price was transferred to her children without being subject to the much bigger bite of the estate tax.
In a memo to Mrs. Olsten, Mr. Covey characterized his plan as "risky," noting that the I.R.S. could treat the purchase of the right to inherit as a disguised gift, making it subject to as much as 76 percent in combined state and Federal taxes. But Mrs. Olsten decided to go ahead and made the purchase in June 1993. Mr. Covey filed a thick tax return detailing the arrangement and waited to see whether the I.R.S. would accept it or force the family into Tax Court.
Last month, Mr. Covey described at a gathering of Manhattan estate lawyers what happened next. An I.R.S. agent summoned him to a meeting, he said, and then handed him a piece of paper on which was written how much in total taxes the agency was willing to settle for. "Take it or leave it," the agent said, according to Mr. Covey.
The Olstens took it. While neither Mr. Covey nor Stuart Olsten would say exactly how much was paid to the I.R.S., Mr. Covey anticipates that the tax savings will ultimately be in the millions of dollars. However, those savings will depend on the company's stock price when Mrs. Olsten dies.
Mindful of how much wealth remains in their mother's own estate, despite a drop in the price of Olsten stock over the last year, the Olsten children are devising ways to pay the estate taxes that will come due at her death. They are pursuing a common technique of buying life insurance on her -- in this instance, a policy worth $50 million. They will pay the $1.2 million in annual premiums with some of the money they received.
And Miriam Olsten, also looking for ways to save on estate taxes, has put her company stock into trusts for the children similar to the one used by Eugene M. Isenberg at Nabors Industries.

Complexity
Forcing Uncle Sam To Cry Uncle
 The Pritzkers, who own the Hyatt Hotel chain, airline service industries and a host of manufacturing companies, are one of the wealthiest families in the nation, worth billions of dollars. But after the family's patriarch, A. N. Pritzker, died in 1986, his heirs contended that no estate taxes were due. They noted that for years Mr. Pritzker had shifted his share of the family wealth into trusts in the Bahamas, which were holding the assets on behalf of his children and grandchildren. By the time he died, they said, he no longer owned enough to owe any taxes.
The I.R.S. rejected that notion and sent a bill for $53.2 million, saying that the trusts were a sham. But just as it was to present its case to the Tax Court in 1994, the I.R.S. backed off. It settled with the Pritzkers for $9.5 million, or 18 cents for each dollar it had said was owed, plus interest.
What happened? One problem was that the I.R.S. could not get enough records to completely and accurately place a value on the late Mr. Pritzker's holdings. The Bahamas have strict secrecy laws, and the I.R.S. could not compel the bank that administered the trust there to hand over its files.
One of Mr. Pritzker's sons, Jay A. Pritzker, said the family had settled because "it was better than litigating; it's as simple as that." He said he thought "the Government's people did an excellent job of collecting more than they were entitled to."
But tax lawyers say the agency's retreat was part of a pattern: It has had trouble enforcing its largest claims, especially against the estates of individuals whose business dealings are very complex.
Long, difficult court fights tie up I.R.S. staff members, and the Government risks a complete loss.
"The I.R.S., including its trial lawyers, is seriously undermanned and overextended," said Mr. Zabel, the New York estate lawyer. "And this leads them in some cases to compromise where they might obtain substantially more by litigating."
One of the agency's biggest losses came in a case against the estate of S. I. Newhouse, the founder of a publishing empire, who died in 1979. The I.R.S. had contended that his control over the family's primary company was so extensive that most of its value belonged in his estate, which would have produced a $609 million tax bill.
Mr. Newhouse's heirs argued, however, that the company's structure was more complex. Even though Mr. Newhouse had held all of the most important type of stock, other family members had the right to exercise a veto on certain matters. While they were unlikely to veto anything while Mr. Newhouse was alive, the family argued that the possibility of any kind of veto made the stock less attractive to a potential buyer outside the family, thus greatly reducing its value. In 1990, the Tax Court agreed with their contention that only about $48 million was due.
Lawyers note that it can be hard to agree on what a business, and especially a piece of one, is worth. The Tax Court itself, they say, sometimes seems inclined to split the difference between claims made by the I.R.S. and valuations proferred by heirs to an estate.
For instance, the court did just that in a 1994 decision involving the estate of Joseph H. Lauder, a co-owner of the cosmetics business bearing the name of his wife, Estee Lauder. His heirs contended that his shares in the business were worth $29 million when he died in 1983, while the I.R.S. said they were worth $89.5 million. After hearing from appraisers hired by both sides, the court valued the shares at $50.5 million, essentially splitting the difference.
Donald C. Alexander, who was commissioner of the I.R.S. in the mid-1970's, said the agency "has flubbed cases because it is outgunned." He said he was also concerned that recent budget cuts by Congress -- resulting in agency staff cuts of 9 percent over the last two years -- would increase the problem. "If the Congress would only do what it should do, which is give the I.R.S. adequate resources and stop bashing the I.R.S., then it could perform its job better and the country would be better for it," Mr. Alexander said.
 
The Politics
Keep the Tax Or Change It?
 While tax advisers focus on new ways to sidestep the estate tax, a number of small-business owners, farmers and politicians are advocating its elimination -- contending that huge estate-tax bills might force heirs to break up enterprises that took a lifetime or more to build.
Clarence L. Tart, a North Carolina farmer and business owner, recently wrote to several members of Congress about how hard the estate tax can hit families that do not take steps to avoid it. When Mr. Tart's father died in 1964, his widow had to borrow $75,000 and sell a warehouse to pay a $200,000 tax bill. "Ever since then, I've had a passion not to let this happen again," he said.
Mr. Tart, who estimated that his company was now worth $3 million, argued that he could not put real estate in a trust for his two children or give them big gifts of cash or stock. Such strategies, he maintained, would prevent him from using the assets as collateral for loans his company often needs.
So he has resorted to an old standby, insurance. He pays $15,000 a year in premiums for $1 million of life insurance to make sure that his heirs will have cash to pay the taxes on his estate. He has also spent thousands of dollars on expert advice to create a trust to hold the policies for his heirs -- protecting the insurance proceeds themselves from being hit by estate taxes.
Many other business owners are taking similar precautions. And those who favor repealing the estate tax say that the huge sums spent on insurance and the other avoidance strategies are wastes of money, slowing the growth of many businesses and costing tens of thousands of jobs.
Republican leaders, citing what they call a public desire for lower taxes, portray the traditional arguments for the estate tax as hopelessly outdated and out of step.
Though he pledged that Congress "will look at all aspects of things being utilized by people as far as making end runs around the tax code," Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, expressed most concern with one of the underlying principles of the estate tax.
"I want to get away from the taxes that are meant to create some sort of social redistribution of the wealth or in some way or another make people feel good," said Mr. Archer, whose committee writes the nation's tax laws. "Taxes should be imposed to pay the Government's bills. Period."
But the Government is also running huge deficits and sorely needs revenue to pay its bills. "There is a porousness in the estate tax," one senior Treasury official, who insisted on anonymity, said. He added that the Clinton Administration was concerned that some of the new avoidance strategies "are tremendously ripping off the Treasury."
The idea of taxing the estates of wealthy Americans at death took hold at a time of widespread concern about the growing concentration of economic power. Shortly after the turn of the century, with a handful of families controlling vast oil, railroad and manufacturing fortunes, President Theodore Roosevelt called for "a progressive tax" so that enormous fortunes would not pass in their entirety from one generation of super-rich to the next.
Supporters of the estate tax believed that it would help spread wealth more evenly across the economy and make for a more just society. But by the time Congress established the estate tax in 1916, a second motivation had emerged: a need to increase Government revenues as the nation slid toward involvement in World War I.
Congress shut down big loopholes in the 1980's in an effort to apply the taxes more fairly and make them harder to avoid. Some analysts believe that the issue of loopholes should be revisited.
"There is a great disparity between appearance and reality in the estate tax, and that does not create confidence in the fairness of the tax system," said Max B. Sawicky, tax economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a research organization backed by unions.
It appears unlikely that Congress will eliminate the tax. But Republican officials said the new Congress could well raise the basic exemption, to $750,000 in total gifts and bequests from $600,000, and extend additional breaks to small businesses and farmers.
"I am quite torn about the estate tax," said William G. Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Given the growing concentration of wealth, "one can make a case that an estate tax in principle is an appropriate tax." But, he said, "it is not obvious that there is too much concentration," enough to harm the economy, "or that the estate tax is effective in breaking it up."
Still, he said, the estate tax remains an important backstop.
"A lot of income escapes the income tax," he said. "There's lots of deferred income and capital gains that are avoided. So the estate tax is a way to capture taxes on money that has escaped taxation during the lifetime of the individual."

Anticipating that a home will rise in value, homeowners can insulate it from estate taxes. By putting a home into a trust for their children, parents can give their family a break on both gift taxes and estate taxes.
Guided by her husband, the tax lawyer Martin Shenkman, Shelly Shenkman created a qualified personal residence trust for the benefit of their three minor children and gave it the $539,000 house where the family continues to live. After the 25-year term of the trust, the house wil belong to the children, and will not count as part of Ms. Shenkman's estate. But in doing so, she has used up only $83,750 of the $600,000 she is allowed to give or leave to their children.

 Tax advisers at J. P. Morgan are promoting a way to help executives pass on fortunes to their children while saving on taxes. The idea is to let them transfer stock options to family members and family trusts. Profits on the options would belong to heirs free of estate tax.
 Eugene M. Isenberg, chief executive of Nabors Industries, transferred options to buy the company's shares into trusts for his children and grandchildren. Those options were exercised in October and November, as shown in this document he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, producing a gain of $29.7 million. (pg. 31)

Herman Melville
A Biography.
PUB-DATE: UNKNOWN 1, 1819-1851.
By Hershel Parker.
Illustrated. 941 pp. Baltimore:
The Johns Hopkins University Press. $39.95.
Readers have wanted to know the truth behind Herman Melville's books from the very first moments of his literary career. He wrote "Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life" in 1845, described it as a faithful narrative of his voyage to the far Pacific and submitted the book to Harper & Brothers. But as Hershel Parker shows in "Herman Melville: A Biography," the publishers suspected at once that Melville's real-life experiences were other than as described, and they returned the manuscript. "Typee" found its way into print even so, followed by "Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas"; and the skepticism spread. In Britain the attacks on Melville's bona fides were harsh enough to damage sales, and his publisher pestered him for proof that the voyages had actually taken place. 
 Melville was indignant. Yet how could anyone read those first astonishing books of his and fail to raise an eyebrow? The beauteous Polynesian nymphs swimming out to the whaling ship for a shipboard orgy with the sex-starved sailors, the three shrunken human heads dangling over the narrator's bed, the cooking vat lined with human bones, still moist, "with particles of flesh clinging to them here and there!" Those were weighty scenes to accept from an author who was otherwise unknown to the literary world.
Melville's prose style, even in its early, leaner phase, aroused a measure of incredulity all by itself. He claimed to have spent his youth as a lowly seaman "before the mast," laboring among the most grimly oppressed of the 19th-century proletarians. Yet he wrote with the cheerful air of a cultured gentleman, sure of his way around the bookcase. A famous early review of Melville's work, nicely described by Mr. Parker, appeared in Blackwood's Magazine in Edinburgh and all but unmasked Melville as an English worthy pretending to be a humble American sailor. The very name "Herman Melville" fell, the reviewer said, "suspiciously on our ear."
Americans have been laughing at that snobby British response for a century and a half. Yet for all the misconceptions in that review -- Melville's New York and Boston roots were incontestable, his South Seas voyages were real enough -- something in those early doubts and wonderings went to the heart of his achievement. Every one of Melville's first six books, from "Typee" to "Moby-Dick," was written in the first person, and every one of his narrators was a bit of an anomaly -- a bookish man, humorous and gallant, and at wit's end. Every one of the narrators appeared to be in flight from an unspoken past, and the flights themselves grew more desperate, until the last and most eloquent of those six bookish gentlemen ended up bobbing in perfect isolation in the middle of the creamy ocean, gazing downward into the white depth of all existence, which is pure monstrousness -- the loneliest, most terrified intellectual in all of literature.
Those early narrators were Melville's greatest creation -- greater than Ahab, or the giant sea beast, or Captain Vere of "Billy Budd." But because the narrators also seemed to be Melville's doubles, it has always been natural to ask what exactly was the origin of that irresistible urge to flight -- the urge that, in Melville's youth, led him to ship out in real life, then led him, a few years later, into imaginary voyages so wild and exotic that only his own invented vocabulary, the language of an American Shakespeare, could evoke what he saw and felt.
Mr. Parker tells us that "Typee" transformed Melville into America's first literary sex symbol, which is to say, sales were brisk. But the subsequent books did less well, with the result that Melville never did go through the kind of late-life lionizing that causes a great writer's admirers and friends to collect his letters and compose memoirs and generally to speculate about the real-life story behind the stories. The solution to the mysteries of Melville's personality was left to 20th-century scholars to solve. During the last 75 years or so, armies of researchers have devoted themselves to digging up the necessary information; and of those many decades of scholarly labor, Mr. Parker's "Herman Melville" is the grand culmination.
The book is some 900 pages long, and even so counts merely as Volume 1, with Melville 32 years old at the end, fondling the first printed copies of "Moby-Dick." Mr. Parker is a professor of English at the University of Delaware, and his fanaticism for exactitude is such that he gives us not just the tiniest details, but the details about the details. He quotes a precise description of Melville by Nathaniel Hawthorne's wife, Sophia -- "His nose is straight & rather handsome, his mouth expressive of sensibility & emotion," and so forth for half a page -- and then he doubles the precision by telling us that Sophia's account "is by all odds the fullest such description of Melville known to exist."
Whole forests among these details are new, and of the million fresh facts, the most striking, as I judge them, reveal the commercial dealings of Melville's father. The elder Melville was a loving family man but a business moron. His incompetence and untimely death brought the Melvilles spiraling downward from the higher reaches of the old Knickerbocker and Yankee aristocracies into the agonies of bankruptcy, debt, disgrace and family charity. To make your way through the intricacies of Mr. Parker's account has some of the charm of going into bankruptcy yourself. Yet you glean a clearer idea than any other biography has offered of how consequential was the fall. The misery of economic failure, surely, and not just the ambiguity of Melville's sexual nature (which is a topic that Mr. Parker appears to believe has been overemphasized), has got to be the terrible experience that lay in Melville's own past.
Mr. Parker's arcana show the family roots of Melville's prose style. We read about his sisters and cousins and their fondness for pompous teasing and jokey ironies -- and we recognize traces of Melville's wordy and sometimes irritating sense of humor. His older brother, Gansevoort, became a Democratic Party orator, famous for a tub-thumping peroration to the dying Andrew Jackson, which Mr. Parker has unearthed: "When Andrew Jackson dies, he will not drivel his path to the grave like a slobbering dotard, as the whig press falsely call him; but when HE dies -- when the great soul within shall have utterly consumed its outer tenement of clay -- why, then, a MAN will die!" And we recognize the passage in "Moby-Dick" where, Mr. Parker reminds us, Melville invokes "thou great democratic God!" -- "Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne!"
The spirit behind Mr. Parker's biography has a good deal in common with another of his Melvillean projects, the 13 volumes (so far) of the Northwestern-Newberry edition of Melville, of which Mr. Parker is associate general editor. The labor that has gone into those volumes is Pharaonic. The Northwestern-Newberry "Moby-Dick" took 23 years to edit and contains nearly 500 pages of commentary about the book's publishing history, comparisons between the English and American versions and a list of every single word that was hyphenated at the right margin in Melville's original text. On the other hand, to the earnest "Moby-Dick" reader who stumbles across one of the many obscure references and would like to flip to the back pages to find a brief explanation of what Melville had in mind -- to that unhappy person, the Northwestern-Newberry "Moby-Dick" offers very little help. There is not even the diagram of a ship. The 23 years of drudge labor appear to have addled the editors' minds, until literature has slipped from view and antiquarianism alone remains. And that same combination of microscopic detail and macroscopic lack of judgment reappears in Mr. Parker's enormous biography.
You wade through Mr. Parker's gigantic leaf-drifts of petty facts regarding letter writing, cousins, sisters, rentals, sales, architecture, debts, billings and contested wills -- reassuring yourself all the while that, at least, everything you could possibly wish to know about Herman Melville will eventually turn up. But that is not the case. About the Polynesians and their charmingly idiosyncratic notions of sex and meat, for instance, Mr. Parker tells us hardly more than can be learned in Leon Howard's "Herman Melville: A Biography" of 1951.
Mr. Parker tells us almost nothing about Melville's special insights into colonialism and race, and very little about his warm, economically dependent and politically awkward relations with his father-in-law, the chief justice of Massachusetts, who kept sending escaped slaves back to bondage in the South. On these delicate topics, there is more in the one-volume, slightly jargony study by Laurie Robertson-Lorant, "Melville: A Biography," which came out a few months ago, than in Mr. Parker's mass of details. I don't even mention the majesties of Melville's vocabulary, his odd relation to Shakespeare, the Platonist and Calvinist ideas that bear so crucially on his sea beast, his miraculous ability to convey the feeling of motion, his ferocity, the richness of his images -- in a word, Melville's genius. On topics like those the reader is better off looking up Newton Arvin's "Herman Melville" of 1950 or Charles Olson's "Call Me Ishmael" of 1947.
Even so, the shape of Melville's career obliges Mr. Parker to tell a number of dramatic stories, and this he does well. The last section of the book -- a fleeting passage of 150 pages -- recounts Melville's life while at work on "Moby-Dick," his meeting Nathaniel Hawthorne and forming a passionate friendship, his decision to stay permanently in the Berkshires in order to draw inspiration from Hawthorne, the deepening of his imagination almost from month to month. All of that, in Mr. Parker's rendition, breathes a genuine excitement, even if whole paragraphs about letter-writing sisters and cousins and picnic menus are always getting in the way.
By the end of the volume, the first copies of "Moby-Dick" have at last arrived, with their moving dedication to Hawthorne, and Melville celebrates by taking Hawthorne to dinner at a hotel in Lenox, Mass. The two writers sit alone in the dining room while people at the hotel gawk at them from the doorway through clouds of tobacco smoke. It is November 1851. Mr. Parker writes: "At some well-chosen moment Melville took out the book whose publication they had both been awaiting and handed his friend an inscribed copy of 'Moby-Dick,' the first presentation copy. In no other way could Hawthorne have had a copy so soon, one that he had read by the 15th or 16th, in time to have written a letter Melville received on the 16th." Mr. Parker's sleuthing on such questions as exactly when a book arrived and when a letter was written is unsurpassable.
"Here, in the dining room, Hawthorne for the first time saw the extraordinary dedication and tribute to his genius -- the first book anyone had dedicated to him. . . . Alone with the author, he could open the book in his nervous way (more nervous even than normally), and get from his friend a guided tour of the organization of the thing now in print, and even sample a few paragraphs that caught his eye or that the author eagerly pointed out to him, perhaps even some passages he had seen in manuscript in Melville's study."
That is a vivid scene, carefully, even beautifully, imagined by the biographer on the basis of an eyewitness description that Mr. Parker has dug up from an absurdly obscure Vermont newspaper. I wonder how Volume 2 will begin, and what other tiny jewels of research will sparkle among the tons of material that Mr. Parker has surely exhumed.

HEADLINE: Let's End the Cold War Again

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is vice president for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Carnegie Endowment.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
This week marks the fifth anniversary of the breakup of the Soviet Union, perhaps the most astonishing single event in the second half of the 20th century. The collapse combined at least three-and-a-half revolutions in one. Leninist politics were to be supplanted by democratic pluralism; Stalinist economics, by private ownership and the market; the czarist empire, by a dozen suddenly independent states, and what little was left of the cold war in 1991, by rapturous Russian-American partnership.
Five years are hardly enough time for a final verdict on changes of this magnitude, but they are enough for provisional judgments about what's working and what isn't, and where re-thinking is needed. Some surprising conclusions suggest themselves. Those transformations that aroused the deepest doubts five years ago -- that led serious people to ask whether Russia was really ready for westernization -- have generally gone better than the doubters expected. 
 By contrast, where our hopes were highest and the revolution had gone furthest even before the Soviet collapse -- that is, in Russian-American relations -- we have too little to show for the past half-decade. We won the cold war. It should be further behind us than it is.
First, the better-than-expected results. When the Soviet Union disappeared, the skeptical view had it that neither history nor culture prepared Russians for democratic capitalism, much less for the discomfort of getting there. Faced with (to quote one recent scholarly outburst) "an endless collapse of everything essential for a decent existence," the people were obviously going to opt for something familiar, like dictatorship.
Such forecasts staked a lot on a reading of the popular mind. But the best research on the Russian man-in-the-street suggests that his views have remained much calmer than many Western analyses. Year by year since 1992, the proportion of Russians who believe that their economic situation is either holding steady, or getting only marginally better or worse, has never been less than 60 percent and never more than 65 percent.
Behind such figures, of course, lie a lot of frayed overcoats, starchy diets and appalling medical care. Yet, if popular attitudes are changing at all in response to prolonged privation, the trend seems to be toward slightly greater optimism.
In 1992, 24 percent of Russians polled said they expected life to be a little better after five years. That figure has inched up to 32 percent. (And the 15 percent who said they expected things to be a lot worse has inched down to 9 percent.)
As for the idea that Russians simply don't get what democracy is all about, or are disenchanted with it, the polls again tell a different story. When asked to evaluate specific democratic freedoms -- religion, speech, assembly, independent political activity -- Russians prefer the present to the past by majorities that have grown steadily over time and are now as high as 5 to 1.
Public attitudes of this kind hardly guarantee good policies or strong democratic institutions, but without them neither policies nor institutions will survive for long. For all Russia's difficulties (and some will not be overcome for many years), it is tracing a slow, bumpy but dogged route to political and economic normalcy.
Given this record, it is discouraging to see Russia's relations with the outside world unfold so much less favorably, particularly measured against the expectations of five years ago. Today we remember the Bush Administration's "new world order" talk only with embarrassment.
But if the slogan was fatuous, the aim was not. Applied to Russian-American relations, it meant putting the struggles of the cold war aside, not simply continuing to wage them on (for us) more favorable terms.
The reason for doing so was not to make a show of magnanimity toward a defeated power, but because the war was really over and we needed a framework for dealing effectively with the problems that would preoccupy us in the future.
We're not there yet. In fact, with the dispute that has taken shape over the expansion of NATO, the past is definitely gaining on us. It would be hard to think of a policy that more pointlessly re-enacts cold-war battles without really helping us to deal with post-cold-war problems.
Over the next year and more, as NATO discusses the first round of new invitees, and then the second, we may have to get used to a kind of retro-diplomacy on both sides -- blustery take-it-or-leave-it offers, walkouts and so on. 1991 will seem very far away; 1981 may not.
The cold war, however, does not live on only in policies that revive East-West disagreements and dividing lines. It can lie hidden, ironically, even in policies that seem to unite the former combatants. There is no more striking example of this than the old superpower nuclear standoff, which -- five full years after the Soviet Union broke up -- remains almost completely unchanged.
Yes, the number of missiles and warheads is down, and bombers are no longer on 24-hour alert, but otherwise the nature of the relationship is exactly the same. Two huge arsenals still confront each other; the strategy of each side is still to be able to respond overwhelmingly to a first strike, and the only way to carry out the strategy is still to modernize weapons at hand so as to be able to use them if it ever becomes necessary to do so. Russian generals now routinely say that the role of nuclear weapons in their national security is actually increasing. The Pentagon, meanwhile, discusses how many upgraded submarine-launched missiles it needs.
This is not where we should have ended up. It may seem to do no harm simply to chip away slowly at these antiquated arsenals, but nuclear inertia does not serve either side's interests.
Expense is clearly the least of the reasons, but it's not nothing. A Brookings study last year put the annual cost of the American nuclear deterrent at more than $20 billion; the Pentagon says the number is less. Even if it is much less, and even if we could save only half of it (and that might be hard -- dismantlement costs a lot, too), both we and the Russians could put the money to more effective military use.
A second, more pressing reason to break our nuclear inertia is the help we would get in dealing with the "loose nukes" problem. If the entire Russian and American nuclear weapons inventory were only a few hundred warheads on each side, at a few controlled locations, the formidable task of tracking tens of thousands of weapons across Russian territory would be made much more manageable.
A third reason for avoiding a business-as-usual approach is that, if Russian-American relations become more contentious, nuclear weapons are not likely to remain a sleepy area of agreement for long.
Already Russian generals buzz with talk about deploying tactical nuclear weapons once more in neighboring Belarus if NATO expands, and rejecting the Start 2 treaty has come to be seen as one of the few ways for Russia to express its frustration at being isolated from NATO's grand design. When even our incremental nuclear policies become tangled up in this political confrontation, we'll regret not having taken a more radical approach.
There is a final reason, by far the most important, for rejecting the strategic nuclear legacy handed down to us by the cold war. These weapons may have been a useful form of power in the past, but they are not likely to be so in the future, and we do should not want them to be.
If, for example, the United States ends up with the very same nuclear relationship with China that it had with the Soviet Union -- growing strategic arsenals poised to destroy each other -- we will have to consider this result a failure. But it seems by far the most likely outcome if we do nothing whatever to refashion our nuclear relationship with Russia.
One obviously better alternative is to greatly reduce offensive forces while steadily increasing our reliance on technologies for defending against ballistic missiles. Over time, with a number of possible rising nuclear powers on their borders, the Russians themselves are likely to see the advantages of such an approach, but if they have a better idea, let's hear it. And if the Clinton Administration has one, let's hear that, too.
Instead, the Administration has been evasive on the subject. When a large group of former generals and admirals from a dozen countries called for abolition of nuclear weapons two weeks ago, we should have heard from the Pentagon that zero is the wrong number -- these weapons can't be disinvented -- but that radically reducing their place in international security is the right goal.
Similarly, the Administration has to work much harder at showing Congress that it does not oppose the Republican plan to create a nationwide "shield" against ballistic missiles simply because it prefers to rely for all time on large offensive arsenals. It should show that it is ready to deploy missile defenses where they are most practical today, to protect our friends and forces in regional conflicts.
Because of the contentious new tone of Russian-American relations, the Administration is going to find it hard to resolve nuclear weapons issues with Moscow unless it can say more about the place these weapons will have in our own military strategy. When Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton meet next March to salvage something of of their "partnership," they could do far worse than to put this problem on the agenda. If they talk seriously and act boldly, five years from now maybe the cold war will really be over.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Classical Music Finds Its Grand Narratives Being Told Elsewhere

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
For two decades now, the anxiety has been building. At first, sunny declarations of enthusiasm masked sotto voce whispers of worry. Then darker expressions of pessimism emerged. Now, conversations are tinged with despair. The classical music world is in a crisis.
Consider the recent symptoms. Early this month, the San Francisco Symphony went on strike, and the Cleveland Orchestra barely avoided one. This season has already seen a 10-week strike by the Atlanta Symphony, a 9-week strike in Philadelphia (the first in 30 years) and a 15-day strike in Oregon. 
 This is not a matter of strong unions' making unreasonable salary demands in tight economic times. Players and managers across the country are expanding an increasingly desperate ritual, insisting on greater security because all they see around them is greater insecurity. Prospects for major orchestras and the classical music world itself are far from encouraging.
This is why, for years, orchestras have been overspending on star soloists to sell troubled subscription series. It is why the American Symphony Orchestra League, in a notorious report a few years ago, proposed that in response to declining sales and dwindling support, orchestras start programming more popular works, hire interior decorators to liven up concert halls and install video monitors so conductors' expressions could be seen by audiences.
It is why classical record labels are seeing their market share slip away. And it is why those labels are creating more and more "crossover" recordings, sold with ever more glitzy marketing techniques.
By now, those of us who have been chronicling this decline can easily recite a litany of causes: the dismantling of public music education, the American urge to "democratize" the arts and eliminate esthetic distinctions, the increasing dominance of popular culture. Within the music world, audiences blame composers, composers blame audiences, players blame recording companies, and critics are ready to blame everybody. We mourn for a lost golden age when performance, composition, education and the elevated status of art music promised calm seas and a prosperous voyage.
Here and there are voices trying to dispel the gloom: after all, doesn't every era yearn for lost glories? Aren't there still interesting new pieces being written, accomplished virtuosos plying their wares, exceptional interpretations inspiring enthusiasm? Aren't operas, at least, getting attention?
Forget the threnody, these voices urge. The problem is not in the musical stars, but in ourselves; we have created overheated market expectations, an overabundance of orchestras and concerts, too obsessive a focus on bottom lines.
True, but not true enough. The malaise is so deep, and affects so many different segments of the music world, that it seems to mark a sea change in our culture, a fundamental shift not unlike the one that gave birth to this musical life in the first place, just two centuries ago.
At that time, middle-class composers first began to serve a new middle-class public in concert halls. Their symphonies, sonatas and showpieces created grand dramas and inspired intimate reflections. These works were literally musical narratives -- stories -- in which themes were as subject to trials and triumphs as characters in the period's epic novels and operas.
In those stories, whether heard in Brahms rhapsodies or Liszt etudes, Mahler symphonies or Paganini caprices, it can seem as if heroic individuals were venturing into the world, wrestling with its dangers; eventually, in sweet release or tragic resignation, those struggles would reach resolution.
These journeys inspired an almost novelistic sort of identification by listeners who heard their own sentiments reproduced in sound. Each performance was a telling of a primal story, a ritual renewing its celebrants, binding them into a community. The anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss once suggested that these compositions had a mythic function: they spoke of a society's origins, dramatizing its evolution. They have even been repeated, in concert after concert, with almost ritualistic devotion.
But then something changed. Composers began to have different kinds of goals in mind; specialized publics developed. And while the mainstream audience has remained committed to the old rituals, even those repetitions have begun to wear thin. Performance styles have followed suit, becoming more professional, less individual, less risky, less mythic. The great artworks have lost none of their power, but their social roles have.
The grand mythic adventures of our age, in fact, are found not in the concert hall's abstract sounds, but in the flickerings of the movie screen, or the stripped-down formulas of television and commercial pop. "Independence Day" is our version of Beethoven's Ninth. The result is debased, but the job is done. (Both proclaim that "all men are brothers.")
And lacking any deep commitment from a wide public, requiring more study and attention than we are willing to give, making large economic demands and claiming a priority that is no longer freely given, the world of art music stumbles from crisis to crisis, envying the commercial successes that surround it and unable any longer even to make a case for itself. The culture itself must change if art music is to have a vital future. Is it any wonder that the hope now is not to avoid inclement weather but simply to survive it?

Mideast: Bibi Agonistes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"I am a sojourning settler with you," said the patriarch Abraham to the Hittites, in Robert Alter's illuminating new translation of the Book of Genesis. "Grant me a burial holding with you . . ."
His wife, Sarah, had died "in Kiriath-arba, which is Hebron, in the land of Canaan." Ephron the Hittite offered Abraham a grave site free, but the patriarch insisted on paying for a cave in the far end of the field. Ephron then made a package of the cave and the field and asked an exorbitant price -- 400 shekels of silver. Without bargaining, Abraham paid the asking price for the land. 
 Why pay for a burial plot when it has been offered as a gift? "Ephron, of course, knows what Abraham really wants," explains Alter, "is to be able to buy the land and thus acquire inalienable right to it." Though promised the land by God, the patriarch paid dearly because he wanted his descendants to avoid future legal argument from men.
Does a biblical property transaction, recounted in such detail thousands of years ago, still hold? At least a few hundred modern "settlers" who re-established Kiriath-arba in Hebron believe that it does, and put their lives on the line by living there, near the Cave of the Patriarchs, amidst Arabs angered by their presence.
You don't have to be a fundamentalist or a fanatic to understand the depth of feeling that attaches some deeply religious Jews to that place. Their determination to remain in hostile Hebron is a central symbol of one persecuted people's unique survival through the millennia.
One reason Jewish Israelis voted decisively to elect Benjamin Netanyahu Prime Minister was to insure that the residents of Kiriath-arba could bear witness to that continuity without getting massacred, as similar settlers were a few generations ago.
To protect their lives, even as most Israeli troops withdraw from Hebron, Mr. Netanyahu suggested some reasonable security modifications -- making it harder, for example, for potential snipers to zero in on children -- in the agreement too-eagerly reached in Oslo. Shimon Peres considered Hebron and other outposts to be impediments in his plan to purchase peace at the price of delivering almost all the West Bank to a Palestinian state.
Although unease among Jews has risen since Palestinian police used weapons supplied by Israel to fire on Israeli troops, Yasir Arafat has rigidly refused to compromise. That's because his goal is not to live in peace with Israelis in the West Bank, but to marshal world opinion to drive all Jews out of "his" territory. Mr. Netanyahu, recognizing that motive, has shown his resolve by restoring economic aid to Israelis who dare to live in hardship areas.
That led the blame-Israel set in the U.S., led by Carter's Zbig Brzezinski and Bush's Jim Baker, to entice Clinton into settler-bashing. Mideast experts like George Shultz, Sol Linowitz and Henry Kissinger were not roped in by Baker, but when a reporter then shouted a question to the President about settlements, Clinton accepted the premise that they were "obstacles to peace."
He erred. Perhaps he thought that the questioner meant "new" settlements, which would surely upset negotiations, but to assert a U.S. position that the present settlements should be uprooted would be an intrusive blunder. Even the Rabin-Peres Government oversaw the "thickening" and growth of present Israeli West Bank towns and Mr. Clinton needs to get out of the trap set for him.
The peace that cries out to be reached has about 70 percent of the disputed land Arab, the remainder Israeli. Arab families would continue to grow in contiguous Palestinian settlements, under their own flag, and Israeli settlers, including immigrants, would be fruitful and multiply in their own.
But the road to war is to encourage Arabs to believe that world pressure can drive Jews out of all the West Bank and establish East Jerusalem as capital of a Palestinian state.
That will not happen. Beating up on Benjamin Netanyahu, or demonizing settlers in Hebron, or threatening another intifada if Jews build homes in any part of Israel's undivided Jerusalem -- no such coercion will make it happen.
The popularity of Israel's present Government may suffer as it resists pressure to part with the nation's patrimony. Netanyahu's reward will come when his unfashionable realism delivers durable peace.

HEADLINE: Bulgaria's Premier Likely to Keep Job Despite Economic Mess

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Despite an economic collapse that has closed major hospitals, put many banks in receivership and drained hard currency reserves, the former Communists who have governed Bulgaria for the last three years appeared poised tonight to re-elect the Prime Minister.
A two-day special congress of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, which began Saturday, was called after the party's candidate lost the presidential election in November. Prime Minister Zhan Videnov told the delegates on Saturday that he was resigning and criticized a challenge to unseat him by the party's reform wing. 
 An astute tactician who was trained in Communist Party techniques in the former Soviet Union, Mr. Videnov apparently offered his resignation as a way of rallying support. He had insured through the selection process for congress delegates that his opponents would be underrepresented, several delegates said. A vote was expected late Sunday or Monday.
The main challenger to Mr. Videnov's leadership, the American-born Georgi Pirinski, was received coolly by the delegates today after making a speech calling for an "end to the plundering of state assets."
Mr. Pirinski resigned as Foreign Minister last month after declaring that the Government lacked popular support.
The Bulgarian Socialist Party remains the least Western-oriented and most pro-Russian party in Eastern and Central Europe. The party has balked at undertaking market reforms, and many of its leaders have been under fire from a parliamentary corruption commission for allowing politically connected banks to drain the country's hard currency reserves.
The Government is currently spending two-thirds of its budget on domestic and foreign interest payments, leaving little for essential services like heating schools and hospitals. Schools have reduced their lesson periods from 45 to 35 minutes so that students can spend less time huddled in the cold classrooms.
A relatively mild winter so far is the only thing that has kept deaths among elderly poor, many of whom cannot afford heating costs, relatively low, doctors said.
Under Mr. Videnov's two-year stewardship, Bulgaria's economy has gone into a free fall, with inflation likely to top 300 percent by the end of this year. The currency, the lev, has fallen from 70 to the American dollar in January to a low of 550 earlier this month.
The International Monetary Fund has frozen $582 million in badly needed loans because of the Government's refusal to carry out reforms. And it has insisted that in order for Bulgaria to qualify for new loans, the Government must agree to the introduction of a currency board. Such boards have been used by the fund to stabilize the economies of Argentina and Estonia.
The Socialist Party was dealt a severe blow last month when its candidate for President was easily defeated by Petar Stoyanov, the candidate of the opposition party, Union of Democratic Forces. But the President in Bulgaria has little more than ceremonial power.
Mr. Videnov was able to enhance his strength this weekend not only because he stacked the congress with his supporters but also because the reform wing of the party has been weakened. The main figure among the Socialist reformists, Andrei Lukanov, was shot dead outside his house in early October. His colleagues said his killing was linked to his plans to publicize corruption at the party's top levels.

HEADLINE: After a Year Of Law, Scant Competition

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
When President Clinton signed the landmark telecommunications bill on a clear, cold morning last February, he declared, "With the stroke of a pen, our laws will catch up to the future."
Almost a year later, the future is murkier than ever. 
 Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 became law, the cable television industry has largely abandoned its foray into the telephone business. The regional phone companies have shelved their efforts to get into television. And the three big long-distance carriers have put through their steepest rate increases in several years.
"If we're supposed to be on the road to new services and declining rates, we're off to a horrible start," said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of Consumers Union in Washington.
Early this week, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to release its second major set of proposals on fostering competition in telecommunications.
But critics of the F.C.C. are already sharpening their arguments that these rules -- like the first set of regulations issued by the commission in August -- are the primary reason that so little competition has taken hold.
Several experts in deregulation said, though, that the criticisms of the new law, or the way it is taking effect, are somewhat misplaced. The retreats and about-faces were not caused solely by flaws in the law, they argue. The companies themselves failed to predict the cost of their new ventures and overestimated the capabilities of the technology. Caught up in the mania of the digital age, some executives simply lost their grip on reality.
"We can hope for competition all we want, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen," said Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the F.C.C. and the architect of the Government's efforts to open these markets.
Mr. Hundt has played a part in slowing the process. Several industry executives said his aggressive approach to prying open local telephone monopolies had provoked a backlash from the companies, who have successfully challenged the commission's first set of competition rules in the Federal courts.
But when cable and phone executives began lobbying before Congress to change communications laws almost a decade ago, they said they intended to string new wires into American homes to compete with each other in television and telephone service. As the cost of those ventures rose and the potential payoffs receded, they pulled back.
The nation's largest cable operators, Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner, have both scaled back their plans to offer phone service as they struggle with mounting debt. Bell Atlantic, Nynex and the Pacific Telesis Group, which joined forces two years ago to start an ambitious television programming venture, Tele-TV, are in the process of shutting it down.
"Partly, this is a case of excessive expectations," said Eli M. Noam, the director of the Columbia University Institute for Tele-Information. "The cable and telephone companies fought very hard to get this law passed, and now they are having second thoughts.
Some experts contend that the withering of competition between cable and phone companies does not, by itself, doom the prospects for competition. They noted that other industries have been successfully deregulated without the emergence of new types of competitors.
"We didn't solve the lack of competition in airlines by having trucking companies get into the airline business," said Paul W. MacAvoy, a professor of management studies at the Yale School of Management.
Still, even the more orthodox rivalry between long-distance and local phone companies has been slow to develop. Despite the bold predictions of executives like Robert E. Allen of AT&T, long-distance carriers have barely made a dent in the $100 billion local phone business.
AT&T, the nation's largest long-distance carrier, is offering local phone service to a handful of customers in Sacramento, Calif. But the company has been stymied in its efforts to expand its local service beyond a few pockets because it is locked in protracted negotiations with the Bell companies to gain access to their networks.
"I think residential competition is going to be fairly modest in the first half of 1997," John D. Zeglis, the general counsel of AT&T, said. "Whether we can learn enough to break the code and compete in the second half of the year, I'm not going to speculate."
Executives at the Bell companies said the F.C.C. was to blame for their resistance. As part of its so-called interconnection rules, the commission required that the Bells open up their networks to AT&T and other competitors at wholesale rates far below their retail price. The Bells said that requirement was an unlawful taking of their property.
"Regulations vary widely from state to state, so you can't determine at the Federal level how these things should be priced," said Alfred E. Kahn, a Cornell economist and Carter Administration deregulator, who is representing the Bell companies in their lobbying battle.
GTE and other local phone companies recently challenged the F.C.C. in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis, saying that the commission did not have the jurisdiction to dictate interconnection terms. The court suspended the rules until a hearing next month.
Now, the F.C.C. is tackling an even more nettlesome issue: access charges. These are the $23 billion in annual fees that AT&T and other long-distance carriers pay to the local companies to complete their calls. Under the current regulatory regimen, these charges are set artificially high to help subsidize the cost of local phone service.
In a fully competitive market, most experts agree, access charges should be reduced anywhere from $5 billion to $20 billion. But some analysts said it would be irresponsible to slash those charges without allowing the Baby Bells to recoup at least some of the losses by raising their rates. It could also discourage would-be local competitors from building their own operations to compete with the Bells.
For all that, Mr. Hundt said the F.C.C. had no plans to recommend any rate increases in the proposals it will shortly release. And he argued that his critics were missing a larger point: Deregulation and technology are creating new businesses -- like high-speed access to the Internet -- that will more than offset any losses.
Indeed, some experts said it was shortsighted to complain about the pace of competition in an industry as unpredictable, volatile and fast moving as telecommunications. Technology and innovation can cause competition to sprout in unlikely places, like direct-broadcast satellite television or new types of wireless telephone service.
While it is difficult to find a cable executive who rhapsodizes about getting into the phone business, or a Bell executive who wants to buy a film studio, every big cable and telephone company is now scrambling to offer a high-speed link to the World Wide Web.
"To complain about the state of competition after 10 months makes me burst out laughing," said Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who studied the competitiveness of telecommunications for the Justice Department in 1986. "This is a very big business. It took 10 years for the microcomputer industry to challenge I.B.M."

HEADLINE: A Room With a Cyberview;
Hotels to Offer On-Line Services to Business Travelers

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Interactive television may still be searching for an audience in the home, but there are signs now that it may have finally found a solid market -- business travelers.
And the companies that are delivering it are the ones that have profited from offering hotel guests soft-core pornographic movies. 
 If the plans work out, and they will begin unfolding next year, the television will become for business executives the nerve center of the hotel, a place to make reservations, order flowers or food, send and receive E-mail or surf the Internet. One of the first hotels to offer the new services, both on and off the Internet, will be the Hilton Hotel at San Francisco International Airport, starting in January. Tests are expected to follow at other hotels later, although the companies will not disclose where yet.
Right now, pay-per-view companies provide hotels, including big chains like Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott, with Hollywood movies as well as the more popular erotic films. But they are trying to wean themselves from reliance on a single product, and they think delivering access to the Internet is the way to do it.
"The adult product has been one of the economic pillars of the industry," Robert Kavner, the newly named chief executive of the On Command Corporation, the largest pay-per-view company, said. "That was true for the VCR, too. But I have much higher expectations from hotel guests. As we broaden the programming we offer, the adult product will become less important. I think everyone wants that."
Not only are legions of business travelers eager for such services, executives at these companies say, but installing the systems to provide them is easier and cheaper than in private homes because the wiring is in place to connect scores of television sets. Within months, large blocks of hotel rooms are expected to undergo at least partial conversions to enable the pay-per-view companies to deliver Internet services.
"They are realizing that they now have the right of entry into all those hotels, with access to a sophisticated customer who is willing to pay for a lot of services," said Brian Schecter, an analyst at Paul Kagan Associates. "Whether they are able to successfully make that work is another question."
Mr. Schecter added: "They are starting out at the high end of the business, with people who are already paying $175 a night for a hotel room. Spending another few dollars for the Internet is nothing to them."
Business travelers who carry around laptops with Internet access will not need many of the new services. But plenty of other hotel guests will, the providers assume.
Hotels making the switch not only stand to make a few extra dollars per room every week, they will also be solving a growing problem: overloaded phone lines. Chris Elam, the corporate director of rooms at the Hyatt Hotels Corporation, said guests' phone calls used to average just seven minutes, meaning that 50 trunk lines could generally handle the phone traffic for a 500-room hotel. But with more business travelers carrying laptop computers, and using them to explore the Internet, he said, calls can often run to three hours, overwhelming the phone systems. If the pay-per-view companies can offer Internet access on their own phone lines, that would ease the stress, Mr. Elam said.
For the pay-per-view companies, the embrace of new technologies comes as something of a relief, at least in terms of their public images. Instead of being seen as essentially purveyors of soft-core pornography, they want to be known as technology and information companies. Mr. Kavner, On Command's chief executive, is an apt symbol of this shift of emphasis: he is a former AT&T executive who has spent the last few years trying to develop interactive systems for several telephone companies.
Moreover, the Internet promises a lucrative new opportunity for pay-per-view companies just when their market is reaching saturation. While they have been growing rapidly in recent years -- the Lodgenet Entertainment Corporation, No. 2 in the industry with 4,000 rooms wired, has seen its revenues jump by nearly 50 percent a year for the last few years -- the expansion has largely come from signing up more hotels. To maintain growth, they will now have to bring in greater revenues from each hotel room.
Tim C. Flynn, Lodgenet's chairman, said his company's revenues per room have grown to about $21.50 a room a month from $16.25 three years ago by adding such services as Nintendo games, increasing advertising and offering movies on demand rather than on a fixed schedule. He said the Internet access will probably cost hotel guests about $4.50 an hour. That does not include telephone access charges, which the guests will pay separately. If the Internet and other new services catch on, he said, per-room revenues could double over the next several years.
Mr. Flynn added that the additional services will cost his company less than $20 a room to install because most of the wiring and infrastructure are in place.
On Command has been working hard to update all its 900,000 rooms with its full package, which now includes Sony Playstation games, Bell Atlantic's interactive Yellow Pages, dozens of free cable channels, video checkout services, room service ordering and messaging for guests.
On Command, which was just spun off this fall by its parent, Ascent Entertainment, reported a 25 percent increase in revenues in the third quarter from the year earlier to $32.7 million. Its cash flow rose 8 percent to $11.8 million, while its net income slipped to $411,000 from $1.6 million the previous year. Lodgenet reported revenues of $27.2 million in the third quarter, up 56 percent from the quarter a year earlier. Cash flow rose 57 percent from the year earlier to $7.5 million in the third quarter.
On Command closed Friday at its 52-week low of $15.625, while Lodgenet closed at $16.75. Both trade on the Nasdaq.
In addition to giving travelers access to the Internet, many of the companies want to offer extensive electronic shopping services and information -- like listing restaurants close to the hotel and offering guided walking tours -- that would permit them to sell advertising.
The pay-per-view business has come a long way since a company called Spectravision began piping movies into hotel rooms in the 1970's. After dominating the market for several years, Spectravision stumbled in the 1980's, the victim of the financial wheeling and dealing of that decade and its own slowness in adapting to technological change.
The company showed its movies -- played on banks of videocassette recorders in the hotel basement -- on a fixed schedule. But it lost business to newer competitors, including On Command and Lodgenet, whose systems allowed hotel guests to order movies any time they wanted.
Just as damaging, Spectravision went through two leveraged buyouts, most recently by Marvin Davis in 1989. The deals piled on a huge debt load that the company was ultimately unable to carry.
Spectravision was operating under the protection of Federal bankruptcy law when On Command, which is 57 percent owned by the Ascent Entertainment Group in Denver, purchased it several months ago for $161 million. In addition to offering interactive services, On Command now hopes to grow overseas, particularly in Asia and South America.
What has largely driven the growth of cash flow and revenue until now has been soft-core pornography. The pay-per-view companies generally buy unlimited rights to show those films for a specified period of time, usually about $5,000 or so for three years. The low price and unlimited use make the films more profitable for the pay-per-view companies. In contrast, Hollywood studios generally collect about 40 percent of viewing fees for their mainstream movies.
The biggest supplier of the soft-core porn films is Vivid Video in Los Angeles. Susan Yannetti, a spokeswoman for Vivid Video, said the company makes about 75 films a year, each typically costing $50,000 or less, then edits them into two versions: hard core and the less-explicit soft core for cable television and hotels.
The distributors of the films make no apologies about their content. "You're away from home and you can be a little bad, I guess," said Eric Goldberg, a senior vice president at SVI Systems, which serves smaller hotels. "People joke about it, but the adult package is where we make our money."
Mr. Elam of Hyatt Hotels said the company assures guests who complain about the films that the procedure for ordering them keeps children from watching them by requiring answers to a series of questions. Guests can also simply switch off access to the adult movies.
Mr. Kavner said On Command's goal was to increase its per-room revenue to $1.30 a day from 80 cents, primarily through delivery of Internet services. He said hotel guests still watch more commercial TV -- two and a half hours a night, on average -- than anything else. Only 12 percent buy movies, he added.
"We are trying to figure out what the other 88 percent might want," Mr. Kavner said.

HEADLINE: Serbia's Apartheid Victims

 BODY:
The political crisis that has filled Serbia's streets with protesters for more than a month provides some hope for the forgotten victims of President Slobodan Milosevic -- the 1.8 million Albanians who live in the southwestern region of Kosovo. Although 90 percent of the population, the Albanians are ruled in brutal apartheid style by the ethnic Serbs.
Mr. Milosevic began his ascent from Communist functionary to President of Serbia with an emotional speech in Kosovo commemorating a Serbian defeat there in 1389, tapping into the Serbian sentiment that Albanians are outsiders on Serbian sacred ground. Upon taking power in 1989, Mr. Milosevic began an ethnic cleansing of the Albanians, who had autonomy under Communism. The Communist officials who controlled the government, schools and police were local Albanians. 
 The Milosevic regime fired them, and most Albanians employed in government and industry. Albanian schools are now outlawed. According to a new report by Human Rights Watch, police detain or beat up dozens of Albanians every day. Security forces have killed 21 Albanians in the last two years. Ethnic Serbs, especially war refugees, are encouraged to go to Kosovo and take jobs from Albanians. Nearly 350,000 Albanians have emigrated.
An Albanian terrorist group began attacks this year, but the vast majority of the Albanians have chosen nonviolence. Their only local ally, the nation of Albania to Kosovo's south, is impoverished, with a feeble army. Its president, Sali Berisha, has refrained from inciting the Kosovo Albanians. That is important, because conflict in Kosovo could spill over into neighboring Macedonia and ignite a regional war.
The Clinton Administration rejects the independence many Albanians want, but it has been Kosovo's main protector. It has made full respect for human rights in Kosovo a condition for lifting sanctions that keep Belgrade out of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and block loans that could help revive its collapsed economy. Mr. Milosevic has responded with some conciliatory talk on Kosovo, although so far it is only talk.
The top leaders chosen by Kosovo's Albanians have been reluctant to support the anti-Milosevic protests, in part because Mr. Milosevic's more nationalist opponents endorsed the Kosovo crackdown in the past. But the nationalists have changed their rhetoric. In a protest rally earlier this month, one of their leaders, Vuk Draskovic, asked for a moment of silence for an Albanian teacher who died in police custody in Kosovo. The Kosovo Albanians have reason to be cautious, but their top leaders should recognize that Kosovo will benefit from a democratic Serbia.
The Kosovo Albanians need continued resolve from Washington. Economic ruin has fueled the protests, and Mr. Milosevic is desperate to get rid of the sanctions. No matter who ends up running Belgrade, Washington must continue to emphasize that sanctions will be lifted only if its conditions are met, including full rights for Kosovo.

HEADLINE: Mystery of a Casino Boat Matches the Style of Its Owner

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
For months, Michael Kornblum told curious residents and politicians that the pier his new company was busily renovating on the Sheepshead Bay waterfront in Brooklyn would be used for a dinner-and-dancing cruise boat that would bring some high-class entertainment to an area struggling to revive itself.
Then, like a magician pulling away the cape, the company suddenly announced that the cruises -- once on the high seas and out of New York State jurisdiction -- would, in fact, offer casino gambling, which in international waters is unregulated. 
 And that has put Mr. Kornblum in the middle of a squall.
A man who was until just a week ago an obscure, if not quite anonymous, New York real estate developer became, literally overnight, the local symbol, if not the lightning rod, for all the multilayered anxieties, antagonisms and ambitions connected with the multibillion-dollar casino industry, which has struggled to lose the taint of its long associations with organized crime.
"I am troubled by the way they conducted themselves," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said of Mr. Kornblum's company yesterday. "They conducted themselves in a surreptitious manner."
Mr. Giuliani said that while he had no evidence of any criminal activity or involvement, he would take the company to court today to stop the cruises until more could be learned about the company's principals and employees, and whether proper background checks had been made to protect the public.
In a very real way, the mystery of Bay Cruises has become its biggest problem.
Mr. Kornblum, a 45-year-old engineer who is the company chairman and chief executive, said in an interview yesterday that he welcomed a closer look at his start-up company and would cooperate fully with the Mayor in order to reassure customers. He has said repeatedly that he kept the real business of the company secret because he feared that the giant publicly traded companies in Atlantic City would use their clout and influence and armies of lawyers to stop the company before it got started -- not because there was anything to hide.
"I have no concern about any investigation whatsoever," he said. "We will work with the Mayor and turn over the names of every partner and employee of Bay Cruises."
One of the partners, Clive P. Tilley, the chairman, president and chief executive of Gold Star International, a Florida company that runs the casino on the Bay Cruises boat, also said he welcomed an investigation. Mr. Tilley said that all the casino supervisors on the Bay Cruises boat, called Liberty I, were longtime employees of his from Florida who had passed background checks for criminal records or connections to organized crime.
The dealers, Mr. Tilley said, are temporary workers hired under a subcontract from a Long Island company called Great Neck Games. They will work there until after the holidays, when the company plans to start interviewing, training and doing background checks for the casino workers it hopes to hire from the local area, he said.
Mr. Tilley conceded that his company had not conducted background checks on those interim workers, because they are not technically Gold Star employees. Officials at Great Neck Games could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Kornblum himself is also largely an unknown figure in New York City, even though he has lived all his life in the region and been active as a real estate developer since the mid 1970's. How he brought gambling to Brooklyn is a tale of chance personal introductions -- executives of Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn., played a role in that -- and partly a story of personal misfortune in New York's deep recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, when Mr. Kornblum defaulted on some of his New York buildings and began to look around for new ways to make a living.
His gambling interests have also not been without their troubles. One of the subsidiaries of Gold Star International, which Mr. Kornblum cofounded with Mr. Tilley and several other partners in 1992, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1994, owing about $2.5 million to creditors who had invested in a gambling cruise that ran in 1993 in Galveston, Texas. Mr. Kornblum said that bankruptcy case had been resolved and all of the claims settled.
Mr. Kornblum's style, however, has always been quiet, business associates say, as demonstrated by the kinds of buildings he specialized in in New York: Most have been obscure, existing second-tier commercial properties that Mr. Kornblum would buy and completely renovate from within. That means that for most New Yorkers, his work has been entirely invisible, though in some cases substantial, like the $60 million renovation project he did at 230 Broadway in the 1980's.
He also made it a practice, he said, never to do any deals that required special approvals or zoning changes. That would slow projects down, and he likes to operate, he said, on a 9-to-12-month time line. Avoiding confrontations and drawn out public processes means that he has made little news. His has never been the swaggering, abrasive style of say, a Donald Trump.
"What I've done for the past decade or more, I'm ashamed to say, is we take old spaces and turn them into new spaces, whereby you'll never recognize either the building, or the interior or its prior use when we get finished with it," he said. "This space that we're sitting in used to be a Nathan's Restaurant," he said, gesturing to the Bay Cruises office, with its banks of telephone reservation-takers, who were working under the intermittent clatter of construction tools as workmen installed office doors.
Mr. Kornblum knows what happens when forces turn against him. He defaulted on loans on three or four properties in 1991 and 1992, including a major building at 39th Street and Broadway in the Garment District in Manhattan, when real estate values collapsed. The properties all reverted to ownership by Mr. Kornblum's lenders.
"We leased high and the garment center took a direction south," he said.
The Foxwoods connection arose about that same time. A friend in the senior management at the casino -- owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians -- said he had a friend who was looking to expand into the northeast. That turned out to be Mr. Tilley, and that was the origin of Gold Star International, of which Mr. Kornblum said he is now only a shareholder. The effort to expand into New York, however, was led entirely by Mr. Kornblum, Mr. Tilley said.
"Michael is a land developer par excellence -- he knows better than anyone I've ever met how to mobilize and get a site developed," Mr. Tilley said. "I'm a Brit living in Miami -- what do I know about New York politics?"
Mr. Kornblum's critics, including the City Councilman from Sheepshead Bay and the chairman of the community board, have said that Bay Cruises mobilized without being honest about its intentions. Mr. Kornblum, they say, simply lied to them, with repeated assurances that Bay Cruises would be simply a classy dinner-and-dancing venue.
Mr. Kornblum said the secrecy was necessary because he believed that in the bare-knuckled world he was preparing to enter, "the giant publicly traded gaming companies," based in Atlantic City would have found a way, through legal tactics or politics, to stop him. But he agrees that there was a price to pay.
"I felt for approximately a year and quarter, every day, seven days a week, as though I was a chemist in a white robe in the basement of a building, that I would come out to breathe by going home to my family and sharing with them what I was doing," he said. "But then I had to tell my children that anything that's said at the kitchen table must remain at the kitchen table."

HEADLINE: PERU REBELS FREE 225 HOSTAGES, BUT RETAIN MANY OF HIGH RANK

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Marxist guerrillas occupying the residence of the Japanese Ambassador released 225 of their 365 hostages tonight.
But they stopped short of fulfilling President Alberto K. Fujimori's demand that they release all their captives and lay down their arms in exchange for the chance of free passage out of the compound. 
 The guerrillas did not release their most strategically important captives, including ambassadors of several Latin American countries, five Peruvian generals, two Peruvian Cabinet members and scores of Japanese and Peruvian businessmen.
While the move appeared conciliatory, it also eased the way for the 20 guerrillas to control the hostages remaining. The Red Cross negotiator said just over 140 people were still held.
The development followed a day of negotiations led by the Red Cross official and the Peruvian Education Minister.
Surrounded by heavily armed Peruvian police SWAT teams and an armored car, five buses equipped with stretchers transported the captives away from the compound to a police hospital, where they are to undergo medical examinations.
The darkness of night prevented identification of most of the hostages freed, but they included the Cuban Ambassador, Pedro Diaz Arcia; the Venezuelan Ambassador, Arteaga Acosta, and all of the six middle-ranking United States Government officials who were held. Among the Americans were James Wagner, a political officer; John Riddle, an economic officer, and John Crowe, a senior narcotics agent.
"We're not doing this because we think President Fujimori is governing for the poor," said a statement released by the rebels moments before the release, "but because we respect the Peruvian people." The statement said the release, which began just before 10 P.M., was "a gesture of ours for Christmas."
It was by far the largest discharge of hostages since the rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement staged their daring raid on a diplomatic party given by the Japanese Ambassador on Tuesday and took more than 600 people captive. About 200 women were freed immediately, leaving only male hostages.
The breakthrough stopped far short of an end to the crisis, but it came as a surprise and was broadcast live on Peruvian television. It occurred only hours after Japan's Foreign Minister, Yukihiko Ikeda, returned to Tokyo after his two-day effort to free the hostages had apparently failed. Other mediation efforts by several freed ambassadors -- including those of Greece, Germany, Canada and Egypt -- had collapsed during the week.
Tonight the Education Minister, Domingo Palermo, who negotiated the release with Michel Minnig of the Red Cross, shook the hands of the hostages as they entered the buses. A number of Japanese looked on hoping their relatives would be released. As the first bus drove away, smiling former hostages waved to reporters and residents of the fashionable San Isidro neighborhood.
When the hostages arrived at the hospital, they were greeted by President Fujimori.
An opening may have come when the President made a nationally televised address late Saturday, breaking the silence he had kept for five days. Mr. Fujimori, who kept his strategy to himself and perhaps a few advisers, alternated in his speech between offering an olive branch and condemning terrorism.
"One can't speak of peace nor of an accord while terror is utilized as the principal argument," he said. "However, my Government will not abandon its responsibility to seek a humanitarian exit."
His highly conditioned overture amounted to this: The Government will consider allowing the rebels to leave the compound safely only if they free every captive and lay down their arms. He did not directly address the principal rebel demands: that the Government free some 300 comrades in prison and grant passage to a safe haven deep in the Peruvian Andes.
Mr. Fujimori's offer came in response to a public relations initiative by the rebels on Saturday afternoon trying to demonstrate that they were treating their captive diplomats, generals, cabinet officials and businessmen humanely.
Apparently seeking to add to the pressure that Japan has put on Peru to seek a peaceful settlement, the rebels allowed the Japanese Ambassador and the Peruvian Foreign Minister to use a shortwave radio broadcast to urge Mr. Fujimori to consider the rebels' demands.
But as thousands of Peruvians marched in the streets earlier today calling for a peaceful settlement -- waving Peruvian flags, religious ornaments and even pet doves -- the rebels and the Government both appeared to be preparing for a long standoff. Even as the two sides tried to project flexibility, the rebels refused to compromise on their demands, and the Government refused to restore electricity and telephone service to the compound.
"Each side is trying to see what the other will do next," a Western diplomat monitoring the crisis said hours before the release. "I have the distinct impression that the terrorists thought through the takeover, but perhaps they didn't stop to think what to do next with hundreds of hostages."
What emerged in the last two days was something akin to a high-stakes chess game between Mr. Fujimori and Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, the Tupac Amaru guerrilla commander holding the hostages, with each countering the other with moves that were purposefully ambiguous.
Mr. Fujimori still has overwhelming firepower at his disposal, while the rebels still have in their hands a rich collection of dignitaries.
After years of defeat in the mountains, jungles and cities, Mr. Cerpa stunned the nation with the audacity of his attack on Tuesday night. As one group of rebels infiltrated the party in honor of the Japanese Emperor and served food as waiters, another blasted their way into the compound with dynamite -- all without a single fatality.
The attack made the Peruvian security forces look incompetent, spurred a sell-off on the Peruvian stock market and created tensions between Mr. Fujimori and Japan, an important source of foreign aid and investment.
Using a shortwave radio hookup with Peruvian television on Saturday, Mr. Cerpa introduced Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela, who broke ranks with his Government by urging it to consider the rebel demands "with seriousness and purpose." The policy of the Government is not to negotiate with terrorists, a position strongly endorsed by the powerful military high command.
Then, in an act intended to project conciliation, Mr. Cerpa promised to release many more hostages "who are not tied to the politics of the Government."
For his part, Mr. Fujimori balanced many competing pressures with his sober address.
By finally emerging from his palace refuge, he silenced a growing number of Peruvian critics who had said his silence projected paralysis. His stated willingness to seek a peaceful resolution may have helped damp pressure from Japan to negotiate seriously for the freedom of the hostages, while his refusal to give in to guerrilla demands shored up his standing with the military.

HEADLINE: Peter W. Eccles, 60, an Expert In International Banking, Dies

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Peter W. Eccles, an international investment banker credited with devising a strategy to help companies reduce their financial risk from foreign currency fluctuations, died Dec. 13 at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx.
He was 60 and lived in Irvington, N.Y. His family declined to disclose the cause of death. 
 Mr. Eccles, whose varied career traversed both law and banking, was president of Eccles Associates, an international investment banking firm that he founded in 1990. Its clients include multinational companies and foreign investors.
Mr. Eccles worked as a lawyer at the World Bank and at the New York City law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton in the 1960's. He later joined Goldman, Sachs & Company as a vice president, before moving to Ultrafin International Corporation, where he became a vice president and head of corporate finance.
In the late 1970's, he joined Citicorp, where he held various positions at its headquarters and subsidiaries, including a post in Brazil. While at Citicorp, Mr. Eccles devised the currency swap, which is now widely used to hedge risk in the foreign exchange market.
Mr. Eccles discovered that global companies often had local currency reserves in certain countries that were blocked by exchange controls, in the same way that Citibank's own profits in some countries were blocked at times by government restraints on foreign exchange. So he negotiated an exchange of money between two companies, each of which needed the other's currency.
Walter Wriston, the retired chief executive of Citicorp, called the swap "simple in name and principle but arcane and complex in execution," according to a biography of Mr. Wriston by Phillip L. Zweig. In the book, Mr. Wriston credited Mr. Eccles as being the person most responsible for inventing and introducing the swap, which he said was "the centerpiece of the new product culture, and of investment banking, at Citicorp."
The development of the swap was a landmark in the globalization of Citibank, the biography notes, and over the years it generated hundreds of millions of dollars in earnings.
According to the book, the first swap conducted by Citicorp involved less than $20 million; the transaction, between Corning Glass and a British company, took nearly eight months to complete. Not understanding why the deal was taking so long, Mr. Eccles was reportedly told that the British company feared that Citicorp would take its profits. Mr. Eccles, confident that other, more lucrative swap deals would follow, proposed a quick solution that shocked the British company. "You can have all the profits," he told his colleagues to tell the British. "Just let me close."
Mr. Eccles was born and raised in Lawrence, L.I. He graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth College in 1958 and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He was a Fulbright scholar at Cambridge University in 1958 and 1959, and studied at the Institut de Science Politique in Paris in 1959 and 1960. He graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1963. Mr. Eccles was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
He is survived by his wife, Achla Chib Eccles; a son, Peter Rahul Eccles of New York City; a daughter, Radika Elisabeth Weddle of Johannesburg, South Africa; his father, Wilson Eccles of St. Albans, Queens, and two sisters, Helen Harris of New York City and Barbara Eccles of Charlotte, N.C.
 The obituary also referred incorrectly to Citicorp's first swap transaction, which involved a British company. According to Mr. Zweig's book, it was Mr. Eccles's colleagues in London, not the British company, who were concerned that Mr. Eccles was trying to take the profits from the transaction.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 28, 1996, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Monday about Peter W. Eccles, an international investment banker who had worked for Citicorp, misattributed a comment about the currency swap, a strategy he devised. The comment--that the swap was "simple in name and principle but arcane and complex in execution"--was made by Phillip L. Zweig in his 1995 biography of Walter Wriston, a former chief executive of Citicorp, not by Mr. Wriston.

HEADLINE: The Power of St. Irene's Hand;
Relic Brings Clout and Miracle Seekers to a Queens Church

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
The hand of St. Irene -- or what worshipers believe to be the remains of it -- rests on a bed of red velvet in an engraved silver box carefully balanced atop an altar pedestal in a Greek Orthodox church in Astoria, Queens.
To the untrained eye, it is nothing but a piece of bone immersed in beeswax, and some doubt it is from the saint. But to the legions of faithful who go to see it every Sunday at St. Irene Chrysovalantou Greek Orthodox Cathedral -- a small church that belongs to a splinter branch of Greek orthodoxy -- the hand is a holy relic, a powerful symbol that their beloved saint has followed them to their new home in America not only in spirit but also in body. 
 As for the church, the possession of the hand is a sign that the denomination it belongs to, the Genuine Orthodox Christian Church, is cementing its place in America, 25 years after it ventured out of the Old World and six years after a string of events, fluctuating from miraculous to scandalous, threatened to dislodge it from its niche in the heart of Astoria's Greek community.
Since 1990, the church has been the site of a proclaimed miracle (a weeping icon of St. Irene), a theft (of the same icon, by masked men with guns), another miracle (the return of the icon by mail, though without its jeweled frame), a legal squabble (a $30 million libel suit, since settled, over suggestions that the theft was a hoax), a fraud investigation (now closed, by the Queens District Attorney's office after an insurance company also asserted that the theft had been staged), an ongoing court fight (to get the insurance company to pay for the stolen jewels) and a clerical mess (the defrocking of a priest after it was revealed that he had worked at a brothel in Greece).
The church's zigzagging, from the evening news to police headquarters and from there to New York courtrooms, brought notoriety and recognition to its leaders, but not the kind they craved. The events of the last six years have marred the church's reputation and raised questions about its once low-profile leaders: Are they saints or schemers? Victims or villains?
Now comes the "hand," or what is said to be a piece of the saint's right index finger. Church leaders contend that it is the only known relic from the body of St. Irene, a ninth-century abbess who preferred the austere life of a convent to marriage and whose name is Greek for peace.
"We think she will bring us good things," said Archbishop Paisios Loulourgas, leader of the Genuine Orthodox Christians in America. "We feel blessed and renewed by her presence among us. She will bring us peace."
She will also bring them people, hundreds a week. On some Sundays, busloads of visitors have flocked to the church at 26-07 23d Avenue, where membership stands at 2,000. The hand will be on display every Sunday until Christmas Day, which for this denomination is celebrated on Jan. 7. After that, the priests said, it will be stored in a vault.
The surge of attention and new members represents an important step in building not only the Queens church, the nerve center of the Genuine Orthodox Christians in the United States, but also in strengthening the group's influence among Greek immigrants, who tend to follow Greece's official Greek Orthodox Church. Although overshadowed by the Greek Orthodox Church, which is recognized in Greece's constitution as the state church, the Genuine Orthodox Christians have opened 22 churches in the United States. Six are in New York, two of them in Queens, where the majority of Greek immigrants in this country reside.
Some, like Michael Gamurakas, come to St. Irene's looking for a miracle. On a recent day, he prayed in front of the icon of St. Irene and asked the saint to restore health to his 5-year-old niece.
"St. Irene is my helper," said Mr. Gamurakas, an unemployed 51-year-old Greek immigrant. "I know she will help me now, too.
The fascination with the icon and with the hand is part of Greek culture and religion, observers say.
"Greeks are very religious," said Apostoli Zoupaniotis, editor for community affairs of Proini, a local Greek-language newspaper. "They want to have holy items brought here, things that physically connect them to the saint. It's an extension of the ties between the motherland and the community abroad."
Harry J. Psomiades, director of Greek and Byzantine Studies at Queens College, said the relic serves a more contemporary purpose: clever marketing. Devout Greek Orthodox people, he said, "will go there, anywhere where there is a so-called miracle, a weeping icon, a hand, whatever."
The hand, which was given to the church by monks who had kept it since 1922, was transported from Athens in October by security guards and three bishops. It traveled on Olympic Airways in a first-class cabin, where it was revered by crew and passengers. It arrived in Astoria in a black stretch limousine. Three blocks were closed to traffic near the church, where a huge party awaited. Local officials attended the party, or, as Governor George E. Pataki did, sent letters congratulating the church on its acquisition.
It was a crowning moment for a religious group that for years has struggled to find its place in the modern world, here and in Greece.
The denomination has been at odds with Greece's richer and more powerful Greek Orthodox Church since the early part of the century. The church split in 1924 when leaders adopted the Gregorian calendar commonly used in much of the world. Clinging to the old Julian calendar, which is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar, a group of priests created their own sect.
The Old Calendrists, as they came to be known, founded their first church in the United States a quarter of a century ago. By then, many who had been members in Greece had switched allegiance and were attending services at mainstream Greek Orthodox churches. To lure them back, the church placed extra emphasis on parishioners' needs, feeding the poor, offering child care and establishing senior citizen centers.
"It paid off," Mr. Psomiades said. "They are highly respected and much admired by their people. Their people are poor, but they give the church all they have."
The cathedral of St. Irene gained national notoriety in 1990, on the eve of the Gulf War, when the church said its icon, a 6-by-8 inch painting of the saint, had begun to weep. Church leaders expressed fears of something ominous and they telegraphed President George Bush and other world leaders with a warning: be careful, they said, the world could be on the brink of war. Word of the so-called miracle on 23d Avenue got around. Television cameras followed.
People from all over the country visited the church to ask the saint for a miracle, leaving jewels at its feet. Church leaders arranged the jewels on the gold frame that surrounded the icon.
Then, in December of 1991, four masked and armed thieves walked into the church and, in the presence of two priests and several worshipers, ripped the icon with its jeweled frame from its pedestal. Soon after, the icon came back in the mail, undamaged but without the jewels. The thieves were never found.
By then, the church was embroiled in a controversy that would shortly end up in court. Two local Greek-language newspapers and a spokesman for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, based in Manhattan, questioned whether the theft was staged.
St. Irene sued the Greek Orthodox church and the two newspapers for libel, seeking $30 million in damages. Still, an insurance company, Cigna, refused to pay the $1.2 million the church claimed as the value of the jewels, and instead asked the District Attorney's office to initiate a fraud investigation. That inquiry was later closed for lack of evidence.
Last year, as part of an out-of-court settlement, the newspapers and the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese retracted their previous comments. St. Irene's took Cigna to court, where the dispute still simmers.
In the midst of the legal conflicts, the Genuine Orthodox Church was informed that one of the two priests who had witnessed the theft of the icon, Father Ieronimos Katseas, had once worked in an Athens brothel. He was promptly excommunicated.
The icon of St. Irene, and now the hand, continue to be a magnet for jewels left by congregants. Genuine Orthodox officials said they appraise the jewels every year and periodically sell pieces of lesser value to finance church projects. More expensive pieces, they said, are kept in a vault.
Mr. Psomiades said he doubted that the hand once belonged to St. Irene. He also said he did not believe the icon ever wept.
"On the other hand, some people do believe in miracles," he said. "And if you believe in miracles I suppose anything can be true."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 31, 1996, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 23 about St. Irene Chrysovalantou Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Astoria, Queens, which recently acquired a relic venerated as part of the hand of St. Irene, referred incorrectly to the disposition of a lawsuit filed by the church against two local Greek-language newspapers, which had suggested that the theft of an icon from the church in 1991 may have been a hoax. While one paper printed a retraction as part of a settlement, a judge dismissed the suit against the second paper; they did not both print retractions.

; Chart: "A 'Beautiful Girl' Destined for Sainthood"
Before she was a saint, Irene was "a very beautiful girl of great virtue and the daughter of noble parents" who lived in Cappadocia, a mountainous region in what is now eastern Turkey. In the year 851, she was chosen to marry Michael, the son of Emperor Theophilos and Empress Theodora, supporters of the Orthodox Church. But on her way to the palace for her wedding, Irene met a saint who lived near Olympus. He told her that she was destined to become the abbess of the Convent of Chrysovalantou.
The prophecy soon came true. By the time Irene arrived at the palace, another bride had been chosen. Other noble and rich men proposed marriage to Irene, but she declined.
Giving away all her possessions, Irene entered a convent. She lived on bread and water and prayed all night, every night. In time, she started performing miracles and telling the future of those who sought her wisdom. When she died at age 103, she looked not a day older than when she first entered the abbey.

HEADLINE: Dwarf Mouse's Secret to Long Life Seems to Be Linked to Its Tiny Size

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
WELL into what should have been her dotage, a dwarf mouse with peach-color fur, weighing barely half an ounce and measuring two inches from the tip of her snout to the base of her tail, retained her youthful looks and energy. Her younger, full-size relatives became grizzled and humpbacked, and slowed from scurrying to hobbling, long before she sprouted her first gray hair. She outlived them all.
By the time she finally died last fall, she was four years and two months old, an unheard of age for her species, about twice the life span of a normal mouse. 
 "She was incredibly old," said Dr. Andrzej Bartke, a professor of physiology at the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, in Carbondale. He did not know whether she was the world's oldest mouse, but, he said, "It's certainly a reasonable guess."
The venerable peach mouse was one of a breed of long-lived mutants known as Ames dwarfs, described last month in the journal Nature by a research team led by Dr. Bartke and Dr. Holly M. Brown-Borg, an assistant professor of physiology at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, in Grand Forks. The researchers found that the dwarf mice, which are a third the size of normal ones because they lack growth hormone, generally survive at least a year longer than their normal-size counterparts.
"The difference is huge," Dr. Bartke said. "We're talking about almost half a life span. It's like a person, instead of living 70 years, living 105." Dr. Bartke and Dr. Brown-Borg are trying to find out why the mice live so long, and hoping that the animals will yield new information about aging and its possible links to growth and body size, not only in mice, but in other species as well. "The main interest in these mice is that they're a new model for the extension of life, and there are few models," Dr. Bartke said.
Ames dwarfs were first found in the 1950's in a colony of laboratory mice at the University of Iowa, in Ames. No one knows where they came from. They may have resulted from a spontaneous mutation, Dr. Bartke said, or from a mutation caused by radiation. He said, "I was told the colony in which they were found was at some prior point used for some radiation biology work, but it's hard to know." In any case, the mutation has left them with few or none of the cells in the pituitary gland that would normally secrete growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin, a hormone needed for reproduction and lactation.
Even in old age, their faces retain a pug-nosed, juvenile look, unlike the pointier snouts of their normal relatives, because the lack of thyroid hormone stunts the growth of their facial bones and cartilage. It also makes them less active than normal mice, though, oddly, they seem to become more energetic as they grow older. They show next to no interest in mating, and the females cannot become pregnant without hormone replacement. Unlike normal mice, they do not seem to get cancer. "We've never seen a dwarf mouse with a tumor," Dr. Brown-Borg said.
Among mammal species, with some exceptions (notably small, long-lived bats and large, short-lived marsupials), big species with slow metabolisms, like elephants, live longer than small ones with fast metabolisms, like mice. But, as the mice show, size and longevity within a species may follow a different pattern.
In dogs, for instance, large size is often a disadvantage: breeds with the biggest frames, Irish wolfhounds and Great Danes, live only six or seven years, while Chihuahuas and toy poodles often live twice as long. Smaller breeds of horses also tend to outlast larger ones. Biologists are not sure why.
"We're looking at a phenomenon, and we don't have an answer," said Dr. Norman Wolf, a pathologist at the University of Washington, in Seattle, who has studied life span in dogs and various strains of mice. "Finding the mechanism is the next step. It's what we're after in attempts to extend the useful life span."
He and his colleagues have already shown that skin cells taken from large dogs cannot grow and divide as many times as those from small dogs, a standard sign of aging and reduced life expectancy. Now, Dr. Wolf is trying to determine whether it is the large animals' high level of growth hormone and other growth factors that somehow diminishes the ability of their cells to reproduce, and shortens the dogs' lives.
"Within a species, our concept is that evolution sets a life span for that species, which occurs over millennia," he said. "When you vary things within the species, such as essential hormone flows, you begin to affect life span."
Like Dr. Wolf, Dr. Bartke and Dr. Brown-Borg think growth hormone plays some role in aging, and they suspect that the lack of it may account for the longevity of the Ames dwarfs. They offered several pieces of evidence for that idea. One is that people with untreated acromegaly or gigantism, pituitary disorders that cause overproduction of growth hormone, tend to die young.
In addition, mice at the opposite end of the spectrum from the dwarfs -- giant "supermice," which become twice the size of normal animals because they have been genetically engineered to produce high levels of growth hormone -- age prematurely and live only 8 or 9 months, just half as long as a normal mouse.
Their rapid aging and early death may be due to the buildup in their bodies of molecules known as free radicals, said Dr. C. David Rollo, a biologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. "The free-radical theory is a really big theory of aging nowadays," Dr. Rollo said. "It suggests that your own basic metabolism generates molecules that can damage proteins, DNA and fats, and that's the cause of aging."
In a paper published last summer in The Canadian Journal of Zoology, Dr. Rollo and other scientists showed that the supermice had free-radical levels, and tissue damage, two to four times above normal. Statistical analyses also showed a link between the high levels of free radicals and the animals' reduced life spans. "It was a nice test of the free-radical theory," Dr. Rollo said.
His findings also tied in with results on the only method researchers have ever found to increase life span in mice and rats: restricting the animals' calorie intake to 60 or 70 percent of normal. Rodents kept on such meager diets live twice as long as animals allowed to eat as much as they want. The reason is not known, but researchers think that one factor may be that animals that eat less generate fewer free radicals and may also produce higher levels of the enzymes needed to get rid of them. Those animals also secrete less growth hormone.
Dr. Bartke and Dr. Brown-Borg have planned further studies of the dwarf mice, to measure their metabolism and their levels of free radicals, as well as enzymes that eliminate the harmful molecules. They also hope to determine whether giving the dwarfs growth hormone accelerates their aging and shortens their lives. "But I wouldn't be surprised if growth hormone turned out not to be the whole picture," Dr. Bartke said, noting that the animals lacked other hormones as well.
Although the researchers hope to elucidate mechanisms of aging that might shed light on the process in people, they do not think their findings about size and life span apply directly to humans. Although some surveys of height and longevity might seem to suggest that shorter people live longer than taller ones, most researchers dismiss them as unscientific, pointing out that during the past few decades, both longevity and average height have increased.
"The human data show only very small differences in life span, and they are complicated by genetic differences, smoking, drinking, drugs, economic factors -- all the things that always complicate human data," Dr. Bartke said. "If you want to find mechanisms, the advantage with mice is that they don't smoke or drink. They eat the same food, and live in the same cage at the same temperature. Some are normal, and some are dwarf. Everything else, we can control."
Despite the evidence in mice of the harmful effects of excess growth hormone, Dr. Bartke also said such findings should not raise alarms about medical uses of the hormone that are now considered legitimate, which include treatment for people who are deficient in the hormone and for some patients who have lost large amounts of weight as a result of AIDS and other illnesses. The doses given are small compared with the levels in the supermice. And although too much growth hormone is clearly harmful in humans, so is too little.
"But I do think illicit use by athletes and body builders, where they take a lot of the hormone, could become a concern," Dr. Bartke said. "Prolonged treatment with large doses should be looked at very carefully for side effects, including shortening of life span."

HEADLINE: Incomes and Spending Both Rise by 0.5%

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Americans' incomes and spending both posted healthy increases in November, providing a strong start to the holiday shopping season.
The Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose half a percent last month, a solid rebound after no gain at all in October, while consumer spending was also up by half a percent. 
 The spending increase followed a seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in October. Consumer spending is critical to the economy's health because it accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.
Analysts said the consumer spending report plus more recent information on December sales showed that retailers would enjoy a good Christmas if not quite as good as had been expected. Sales are expected to rise modestly from last year's weak level.
Cheryl Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said that high consumer debt burdens and an expected slowing in employment gains would depress consumer spending in 1997, but that growth would still be sufficient to keep the gross domestic product rising at around the 2.3 percent rate expected for all of 1996.
For November, wages and salaries, the largest part of incomes, were climbing at an annual rate of $22.5 billion, after having fallen by $4.9 billion in October. In November, the number of people employed, the average number of hours worked and average hourly earnings all showed increases.
The big increase in personal consumption spending reflected strength in purchases of services, which analysts attributed to a big jump in utility bills because of unusually cold weather.
But Americans' disposable income, the amount left after paying taxes, was also up in November, gaining half a percent after a one-tenth of 1 percent gain in October. These figures do not take inflation into account. After adjusting for inflation, disposable income rose three-tenths of 1 percent in November after declining two-tenths of 1 percent in October.
After inflation adjustments, consumer spending was up three-tenths of a percent in November after an increase of four-tenths of a percent in October.
Americans' personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, held steady at 5 percent in November, the same as in October.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
In expanding its luxury appeal to a mass market, Tiffany tries television for the first time.

BYLINE: By Dana Canedy 

 BODY:
TIFFANY & COMPANY is advertising on television for the first time in the company's history in a tricky attempt to expand its consumer appeal without compromising its prestigious image.
The idea is to bring in customers who may not be able to afford the $1.8 million strand of Tiffany South Sea pearls but who could spring for, say, a $40 key chain. 
 The commercial, which has been running this holiday shopping season only in the metropolitan New York market, is titled "Vows" and was created by the McCann-Erickson unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York. The spot is broadcast during local station breaks on prime-time network programs like "E.R.," "Monday Night Football" and "Seinfeld." Both Tiffany and McCann declined to discuss the budget for the spot.
In the commercial, a beaming bride leaving a church has her hand resting against the car window, her Tiffany's engagement ring prominently in view. An announcer says, "To the vows we make." The camera then turns to a college graduate leaving his commencement ceremony with his proud parents as the narrator says, "To the roads we take." There are other snapshots of significant life events -- a couple celebrating an anniversary, a child meeting her newborn sibling -- and ends with a close-up of the trademark robin's-egg-blue Tiffany's box as the narrator concludes, "And the stops along the way."
"We've been thinking about TV for a couple of years," said Diana Lyne, senior vice president of marketing. "We have four stores in New York so it made sense in this market." The company will decide in the next few weeks whether the test spot, which began running in October and will continue through this month, will be expanded to other markets.
The images are meant to evoke universal sentiments. "Those things cross all boundaries and classes," Ms. Lyne said. "Hopefully the message will appeal to everyone."

 Tiffany's "something for everyone" approach is the company's attempt to lure consumers with disposable income who may consider the retailer and its gems and trinkets too snooty for their tastes and too costly for their wallets.
"What we're trying to do here is talk to people who should be coming to their stores but aren't," said Ted Pettus, creative director at McCann-Erickson. "They have things for all price points and there is nothing snooty or elitist about them."
Indeed, there is incentive for upscale retailers in general to go easy on marketing for snob appeal. Consumers of varying net worths are spending these days on apparel brand names like Tommy Hilfiger, designer label goods like Gucci and classic retailers known for quality and tradition like Tiffany's.
The approach is building on Tiffany's increased sales in recent years. Barbara Miller, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, said: "When the recession occurred in '90 and '91 their sales trends were not as strong. They had an economic downturn in their key markets. What they did in those less robust periods was reach out and begin creating a better marketing campaign.
"They positioned themselves to better capitalize on an improved economy. What happened to them was, to a large extent, extremely driven by the economy. They took the reins to improve themselves and came out of the economically depressed period as a stronger company."
In trying to tap the less-affluent market, though, Tiffany's has chosen a marketing approach that is risky for any upscale retailer whose image is as much a selling point as its earrings and bracelets.

 "They are kind of playing a very delicate game right now," said Jeanne Hanley, principal of Capital Reflections in North Granby, Conn., a firm that tracks consumer and industry trends. "They have to address the lower-end market but not necessarily take away their prestige." So far, though, the approach seems to be working, she said.
Ms. Hanley noted, for instance, that for several years a series of print ads have run in national newspapers and magazines providing a number to call for free brochures and video guides on how to shop for a diamond or strand of pearls. Another print ad notes that Tiffany's platinum engagement rings start at $850 and that the retailer has wedding bands for $280.
"I think the perception always had been that you had to be very wealthy to be able to afford an engagement ring at Tiffany's," Ms. Lyne, the Tiffany executive, said.
By marketing itself as the authority on gems, Tiffany's was able to play up its image as an exclusive retailer while attracting consumers who might have otherwise been intimidated walking into its boutiques. The "Vows" commercial is an attempt to push that effort further.
"It's all part of a strategy to increase their accessibility," Ms. Hanley noted. "I think what they are doing is playing on their strengths in their mass-market approach."

HEADLINE: Fitter Yeltsin Back to Work, Facing a Host Of Problems

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Appearing noticeably thinner and fitter, President Boris N. Yeltsin returned to work in the Kremlin today, seven weeks after heart bypass surgery, and declared that he was "ready for battle."
At what was effectively the start of his second term, Mr. Yeltsin spoke only briefly as he stepped from his car, showing little of the energy that won him re-election last July. 
 "I am in good spirits," Mr. Yeltsin, 65, said. "I feel well."
Wrapped up against the frigid temperature, he said his priorities would include wage and pension arrears and military reform. Asked whether life would get better for Russians in the year ahead, he replied simply: "Absolutely, absolutely."
It could hardly get worse.
Social problems have intensified since Mr. Yeltsin dropped from sight nearly six months ago, just days before his re-election victory on July 3. He was later reported to have suffered a heart attack.
Official data issued today showed that gross domestic product had dropped another 6 percent in 1996, confounding more optimistic forecasts made at the start of the year.
Millions of state and private-sector workers have not been paid for months, leaving much of the population on the bread line and provoking sporadic strikes across the country, especially among coal miners and schoolteachers.
Mr. Yeltsin's more pressing domestic business includes a round of elections for regional governors and next month's voting in Chechnya, where new violence is threatening a fragile cease-fire.
Discreet jockeying for position among Kremlin aides broke into open conflict after Mr. Yeltin, clearly very ill, went on television in early September to say that only surgery could spare him from a twilight existence of chronic heart problems.
Shortly before the Nov. 5 quintuple bypass surgery, Mr. Yeltsin had to dismiss his security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, after charges of plots and counterplots to augment his trusted aide's power.
Today the President met with his chief of staff, Anatoly Chubais, to review political matters. He also spoke with Prime Minister John Major of Britain by telephone and invited him to Russia next year. The President already has plans to meet with leaders from the United States, Germany and France. Mr. Yeltsin is to meet with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Tuesday.
Michael DeBakey, the leading American heart specialist who advised Russian doctors on Mr. Yeltsin's operation, told BBC radio today that the President would have no trouble resuming a normal eight-hour workday, although it would be another month or so before he was back to full health.
Dr. DeBakey voiced some concern that the Russian habit of repeated toasts during celebratory meals was a recipe for trouble, but said an occasional drink would do no harm to the President, whose fondness for alcohol has caused him problems in the past.

HEADLINE: St. Louis Bank Acquiring Rival For $1 Billion

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Mercantile Bancorporation Inc. announced yesterday that it would acquire a rival, Roosevelt Financial Group Inc., for $1.07 billion in stock and cash. The move strengthens its position in the Midwest, but makes it a more attractive takeover target in a swiftly consolidating industry.
The purchase would allow Mercantile, which is based in St. Louis, to move ahead of Boatmen's Bancshares as Missouri's biggest bank and give it a hefty market share in Kansas, Iowa and Illinois. It would be the third recent acquisition for Mercantile, which has felt pressure from Nationsbank, a national powerhouse that announced plans earlier this year to buy Boatmen's for $9.5 billion. 
 "It looks like a win-win for both sets of shareholders," Joseph Roberto, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said. "By creating a $30 billion institution and the No. 1 independent bank in Missouri, Mercantile has an opportunity to survive as an independent, in the short term. But it also makes them more attractive to outside buyers who may have been frustrated in the Nationsbank-Boatmen bidding."
Commercial banking has been one of the industries to witness the most consolidation since the merger boom began in 1993. Banking ranked No. 1 last year with $66 billion in deals, but is at No. 8 so far this year with $22.4 billion in activity, according to the Securities Data Company.
Many analysts say that the boom is far from over, and that Mercantile's sizable market share gives it particular allure, even as it becomes the ninth-largest bank in the Midwest.
First Bank System Inc. and the Norwest Corporation, both of Minneapolis, and the First Chicago NBD Corporation are clearly on the prowl for potential acquisitions like Mercantile, analysts say. And chief executives at Nationsbank, the BankAmerica Corporation and the Banc One Corporation are all intent on establishing the first coast-to-coast banking operation by acquiring smaller banks.
"There's already been a lot of merger activity and it's going to continue," Michael Ancell, a banking analyst with Edward Jones, said. "We're headed for some large banking company having a true national presence."
Investors sent Roosevelt shares up $2.3906, to $20.5156, on the Nasdaq yesterday, while Mercantile stock dropped $1, to $49.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Roosevelt, also based in St. Louis, is a leading mortgage originator in Missouri. It has 81 offices and was in the process of transforming itself into a commercial bank. The combined institution will have 23 percent of the state's deposits and will be the largest bank in St. Louis.
Mercantile said it would pay up to 13 million shares of its common stock and make up the rest by paying $22 in cash for each of Roosevelt's shares. The company is proposing to use about seven million Mercantile shares it plans to purchase on the open market.
The deal, which is structured as a tax-free exchange for shareholders getting stock, is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.
Stanley J. Bradshaw, chairman of Roosevelt, will head the combined mortgage operations and report to Thomas H. Jacobsen, chairman of Mercantile.
Mercantile said the deal should result in cost savings amounting to more than a third of Roosevelt's noninterest expenses by 1999, much of it coming from the planned closing of 50 branch offices in overlapping markets. The banks declined to say how many employees would be affected by the cuts, but the deal is expected to worsen unemployment problems in St. Louis, which has seen a wave of corporate mergers.
"Roosevelt shareholders are getting an early Christmas present, but employees may feel like the Grinch swept in," Michael Ancell, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis, said. "The St. Louis employment market has been pretty hard hit."
Among recent mergers in the St. Louis market, the Boeing Company recently announced its plan to acquire the McDonnell Douglas Corporation of St. Louis for $14 billion, while Nationsbank plucked Boatmen's and Monsanto announced plans to sell off its chemical division. Mercantile's recent acquisitions were a $820 million purchase of Mark Twain Bancshares Inc. earlier this year, and a $41 million acquisition of Regional Bancshares of Illinois.
Despite the changes, a Mercantile executive said that local businesses had been able to absorb the workers laid off.
"The economy is pretty resilient," John Beirise, group president at Mercantile, said. "It's not the Fortune 500 that're creating the jobs so much as the midsized companies that continue to grow and offer employment to people displaced by larger corporations."

HEADLINE: Few Forints to Spend, but Hungarians Like the Mall

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
Diana Galli had already bought several toys and a knock-off Walkman, and now she contemplated an elegant display of tableware in the first American-style shopping mall in Central Europe.
"The prices are very reasonable, the atmosphere is very pretty, and it feels just like the United States," said Mrs. Galli, a 32-year-old housewife, as she debated color coordination with her mother and whether to add to the $130 they had already spent on Christmas. 
 When real estate developers and retailers opened the Polus Center on the outskirts of Budapest in November, they knew they had to transplant the authentic ambiance of an American mall.
In some ways, they outdid themselves. An entertainment center called Western City combines cowboy sculptures, and potted palms evoking Florida. The food court would thrill any junk food maven, with shoulder-to-shoulder Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's and Pizza Hut. A six-theater cineplex is showing Sylvester Stallone's latest.
But the developers also understood that prices, as Mrs. Galli's budget showed, would be the ultimate test. With an average monthly wage of $465, Hungarian purchasing power is limited.
Yet not so limited, argued Sandor Demjan, the main Hungarian investor in the Polus Center, that a mall wouldn't take off. Historically, Hungarians are known as trend-setters willing to latch onto anything new. And besides, Mr. Demjan knew the sizable black market -- about 30 percent of the economy, according to the World Bank -- disguised real spending power.
"No one was a believer," said Mr. Demjan, who has converted himself from the longtime king of retailing under the Communists to the king of retailing in Hungary's market economy. "Everyone in Western Europe would say: 'O.K. what's the purchasing power? The truth is very simple. There are plenty of bad shops. If a good shop enters the market, the customers have their interests at heart and go where it is best for them."
After acquiring a former Soviet Army base on the outskirts of Budapest for the mall, Mr. Demjan offered a partnership to the Trizec Hahn Corporation of Toronto, one of the biggest real estate companies specializing in retail centers and office towers in the United States. Headed by Peter Munk, an emigre Hungarian who fled Budapest in 1944 and has made a fortune in gold mining, the newly formed Trizec Hahn has invested $5 million in the mall, according to the company's president, Greg Wilkins.
The investment was tiny by the company's standards, Mr. Wilkins said. But it is seen as the pilot for a string of shopping malls and other real estate projects Trizec Hahn plans in Central Europe, he said. A second mall is planned in 1997 adjacent to the main rail station in downtown Budapest, he said.
Despite the low consumer purchasing power in Hungary, the "trend line is very good," he said. Today, the average Hungarian salary earner might spend about half his pay on a suit but purchasing will grow steadily, forecasts show.
Central Europe was attractive for other reasons, too. Chief among them was the lack of Western-style retailing. With well-connected local partners like Mr. Demjan who knew how to blast through the bureaucracy, the development process could be completed relatively quickly with deals on land, construction and financing, Mr. Wilkins said. With Mr. Demjan's pull, the Polus Center went up in 18 months, a happy contrast to the average of seven years it takes to open a mall in the United States, Mr. Wilkins said.
As a former Communist Party businessman Mr. Demjan is particularly well connected. He ran cooperative retail shops during the hardline Communist era in the 1960's and then, with the Communist Party's blessing, opened the state-owned Skala chain of department stores in 1974. He received the exclusive license to import Taiwan-made electronics in the 1980's. In 1986 he was chosen by the Communists to head the largest Hungarian commercial bank, Hungarian Credit, which had to be rescued from insolvency after the collapse of the Communists in 1989.
The mall's flagship store is Tesco, the largest British supermarket chain. Tesco opened a hypermarket selling food and clothing at low prices, with special offers on everything from diapers to potatoes, toilet paper to milk.
Although Tesco has not pulled in the $500,000 daily revenue that Mr. Demjan boasted about in an interview, it has been performing 50 percent better than expected, with an average daily turnover of $167,000, according to Charles Hardwick, the marketing director in Hungary. Already, the store ranks in the top 5 percent of the company's 750 stores worldwide, he said.
"We're getting about 12,000 customers a day," Mr. Hardwick said. "Of course they have less disposable income, but they're buying."
But what they buy is a bit different. Bananas, for example. "In one week, we sold more bananas than any of our stores anywhere," he said. Hungarian banana lovers snapped up 1,600 cases at 117 forints, or 73 cents, a kilo, or 2.2 pounds. Crusty rolls sold like the proverbial hot cakes: 210,000 in the first week. Customers oohed and aahed at the bakery counter as they lifted pastries warm from the oven, cradled them in their palms, showed them around and marveled at the freshness.
Inexpensive clothing, like $30 shell jackets made in Indonesia and $50 hiking boots made in China, were also moving.
"We're beginning to think the only mistake we made was not building a bigger store," Mr. Hardwick said.
But for the small Hungarian retailers with less experience and less capital the first month at the mall has not been so marvelous.
Mr. Demjan, who says he understands the Hungarian shopper better than anyone, believed that a florist should be the first store inside the mall entrance. "Hungarians buy more flowers per capita than anywhere else," he said with his flair for the grand statement.
But so far he has been wrong. "People are not looking for flowers when they come here," the propietor said as she cared for some wilting specimens. "And it is too hot here for the flowers. In one month we haven't been able to make our rent." Similarly, at the Infosztrada Studio, a well-fitted store filled with electronics, sales of television sets were 75 percent below expectations, the manager said. Too many people were browsers, not buyers, he said.
But if mall shopping is about atmospherics, Polus Center appears to be a winner.
"We love it," said Istvan Kurtej, 25, with his girlfriend, Orsolya Kamaras, 19, as they peered into the twinkling lights of a jewelry store window on one of their many dates here. "We've been here maybe 15 to 20 times. I like this kind of shopping -- it's more comfortable than walking several miles downtown."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long Bond Rises on Poll Of Consumers

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were up yesterday, after a consumer sentiment report suggested expectations about the economy were waning, a development that is market-friendly since it suggests the Fed will not need to push up interest rates to fight inflation.
The data indicated that people would not necessarily be spending more in the months ahead. 
 The 30-year bond rose 7/32 in lighter-than-normal volume, to a price of 98 30/21 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, slipped to 6.58 percent, from 6.60 percent on Friday.
The PSA, the Bond Market Trade Association, which represents the securities firms and banks selling and trading debt securities, has recommended that the bond market close early today at 2 P.M. All domestic financial markets will be closed tomorrow for the Christmas holiday and will reopen on Thursday.
The revised and final University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for December fell to 96.9 from the 99.2 reported in November. The current conditions component fell to 104.9 from 107.5, while the expectations component dropped to 91.8, from 93.9 in November.
Traders said prices were little changed after November's report on personal income and spending failed to alter expectations for inflation, which remains benign. The Commerce Department report showed income up half a percent, less than the six-tenths of 1 percent that economists had expected; spending increased by the same amount, and that was more than the three-tenths of a percent that had been expected.
Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager of the Private Bank, at the Bank of Boston, called it a very quiet day. "Looking at the personal income and spending report, it demonstrated to me that consumers spent everything they made last month," he said. "Now what does that say about future spending?"
He said the market's tone was better at the opening after digesting Friday's retail sales results, which were deemed simply satisfactory by one of the larger retailers. "So you're looking at low to midrange single-digit increases in same-store results," Mr. Ablin said. "It's not anything the bond market will be alarmed about." Adding that the big concern the market had about retail sales for the holiday was probably unfounded, he said, "Rates should moderate and stay confined to a narrow trading range until more data become available next month."
Dave Shabelman, an analyst with MMS International, San Francisco, said, "Although Treasuries rallied on softer-than-expected economic data and a good five-year note auction last Thursday, the negative sentiment that kept the market submerged over the previous two weeks was only negated, not reversed." He suspects the market will still be vulnerable to further profit taking ahead of the end of the year and trade sideways at best as it seeks to find a new trading range.
The results of yesterday's bill auction were mixed, with bids for the three-month bill particularly weak. The average rate at auction for the three-month issue was 4.92 percent, sharply higher than the 4.76 percent last week, while the rate for the six-month bills was 5.08 percent, only mildly higher than the 4.99 percent from a week ago on better demand.
Elsewhere, after much ballyhoo, the Treasury announced yesterday that it was postponing its first auction of inflation-indexed 10-year notes, which had tentatively been set for early January. Roger Anderson, Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary for Finance, said that more time was needed to complete the final terms and conditions for the securities and to allow investment firms to review the plans. He declined to say just how long the delay would be.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	Average Price	98.756	97.432	Discounted Rate	4.92%	5.08%	Coupon Yield	5.05%	5.29%	High Price	98.766	97.442	Discounted Rate	4.88%	5.06%	Coupon Yield	5.01%	5.26%	Low Price	98.754	97.432	Discounted Rate	4.93%	5.08%	Coupon Yield	5.06%	5.29%	Accepted at low price	3%	40%	Total applied for	$36,854,814	$45,578,901	Accepted	$13,008,114	$13,073,003	Noncompetitive	$1,310,148	$1,043,881	

Both issues are dated Dec. 26, 1996. The three-month bills mature on March 27, 1997, and the six-month bills mature on June 26, 1997.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Roads Rated Best in Region

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Connecticut motorists pay the highest gas tax in the nation but get what they pay for: the best road system in the Northeast, a nonpartisan research group says.
The tax over the last 11 years has paid for a $13 billion overhaul of the state's transportation network. 
 The result is roads and bridges that are in better shape, according to Federal surveys, than anywhere else in the Northeast, the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council reported Tuesday.
"The bottom line is that we've spent a lot of money, but we got something for it," said Michael Levin, the group's president.
The tax is 38 cents a gallon and will rise to 39 cents in January.
In Connecticut, 43 percent of state highways are rated in fair or poor condition, compared with 59 percent in New York, 60 percent in Maine, 73 percent in New Hampshire, 79 percent in Massachusetts, 80 percent in Vermont and 83 percent in Rhode Island.

HEADLINE: NO PROGRESS SEEN IN PERUVIAN TALKS ON 140 HOSTAGES

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Dec. 23

 BODY:
After a night of joy over the release of 225 hostages, a cloud of fear hung heavy today over the Japanese Ambassador's residence here as negotiations between the Government and Marxist guerrillas failed to liberate the 140 captives who remained inside.
Hundreds of stern-faced soldiers with automatic weapons and dozens of ambulances and medics stood ready outside the compound in response to renewed threats by the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru rebels to kill the remaining hostages if the Government does not release their jailed comrades. 
 The tension increased when the Red Cross intermediary reported that there had been no change in the negotiating positions, which remained far apart, suggesting that the impasse could still end in violence or continue for weeks.
"If one side doesn't budge soon, I'm afraid this situation could drag on through New Year's," said a Western Ambassador, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "At this point, neither party is under pressure, and they may try to wait each other out."
Hopes were raised high Sunday night that the crisis could soon be resolved after the rebels released 225 hostages in what they called a "Christmas gesture."
Among those released were hostages whose Governments could have exerted pressure on Peru to shape its stance in the negotiations. Seven United States Embassy officials were among those released.
In Washington, the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said President Clinton welcomed the release of the Americans but called for the immediate release of the remaining hostages.
The State Department said in a statement, "Our sense of relief on their release is tempered by the fact that over 100 individuals continue to be held."
The United States had encouraged Mr. Fujimori not to give in to the guerrillas' demands and reportedly sent a force of advisers and military commandos to help the Peruvians.
But neither the guerrillas, who are demanding freedom and safe passage for hundreds of jailed rebels, nor President Alberto K. Fujimori, who has offered only that the hostage-takers will have safe passage if they give up, appeared to change their stance.
Michel Minnig, a Red Cross official who is serving as the main intermediary, made his daily shuttle between the Presidential Palace and the Japanese compound, but he said nothing to the throngs of journalists outside.
Many foreign diplomats and former hostages suggested that the impasse could continue for weeks, especially since the rebels had reduced the number of hostages to a manageable size.
Since capturing 600 international dignitaries at the Japanese residence on Dec. 17, the rebels have released about 460 hostages, including the elderly, sick, women, foreign businessmen and others who have no connection with the Peruvian Government or importance to the rebels.
By setting a majority of the hostages free, the rebels have apparently sought to increase pressure on Mr. Fujimori to negotiate and to relieve their burden of managing hundreds of people in a residence that was intended for a single family and that has not had running water, electricity or telephone service since the Government cut the services on Thursday.
The United States Embassy identified the freed Americans as James Wagner, embassy political officer; John Riddle, economic officer; John Crowe, anti-drug officer, and Donald Boyd, David Bayer, Mike Maxey and Kris Merschrod, officials of the United States Agency for International Development.
A spokesman for the embassy said the freed Americans would not be allowed to speak with reporters today. But Canadian businessmen who were released from the residence on Sunday night said that they had not been mistreated by their 20 guerrilla captors, whom they described as well disciplined.
"The worst thing was leaving behind the other hostages," said Hubert Zandstra, a Canadian who is president of the International Potato Center, a research center based in Lima.
The guerrillas continue to hold important hostages, a factor that could prove useful to them in future negotiations. They include senior Peruvian political and military officials, Japanese businessmen and the Ambassadors from Japan, Malaysia, Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay.
Mr. Fujimori's former wife, Susana Higuchi, confirmed rumors that the President's younger brother, Pedro, was among those being held. Mr. Fujimori's mother and sister were released on Dec. 17 with other women held in the compound.
There is widespread speculation that the Tupac Amaru rebels will seek large ransoms from Japanese and Malaysian companies whose employees are under their control. In the past, the guerrillas have received tens of millions of dollars by kidnapping Peruvian and foreign businessmen.
It is unclear why the rebels continue to hold several Latin American ambassadors, but some analysts speculated that the guerrillas may try to gain the freedom of other left-wing rebels who are imprisoned in those countries.
For his part, Mr. Fujimori has stood firm in his position that he will not negotiate with rebel groups, which came close to taking control of Peru until Mr. Fujimori conducted an aggressive offensive in 1992 that led to the capture of most rebel leaders and a dramatic decline in their activity.
Indeed, the President had not even spoken publicly about the attack on the Japanese Ambassador's residence until late Saturday night, when he delivered a nationally televised address, offering the rebels safe passage if they laid down their arms and released all captives.
Despite pleas from the hostages and rebels, Mr. Fujimori has refused to restore electricity, potable water and telephone services to the residence, where freed hostages said conditions were very cramped and difficult. But the Government has permitted the delivery of food, water and medical supplies.
Mr. Fujimori's Government has also refused to speak directly with the rebels and is relying on intermediaries like the Red Cross representative. But the President is being lobbied heavily by the Japanese Government and business leaders to resolve the crisis in a nonviolent way.
"Part of the complexity of this crisis is that there are multiple negotiations taking place at the same time and that can lead to dangerous miscalculations," said David Scott Palmer, a political science professor who specializes in Latin America at Boston University. "But different negotiating routes also increase the chances of compromise."
One such compromise being floated in diplomatic circles is an arrangement in which the Japanese Government would exercise its sovereignty over the residence and would agree to transport the rebels to a safe country if they free the hostages.
Perhaps the most difficult issue to resolve is that of whether to release jailed guerrillas -- a move that many experts on rebel movements say Mr. Fujimori has rejected because it would symbolize a Government retreat on the issue.

HEADLINE: The Sudan's Islamic Leader: Enigmatic Foe for the West

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan

 BODY:
Hassan al-Turabi sits in his office overlooking the Nile, talking at the speed of sound, weaving great mosques and minarets of words in the air.
His eyes gleaming beneath his ivory turban, the most powerful man in the Sudan -- Africa's largest nation in area and one of the world's poorest -- leaned forward to confide a secret. "We are a rich country," he said. "One of the richest countries on earth." 
 The harsh truth is that the Sudan is broke, its currency all but worthless, its treasury drained by an endless civil war between the Sudan's north and south, its Government under intense pressure from the United States to change its ways.
But Mr. Turabi's economic analysis fits his image of himself and his nation. He sees himself as Islam's Grand Vizier and the Sudan as a million-square-mile Holy City. In turn, some in the United States Government see him as the Khomeini of Khartoum and the Sudan as the world's biggest terrorist training camp.
Mr. Turabi is Speaker of the Sudan's National Assembly and leader of its National Islamic Front, which commandeered the nation in 1989 and remains its only real political party. In fact, he voices a tolerant version of political Islam -- far less conservative than Saudi Arabia's, far less militant than Iran's.
But his big dreams and eccentric schemes have landed the Sudan on the United States' list of terrorist states, enraged all nine of the Sudan's African neighbors and sparked threats of war from Cairo to Kampala, and from Asmara to Addis Ababa.
The big issue for the United States is that the Sudan has served as a safe house for stateless revolutionaries. American officials have no hard proof that the Sudan still provides training centers for international terrorists. But in their eyes, the Sudan stands convicted of abetting the attempted assassination last year of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Ethiopia, the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 and a foiled plot to blow up the United Nations.
"Sudan cannot move into the future unless it comes to terms with what it's done," said Timothy Carney, the United States Ambassador to the Sudan. "It has to satisfy Ethiopia and Egypt over the issue of the assassination and over Sudan's policy of the expansion of political Islam by force."
The United States is searching for the right combination of political, economic, diplomatic and indirect military pressure to compel Mr. Turabi to change his behavior without touching off new fighting or adding to the misery of the Sudanese people. No one in Washington is very optimistic about finding that magic formula.
For Mr. Turabi's opponents in the Sudan, the issue is the 40-year civil war. The North is a desert land, culturally and politically Arabic and Islamic. The South is a huge savannah, home to hundreds of tribes -- mostly animist, some Christian, often mutually hostile.
They are one nation only on paper -- "a line on the map drawn by Europeans," as Mr. Turabi puts it.
But neither politics nor war have united Sudan since independence in 1956. More than a million Sudanese are thought to have died in the fighting. The southern rebels dream of their own nation but have little chance of military victory.
For Mr. Turabi's African neighbors, the issue is the threat of a wider war. Thousands of rebels from the southern Sudan are based in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, three nations that would not mind terribly if Mr. Turabi disappeared tomorrow. This month, those nations are taking delivery of $20 million of nonlethal military equipment from the United States -- trucks, uniforms, radios, but no guns. Some of that equipment, despite the denials of American diplomats, is likely to find its way discreetly into the hands of the Sudanese rebels, according to other American officials.
The delivery of the military equipment shook the Sudanese Government, which was probably the intended effect. But now rumors of war flit daily among the military and intelligence branches of the National Islamic Front, and there is talk of opening up an eastern front against Eritrea or Ethiopia. And for Mr. Turabi, the biggest issue has become the United States' indirect support for his enemies. He talks about striking back, indirectly.
The calculatingly charming Mr. Turabi talks nonstop, his silvery tongue and twitching fingers shaping oddly illogical arabesques. A 65-year-old lawyer educated in London and Paris, he has been seeking and using power secretly for 30 years. His typically Sudanese resume includes a seven-year prison sentence imposed by a pro-American dictator who later made him Attorney General.
Until this year, he held no official position in the present government, but always held more power than the President, ruling through shadow security forces, secret cells created by the National Islamic Front. He has traveled throughout most of the United States, and thinks he knows it far better than it knows him.
He said the United States' attitude is: " 'Let us isolate the Sudan, let us finance everybody against the Sudan, let us hurl new charges against the Sudan of terrorism.' "
He added: "Looking for an enemy isn't right. That spirit is very contagious. Don't provoke a Sudanese. If you try to attack him, oh, he will counterattack. I don't want all Sudanese to view America as the devil, as the enemy, as a target. Because this will also spread worldwide. And this will create trouble inside the United States."
On its face, the confrontation between the United States and the Sudan looks impossible to resolve. Under the surface, things are more subtle.
During the cold war, the United States spent $15 billion buying or renting the allegiances of Sudanese governments. Back then, Mr. Turabi and his National Islamic Front would have been prime targets for a coup plotted by the Central Intelligence Agency or a secret operation running guns and money to the rebels.
Mounting such an operation today might be easier if there were proof that the Sudan is directly involved in terrorist acts against the United States.
But "we just don't know" what its role is, other than providing a toehold for Iran in Africa and maintaining dangerous liaisons with terrorist organizations, said a United States official responsible for analyzing the Sudan. And the C.I.A. "can't envision any successor regime," the official said.
The hope that a friendly government could take power by force is "wishful thinking and self-delusion," said another official who studies the Sudan closely. As for the southern rebels, "all the leaders hate each other," and their plans for taking power are only dreams, said a third United States official focused on the Sudan. The three spoke on condition of anonymity.
Hilary Nyigito Paul Logali, a veteran leader of a southern rebel faction, concedes that "no side can win this war." Since cease-fire negotiations are going nowhere, he said, the best hope is that mounting internal and international pressure will lead the National Islamic Front to share power or even grant autonomy to the south. "Of course," he said with a smile, "if they loosen the strings of political control, that's the end of the N.I.F."
How to impose that pressure is the question for Mr. Turabi's domestic and foreign opponents. They hope the United States' support for the Sudan's unfriendly neighbors, combined with diplomatic and economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, might get Mr. Turabi's attention in a way that recent bread riots and coup plots in Khartoum did not.
"He's genuinely paranoid about what's happening," said a United States Government official. "If he thinks the opposition will be backed by his neighbors or the United States, he might take measures like actually offering opposition elements a measure of power, or lifting the ban on political parties."
There is even some ferment among Mr. Turabi's longtime loyalists, like El-Tayib Zain al-Abdeen, a political scientist at Khartoum University whose credentials in the National Islamic Front are paid in full.
"Hassan al-Turabi is a person of vision," Professor Abdeen said. "He likes to experiment with things. And he's a very daring person -- almost too daring. His wilder visions have been implemented. And now he is being forced to change. Since 1994, you can see a change from his dreaming, visionary, romantic mood. He became wiser after seeing the consequences."
The danger, he said, is that the pressure being applied to the Sudan could cause an explosion.
"The United States Government should not encourage chaos," he said. "The civil war can spill over our borders if the economic crisis continues, if peace in the southern Sudan does not come quickly, if the eastern front opens. And we have nine borders. We have 570 tribes. If this spills over, it could be worse than Liberia. It could be worse than Somalia."
The President of the Sudan, Gen. Omar al-Bashir, appears to want desperately to talk to the United States about all this. "Big countries usually have big problems," he said. "Even we as a Government can make mistakes. We have always wanted to have a positive relationship with the United States. We are ready for a genuine dialogue."
But the United States all but closed its Embassy here in February and moved its personnel to Kenya, after the C.I.A. warned of a threat to its diplomats and staff. President Bashir says he fears that no one is listening.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Economy not expanding? Some companies don't mind.

BYLINE: By Robert Hurtado 

 BODY:
BECAUSE of the increased volatility in the market and signs of a possible slowdown in the economy, some Wall Street advisers are telling investors to focus on companies with predictable profits that are not dependent on an expanding economy.
To be sure, stocks are not far off their records, and they rebounded strongly last week after the small selloff earlier this month. And some analysts say earnings will continue to be strong next year. Still, over the last few months, big stocks have generally performed better than small issues, which are perceived as more speculative. 
 And some investors, believing that trouble looms for the economy, are willing to pay premium prices for stocks of companies with prospects for steadily growing earnings. For these investors, cyclical stocks, which are more reliant on a strengthening economy to sustain earnings growth, have fallen out of favor.
"Investors looking to buy stocks at this stage of the business cycle might do well to seek earnings visibility as an insurance policy against an economic slowdown," said Paul W. Combs, director of research for Stephens Inc., a brokerage firm in Little Rock, Ark. "Companies with more predictable earnings streams that are less dependent on an economic expansion may offer a better premise."
Clearly, cherry-picking stocks in this manner is not risk free, because even companies deemed better insulated from an economic slowdown can stumble for other reasons. Still, if the underlying conditions that have driven the market's growth change, these stocks might be a safer bet.
In the technology arena, the Gartner Group passes the test of steady earnings, some investment professionals say. The company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., derives about 78 percent of its revenue from corporate contracts for research on information-technology markets and advisory services. In the 1996 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, Gartner's revenue totaled $394.6 million.
Customer renewal rates for Gartner's research-report subscriptions and advisory-work contracts run at 85 to 90 percent annually, said Stephen L. Eskenazi, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons.
Mr. Eskenazi said he expected Gartner to earn 70 cents a share in the 1997 fiscal year. In the 1996 fiscal year, the company earned 51 cents a share. The stock closed yesterday at $36.4375, down $1.0625, on Nasdaq.
Another company cited by analysts as having steady earnings prospects is the Mississippi Chemical Corporation, a maker of fertilizer nutrients like nitrogen, phosphate and potash. Because the demand for food and thus fertilizer does not rise or fall much with the swings in the economy, the company is considered to be noncyclical, with fairly steady growth tied to an ever-increasing world population.
The company has a stable customer base, with about an 80 percent annual order renewal rate.
Still, even such a stock is not without risk. Mississippi Chemical, which is based in Yazoo City, Miss., is a commodity supplier and its fortunes hinge on variables like the weather, trade policy and product capacity -- all of which can affect orders, product pricing and earnings.
According to David C. Nelson, an analyst with NatWest Securities, these and other external factors are favoring an upswing in the company's earnings. He expects Mississippi Chemical to earn $2.94 a share in the 1997 fiscal year, ending June 30, and $3.15 a share in the 1998 fiscal year. This includes earnings derived from the previously announced acquisition of the First Mississippi Corporation's fertilizer assets; that deal was completed last week. Mississippi Chemical reported earnings of $2.34 a share last year. The stock closed yesterday at $23.50, down 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
Health care is another segment of the economy expected to grow regardless of the general business climate. One company favored by several analysts is Emcare Holdings Inc. The company, based in Dallas, is hired by hospitals to manage emergency rooms, which is a growing business, according to Lori Price, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. She noted that Emcare, which has been in business for a quarter of a century, has a contract renewal rate of more than 90 percent.
"Emcare's multiyear contracts, high retention rate and ability to manage expenses provide a high predictability to earnings," Ms. Price said, adding that revenue growth at operations open more than a year has been ranging from 5 to 6 percent for each of the last four quarters.
She said she expected the company to earn $1.24 a share in 1996 and $1.50 a share in 1997. Last year, Emcare earned $1.05 a share. The stock closed yesterday at $22.75, down 12.5 cents, on Nasdaq.

HEADLINE: Profit Taking Pulls Down Most Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average staged a late rebound to post a slim gain yesterday, but most stocks pulled back modestly, as money managers sought to guard the robust gains of 1996.
The Dow rose 4.62, to 6,489.02, erasing a 34-point drop in the last half-hour. Last week, the blue-chip barometer tacked on nearly 180 points, including 126 points on Thursday. 
 Broader measures fell, with the Nasdaq showing the worst damage, as computer-related shares gave up some ground for the second consecutive session.
Technology shares "have been great stocks this year, and for investors trying to nail down some profits in the last week, that's one sector they would turn to," said Jim Weiss, the deputy chief investment officer for equities at the State Street Research and Management Company in Boston.
Stocks slipped despite a strong bond market. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a key determinant of corporate and consumer borrowing costs -- fell to 6.58 percent, from 6.60 percent on Friday.
Several of the Dow's strongest issues were defensive stocks in the consumer products sector like Philip Morris, up 1/2 at 112 1/8, and oil producers like Texaco, up 1 at 97 7/8, and Exxon, up 5/8 at 100 1/4. The Dow's weakest components included several issues that have performed well recently. Boeing fell 1 3/8 to 104, and Du Pont slipped 1 3/8, to 95 3/4.
"It was really a cautious market," Mr. Weiss said, describing the session as "another indication of people taking profits and trying to park them in safer places. Portfolio managers are desperately trying to hold onto their gains."
There was little market reaction to a Government report that personal income rebounded in November and consumer spending was strong at the beginning of the holiday season.
The Commerce Department reported that personal income rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month after being flat in October. Consumer spending was also up five-tenths of 1 percent in November, down from a seven-tenths of 1 percent October gain, but slightly better than the four-tenths of 1 percent rise many analysts had expected.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 5-to-4 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where the pre-holiday volume was predictably slack at 343.28 million shares. That was down sharply from 650.09 million in Friday's barrage of trading related to the expiration of futures and options contracts.
The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 1.94, to 746.93; the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.82, to 393.29, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 1.03, to 580.98.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 9.04, to 1,279.52, with several computer industry bellwethers falling sharply. Intel dropped 2 3/8, to 132 1/4, and Dell Computer slid 3 1/4, to 51 3/4. In active Big Board trading, Compaq Computer fell 4 1/8, to 72 5/8.
Mr. Weiss said the profit taking in technology shares was being exacerbated by an "hour-by-hour nervousness" about how the holiday selling season was going for the group.
Airgas fell 3, to 21 1/4. The company said it expected to incur a loss because of suspected fraud by a supplier, but it did not estimate the amount or say when it would be recorded. Airgas said it was suing for breach of contract. It said that it could not find all of the product purchased, and that an Airgas customer had said some of the product did not meet specifications.
In Nasdaq trading, Home Beneficial rose 8 11/16, to 37 15/16, after American General agreed to buy it for $665 million, or $39 a share, solidifying the Houston-based American General's position as one of the nation's five biggest life insurers.
Florida Panthers Holdings was up 2 3/4 at 12 3/4. The hockey team owner agreed to acquire two resorts in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for 8.4 million shares of Panthers stock. The properties, the Hyatt Regency Pier 66 Resort and Marina and the Radisson Bahia Mar Beach Resort and Marina, are currently owned by the Rahn Group, which includes several Panthers board members.
U.S. Diagnostic Labs, of West Palm Beach, Fla., was down 2 11/16 at 9 3/8. A research report by Bear, Stearns, which is dropping coverage of the health care company, said that a U.S. Diagnostic co-founder pleaded guilty to fraud in 1994.

Further Earnings Strength Seen in Some Forecasts
After two exceptional years for stocks, investors are looking closely to see whether the strength in corporate earnings, which drove much of the gains, can continue.
Some forecasters believe that the outlook is strong enough to support another good -- though less ebullient -- year for stocks. But several factors, including economic growth overseas and the value of the dollar, could be pivotal. [Page D3.]
 
Income and Spending Both Up 0.5%
Americans' incomes and spending both posted healthy increases in November, providing a strong start to the holiday shopping season. The Commerce Department reported that personal income and consumer spending both rose by half a percent. In October, income was flat and spending rose by seven-tenths of 1 percent. [D2.]
 
American General to Buy Insurer
Continuing the consolidation in the life insurance industry, American General said that it would buy Home Beneficial, a life insurer based in Richmond, for $665 million. It is the third acquisition in two years for American General. [D6.]
 
Archer to Buy Grace's Cocoa Unit
Archer Daniels Midland said that it would buy the cocoa business of W. R. Grace for about $430 million in cash and debt. The unit is the world's largest processor of cocoa beans, expanding the reach of Archer Daniels beyond grains and soybeans. [D6.]
 
Two Biotechnology Drugs Advance
Two biotechnology drugs moved closer to market. Teva Pharmaceutical of Israel received marketing clearance from the F.D.A. for Copaxone to treat multiple sclerosis. And Agouron Pharmaceuticals of California filed a request with the agency for permission to market Viracept to treat H.I.V. infection. [D2.]
 
Dow Average Up 4.62; Others Fall
The Dow Jones industrial average staged a late rebound to gain 4.62 points, closing at 6,489.02. But most stocks pulled back modestly, and technology-related shares were especially weak, as money managers sought to guard the robust gains made this year. The Nasdaq index fell 9.04 points, to 1,279.52. [D7.]
 
Bond Prices Rise Slightly
The prices of Treasury securities gained after the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for December fell to 96.9 from 99.2 in November, suggesting that the Fed will not need to push up interest rates to fight inflation. The yield on the 30-year bond slipped to 6.58 percent from 6.60 on Friday. [D13.]
 
The Treasury postponed its first auction of inflation-indexed 10-year notes, which have been promoted as a way to save for college or retirement. The auction had been tentatively planned for early January. [D7.]
 
Dean Witter to Buy On-Line Broker
Dean Witter, Discover said that it had agreed to buy Lombard Brokerage, a securities firm that offers trading via the Internet and a toll-free telephone number. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. [D3.]
 
Tiffany Advertising on TV
Tiffany & Company is advertising on television for the first time, in a tricky attempt to expand its consumer appeal without compromising its prestigious image. The idea is to bring in customers who might not be able to afford a $1.8 million strand of pearls but who could spring for a $40 key chain. Advertising. [D4.]
 
The National Advertising Review Board, part of the advertising industry's self-regulatory mechanism, has referred Winn-Dixie Stores' comparative pricing advertisements to the Federal Trade Commission for review after deciding that they could be misleading. Such referrals are rare. [D4.]
 
DNA as an Heirloom?
A new company, Genelink, promises to protect and preserve DNA, the material that contains people's genetic codes, in case it might be useful for future generations. Medical experts are divided on the idea. Some see it as an innovative move, but others say it is simply an attempt to cash in on the public's fascination with DNA, saying that there is no obvious medical benefit. [C1.]

HEADLINE: Dollar and Foreign Economies Influence Earnings

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Now that the second consecutive super year for equities is drawing to a close, investors will be looking more and more at the outlook for corporate earnings in 1997, which some forecasters believe is strong enough to support another good -- although less ebullient -- year for stocks.
But there are two factors that are critical to most of the earnings forecasts for 1997 -- economic growth overseas and the value of the dollar -- which investors may largely ignore but which could disappoint. With both lower-than-expected growth and a stronger dollar, earnings forecasts would fall. 
 Given how mixed forecasts are now, earnings growth estimates that range from zero to 10 percent could slow to anywhere from 6 or 7 percent, to a decline.
"American investors have a tendency to get focused on what is happening in the U.S," Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said. "But the real swing factor is outside the U.S. The hard things to forecast have been outside the U.S. for the last three years."
Ms. Cohen has one of the more bullish estimates for operating earnings next year with a forecast of 10 percent growth a share, in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks. Next year "will be a good year but not necessarily a great year for U.S. equities," she said.
But she said that a "back of the envelope" estimate showed that operating earnings would drop to 7 percent if the very moderate overseas growth performances assumed in the forecast did not materialize.
John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said the rise in the dollar in the last year against the German mark and the Japanese yen could also cut into profits because earnings abroad lose value when translated into a stronger dollar.
"We have seen a turn in the dollar, and already that element that helped underpin earnings growth is becoming more problematic," he said, adding that a weaker dollar in past years "was helpful for increasing profits." An even stronger dollar "certainly would be a challenge for the equity market," he said.
Analysts are not changing their forecasts yet. But the mixed signals now coming from overseas economies may mean it will take some time to be sure about their contribution to American earnings and about what will happen to the dollar.
For example, the outlook for growth in the Japanese economy, which was already expected to slow in 1997, may be even more sluggish. The Japanese Economic Planning Agency announced last week that the country's gross domestic product is expected to grow only 1.9 percent in the coming fiscal year, which starts on April 1. The Government's target for the current year is 2.5 percent. The 1997 forecast for growth was the lowest since the end of World War II. And financial analysts have been knocking their estimates down to even lower levels.
For Europe, John O'Neill, the chief currency economist at Goldman, Sachs, said that "there are increasing signs of economic recovery being entrenched and not just a monthly fluke."
But despite these signs, Goldman lowered its growth forecast for Europe slightly in its December analysis, in part because growth for 1996 was less than expected.
The Goldman global economic forecast was one basis for Ms. Cohen's earnings forecast. "I am watching Japan," Ms. Cohen said. "That is my single biggest concern. The world's second-biggest economy seems to be decelerating again."
The outlook for the dollar is also mixed. Some analysts, including Mr. Lipsky, think that it will not move that much higher in 1997. But it rose 10.5 percent against the yen and 7.9 percent against the mark since the end of last year. And some forecasters are expecting it to move higher.
Another reason that foreign economic performance is so important is that most of the estimates that Wall Street makes for earnings are based on the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, which Ms. Cohen noted are much more dependent on foreign business for their performance than other stocks. She estimated that about 30 percent of the revenue and earnings for these generally larger and better-known companies came from abroad.
"It is a huge chunk," David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said. His forecast for S.& P. 500 operating earnings growth was 5 percent, half that of Ms. Cohen's estimate, and weaker overseas growth would trim it more.
"It would be less than 5 percent, but I don't have an equation," he said. He said the foreign earnings were very important for technology, energy, chemical and pharmaceutical companies.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Can He Be Beaten?

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's increasingly confident appraisal of his re-election prospects has not come as a surprise to the Democratic leaders who would like to unseat him. Many of them have been saying the same thing -- if less publicly -- for months.
"Sober Democrats appreciate that Giuliani is currently the favorite," said Mark J. Green, the city's Public Advocate, a Democrat who himself briefly contemplated and then abandoned a run for Mayor. Mr. Green was describing an emerging Democratic Party consensus with uncharacteristic understatement. 
 It is becoming a conventional wisdom that knows no partisan bounds. It is so overwhelming that the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, one of the Democrats who would like Mr. Giuliani's job, begins campaign speeches by assuring party supporters that her cause is not lost. "Every incumbent who has a pulse is described as unbeatable," another Democratic contender, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, said over coffee the other day.
On the face of it, there is ample reason for all this glumness among Democrats. Mr. Giuliani is quite popular these days. He will, if history is any guide, benefit from the drop in crime and the rise in the city's economy.
Mr. Giuliani's stature can best be measured by the lack of success Democrats have had in convincing some established candidates, like Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, to run against him, the lesser fund raising of his opponents and the absence of excitement over the candidacies of Ms. Messinger, Mr. Ferrer, Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn or the Rev. Al Sharpton.
All that aside, forget the conventional wisdom for a moment. As improbable as it may seem today, Mr. Giuliani's re-election is -- while certainly likely -- in truth, not certain. There are Democrats who are now just beginning to make a case for how Mr. Giuliani might be defeated, and while some of it is wishful thinking, much of it is based on serious observation about the realities of Mr. Giuliani's coalition, and the potential contours of the political campaign for the year ahead.
With 11 months to go before the election, here are a few things that Democrats say could turn things around, and that may explain why Mr. Giuliani is running as if, as he put it the other day, he is 30 points behind.
 
Early Polls Mean Little
The specter of Mr. Giuliani as unbeatable is fed by every new poll showing him with another double-digit lead over another opponent. The Mayor has taken to reciting these polls, in no small part to feed the image of himself as unbeatable, and also to scare off potential challengers. "I read the polls, both external and internal, as my having a very strong lead," Mr. Giuliani said on Friday in an interview at his office.
His opponents dismiss such reasoning as politically presumptuous.
"Here's my experience," Ms. Messinger said. "Lots of people think specifically that the race is just beginning. There are things they're not happy about, that they haven't been focusing on. The holidays are going to be over soon."
In truth, when it comes to predicting the outcome of elections, the kind of horse race polls that are feeding the image of a politically invincible Mayor are notoriously unreliable. Such polls ask people to make a judgment about candidates they know nothing about, on issues that have not been raised, and in contests they have barely begun to consider.
Such early polling is useful in what it says about voter attitudes toward Mr. Giuliani and the city he runs. In that case, the findings augur mostly -- though not universally -- well for him. A Quinnipiac College poll in November found that 54 percent of New Yorkers surveyed said they held a favorable approval of him.
On the other hand, while voters say they are happy over all with the way Mr. Giuliani is doing his job, they are not happy with his handling of social programs or the tone he sets. Voters tend to think he is abrasive or divisive, according to polls by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. That gives his opponents ammunition.
It is also notable that Mr. Giuliani gets 46 to 49 percent in early polling matchups against his most credible opponents (except for Mr. Sharpton, who is well known and unpopular). In a two-way race, a candidate needs over 50 percent to win. Further, considering that Mr. Giuliani is running for mayor for the third time, and is thus well known in New York, his showing in those polls could be seen as a ceiling, which is what Democrats suggest it is.
"He's pretty much at 46 to 48," said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute. "That's close to what he needs to win, but it's not quite there."
 
A Reduced Racial Factor
When political advisers to Mayor David N. Dinkins reviewed his loss in 1993, they concluded that one force overwhelmingly explained his defeat: race. Some people outside Mr. Dinkins's circle might quarrel with this conclusion, given Mr. Giuliani's success at turning the 1993 contest into a referendum on Mr. Dinkins's record in dealing with crime and quality of life. But the 1993 contest was indisputably framed by racial tensions, partly because of the way Mr. Dinkins handled the racial disturbances in Crown Heights in 1991.
A result was that many middle-class white voters who for generations had voted Democratic did not.
Mr. Giuliani won 77 percent of the white vote against Mr. Dinkins in 1993. But early indications are that the election will not be quite as racially polarizing as 1993, and that might affect the enthusiasm, and thus the turnout, among some of Mr. Giuliani's supporters.
"You don't have him running against an African-American candidate," said Leland T. Jones, a senior adviser to Ms. Messinger. "You don't have Crown Heights. You don't have the wedges that worked so much in his favor."
That is not to say there are not racial considerations in the impending contest; there are. They are just slightly more nuanced. The lack of overt racial strife in New York might mean that a candidate like Ms. Messinger could win back some of the white vote that Mr. Dinkins lost.
Equally intriguing is the level of turnout among blacks. Mr. Dinkins's political assistants were distressed at how low it was in 1993, and came to believe it reflected disappointment with the performance of the city's first black mayor. Ms. Messinger has made a concerted effort to cultivate black support during her career; nevertheless, despite the hope of some of her aides, it seems unthinkable that she could equal Mr. Dinkins's support there.
Mr. Ferrer, by contrast, could find himself paying a price for the rivalrous history between black and Hispanic groups in the city. At the same time, Mr. Ferrer is Puerto Rican and his appeal to Hispanic voters -- the single fastest-growing voter group in the city -- could change the equation as well. Mr. Giuliani received the support of 38 percent of Hispanic voters last time, which Mr. Ferrer argues the Mayor will not be able to do against a Mr. Ferrer.
In truth, New York's Hispanic community comprises people from many different countries and ideologies, and most city politicians say it is anything but a bloc.
All this is particularly important because the number of black and Hispanic residents here has increased steadily through the decade, as the number of whites has declined, said Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College.
Bill Lynch, who was Mr. Dinkins's campaign manager in both races against Mr. Giuliani, said: "In 1989, David Dinkins won by 50,000-plus votes. In 1993, he lost by 50,000 votes. And I think that the demographics of the city have changed: those people who are more likely to be of the Dinkins coalition, their numbers have increased a little bit."
 
He's Still a Republican
Finally, for all his popularity, Mr. Giuliani is a Republican Mayor sailing against a Democratic wind. New York City has 2.3 million registered Democrats and 485,000 Republicans. So it was that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1994 and Attorney General Robert Abrams, when he ran for the Senate in 1992, went down to defeat statewide but won, easily and convincingly, in New York City.
What is more, Mr. Giuliani was helped in 1993 by the referendum on Staten Island on whether the borough should be allowed to secede from the rest of New York City. That brought out a sharp increase in Staten Island voters, most of whom, by the calculations of Mr. Dinkins's aides, went to Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Giuliani has blurred party lines -- witness his endorsement of Mr. Cuomo in the 1994 race -- but it is still a matter of concern among his advisers. "It's still a Democratic town," said Peter J. Powers, who is expected to run Mr. Giuliani's campaign. "You've got to be careful."
By next November, will all this still matter? Churchill, of course, was thrown out after saving England. And there are Democrats who argue that some of Mr. Giuliani's recent actions -- making peace with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, for instance -- show that Mr. Giuliani, for all his public bravado, has more than a few worries about the race ahead.
Perhaps. But it appears more likely that Mr. Giuliani is leaving nothing to chance. "I don't take anything for granted -- ever," he said on Friday.
Even Mr. Lynch, who was Mr. Dinkins's campaign manager, seemed resigned to a Giuliani victory as he answered questions about how Mr. Giuliani might lose.
"I think it's just Rudy," Mr. Lynch said. "I think it's going to go back in 2001. It'll go back to a Democrat. I think in 2001 it will go back to the way it normally is."

HEADLINE: China Shows New View On Mentally Disabled

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, Dec. 18) highlights an important point: as China continues its steady economic and social growth, new forces for human rights change will emerge within the country that are more important than the external forces that apply pressure. An example is the Chinese officials who joined the Special Olympics movement and who have begun to reshape China's treatment of people with mental retardation. 
 China's record with respect to these citizens has been considered scandalous. Reports have brought to light the inhuman conditions that exist in many of the "orphanages" in which they live.
Yan Ming Fu, the vice minister of civil affairs, after opening a Special Olympics office in Beijing, organized the first Asian-Pacific Special Olympics Games, which took place last month with skilled athletes from 15 nations. The games were broadcast to an estimated 100 million viewers, most of whom had probably never seen a person with mental retardation in public.
In addition, the civil affairs ministry and the Ministry of Education have forged a commitment to reshape the educational experience of people with mental retardation. More than 150 leaders from around China convened during the games to learn strategies to promote sports and recreation opportunities.
It is to be hoped that this event signals one example of what the post-Deng Xiaoping era in China will look like.

PEARL S. BUCK
A Cultural Biography
By Peter Conn
Illustrated. 468 pages. Cambridge University Press. $29.95.
In 1934, when the literary critic Malcolm Cowley published "Exile's Return," his essay on writers like Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos and F. Scott Fitzgerald who were returning to the United States from abroad, Pearl S. Buck did not make the list. The omission seems strange, and not just because Buck returned to the United States that very year after four decades in China. Buck's best-known novel, "The Good Earth," was the biggest-selling book of 1931 and 1932, and praised by William Lyon Phelps at Yale as "one of the outstanding works of our time." Four years later, in 1938, Buck became the third American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.
But in Cowley's book on the really important writers, Buck was a nonperson. More to the point, she has been a nonperson in American literary circles for several decades, and the main purpose of Peter Conn's absorbing biography is to rescue her from the oblivion that has enveloped her like a mist.
"Pearl Buck perfectly exemplifies a writer who once loomed large on our cultural landscape and whose disappearance has damaged our historical understanding," Mr. Conn writes in his preface. But in fact, Mr. Conn never makes a strong case that Buck, whose books come across now as dated and formulaic, deserves a major literary rehabilitation. Nevertheless, she certainly was a major figure of her time, and to follow her life in Mr. Conn's finely detailed narrative is to encounter a powerful and moving 20th-century experience.
Born Pearl Sydenstricker in 1892, the future Pearl Buck was a child of the American-missionary urge, so powerful in the 19th and early 20th centuries, to rescue the hundreds of millions of Chinese from their putative spiritual benightedness. Pearl's father, Absalom Sydenstricker of western Virginia, was a relentlessly driven, humorless, fanatical Presbyterian missionary of the sort, as his literary daughter later saw it, who "spent decades in an ancient, complex and dignified civilization and had seen only a stronghold of Satan." Her mother, Carie, who lost three of her first four children when they were very young, was a long-suffering missionary wife who came to see her life as a lost opportunity, foolishly dedicated to the futile ambition of her husband.
Mr. Conn has studied the record well, and his descriptions of missionary life in China are sound from the scholarly point of view and gripping as well. Pearl had what he calls a "stunted childhood," stunted by her father's emotional distance, her mother's sadness, her own sense of alienation and uncertainty as an American living in China. When she married John Lossing Buck, an agricultural economist whose work in China is still viewed as a scholarly monument, she unconsciously duplicated the emotional structure of her parents' marriage. Pearl and Lossing Buck remained bound together for 17 unrewarding years, with Pearl alone undertaking the wrenching task of coping with the severe retardation of their only biological daughter, Carol, while Lossing devoted himself to his work.
But Pearl also lived in the vortex of history and experience. As a schoolgirl in Shanghai in the early years of this century, she did volunteer work at the Door of Hope, a shelter for Chinese slave girls and prostitutes. She witnessed female infanticide in her village near Nanjing on the Yangtze River. She saw civil war, death and some of China's early struggles for liberal reform, especially the May 4th Movement of 1917 to 1921. She was that rarest of persons, a truly bicultural American, literate in Chinese, an American for whom America was a kind of foreign country while China was home.
When "The Good Earth," Buck's second novel, was published in 1931, it made her a prototype of the writer propelled from obscurity to overnight wealth and fame. Mr. Conn's analysis of the reasons for the success of her best-known novel is shrewd. The book was full of authentic detail about rural Chinese life; it had "a formal, quasi-biblical rhetoric" that for many readers "helped lift the plot toward a sense of universality." It was in addition "a story of the land, a rather familiar American genre," similar in this respect to other major novels of the decade like "Gone With the Wind" and "The Grapes of Wrath."
Mr. Conn seems angry that Buck was never accepted into the high culture by what he contemptuously calls "the makers of taste," meaning influential critics like Cowley or Alfred Kazin. He tends toward a feminist interpretation of this fact. "Pearl was a woman who wrote mainly about the unglamorous daily lives of women," he says, adding later: "Pearl's Asian subjects, her prose style, her gender and her tremendous popularity offended virtually every one of the constituencies that divided up the literary 1930's."
But other popular writers who were not women were also neglected by the highbrow elite, Buck's fellow Nobel Prize winner Sinclair Lewis among them. Moreover, Mr. Conn himself allows that Buck's prose was often "commonplace," that she "displayed a taste for formulaic phrases," and that even "The Good Earth" did not necessarily "represent the highest literary achievement."
Buck, in any case, spent the last 40 years of her life (all in the United States; she never returned to China after she left it in 1934) in an immensely energetic effort to use her wealth and fame for good purposes. She was a leader in generating public concern for Amerasian children (a term she coined), the mixed-race offspring often abandoned by their American fathers and neglected in the Asian societies they were born into. She was given credit by at least one Jewish refugee from Austria for saving her family. A friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and Paul Robeson, she was ahead of her time on the rights of women and blacks.
All of these facets of Buck's life are sensitively described by Mr. Conn, who never allows his admiration for his subject to blind him to her frailties and her mistakes in judgment. He certainly makes the case that Buck was, whatever her literary reputation, a remarkable woman who deserves more renown than recent generations have given her.

HEADLINE: Reflections of Advocate for Education and Arts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who wrote the legislation creating national endowments for arts and humanities and who gave his name to Pell grants, the Federal college scholarships for needy students, is retiring in January after 36 years in the Senate.
"I could have won if I'd run for re-election," Mr. Pell said with a smile in a recent interview. "To date, there have been 60 million Pell grants -- and that's quite a political resource." 
 In addition, he could probably have counted on support from recipients of 150,000 or so grants made over the last 30 years by the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Mr. Pell has had his share of opponents, among them conservatives who disparaged him as soft on Cuba and the Soviet Union and liberals who scolded him for being too accommodating to conservatives.
When Mr. Pell first ran for the Senate, in 1960, his Republican challenger sneered at his patrician manners and called him "a cream puff."
Mr. Pell's response? "To rush out and get the baker's union to endorse me."
Now 78, and suffering from Parkinson's disease, Mr. Pell spent a recent day in reflection, surveying his Senate career, pointing to mistakes and triumphs, and dispensing advice for his successor.
In his baronial home in Georgetown, he was surrounded by treasures collected over a lifetime -- Rembrandt etchings, suits of armor, paintings of his parents and ancestors, rare tapestries, early books and beautiful Persian rugs.
He said he was proud of sponsoring legislation creating the Federal scholarships, which give $2,700 a year to needy students. At first they were known as the 1972 Basic Educational Opportunity Grants. How, he was asked, did they come to be called Pell grants?
"Because," he replied, "there was no Senator Beog."
Chuckling, he recalled that eight years after the legislation's passage, the Education subcommittee honored him by making the official name change.
"The program has exceeded my wildest hopes," Mr. Pell said. "As of today, it's expended more than $70 billion. This year, instead of getting cut we got an increase of almost $700 million for fiscal '97."
His chief regret, he said, is that the program did not become an entitlement like Social Security and thus pegged to inflation. Instead, the Pell grants remain discretionary, which means Congress decides an amount each year.
In 1992, Senator Pell and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, sought to make the program an entitlement by amending the 1965 Higher Education Act, but their effort failed -- and this, Mr. Pell said, has had alarming consequences.
"Congress moved in the wrong direction by creating a terrible imbalance between grants and loans," he said. "A decade ago, a typical student's aid package was 75 percent grants and 25 percent loans. Today, it's the opposite -- 75 percent loans and only 25 percent grants. In the 1980's, total student borrowing came to around $3 billion a year, whereas today that figure is over $24 billion.
"The result is that students have an overwhelming debt by the time they graduate."
Mr. Pell said he lost another battle when Congress terminated a program under which Pell grants could be awarded to prisoners.
"I said it was cheaper to send people to Yale than to jail," he said.
The Senator expressed optimism that the grants would continue, saying:
"I argue that the strength of the United States is not the gold at Fort Knox or the weapons of mass destruction that we have, but the sum total of the education and the character of our people. Congress understands that."
Turning to the humanities and arts endowments for which he was the principal Senate sponsor in 1965, Mr. Pell recalled the politicking that took place behind the creation of these agencies.
"I had many conversations on the subject with Jackie Kennedy," he said. "She would cite the fact that the French Government had a Cabinet-level official who dealt with cultural affairs, and she thought we should do something like that. President Kennedy was in favor of the idea, too, but I can tell you he didn't lose much sleep over it.
"Barnaby Keeney, a medievalist and the president of Brown University, wanted a humanities foundation, and in those days the humanities had a much bigger following around the country than the arts. I wanted the endowment to be for the the visual arts, and Jack Javits wanted it for the performing arts. So we compromised, and that's how we got the two endowments and later the Institute of Museum and Library Services."
Mr. Pell said he was encouraged that financing for the humanities endowment in fiscal 1997 has held steady at $110 million despite efforts to cut it, and that the Institute for Museum and Library Services received a $1 million increase over 1995, raising its fiscal 1996 budget to $22 million.
He said his principal advice for advocates of government support of higher education, the arts and humanities was to speak softly.
As an example, he cited winning support for Pell grants from two conservatives on the Education subcommittee: Peter Dominick, Republican of Colorado, and Winston Prouty, Democrat of Vermont.
When asked whether he ever suited up in the armor decorating his home before doing combat in the Senate, Mr. Pell recoiled.
"That's what not to do," he said. "In politics, you must let the other person have your way."

Lamont McClam, a slight, 39-year-old man distinguished by a toothless, immensely winning grin, lives in a cardboard box at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street across from Trump Tower and the St. Regis Hotel.
You can almost set a clock by his comings and goings. They begin each morning at 5 A.M. when he is awakened by the rumble of a garbage truck servicing the St. Regis. He rolls up his sleeping bag, disassembles his cardboard home and stacks the flattened boxes next to a trash basket. 
 He commutes each weekday to a regular, albeit minimum-wage warehouse job in Long Island City. He doesn't absolutely have to live in the box. But he has a clear goal: to save $50 a week so he can reunite with his estranged wife and two daughters, who moved to Florida.
He could save nothing if he paid for a room. His mother refuses to take him in. He rejected homeless shelters because he does not feel safe there. So, he lives in a box of his own making.
It is a rigid routine: cold-pavement mornings, subway commutes, soup kitchen suppers, nightly harvests of cardboard, Sunday afternoons watching pro football outside the windows of WNYW. He spends $10 a week on a phone card to talk to his wife, Marie, and daughters, Monique, 8, and Nicole, 6. Perhaps accordingly, it is his matter-of-factness, his practicality, that is most striking.
"I come to work every day and go back to the box and live," Mr. McClam said. "Then I get up in the morning and do it all over again."
The Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, knows Mr. McClam, having ministered to several generations of his family. Mr. McClam's grandfather, a minister, was a friend of his, and he officiated at the marriage of Mr. McClam's sister. He has tried to help the homeless man, by finding him a room on one occasion, by giving him money from his own pocket at other times.
"This is a man working at the margins trying to battle his way to some sense of normalcy," Mr. Butts said.
The pastor sees Mr. McClam as a telling example of what the working poor face as even the cheapest housing stretches their earnings to the limit. For some, the cutbacks in welfare are expected to make the pain worse.
But Mr. McClam, like many others, has always worked and never been on welfare. He did not get unemployment benefits when he was dismissed from his last steady job a year ago because he worked off the books. He has never panhandled.
In effect, Mr. Butts suggested that Mr. McClam is working without a net at a time when many others face the same possibility. "A lot of men are in the situation Lamont is in, and it's going to get worse," he said.
But Mr. McClam's story remains inextricably his own, involving deeply personal tragedies, willowy hopes and unshakable fears.
"The key is not thinking No Home, but going on with your life, the only hard part is finding a place to sleep when it rains and gets cold outside," Mr. McClam once wrote in a composition at a workshop for the homeless.

Part of a Network Of Information
He believes in fate, but is on a nonstop mission to better his slim odds. When he eats, for instance, he stuffs himself because he does not know for sure when he will eat again. He seems somehow comfortable in all this uncertainty, in part because the homeless form networks to help one another: he was told by a friend about the soup kitchen at St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue, and helped others find jobs at a temporary-employment agency he uses.
And his sense of identity seems rock solid. "This is my mouth and what comes out of it, I have a right to say," he said. "I'm put here for a purpose."
Mr. McClam has been homeless since March, when he lost his messenger's job and his landlord confiscated his belongings. He slept in parks and subways until he found the spot where he erects his cardboard shelter each night.
When the garbage truck at the St. Regis rouses him, it is too early to go to the bathroom in Trump Tower, which he uses in the evenings. So he walks down Fifth Avenue to 29th Street to the temp agency, where he reports daily.
There he washes up and if he gets a work assignment -- and he has got the same one most days for the last three months -- he takes an N train to the 36th Street stop in Queens, where he works in a warehouse owned by a prestigious retail chain. An owner of the agency, Andersen, Rogan & Ross, asked that the chain's name not be used, because he feared publicity might cause the company to ask the agency to stop hiring homeless people.
But one of the agency's owners, Martin Ross, thinks it possible the warehouse job may become permanent. "Lamont's more intelligent and articulate than most of the guys we have," he said.
Mr. McClam clings to this hope, despite similar promises that turned empty. His job involves unloading janitorial supplies from trailers, stacking them on shelves, then loading them on smaller trucks going out to individual stores. Most of the work is manual, but he has learned to use a Hi-Lo loader as well as a U.P.S. machine. It is cold in the vast unheated space and his hands are raw at day's end. He gets $4.75 an hour.
After work, he goes to the soup kitchen at St. Bart's. He is greeted warmly, and smiles at friends. He gets soup, bread, milk and an apple. He sits on a folding metal chair to eat and chat with others who also carry most of their belongings on their back.
He then trudges into the chilly night to collect building material. He hunts for large folded cardboard boxes in front of stores catering to the wealthy. "I wonder what Liz has tonight," he said to a man also hunting for cardboard, referring to a Liz Claiborne store.
It is a slow night, and Mr. McClam rejects piece after piece of folded boxes. Finally, in about an hour, he has the right stuff.
He walks to a nook at the left side of the front of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. A man is already there, and Mr. McLam asks if he will move to an identical adjoining nook. The man, whose only shelter is his tattered coat, obliges. Mr. McClam gives him one of his five cigarettes.
Construction takes half an hour, as Mr. McClam meticulously fits material together. By using different-sized pieces of cardboard, he intentionally makes the section containing his head bigger than that intended for the rest of his body.
"He's the architect," said another homeless man. "This guy builds houses; he don't just build cardboard boxes."
Mr. McClam then puts three layers of cardboard on the floor of his dwelling, followed by a wool blanket. Finally, he unrolls a fluffy sleeping bag that he says God gave him. There is time now for a cigarette and some conversation.
Nearby, someone on the street is playing a saxophone, badly as always. Children stare as they pass; adults appear not to see him.
He seems never to complain, though his life has known few smooth stretches. Beneath the sparkling Fifth Avenue holiday decorations, he unrolls the story of his monochromatic life. He was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant and was sick as a child, contracting measles, scarlet fever and other diseases in his first months of life. At 3, he had a malignant lung tumor that caused him to lapse into a coma and nearly die.
He never knew his father, and dropped out of high school despite being in an academically advanced program in grade school. He admits that at times, he drank a little too much beer. But he always worked, from driving cabs and trucks to clerical work to manual labor.
His jobs included collating travelers checks for American Express, doing back-office work for E. F. Hutton, and driving a truck. Things began to slide when he was dismissed for violating policy by taking a truck home overnight, rather than leaving it in the lot.
Then, a little more than a year ago, he lost a job driving home-care attendants in bad neighborhoods, and could replace it only with a low-paying one as a messenger. He then lost that, and when he could not pay his rent, his angry landlord confiscated his belongings.
Around the same time, he fell on a sidewalk, in a bloody accident that caused him to lose his teeth. He has not been able to afford to have them replaced.
"It seems like every year he goes through something," said his mother, Delores Jeffries, a secretary at Elmhurst Hospital. "There's never an escape."
Ms. Jeffries, whose inclination has always been to help her son, is trying to follow advice given her in counseling sessions by not helping him any longer. It is felt that he will become more self-sufficient if she no longer provides shelter and money.
Mr. McClam's first homeless months were spent living in Madison Square Park. He migrated uptown as the weather became colder, chased from place to place. He learned to build with boxes. Under one scaffolding, he says, a police officer demanded that he move, saying, "This is the big bad wolf and I'm blowing your house down."
But the police do not generally bother the homeless camped out around the Fifth Avenue Church. "It's a sanctuary," Mr. McClam said.

Using Trump Tower And Visiting Home
He has never been in the St. Regis or Peninsula Hotels, but has wandered up the avenue to the Warner Brothers store to see Michael Jordan at a promotion. He feels comfortable visiting the restroom in Trump Tower because "the attendant doesn't make you feel like you're doing anything wrong."
The other night as a light snow fluttered down, a beautiful Brazilian woman stopped to talk about her broken heart.
"We've all been there," Mr. McClam told her. "You'll be alright, you'll find another one."
On weekends, Mr. McClam says, he wanders from the sidewalk square he calls home. Sometimes, he visits his mother in Jamaica, Queens, though she has made it clear she prefers short stays. "I'll be there a few hours, and she'll start looking at her watch and asking me if there is anything she can send with me," he said.
Most Fridays and Saturdays, he goes to Harlem, where he visits a laundromat and maybe a restaurant. He might sleep in a cheap hotel, sometimes with a woman he met while living in Madison Square Park.
He says if he listens long enough to her complaints about being homeless, she is usually receptive to his advances. "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," he said.
He has never panhandled. "What I would need that money for?" he asked. "I can always get something to eat."

Sunday Services And a Free Lunch
On Sundays, he occasionally goes to the Abyssinian Baptist Church, if he does not stop by the atrium of the I.B.M. Building adjacent to Trump Tower to socialize with other homeless people. He almost always goes to the free noon meal provided by St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church at 55 West 15th Street.
There, he participates in a seminar run by the New York Coalition Against Hunger. Called "Teach Us to Fish," it is led by Judith Walker, a student at New York Theological Seminary, and gives homeless people a chance to express themselves in speech and writing.
The participants, all men, often criticize welfare policy, immigrants' taking opportunities that might otherwise go to them and the lumbering social service bureaucracy.
"They're dealing with numbers and forgetting who people are," Mr. McClam says. But he tells the group he has good news: a few days earlier, a judge threw out a summons he had received for loitering.
Afterward, the little man with the big sleeping bag ambles uptown, stopping to watch the Dallas Cowboys, his favorite team, through a picture window. Dinner is at the usual place, St. Bart's on Park Avenue. He waves good-bye and strides into the darkness to begin scrounging cardboard, thinking of Florida and family and future. He figures he has enough savings to visit between Christmas and New Year's and has decided to rent a car to scout job possibilities.
But Monday morning comes first. "You're always plotting and planning for the next day," he said.

Dollar Rallies in Thin Trading, Partly on Fall in Japan Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied yesterday in thin Christmas Eve trading, deriving strength from another tumble in the Japanese stock market to a 1996 low, weakness in the Swiss franc and some profit taking in the pound.
Demand for the dollar pushed it to a 28-month high against the Swiss franc in Europe and back toward the upper end of its recent trading ranges against the yen and mark. 
 But traders were reluctant to read much meaning into the dollar's latest advances because the thin trading exaggerated the impact of small purchases in a market in which hundreds of billions of dollars ordinarily are traded daily.
Most trading desks closed at midday yesterday in the United States; all key markets will be closed today for Christmas and many European markets will remain closed tomorrow.
"There's nothing really to say about the market today; we could have had a simple case of someone who had to buy $20 million or $30 million," said John Hazelton, chief currency trader at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company in New York.
Nonetheless, traders said the dollar's firmness reflected a strong underlying appetite for the currency, which has appreciated nearly 11 percent against the yen and more than 8 percent against the mark this year.
In late New York trading the dollar cost 1.5552 marks, up slightly from 1.5549 Monday. The dollar stood at 114.44 yen, up from 114.08. The pound was trading at $1.6731, down from $1.6750 on profit taking.
The dollar got a lift when Japan's 225-stock Nikkei index fell 528.75 points, or 2.69 percent, to 19,161.71, the weakest since Dec. 19, 1995. The decline reinforced the prevailing view that interest rates in Japan, at record lows for 15 months, are not likely to rise until well into 1997 at the earliest. Low rates hurt the yen.
Also helping the dollar was a selloff in the Swiss franc, which has been eroding in value for a few months because of low interest rates in Switzerland and concern that the currency's strength is hurting the economy by making exports costly.
In European dealings the dollar reached 1.3465 Swiss francs, the highest level since August 1994. In New York, the dollar settled at 1.3406 Swiss francs, up from 1.3377.

Bond Prices End Mixed in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday in an abbreviated Christmas Eve session that saw little movement following the latest report on stores sales.
By the close of the New York session, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up only 1/32 in very thin volume, to a price of 98 31/32; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, was 6.58 percent, unchanged from Monday. 
 All American financial markets will be closed today for Christmas; they will reopen tomorrow. For the bond market, it promises to be another lackluster session; in the last four sessions, the long bond's yield has held within a range of 6.58 percent and 6.60 percent.
The morning's report by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim on weekly chain-store sales showed the index jumped 1.3 percent in the week ended last Saturday. Analysts regard stores sales data for the holiday shopping season as a key to consumers' spending power, which is an important gauge of the economy.
Though the index posted its largest week-to-week gain since the week ended Aug. 31, it was slightly below expectations. In the last four weeks, the average gain has been seven-tenths of 1 percent -- a moderate reading over all but not enough to raise concern among investors that the economy is heating up, which might lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
"The consumer has made some comeback from the third quarter," said John Burgess, managing director at Bankers Trust Investment Management. "The question for the bond market is how much of a comeback."
While inflation has generally stayed between 2.5 percent and 3 percent in the last four years, consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in the 12 months through November, compared with 2.5 percent for the similar period last year. Without food and energy prices -- components considered volatile because of their sensitivity to short-term conditions -- prices were up a little more than 2.6 percent, compared with 3 percent for the corresponding period a year earlier. Bond prices could slip, pushing up interest rates in the process, if investors begin to grow concerned that this year's retail sales are much stronger than expected.
The perception of moderate growth and low inflation could be jeopardized if consumer spending accelerates, Mr. Burgess said. "If we get a strong Christmas season and continued growth in employment, it could eventually flow through into increased inflation." And inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments.
But even if the holiday retail sales were strong, Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of government bond trading at Cowen & Company, said, "that's O.K.," adding, "The market has been accepting economic strength because inflation has been benign."

HEADLINE: Record Orange and Grapefruit Harvests Are Expected in Florida

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Seven years after a two-day freeze over the Christmas weekend devastated the Florida citrus crop, growers in the state are expecting their biggest crop ever, in large part because trees planted after that freeze are maturing and bearing fruit.
The Florida Department of Citrus is predicting that the crop will be more than 10.4 million tons of oranges, compared with 9.6 million tons last year, and 2.7 million tons of grapefruits, because many growers planted twice as many trees per acre after the 1989 freeze to compensate for lost productivity in past years. 
 In 1990 there were about 79 million citrus trees but the number now is closer to 107 million. Typically the trees take about 3 years to bear fruit and about 15 years to mature fully.
But for citrus farmers the huge crop is a mixed blessing since it will almost certainly bring a drop in prices.
"Well, it's good because it's showing that citrus growers are making good use of science and technology to produce high-quality crops," said Steve Rogers, a citrus grower in Highland City, Fla. "But we don't set prices. A large crop like this means that it's harder to find a buyer, and there's a very definite possibility that some of the fruit will not be harvested from the trees."
The harvest is just beginning.
The value of the orange crop is expected to be $825 million, down from $941 million last year. But retail revenue is actually expected to increase by 9 percent because the price stores charge is likely to remain the same.
About 90 percent of an orange crop is converted into orange juice. As consumers have become more health conscious in recent years, orange juice has become more popular, and sales, particularly those of premium orange juice not from concentrate, have increased.
"Demand has increased for Florida orange juice," said Phil Lesser, Director of Economic and Market Research at the Florida Department of Citrus.
"It has been known for many years to be effective in fighting colds," Mr. Lesser said. "It also has properties that will reduce incidents of cancer and heart disease, and I think that consumers are more conscious now of the full health benefits of citrus."
The value of the grapefruit crop, about half of which becomes grapefruit juice, is expected to increase to $131 million this year, from $103 million last year, and revenue from retail sales is expected to increase by 13.4 percent.
Grapefruit sales have remained fairly flat in recent years so Florida growers are trying to increase demand for the fruit. The state is the world's largest producer of grapefruit.
The quality of both crops was also expected to be better this year because there has been much more sunlight this year. The quality of the fruit, its sweetness and flavor, is directly proportional to how much sunlight it receives, agriculture experts say.
"We have better quality fruit this year than the last couple of years, when we've had a lot of rain in the summertime," said Paul Messenger, of the Florida Agriculture Statistics Service. "You need a certain amount of sunlight to put flavor in the fruit."
But the change is not something that consumers are likely to notice, at least when drinking juice, since citrus processors always strike the right balance of sweetness regardless what overall quality of fruit they get.

HEADLINE: 3 Strategies to Help Families in the U.S.

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
What would be needed to assure adequate, center-based care for all the families that wanted it?
 
PUBLIC PRESCHOOLS -- The first place almost all the experts turn for lessons is Europe and, in particular, France. Once French children are toilet trained, they may attend free state-run nursery schools from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. -- and almost all of them do. 
 For younger children of French working mothers, there are centers run by local governments and nonprofit groups. Barbara Bergmann, an economist at American University and the author of the forthcoming book "Saving Our Children From Poverty," reports that charges ranged from $6 to $21 a day in 1991, depending on family income. Home-based day care, regulated by the state and subsidized according to need, is also available. Part-time centers for before and after school as well as drop-in centers for less predictable needs round out the state's cradle-to-kindergarten system.
But the French system would be difficult to transplant to American soil. For one thing, the French keep costs to surprisingly manageable proportions -- roughly $2,600 for each child -- by allowing classes of up to 28 children. And while the system's quality is widely praised -- in 1989, a panel of American experts that included Hillary Rodham Clinton labeled it "an impressive achievement" -- many American parents would probably not be satisfied with the regimentation and discipline needed to make large classes productive.
Politically, too, the system is a peculiar accident. It appeals to the left as an extension of the welfare state. Yet it also pleases traditionalists, who see day care as a way to encourage population growth, as well as to the Roman Catholic Church, which views it as a deterrent to abortion. But while some experts, notably Edward Zigler, a development psychologist at Yale who has championed Head Start, are eager to go the public school route, it seems unlikely to win much support in the United States.
"I don't think the French system would fly here," Ms. Bergmann said.
 
VOUCHERS -- What many child care experts hope would fly in America are subsidies that could be used to buy any sort of day care that met minimum quality standards. Conservatives like vouchers because they provide free choice, while teachers' unions, bitterly opposed to vouchers for public schools, have little stake in fighting subsidies for preschoolers. "Vouchers are the way to go," Suzanne Helburn, a University of Colorado researcher, said.
But there are problems. For one thing, linking vouchers to ability-to-pay -- reducing their value as family incomes grew -- would decrease incentives to work. Another problem is that quality might lose out to convenience. David Blau, together with Alison Hagy of Pomona College in California, found that simply reducing the price of care through subsidies would increase the demand for hours of care, but have little or no effect on the demand for quality as measured by group size, staff levels or training. This meshes with results of the National Association for the Education of Young Children's 1990 survey.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle, though, is the sheer expense. Ms. Bergmann did the arithmetic for a program that paid $4,800 a year for each preschooler from families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution and another $3,600 for before- and after-school programs for grade school children. In her hypothetical budget, subsidies were phased out for middle-income families and eliminated entirely for families in the top 40 percent. Even so, the total cost was over $61 billion a year, $49 billion more than is now being spent on Head Start, child care tax credits and other existing subsidies.
 
REGULATORY REFORM -- If the European model is a nonstarter and direct subsidies to parents are a problem, what is left? A less ambitious solution would seek to expand adequate, moderate-priced care by changing regulations.
Sandra Scarr of Kindercare points to staffing ratios. While she does not object to standards, she notes that most states effectively block the mixing of, say, toddlers with 3-year-olds by setting the minimum number of staff members in a classroom according to the needs of the youngest child. Giving centers the flexibility to combine age groups, she argues, would allow for greater continuity and save money, too.
More broadly, there is little hard evidence that staffing ratios alone have much impact on quality. Relaxing the minimums, therefore, could probably cut the cost of care without harming children -- particularly if states pressed for higher standards for training. It would also reduce the cost differential between licensed and unlicensed day care, giving parents an incentive to shift children to arrangements that are supervised by the states.
Others see potential in industry self-regulation and parental education. If accreditation had more status -- and parents were educated to notice -- day care providers would have more incentive to emphasize what really matters and save on the frills. "Parents don't know," Ms. Helburn said, "the positive aspects of what can happen in a really good center."

HEADLINE: Housing Sales Show New Life With Good Year

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
From the ashes of the late 1980's and early 1990's, the nation's residential real estate market is rising again. But don't count on another year as good as this one.
After being low almost everywhere for several years, sales of both new and existing houses hit all-time highs nationally and in most regions in 1996. 
 At the same time, house prices -- which had been flat or falling for years in many areas -- outpaced the official inflation rate of 2.9 percent in most areas of the United States.
"Nationally, it was the best year in terms of housing appreciation since 1987," said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
Even in the Northeast and Southern California, the most sluggish markets in the nation, there are signs of life again. For example, the median sale price of existing houses in New Jersey rose 4.4 percent this year, to $168,300. In New York, prices rose 2 percent, to $140,600. And in Connecticut, they gained 2.4 percent, to $137,400.
In Southern California, prices increased from 1 percent to 3 percent in Ventura County north of Los Angeles and in Orange County and San Diego to the south. Los Angeles County also eked out a modest gain. "Over all, we are expecting prices to rise 2 percent next year," G. U. Krueger, deputy chief economist with the California Association of Realtors, said.
Housing analysts credit low interest rates, a growing economy and improving consumer confidence for the strong real estate market across the nation.
"Employment was the driver this year," John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said. "A lot of people can get into the market now because the job anxieties they had been through have been resolved."
The real estate recovery does not presage a boom in 1997, however. There are no longer the same forces at play that contributed to the heady atmosphere of the mid-1980's, when it was common to see annual double-digit price increases, multiple offers and the speculative fever that even led some people to buy a house for a short period simply to sell it for a profit.
"People bought homes in the 70's and 80's under the assumption that it was an investment," Mr. Zandi said. "That source of demand has vanished in the 90's. Now, people are buying homes for a source of shelter and doing their investing in the stock market."
The main reason for the change in the house market is that inflation -- a curse to the stock market and a blessing to hard assets like gold and real estate -- has been tame. Another reason is that fewer people are buying their first house.
"The demographics of real estate are not nearly as strong in the 90's as when baby boomers were entering the market and driving up prices," Mr. Zandi said. "Now, most have bought their homes, so the demand for housing is much less than it was 20 years ago."
Indeed, the monthly number of house sales, when adjusted for seasonal variations, peaked in May this year and has been, for the most part, slipping ever since.
Even so, the market is not expected to collapse as it did in the early 1990's, when a lingering recession and downsizing fears spooked many potential buyers and stranded many would-be sellers.
In fact, economists predict that the number of houses sold nationally in 1997 will be only about 300,000 fewer than this year, when resales are projected to set an all-time record of 4.09 million.
"No disaster, no collapse, no recession -- it will just be a slowdown," Mr. Tuccillo said. "The soft landing for the economy is going to be mirrored by a soft landing for housing."
The overall improvement is starting to benefit the market for second homes as well. Beach houses seem to be the second home of choice, rather than ski condos or cabins in the woods. Much of the residential real estate along the Florida Gulf Coast, on some of the barrier islands off South Carolina and along the Atlantic Coast of Long Island has been appreciating at a rate of 10 percent to 20 percent for a year or two.
Nationally, prices of existing houses increased by about 5 percent in 1996, Mr. Zandi said, but gains are expected to be more sluggish in 1997, probably less than 3 percent. Over all, prices were strongest in the Rocky Mountain region, the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest. In those areas, house prices rose, on average, between 6.2 percent and 7.3 percent, according to Regional Financial Associates.
"We have a terrifically low inventory, and we do have buyers," said Marcia A. Royer, manager of the Sandpoint office of Windermere Real Estate, a large regional real estate broker based in Seattle. "Boeing is booming and tech is doing great, so the competition for homes gets driven up."
Seattle is a strong market, but others have been even stronger. The price of existing houses rose by 12.2 percent in Portland, Ore., and 11.7 percent in Colorado Springs.
But the bloom may be off the rose in the West. "It's starting to slow in the Rocky Mountains because California migration is slowing and home building is rampant," Mr. Zandi said. "The market is becoming overbuilt."
The best markets this year were in certain areas of the South and Midwest where new jobs are plentiful. Greenville, S.C., the site of a new BMW plant, recorded gains of 16.1 percent. Detroit, Memphis and South Bend, Ind., reported gains above 13 percent.
The weakest regions continue to be California, where prices rose over all just eight-tenths of 1 percent in 1996, and the mid-Atlantic states -- New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- where they increased only 3.7 percent.
To be sure, real estate sales and price gains vary widely within regions, as well as with the type of housing. For example, condominiums and co-op apartments, generally, are having a tougher time than single-family houses. And in most areas, the high and low ends of the market are faring better than midprice houses. (In the Northeast, midprice usually means houses priced between $250,000 and $500,000)
The decline in mortgage rates contributed to the recovery, but not as much as is commonly thought, according to Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates, a housing and interest rate analyst in Butler, N.J.
Conventional wisdom, Mr. Gumbinger said, holds that rising rates dampen demand, and lower rates increase demand. What tends to happen with housing, however, is that prospective buyers hold off while rates fall, and do not buy until after rates start rising again, a sign that rates may have bottomed.
Lower rates are also often a sign of weak demand for home loans, which, in part, explains why house sales are often at their worst when interest rates are, as they were in the early 90's, at their lowest. And sales are often fairly healthy when rates are relatively high, as they were in the 80's.
For much of the year, the Mortgage Bankers Association said, the average on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage tended to sink gradually from about 8.5 percent to 8.1 before falling to a low of about 7.5 percent this fall. In recent weeks, the rate has rebounded slightly.
"It's a good market, slow and steady growth," Ms. Royer said. "It's not going bananas like in the 80's, when people were so anxious to buy they were doing deals on the hoods of their cars. But that's O.K. We're better off this way, anyway."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Amid New Wealth of Trade, A Humanizing Movement

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Freeing international trade has been the flavor of the closing months of 1996. President Clinton successfully pressed his campaign for zero tariffs on Information Age technology, first at the meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders in Manila late last month, and then at the meeting of the World Trade Organization in Singapore two weeks ago.
But another vision of international trade was also taking shape -- the kind that brings the most economic and social benefits to poor people and to developing nations. 
 This vision of fair trade has scored some modest advances recently:
In London last month, the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industries -- which includes household names like Nike, Reebok and Adidas -- bowed to pressure from development-oriented charities like Oxfam, Christian Aid and Unicef by setting a Feb. 14 deadline for agreeing to a code of conduct to end the abuse of child labor in low-wage Asian factories. This breakthrough came after the International Labor Organization, a United Nations specialized agency, estimated that 250 million children under the age of 14 were working in developing countries.
The Ford Foundation is providing two modest grants totaling about $75,000 to help the American Fair Trade Association publish a directory of North American fair-trade organizations and stores -- entitled "Sweatshops or Fair Trade? Now You Have a Choice!" -- and to offer a new brand of fair-traded coffee next year.
In Singapore, the World Trade Organization's 128 members affirmed their support for humane working conditions in factories and agreed to uphold "internationally recognized core labor standards," including the right to form unions. They also agreed not to exploit child labor.
But under pressure from the developing countries, the international trade forum also said that industrial nations must not close their markets to exports from the third world.
Advocates of fair trade, sometimes known as alternative trade, seek to help developing countries sell their goods abroad for as much as they can, while also promoting acceptable working conditions.
In Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, fair trade is now quite big business, with total sales estimated at $400 million to $500 million a year. Europeans consume 12,000 tons of fair-traded coffee annually; Britain, Switzerland and the Netherlands all have small fair-trading supermarket chains. In London, Christian Aid and Oxfam are trying to persuade Britain's leading supermarket and clothing chains to carry fair-traded food and clothes.
In the United States and Canada, however, fair trade is still in its infancy, with annual sales no more than $40 million.
"American consumers are far less sophisticated than Europeans," said Mimi Stephens, executive director of the Fair Trade Federation, which includes 95 American organizations. "Most of them don't know where goods come from or what is going on in the rest of the world.
At first glance, fair trade looks like an attempt to interfere with the free play of market forces.
But most economists dispute this, arguing that the essence of a free market is a free choice for consumers and that fair trading actually offers them greater freedom by providing more information about merchandise for sale.
"Some people are prepared to pay a bit more for products produced in a socially responsible way," said Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Jagdish Bhagwati, a trade theorist at Columbia University, agrees, saying: "Goods have an array of characteristics, which include how they were made. It is perfectly proper to give consumers this information."
Fair trade organizations operate in three broad ways. Some buy crafts, artifacts and clothing from cooperatives and factories in developing nations that follow acceptable labor practices. They sell these goods in industrial nations, returning any profit to the producers as bonuses, better tools, and services that help design new and better products.
Two American organizations that operate this way are Serrv International and Ten Thousand Villages, based respectively in New Windsor, Md., and Akron, Pa. The two groups, which are affiliated with Mennonite churches, import crafts, furniture and clothes from about 50 developing nations, selling them by catalogue and church-related shops.
"We insist on reasonable working conditions," said Paul Meyers, Ten Thousand Villages' director, "but while we don't buy products made through the exploitation of children, we don't object to children learning a trade in a family workshop or village cooperative -- provided they also go to school."
With total sales of around $17.5 million last year, these two groups account for almost half of American fair trade products.
Other organizations include Market Place: Handwork of India, based in Evanston, Ill., which uses a catalogue to sell clothing and housewares made by poor Indian women, and Pueblo to People of Houston, which sells clothes and household items produced in Latin America.
Another approach to fair trade, favored for tropical agricultural goods like coffee and pineapple, is to buy direct from the grower, cutting out middlemen, and then sell the produce under a label certifying that it has been harvested and packed by adults, paid a fair wage and working under reasonable conditions.
The largest American fair-trade coffee importer is Equal Exchange, based in Canton, Mass. which buys coffee from farmers' cooperatives in Latin America and Tanzania. And while it will sell only $3.5 million worth of coffee this year in a $7 billion market, it says that its sales have doubled in two years.
The greatest success for fair trade labeling was scored not by a development organization but by a San Francisco-based conservation group, the Earth Island Institute. Earth Island sued over the slaughter of dolphins by tuna fishermen, and in the process helped sensitize North American and European consumers to the point that more than 90 percent of the canned tuna sold in these countries now carry certifications that the fish was caught in nets that spare the dolphins.
A third approach, popular with groups like Oxfam or Christian Aid, is to shame industries with extensive factories in the third world, like big sporting-goods makers, into setting minimum standards -- banning the use of child or convict labor, for instance.
The planned code of conduct for sporting-goods makers is clearly an example of this, as is another recent agreement banning child labor in the production of soccer balls.
But many developing countries remain intensely suspicious of such agreements, fearing that the West may try to find a pretext for closing off their import markets.
At their insistence, the final World Trade Organization statement adopted in Singapore calls on all countries to enforce humane working standards but says that such standards must be set not by the world body but by the International Labor Organization, and that failure to observe them does not justify protectionist measures.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
A Pennsylvania township's tax abatement program persuades a company to stay.

BYLINE: By David J. Wallace 

DATELINE: HORSHAM, Pa.

 BODY:
THE General Instrument Corporation is building a $65 million corporate campus in this township, about 20 miles north of downtown Philadelphia, taking advantage of a tax abatement program that helped persuade the company to consolidate a divisional headquarters here.
General Instrument, a maker of cable-TV and transmission equipment, now occupies various office buildings in Montgomery County, in both Horsham and the adjacent town of Hatboro. Its work force in the region totals about 1,000 people. 
 The new campus will have 480,000 square feet of space in four buildings, with space for a possible fifth building in the future, and parking for 1,220 cars. It covers 70 acres south of Route 611 in the Commonwealth Corporate Park -- a 300-acre project combining an office park and a golf course. The complex is scheduled to open next December.
Because Horsham, a predominantly residential suburban township, is trying to build its commercial tax base for the long term, General Instrument will have its taxes phased in over 10 years at a rate of 10 percent a year. Over all, tax abatements will save General Instrument an estimated $4.5 million in township, county and school district taxes, said Charles Ziccardi, vice president of site operations and telecommunications for General Instrument.
The company now pays more than $2 million in rent a year for 200,000 square feet of space in the region, Mr. Ziccardi said, but it has seen rapid growth soak up office space as quickly as new divisions and product lines are created. In May, after a two-year search, it bought the Horsham site from its developer, Matrix Development Group.
"The cost savings are going to be enormous" because of the tax breaks, Mr. Ziccardi said. "And we're going to give people the space they need. Now, we only own one building and rent 10 other facilities spread over a 10- or 15-mile radius. Part of the inefficiency in our operations right now is if people have to attend an internal meeting elsewhere it might take 30 minutes to get there."
Workers also communicate with two production plants in Mexico, another in Taiwan and a fourth in Texas, as well as with General Instrument's headquarters in Chicago. So each of the four new buildings will be connected via covered walkways, and a new telecommunications system will link the offices and plants with high-speed computer networks. Most of the company's growth has come in industries that did not exist three years ago, Mr. Ziccardi said.
In addition to the tax relief, an $11 million package of state and local loans will be used to improve local roads, and training grants for General Instrument will be available, though their amounts have not been specified, Mr. Ziccardi said.
Richard Johnson, vice president of development for Matrix Development, said the project went from document signing to groundbreaking in less than six months. He added that cooperation from state regulators, including promised road improvements, had already helped real estate activity increase in the area.
Horsham Township has only 22,000 residents in an area of 16 square miles. A small concentration of warehouse and office space was built in the town's southeast corner within a few miles of the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Willow Grove interchange in the 1960's, but much of the township's western reaches remained undeveloped.
When office development followed newer road construction to other parts of the region, commercial growth slowed in Horsham and older communities. Though the school district is nationally recognized, Mr. Johnson said, some developers are scared off by the district's high property tax rate.
That led state officials to create the local tax abatement option, said James Robinson, business services coordinator with Montgomery County's Department of Commerce and Economic Development. Local governments in Pennsylvania, unlike county governments, have no authority to levy wage taxes or to create alternative revenue sources, so a stagnating property-tax base can be particularly harmful.
"In this part of Pennsylvania, the real killer is not the county or township," Mr. Robinson said. "The highest tax paid on a physical property is to the school district. Keeping a company that size was a major accomplishment."

HEADLINE: Election Is 2 Years Away, But Californians Gear Up

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
As a measure of the prestige of leading the nation's biggest, richest and most politically powerful state, candidates and would-be candidates are already maneuvering for position in the 1998 race to succeed Pete Wilson as governor of California.
The Lieutenant Governor, Gray Davis, a Democrat, and the Attorney General, Daniel E. Lungren, a Republican, are both announced contenders. They are raising money and running hard for the job that inevitably confers upon the holder the additional quasi-title of "potential Presidential candidate." 
 And stirring in the political wings are half a dozen or so others who show varying signs of having a desire to preside over the Golden State.
Most notable are two prominent Democrats: Leon E. Panetta, the departing White House chief of staff and a former California Congressman, and Senator Dianne Feinstein. But the list also includes a popular Republican Mayor, Susan Golding of San Diego, and two lesser known Democrats, State Controller Kathleen Connell and Alfred A. Checchi, the multimillionaire co-chairman of Northwest Airlines.
Political professionals say, and the few polls available generally indicate, that Ms. Feinstein might run best in the field should she enter the race. And she very well might enter, given that she ran for the office in 1990, losing narrowly to Mr. Wilson, and given that California is one of the few states in which being governor is often viewed as superior to being a senator.
Still, while Ms. Feinstein may appear to be the early favorite to succeed Mr. Wilson, who cannot seek a third term because of term limits, Lieutenant Governor Davis and Attorney General Lungren are showing early strength, too. Each has a bulging campaign coffer, and Mr. Lungren has only one potential opponent in the party primary.
Generally, all of the candidates and would-be candidates are ideologically moderate, mainstream Democrats and Republicans who seem likely to fight out the primaries and the general election in the political middle. In fact, their ideology may turn out to be less important in 1998 than two other political factors: new rules governing campaign-financing and primary voting.
The money regulations, which take effect on Jan. 1 after being approved by the state's voters in November, hold that fund raising cannot begin for a race until the June primary is at least a year away.
But in the case of the first election affected, that of 1998, the prohibition will not be quite as restrictive. Money raised through Dec. 31, 1996, can be kept and added to that raised after next June.
As for the primaries, the new rules declared that they will henceforth be "open," meaning that registered Democrats can vote for Republican candidates and vice versa.
"These changes are very important and they make things very unpredictable," said Sherry Bibitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont Center for Politics and Economics.
Ms. Jeffe said she saw the open primary as "an invite for voter mischief" and a big challenge to candidates looking for support from groups outside their own party. And she predicted that the new money rules would adversely affect some candidates but not others.
"People like Davis and Lungren already have a lot of money raised," she said. "Others, like Feinstein, can raise it in a pinch, including putting in some of their own wealth. Or someone like Checchi can write personal checks forever. But a guy like Panetta -- now he's got a problem, not having time or his own money or much name recognition or grass-roots organization. He's got to think twice before jumping in."
Mr. Davis has raised about $3 million so far, while Mr. Lungren has raised almost $2 million.
Money is crucial to victory in statewide political contests in California, in part because the state is so big and diverse that expensive television advertising is about the only way to reach the majority of voters.
Ms. Feinstein, 63, has said several times that the money issue did not worry her, should she enter the race, because she had already run statewide three times and had a big donor base.
"I'm in good shape," she likes to say.
Political associates say the governorship appeals to Ms. Feinstein because, having been Mayor of San Francisco, she believes that chief executives have more power than legislators, who cast votes rather than give orders. Further, the associates say, she chafes at the thought of working on Capitol Hill in coming years with a Republican majority. Finally, she need not give up her Senate seat to run for governor. She is not up for re-election until 2000.
"She's got a lot of time and room to maneuver," said Bill Carrick, the Los Angeles campaign consultant who has worked with Ms. Feinstein in three previous campaigns.
Garry South, a top campaign aide to Mr. Davis, 53, questions the Carrick analysis.
"She's been beaten statewide once and almost beaten another time," Mr. South said, "and so she's got to know that she's vulnerable. We don't think her donor base is all that solid and our poll numbers say Gray can take her. She's facing a tough decision."
Mr. Panetta, 58, has said he will return to California from Washington early next year to "decompress" after four years in the White House and to ponder whether to get into another political race. He served 18 years in the House, representing the 16th Congressional District in the Monterey and Big Sur area.
A few weeks ago, he urged Ms. Feinstein to decide by early summer whether to get into the race. Mr. Panetta said that if she genuinely intended to run, "you not only owe it to yourself, but you owe it to others, to make it clear by that time."
As for the other Democrats most often mentioned as possible contenders for governor, State Controller Connell has recently stayed well in the background of the maneuvering. Mr. Checchi, the airline executive, said just a few days ago that he planned to make exploratory speaking trips around the state in the coming weeks.
On the Republican side, the possibility of a candidacy by Mayor Golding is still raised now and again, particularly given the good reviews she and her city got during the Republican National Convention. But the general expectation among state political professionals seems to be that Attorney General Lungren will probably be his party's unopposed choice to defend the Republicans' 16-year hold on the governorship.
"Dan got off to an early start and a good start." said Ken Khachigian, a leading California Republican strategist, "and if it stays that way, he'll likely breeze through the primary.
"The Mayor seems to have her eye on running for the Senate when Barbara Boxer comes up in '98. Boxer's as weak as any Democrat in the state. There's plenty to go around for us good Republicans."

HEADLINE: Business Gains With Democrats

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Last year George Kourpias, leader of the machinists union, used the opportunity of a Labor Day celebration to talk to President Clinton about one of his union's major concerns.
Mr. Kourpias told the President that he thought United States jobs and technology were threatened by the growing tendency of American companies wanting to do business abroad to make concessions to foreign governments or customers, especially in Asia. 
 Mr. Kourpias says the President told him that he, too, was concerned about this problem. As a result, White House and union officials say, the Clinton Administration promptly began reviewing the issue, focusing on concessions made by the aerospace industry, the crown jewel of American exporters and a major employer of machinists.
But by this year, unknown to union officials, the review was folded into an Administration report that, at the urging of aerospace industry lobbyists, adopted industry positions on the matter. The report also dropped recommendations the union had favored, like a requirement that companies make public disclosures about the concessions they gave.
The story of this report is one example of how business interests have gained influence with Democrats, at the expense of the Democrats' traditional allies like organized labor. At the same time, business donations to Democrats have vastly increased.
"The Clinton Administration cultivated the defense and aerospace industry, and in turn they fertilized the Democratic Party with campaign contributions," said Thomas Ferguson, a campaign finance expert and a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, at Boston.
The aerospace industry sees it differently.
"The Clinton Administration has decided to let the market be the market," said Joel Johnson, vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association, an organization that represents manufacturers of civilian and military aircraft.
Although large corporations continue to contribute large sums to the Republicans, corporate donations to the Democratic National Committee have more than doubled in four years, while union donations have stayed the same. For every dollar labor gave to the Democrats in 1991-1992, when Mr. Clinton was first elected, business gave four, but by 1995-1996, business donations exceeded labor by a ratio of more than 9 to 1, according to an analysis of election records by Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that favors public financing of elections.
In 1992, the Democratic Business Council of large donors had only 200 members. By 1994, it had 800; today it has 1,900.
And aerospace and defense companies, like the Boeing Company and United Technologies Corporation, have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic committee in the most recent election cycle, much more than they gave before Mr. Clinton's first election.
"Unfortunately, what has happened is that money has taken over what's going on in America," said Mr. Kourpias, whose union contributes to the Democratic committee, but far less than the industry. He said he was upset that his plea to Mr. Clinton about concessions in the aerospace industry fizzled while the Administration responds to companies, "who've given even more money."
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's National Economic Council, said the Administration disagreed with union arguments that concessions to foreign governments or customers had adversely affected United States jobs over all. But she said that "the situation merits close watching."
The Administration stepped into the middle of this policy thicket last summer when 19 agencies, led by the Commerce Department, prepared an annual export policy report for Congress. One section of that report dealt with offsets, which is a broad term covering a variety of trade practices in which companies make concessions in order to win sales or gain access to foreign markets. Last May, in a Congressionally mandated survey, 83 percent of businesses, mostly subcontractors, told the Commerce Department they had been adversely affected by offsets. Often offsets involve shifting some production or technology overseas.
Industry officials were critical of the survey's focus on job losses from offsets instead of on jobs created by export sales. And they were concerned about what the report would say about offsets.
When aerospace lobbyists obtained early drafts of the report, they were not pleased. One draft recommended efforts to limit commercial offsets but with little industry input, while another draft recommended new reporting standards for commercial offsets, industry and Administration officials said.
The reporting standards, one industry official said, were "the worst of all worlds for us, because the better it looks to your customer, the worse it looks to your unions."
The industry weighed in quickly and successfully. The final report released two months ago, in its section on offsets, focused only on military sales. Commercial offsets were mentioned in a brief footnote, which said the issue would be fully analyzed in next year's report.
On military offsets, the report took a cautious approach. It called for talks with industry, labor and trading partners leading to possible bilateral negotiations or changes in government policy, if warranted.
"We don't have enough data about commercial offsets," said William A. Reinsch, the under secretary of commerce for export administration. He added that "the Administration is trying to do a better job" by having a White House task force study the issue, referring to the task force prompted by Mr. Kourpias's chat with Mr. Clinton.
But that task force folded into the Commerce Department-led export policy report.
"We didn't do a report per se, we produced some draft reports, our own internal analysis and then all of this was superseded by the fact that there was going to be a chapter" on offsets in the export policy report, Ms. Tyson said.
And when the Administration, as part of the annual export policy report, debated whether to do something about commercial offsets, the White House came down on the side of industry in opposition to the measures, according to industry and government officials.
The measures were dropped, Ms. Tyson said, because officials "were not compelled by the evidence they had at their disposal."
All of this was unknown to union officials.
"We weren't aware of what was going on in the export report," Mr. Kourpias said. "That's not the way to play the game."
Ms. Tyson acknowledged that the White House only recently informed the union about the status of its study, long after the report was released. But the union may not have been following the issue as closely as when Mr. Kourpias first raised it with Mr. Clinton, White House officials said. Since then, the machinists have completed contract negotiations with companies like Boeing, the largest aerospace manufacturer.
"In the name of increased sales, companies do things they might not do otherwise" such as "shipping technology overseas, some of it taxpayer-funded technology, to companies who couldn't capture the market but who will wind up taking our own work away from us," said Lee Pearson, aerospace coordinator and vice president of the machinist union.
Companies say they are reluctant to give away too much expertise for fear of creating a competitor and point out that aircraft, America's biggest export, are still mostly made in America. But companies also say that to win new business and maintain their work force, they must make concessions. And so the percentage of foreign-made components in United States jetliners is steadily increasing, as is the percentage of foreign sales.
"You have to meet the customer's demand, you have to do what it takes to compete or you're not in business at all and you haven't done your worker any good," said Mr. Johnson of the aerospace association.
Mr. Reinsch said that industry officials privately acknowledged that offsets distorted a market economy but that they also feared that unilateral United States action, like the 1977 Federal law banning foreign bribes, would leave them unable to compete.
"They recognize they have to play by the existing rules or lack of rules until somebody changes them," he said, but "they don't want to call for an end to offsets because it will be seen as offending the Chinese."

 BODY:

U.S., to Protect Patients, Will Curb Doctors' Bonuses
The Federal Government has adopted a new policy limiting the types of bonuses that can be paid to reward doctors for controlling the cost of serving patients under Medicare and Medicaid, the programs for the elderly and the poor. In practice, the rules will set a standard for the entire managed-care industry.
In notices sent to H.M.O.'s around the country, the policy's purpose is described as being "to protect patients against improper clinical decisions made under the influence of strong financial incentives" offered to doctors by H.M.O.'s. [Page A1.]
 
Dow Average Rises 33.83 Points
Stocks advanced in an abbreviated session, led by an upswing in the shares of some big technology companies. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.83 points, to 6,522.85, moving within 25 points of its record close on Nov. 25 of 6,547.79, and bringing its rise this year to 27.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.11, to 1,287.63. [D4.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond unchanged at 6.58 percent. [D14.]
 
I.R.S. Seeks to Ease Merger Rules
The I.R.S. has proposed easing rules governing some tax-free mergers and acquisitions. Tax specialists said that the change would save companies millions of dollars in taxes. [D2.]
 
Calenergy Said to Win Utility Bid
Calenergy of the United States claimed victory in its $1.55 billion hostile takeover offer for Northern Electric, a British regional electricity supplier. Calenergy thus became the fourth American buyer of a British utility in the last two years. [D3.]
 
Huntsman to Buy Texaco Plant
The Huntsman Corporation said it had agreed to buy the last piece of Texaco's chemical business, a plant at Port Neches, Tex., that makes gasoline additives and industrial foam, for $600 million. [D2.]
 
Dollar Rallies Against Swiss Franc
The dollar rallied to a 28-month high of 1.3465 Swiss francs in Europe, reflecting concerns about the Swiss economy. It also gained against the yen and the mark. [D11.]
 
Full Planes for the Holidays
In a colorful promotional display, Austrian Airlines has painted an Airbus A321 with portraits of 24 famous Austrians, including Mozart. Airlines have had little trouble filling their flights lately, with travel at or near record levels for months. Edwin McDowell: Business Travel. [D4.]
 
Progress Made Toward Fair Trade
Fair trade, as well as free trade, has made progress this year. Oxfam, Christian Aid and Unicef have persuaded companies like Nike, Reebok and Adidas to take steps to curb labor abuses in poor countries. [D3.]
 
A Stitch in Jordan Saves Dollars
Veiled Palestinian women stitch panties headed for a Victoria's Secret, including labels saying "Made in Israel." But the women are in Jordan, where costs are about half what they would be in Israel -- they earn about $100 a month. The arrangement is legal, for there is also production in Israel, and the Jordanian plant also serves other brands, including, Donna Karan, J. Crew and Bali. [A6.]
 
Nikko to Rescue Affiliates
Nikko Securities said that it would inject $1.3 billion into three affiliates to write off bad loans and that it would have a loss of 95 billion yen for the fiscal year as a result. Nikko is the third of Japan's four biggest brokerage firms to provide aid to debt-ridden affiliates. [D3.]

HEADLINE: Day Care: Quality vs. Equality;
Parents Most in Need May Have the Least Access

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

DATELINE: CLARK, N.J.

 BODY:
It's 10 A.M., and the parents of some 90 infants, toddlers and preschoolers in this white-collar suburb about an hour's drive southwest of Manhattan know exactly where their children are.
Life within the cheerful, pristine confines of Kindercare's "learning center" is safe, cozy and, above all, predictable. On this sunny, not-too-chilly morning, the older children are busy attacking the plastic playground equipment, while inside the 3-year-olds are puzzling over cut-paper shapes and the babies are snoozing in their green and white cribs. In the kitchen, the cook is preparing pizza-like "Italian dippers" with broccoli for lunch from a four-week rotation that runs from meat loaf to toasted cheese. 
 If Kindercare Learning Centers' new owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, has its way, tens of thousands more preschoolers will soon be sampling the menu. While Kohlberg Kravis, the leveraged buyout specialist, declined to discuss its plans for Kindercare until the formalities are completed next month, Clifton Roberts, a general partner, has made no secret of the firm's wish to capitalize on Kindercare's good will.
"K.K.R. intends to support the expansion of Kindercare through internal growth and acquisitions while continuing to promote industry-leading education and quality standards," Mr. Roberts explained in the Oct. 3 announcement of the buyout. And despite a tangled financial past, Kindercare is probably better positioned to expand than its rivals. It has long experience in operating a nationwide network and a strong reputation in the upper-middle end of the day care market.
But the obstacles to success in the child care business are substantial, a quandary that reflects both the problematic economics of day care and a cultural failure to adjust to the consequences of expecting mothers with young children to work.
There are several reasons. Care of the sort provided by Kindercare's Clark center -- $150 to $205 a week -- is out of financial reach of many families. And many others do not want it: though experts say preschoolers benefit from the social context and stimulation of quality day care, many working parents prefer to re-create, with a mother-surrogate, a more traditional setting, even if it offers little more than baby-sitting.
"Parents and developmental psychologists disagree about what is best for children," said David Blau, an economist at the University of North Carolina, who has studied child care providers. "And many parents just don't want to pay for what the psychologists want."

Quality Care Comes at a Price
Two-thirds of American women with preschool children now work, including half the women with infants under a year old. Yet a survey of 400 day care centers in four states, conducted in 1995 by a team led by Susan Helburn, an economist at the University of Colorado, rated the quality "poor" to "mediocre" in six out of seven centers. While most centers "meet children's basic health and safety needs," she concluded that few help to develop language, math and social skills, leaving even the children of America's middle class inadequately prepared for less sheltered environments.
Less is known about "family" child care -- care in other people's homes. For while friends, grandparents and neighbors are the ones who most often must provide a safe, stimulating environment for preschoolers, the average quality varies widely from the most nurturing to the most neglectful.
For many parents, its great advantage is cost: full-time child care in this largely unregulated part of the market runs $40 to $100 a week, just half the cost of unsubsidized care in a group center.
But it is group day care centers to which more and more American families are necessarily turning.
Today, just 3 percent of preschoolers with working mothers are left at home with nannies, according to Barbara Willer, a consultant to the National Association for the Education of Young Children. That is down from 15 percent in 1965. And of the 20 million children now under kindergarten age, some 6 million spend at least part of the day in one of America's 100,000 group day care centers.
Indeed, Roger Neugeberger, publisher of the Child Care Information Exchange, an industry newsletter, reports that virtually all growth in the market has been in the centers.
For years, the accepted wisdom has been that any solution to the day care problem would require a big injection of Government cash. Roger Brown, the president of Bright Horizons, a company that manages 125 up-market day care centers for corporate and government clients, offers the most common view. "It's much like a famine in the midst of a well-fed world," he said. "Good day care is out there, but the average person simply can't afford it."
 
Margins Are Thin; Mergers Are Sparse
But while more money to subsidize day care is clearly necessary to meet the needs of lower-income families and welfare mothers who are going to be required to work under the new welfare law, no level of government is likely to aim much money in the direction of Kindercare and others that cater to the middle class.
Moreover, investors, like Kohlberg Kravis, that are looking to make a profit in child care must contend with the willingness of small-scale entrepreneurs to enter the business with operations that run on razor-thin margins. Of the roughly 35,000 centers run as businesses designed to make a profit, 29,000 are little more than a single operation -- often a converted house or a storefront. And in contrast to many other service industries, there is no clear trend to consolidation.
Mr. Brown of Bright Horizons thinks he knows why: economies of scale in the business are modest. While chains can save a bit on supplies, training, insurance, real estate and marketing, most of the cost is in labor. The chains have some hiring advantages in being able to offer group fringe benefits and opportunities for promotion. "We can get quality employees for $2 less in hourly wages," said Miriam Liggett, a regional vice president of Kindercare, who started as an assistant teacher.
But the chains face disadvantages, too, in competing directly with the "mom-and-pop" centers whose owners impute little cost to their own long hours on the job.
And there seems to be limited value to brand recognition. While parents may be relieved to find the same Big Mac in Pittsburgh or Prague, they have mixed emotions about the assembly line image in child care. "There is some brand-name premium" for chains that contract to manage centers for others, Mr. Brown concluded. But the contract business represents a small part of the commercial market.
Kindercare clearly wants to break out of the slow-growth mold. The company, which was founded in 1969, stumbled badly in the late 1980's after it was saddled with a huge debt in a buyout engineered by Drexel Burnham Lambert. It spent part of 1992 and 1993 in Chapter 11. But Kohlberg Kravis, which agreed to pay stockholders $467 million, has pledged to provide $175 million in new equity capital, plus a $300 million line of bank credit.

Market and Mandate Determine Costs
But can that injection overcome the inherent difficulties of running day care centers at a return high enough to provide money for further expansions?
A look at the finances shows just how hard it will be. Sandra Scarr, the president of Kindercare, who previously led a research program in developmental psychology at the University of Virginia, would not reveal the actual budget for the Clark center. But she provided enough detail to piece one together. Most of Clark's costs, it seems, are dictated by a combination of competition in the labor market and the State of New Jersey, which regulates health and safety at day care centers and sets minimum staffing ratios for each age group served.
Every classroom at the Clark center has a full-time lead teacher earning $9 to $12 an hour, including benefits, along with enough full-time $8- to $10-an-hour assistants and part-time $6- to $8-an-hour assistants to satisfy the state. New Jersey requires one staff member for every 4 infants, one for every 7 toddlers and one for every 10 children between 2 1/2 and 4. With a mix that requires roughly one worker for 7 children at an average cost of $9 an hour, classroom labor runs a bit less than $1.30 an hour for each child.
Clark is open from 6:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M., or 60 hours a week -- a necessity, said Kristy Sugg, director of the Clark center, because "most of our parents drop them off early on the way to work and pick them up late." Presumably, a full complement of workers is not needed across the entire day. Figure full staffing for just 50 hours a week, and the direct labor cost alone comes to $65 a child.
Each Kindercare center has a director and an assistant director. In a relatively high wage area like Clark, the two earn a total of $60,000 to $80,000, including health benefits and virtually free child care. Figure supervisory costs (including regional and national management) at a minimum of $10 weekly a child when the center is running at 80 percent of its full capacity of 200.
Then there is real estate. Kindercare designs and builds its own centers for about $1.9 million in high-cost areas like suburban New Jersey. It probably takes at least 15 percent a year for capital and maintenance, or $285,000. Assuming the center runs at 80 percent of capacity, the weekly cost for each child is about $35. Food (breakfast, lunch, two snacks), insurance, cleaning, classroom supplies and marketing costs are harder to pin down, but $50 a week is conservative.
All told, then, Kindercare needs revenues of about $160 a week from each child for a spanking new, high-cost center like Clark to break even at 80 percent capacity. Currently, the fees run $205 for infants, $180 for toddlers, $165 for 2 1/2 to 3 years and $150 for 4 and above. This leaves only modest room for profit, "but it is all the market can bear," said Susan Liddy, the New York regional coordinator for Kindercare.
In lower-wage regions and states that permit lower staffing levels, Kindercare can break even for as little as $130 a week from each child, Dr. Scarr said. She added that the company is considering centers with fewer amenities, but doesn't expect that costs could be cut by more than 10 to 20 percent without compromising features that Kindercare considers important. "Shiny playground equipment and hot lunches just aren't much of the bill," she explained.

Looking at Life Through '57 Glasses
At a minimum, high-quality day care -- with the higher staffing levels and wages that Mr. Brown of Bright Horizons said were needed -- would cost $9,000 a year. But even Kindercare's bare-bones $130 a week comes to $6,500 for a 50-week year, or a bit more than 10 percent of the median income of a family with two adults employed full-time. Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that the average center charges less than $5,000, with consequently lower care. Indeed, fully 40 percent of the centers in the Helburn study were rated "inadequate" for infants and toddlers.
What seems clearest in the decidedly murky world of day care is that progress will be piecemeal. In part, this follows from the cost: the tens of billions of dollars needed annually to assure first-class care for all preschool children will not be easily found in family budgets. And the Federal Government, cutting back everywhere else, is certainly not about to fill the gap.
Perhaps the largest impediment to change is Americans' failure to acknowledge, for better and worse, that the 1950's world of "Leave It To Beaver," and "Father Knows Best," is history and that Mom is working outside the home for good. Until attitudes reflect the reality, day care is likely to remain the latch-key kid of public policy. Meanwhile, Roger Brown concluded, "the people who need good child care most are the people least likely to get it."

HEADLINE: Change and Renewal in a Heartland City

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE -- A Christmas Portrait

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Dec. 24

 BODY:
The year is winding down now. The holidays are on everyone's mind. In downtown Canton at the Church of the Savior (President William McKinley's church), the Rev. William Harvey has delivered his sermon on keeping Christmas holy, draping the nativity scene on the altar with Christmas clearance ads to dramatize "how we bury Christ in a wilderness of consumerism."
Charles Dickens's "Christmas Carol" enjoyed a near-sellout run for the 15th year in a row at the Cultural Center for the Arts on Market Avenue. At the Hoover vacuum cleaner factory, on Main Street in the center of North Canton, hundreds of townspeople gathered on the company lawn for the annual Christmas tree lighting as puffs of steam floated out of the plant's smokestack, up into the cold night sky. Santa Claus arrived on the hook and ladder fire engine donated to the city by the Hoover Company, and then the children followed him across Maple Street to the lobby of the Y.M.C.A. 
 As usual, the entire tree lighting event was broadcast live on the county's largest radio station, WHBC.
The elections seem far away now, though in 1996 this middle American place again offered an unobstructed view of the forces shaping national politics. Stark County picked President Clinton by 8 percentage points, his exact national margin. It re-elected every local incumbent, including its Republican Congressman, Ralph Regula, just as the nation re-elected a Republican Congress.
But that was November. Politics? At Christmas? Stark's Young Democrats held a Christmas party at the Geisen Haus restaurant on Wednesday night. There are 79,594 registered Democrats in the county, and this party attracted eight of them. Worse yet, all eight were young Democratic men.
The citizens of Canton are at home, quiet, with family; the big factories are closed for the holiday break, and in a year when the economy played such a strong role in the election, this is a moment to look back on how people fared, from the well-to-do to the poor, who are about to be introduced to welfare reform.
The year 1996 will be remembered as a prosperous one, which was the biggest reason for Mr. Clinton's victory here. Unemployment stayed ow, and shopping reached new heights, as Stark got a second major suburban complex, the Strip, featuring the area's first mega-bookstore, a Borders, its first Baby Superstore and its third OfficeMax.
In the boardrooms, the news is mostly very good this December. The Timken Company, Hoover and Diebold continued to adapt their operations to the global market, enjoying another year of strong profits, which once again will mean substantial bonuses and stock option packages for top executives.
At Hoover, Brian Girdlestone, the president, said, "This is our third year of double-digit sales growth. The company is prospering." There were hopeful signs, too, that Hoover and its union have made peace.
Labor relations had been bad since Mr. Girdlestone announced last spring that to stay competitive with Eureka, Hoover would make its newest upright model in Texas, at a nonunion factory paying half the $14.50 hourly wage that the 2,000 Hoover plant workers make here.
Grievances by the union suddenly shot up. In turn, the company stepped up "bucket checks" (security inspections of lunch boxes), wrote up workers for smoking in bathrooms and reading during down time, and restricted the access that the union president, Jim Repace, had on the factory floor. In early November Mr. Repace said relations were the worst he had seen in 25 years.
But recently, Mr. Girdlestone and Mr. Repace agreed to get along. The company has announced that it will add a new motor line that will mean 40 new jobs here, and Mr. Girdlestone says he is looking to add more jobs to offset the 200-plus that went south.
Since Hoover was bought by Maytag in 1989, people have watched to see whether the company would continue its century-old business and philanthropic commitment to North Canton, or whether that would change under outside ownership. Is Hoover still Hoover? Asked whether Stark will be Hoover's principal manufacturing base over the long term, Mr. Girdlestone said, "I believe it will."
Mr. Repace, the union leader, said: "Things seem to be back to normal. Neither side is talking about the past. We agreed to let it go."
The Hoover plant is closed from Dec. 24 to Jan. 2 for its usual Christmas break. "That's negotiated time off with pay," Mr. Repace said.
 
The Unprosperous
Working Overtime To Stay in Place
But if it is a good Christmas for the middle-aged men and women lucky enough to still have union manufacturing jobs, there is still a substantial part of the middle class here working overtime not to lose ground. In the last decade, thousands of good-paying factory jobs have been lost here. Help wanted signs for minimum wage jobs are everywhere.
Raphiel Carter is a tired man this Christmas. It's been 13 Christmases since Dyneer, a supplier for the automobile industry, closed its Canton plant. Mr. Carter was making $10 an hour then as a union auto worker. Today he is still making about $10 an hour -- but he has to work two nonunion jobs, 80 hours a week.
His main job pays $5.60 an hour at DLH Industries, one of many outsourcing companies that have sprung up here to produce low-cost auto parts -- in this case, primarily for General Motors.
He has recently been training on a machine that makes windshield wiper parts. The job pays a piecework incentive, and it could earn him $2 or $3 more a day.
"You can only do it a couple of times a week," he said. "You're snapping a spring into a plastic tube and your wrists hurt bad. Even with gloves, your hands get raw."
Last summer a union organizer held meetings with DLH workers as they ended their shift. "I was so tired," said Mr. Carter, who finishes at 10:45 P.M. "I had to be at my day job at 8 in the morning." About 20 workers were at his midnight meeting. "People aren't satisfied, but they're afraid," he said. The company raised wages 50 cents an hour and the organizing drive failed.
"It's not that bad a place," Mr. Carter said of DLH. "We get some paid holidays. You get dental and vision. You get three paid days for a funeral. The only thing is wages. You can't live on $5.60 an hour."
DLH's owner, Doug Houck, said: "I agree. I do also wish the wages were higher."
Mr. Houck started his privately held company 20 years ago with one machine, and has built it into five plants and 500 workers.
He says the very reason companies like his started was that the big auto makers wanted to cut costs by getting work done without having to pay a union wage.
"We're in a vise," Mr. Houck said. "They want stateside workers at Mexican wages. They put out a contract for bid with strict cost specifications and if we don't meet it, they go someplace else."
He added, "We made a 1 percent return after taxes on sales. I'm not a high liver. I drive an '88 El Dorado. I live in a house that's not as nice as some guys who work for me."
His plant stays open during Christmas week.
 
The Poor
Much Confusion On Welfare Reform
And the poor? The good news is that volunteerism continues to thrive here. The United Way of Stark County met its fund-raising goal again this year, which was the lead story on the front page of The Repository, Canton's daily newspaper, the day it was announced.
The bad news is it's never enough. The Stark Hunger Task Force has served 15,000 meals at the county's 18 soup kitchens this month. All 229 beds in Stark's homeless shelters have been full the entire year. And in the last month, 18 families seeking emergency shelter were turned away.
At a time when a Republican Congress and a Democratic President are working to shift authority from the Federal to the local level, the No. 1 political question for Christmases yet to come is: Are the people of Stark County ready to shoulder a greater local responsibility?
Welfare reform will be the first test, and the early returns are not promising. Last month voters here defeated an effort to keep the public buses running; they rejected a quarter cent increase in the county sales tax that was needed to make up for Federal budget cuts. It is one of the things that makes Stark County's residents typical of the nation today: they repeatedly vote against new taxes.
Donald Pond, who oversees county welfare here, has to figure out how the people he is about to force off the dole and into minimum-wage jobs are going to get to work. "Beats me," he said.
To sit with Mr. Pond and his deputy, Susan Whitmore -- two people as knowledgeable as most anyone in Ohio about welfare reform -- is to realize that on this issue, the nation is making it up as it goes along. They don't know answers to basic questions, like the time limit for how long a person can be on welfare. There is a five-year limit under the new Federal law and a three-year limit over a five-year period under a Federal waiver given the state this year.
For now, the waiver takes precedence, but when the waiver expires does a person get five extra years of Federal eligibility? Does the waiver mean that after getting three years of welfare in five years, a person is entitled to three more years over the following five years?
"That's what so confusing," Mr. Pond said. "You have state law, but a Federal waiver----."
"See, that's what's confusing," Ms. Whitmore interjected.
Mr. Pond asked, "Do we have the latest fax of----."
"That's what's so confusing," Ms. Whitmore said. "We're getting Federal faxes and state faxes."
The new Federal law lets states provide strict penalties for welfare recipients who do not fulfill their work obligation. For a first offense, the parent does not get his or her share of the welfare check for a month; second offense, the entire family loses its check for a month; third offense, the entire family loses two months' checks; fourth offense, six months.
County officials assume this will mean more children will be taken from parents and placed in foster care. But there is no extra money for foster care. Will it be a problem?
"We don't know," said George Arnold, who oversees Stark's child welfare programs. "We don't know if the sky is going to fall on us or if it will just be an acorn."
Family court officials here, like Judge Julie Edwards and Sally Efremoff, a magistrate, both Republicans, worry that an already overburdened juvenile criminal system will not be able to cope with more disintegrating families.
Steve Miller, director of Stark's United Way, has warned that there is no extra charity money available to compensate for government cuts.
 
The Welfare 'Consumer'
Many Questions, But Few Answers
The United Way has a government relations committee that is trying to plan the agency's role in the welfare overhaul. Most at the December meeting have spent all their professional lives in the social welfare field. They could not have sounded more lost.
"Are we looking at providing Band-Aids when services are cut?" asked Martha Lottman, a community activist.
"Do we want to study this or take the role as a change agent?" asked Eve Brown, director of a family service agency.
"As long as someone else will act as a change agent," Ms. Lottman replied.
"We don't really know that," Ms. Brown said.
Harold Oswell, of Goodwill Industries said: "I'd like to be more involved in the positive. At Goodwill, we've always believed in the power of work."
Greg Pringle, an Urban League leader, asserted: "These people are just going to become cheap labor. That's how a capitalist society views them."
After an hour and a half, Ms. Brown said, "It feels like we're not ready to move forward on this." And Michael Weddle, a local planning director, said, "I'm lost, quite frankly."
"Can I say something?" said Tifinie Heckman, who was holding her 2-month-old son Malcolm. Ms. Heckman, 27, a single mother and a high school dropout, was the committee's "consumer" representative. She has spent eight years on welfare.
"It's hard to understand all the big words and just exactly what it is you're talking about," she began. "I have five children -- the oldest is 8 -- I don't have a college education and I don't see that taking us off welfare will help. I don't want to stay on welfare all my life. It's not something you brag about, but I rely on it. I have a special-needs child." Her 5-year-son is autistic and epileptic.
"As you know, the buses are thinking about not running, so how will we get to jobs?" she asked. "I know they were going to cut welfare, but I didn't know it was like this."
The only place she has ever worked is at a Burger King.
 
The Holiday Spirit
Reviving the Ghost Of Christmas Past
One of Canton's holiday traditions is "A Christmas Carol," at the Cultural Center, a complex built with Timken money. The play is put on by a volunteer cast, people like Joe Martuccio, who ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for judge in November. This month he has been an inspired Mr. Fezziwig.
The show, which runs for a month, is always the Players Guild's biggest money-maker and consumes a lot of time for many busy people. Mr. Martuccio, for one, says he has done it these last 12 years because of the play itself. "This is a powerful story of spiritual redemption," he said.
The staging is as good as anything in the big cities, complete with English storefronts, 19th-century costumes, drifts of fake snow, a Ghost of Christmas Past flying through the air and a 14-foot-tall, black-veiled Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come that rises from the orchestra pit on a state-of-the-art hydraulic stage lift.
Mr. Martuccio is struck each year by how true the play still feels. Even at the most festive moments, Dickens rarely lets a scene go by without ragged men, women and children huddled round a fire on a cold street corner. To see it again is to be reminded that time passes, but not much changes. Underlying so much of contemporary politics, of Bill Clinton versus Newt Gingrich, of Franklin Roosevelt's legacy versus Ronald Reagan's, the question remains: How much can capitalism be unfettered and still be safe?
After 23 performances, the play closed Sunday on the same note as the prose version did 143 years ago in Charles Dickens's London, with Scrooge better than his word and Bob Cratchit's boy, Tiny Tim (actually, Jimmy Jeffries, a third grader at Our Lady of Peace on 39th Street), shouting, "God bless us everyone!" Then the audience spilled into the lobby, where the cast greeted them, wishing all a merry Christmas.
 
An American Place
This year, as so often in the past, the residents of Canton and surrounding Stark County in northeast Ohio mirrored the national vote for President, selecting Bill Clinton by 8 percentage points. This is the 38th and final article in a yearlong series that has explored the forces that have shaped the political debate at the grass roots. (Previous articles are available to computer users on The New York Times on the Web, at http://www.nytimes.com/specials/canton.)

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Serb President Incited Protesters

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Intensifying its criticism of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, the United States today accused him of organizing and inciting protesters who battled in the streets of Belgrade with demonstrators protesting against his Government.
As tensions in Belgrade mounted with today's clashes, the State Department issued one of the Clinton Administration's strongest condemnations of Mr. Milosevic since his decision to annul municipal elections won by the opposition last month provoked a series of protests. 
 While calling on both sides to refrain from violence, which today included fights with knives and sticks and at least one shooting, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott laid all the blame for today's bloodshed directly on Mr. Milosevic and his Government.
In a strongly worded statement, Mr. Talbott repeated the warning, first made by Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Brussels two weeks ago, that Serbia could face renewed economic sanctions. He also reiterated the United States demand that Mr. Milosevic negotiate with leaders of opposition parties who won the elections in 15 of 18 cities, including Belgrade, the capital.
"The Serbian authorities have flagrantly and provocatively chosen to heighten tensions by bringing thousands of people into Belgrade to confront peaceful demonstrations by the opposition," said Mr. Talbott, serving as Acting Secretary of State while Mr. Christopher is on vacation in California.
Since Mr. Milosevic annulled the election results, the United States has grown increasingly critical of the Serbian President, even though the Administration relied heavily on him during the negotiations last year in Dayton, Ohio, that led to the peace accords for Bosnia. It has repeatedly called on him to recognize the election results and to begin talks with opposition leaders.
At a meeting of NATO's Foreign Ministers in Brussels this month, Mr. Christopher threatened tough new sanctions and persuaded all of the NATO allies to join in a condemnation of Mr. Milosevic's Government. Administration officials, however, have stopped short of moving to reimpose the economic sanctions imposed during the war in Bosnia, which were lifted after the Bosnian peace agreement.
"We have warned the Serbian Government that violence against the protesters will have serious consequences and will inevitably lead to Serbia's further isolation from the international community," Mr. Talbott said in today's statement.
So far the condemnations appear to have had little effect on Mr. Milosevic. Echoing the protesters in Belgrade, officials here have accused him of recruiting the counter-demonstrators. On Monday a spokesman for the State Department, Glyn Davies, derided them as "rent-a-crowd" protesters.
The senior American envoy in Belgrade, Richard Miles, met today with Serbia's Foreign Minister, Milan Milutinovic, and urged the Government to halt the attacks on protesters. Mr. Talbott said a similar message was sent to opposition leaders, calling on them to avoid violence, but he did not blame them for the clashes.

HEADLINE: Snow Making Delights Skiers but Alarms Conservationists

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HUNTER, N.Y.

 BODY:
Hunter Mountain Ski Bowl began the season in November with the whir of machinery pumping water at 9,000 gallons a minute for its snow-making operation.
The self-described "snow making capital of the world," Hunter has been in operation as a ski resort since 1959. But the snow making that has made the 4,040-foot mountain famous has also led to years of litigation and legal disputes. 
 Several conservation groups have sued the State Department of Environmental Conservation for failing to safeguard Schoharie Creek, where Hunter gets it water for snow making.
Fishermen say the Shanty Hollow Corporation, which operates Hunter Mountain's pumping equipment, is ruining a trout stream by lowering the water level and therefore destroying fish eggs and the insects that fish eat. The anglers also charge that after Shanty Hollow violated the terms of state permits by withdrawing more water than legally allowed, the state permitted the corporation to pump even more water.
The years of wrangling have resulted in a split between fishermen and skiers; between the traditional Catskill angler and hard-partying ski buffs from nearby cities. It has also pitted the Slutzky family, which owns the ski bowl, against fishermen who accuse them of arrogantly diverting water for their own purposes.
Shanty Hollow runs its water-use program under the terms of a 1992 consent order issued by the State Department of Environmental Conservation. The order allows withdrawals to lower the stream flow to 11 cubic feet per second, and as low as 5 feet at certain times.
That is far too low, said Jonathan Director, co-chairman of the conservation committee of the Theodore Gordon Fly Fishers, a fishing and conservation group in New York City. Mr. Director, a lawyer, is an avid fly fisherman and skier. but he refuses to ski at Hunter.
The Theodore Gordon Fly Fishers, along with the state chapter of Trout Unlimited, is appealing a March 14 decision by Justice Lawrence E. Kahn of State Supreme Court in Albany that upholds current withdrawal levels.
"Hunter has been rewarded for violating the terms of the original agreement drawn up in 1980 that regulated their water use," Mr. Director said. "Shanty Hollow was given a withdrawal limit 16 years ago, which they ignored. The D.E.C.'s response was to allow them to continue to take as much water as they wanted."
Shanty Hollow was served with a complaint by the state in February 1990 for violating a 1980 consent order specifying that no water was to be drawn from the creek when it was running at 10 cubic feet per second or lower.
After a series of studies, the D.E.C. issued the 1992 order. Various conservation groups felt its terms were too generous, and filed suit to have the department reconsider. But Justice Kahn upheld the consent order, calling it a "rational determination" by the department.
For its part, the D.E.C. says it is still working on the problem. "The order is an interim measure," a department spokesman, Gary Sheffer, said. "We are working on developing water withdrawal levels that both the mountain and the fishing groups are comfortable with."
No one disputes that Hunter is an economic engine of Greene County. Hunter had 285,000 ski visits in the 1995-96 ski season, paid $500,000 in sales and property taxes, and will employ close to 500 people at the height of this ski season.
A lawyer for Shanty Hollow, Thomas West, said that the fishermen's claims that Hunter's water use is harming fish have no basis in fact. He said studies have shown no evidence that the fish population of the creek is diminished by the water withdrawals.
"We have found healthy brown trout populations just downstream from Shanty Hollow's water diversion," Mr. West said. "Anyone who says that Hunter is harming the fish in the creek is either uninformed or unwilling to fact the facts." He said the goal was a balanced use of Schoharie Creek, between fishermen and skiers.
Chet Karwatowski, vice president for the state chapter of Trout Unlimited, said the group was continuing its legal battle because Hunter Mountain had been given too much leeway.
"The water diversion has certainly affected the game-fish population over the years," he said. "Anyone who knows the stream can tell you that."
The Catskill Center for Conservation and Development is not part of the appeal, but it is still worried about the water withdrawal.
"We reached an agreement with the Ski Bowl that set an absolute 15 cubic feet per second withdrawal limit for the creek," the group's associate director, Ike Icard, said. "Anything below that concerns us."
That agreement formed the basis of the center's conditional support for Hunter's expansion plan, which was proposed earlier this year. The proposal would have doubled the size of the resort and would require an amendment to the state's Constitution because it involves a trade between public and private lands. It was passed in the State Senate but was not brought up for a vote in the Assembly.
The president of Hunter Mountain Ski Bowl, Russell Coloton, said that the expansion proposal was on the back burner and that the main concern now was simply running the mountain.
"We'll keep the deal we made with the Catskill Center," he said. "But stream flows are in the 80's right now, so water hasn't become an issue."

Miracle of Manhattitlan: A Town Transformed

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: TEHUIXTLA, Mexico

 BODY:
Over the years, hundreds of townspeople have boarded up their homes, leaving this village of cactus and adobe to seek new livelihoods in and around New York City.
So for much of the year, Tehuixtla (pronounced teh-WIXT-lah) is a ghost town. But at Christmas the migration reverses, and the village stirs with new life as hundreds of adopted New Yorkers and New Jerseyans return home on an annual pilgrimage. 
 "At this time of year, Tehuixtla becomes Little New York," said Manuel Aguilar, the Mayor.
In her tidy home off Tehuixtla's grassy plaza, Celsa Garcia, recently returned from Garfield, N.J., has finished decorating a Christmas tree and is tending a simmering pot of chickens and chile.
A few houses away, Teresa Aguilar de Guerrero, who lives 11 months of the year on East 124th Street in Manhattan, is sweeping a year's dust out of her family's mango-shaded home.
And up a dirt street, Rosa Maria Fernandez, who has recently come back to Mexico from Portchester, N.Y., is hanging Christmas pinatas from a mesquite tree.
Mexican emigration to the United States is rarely a one-time, one-way journey; instead, most who travel north in search of work return home occasionally, often to spend a month or more with family in their home villages during the Christmas holidays. Reflecting this annual cycle, Mexico's highways, airports and bus terminals have become jammed in recent weeks with homeward-bound travelers.
This southward peregrination is a Mexican national rite, but it has taken on special importance in Tehuixtla, a village in the state of Puebla 140 miles southeast of Mexico City that would most likely disappear altogether were it not for the economic boost and spiritual infusion represented by the emigrants' annual return.
Townspeople consider their year-end reunion here so sacred that they plan Tehuixtla's Christmas posadas, in which candle-bearing villagers parade on 12 consecutive nights from house to house bearing statues of Mary and Joseph, fully two years in advance.
The exodus from Tehuixtla was part of a broader stream of emigration that, beginning in the 1970's and gaining force in the 1980's, saw more Mexicans settle in New York than ever before, said Ana Maria Valdes, a demographer at Mexico's Autonomous National University who has interviewed Mexicans living in New York City.
Although the 1990 United States census lists 93,000 Hispanic people of Mexican descent living in New York, Ms. Valdes said, several times that many probably live in the state today. "For thousands of Mexicans," Ms. Valdes wrote in an academic journal in July, "Manhattan has become 'Great Manhattitlan,' a place of hopes and dreams." (The names of many Mesoamerican settlements end in "titlan.")
At first the exodus to New York and New Jersey devastated Tehuixtla. Mayor Aguilar says that at midyear the village's population dwindles to fewer than 200 residents, not counting the hungry dogs sniffing the plaza or the burros whose braying punctuates a quiet afternoon.
On the other hand, the village has recently received a facelift as cashsent home by the new New Yorkers have financed construction of a handsome stone church, a refurbished hilltop shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe, and a new wall to keep goats out of the cemetery. And dozens of emigres have converted the adobe huts that were once their homes here into trim cement-and-tile houses, many crowned with satellite-dish antennas.
Teresa and Abel Guerrero have built one of the loveliest residences, a spacious two-story affair with a porch shaded by a curtain of blazing bougainvillea, where they were seated one recent evening.
Mr. Guerrero, 57, who first left Tehuixtla in 1963, remembers his early experiences in East Harlem with fondness.
"Those were beautiful years," he said. But recently he has wearied of New York's hassles, including the drug use he sees on the streets and the exhausting commute he makes each day across the Triborough Bridge and on to Ozone Park, Queens, where he works at an auto body shop. "I can't complain about New York, but now we feel more comfortable back here," he said.
Moments after sunset, a Yuletide chant echoes through the Tehuixtla air; the evening's posada is beginning. Several blocks away, two dozen women and children, faces aglow with candlelight, file into the village plaza, chanting prayers and singing carols. Minutes later they crowd into Celsa Garcia's house, delivering their figures of Joseph and Mary to a makeshift corner altar that Ms. Garcia, 65, has draped with garlands of gladiolas and pine.
As the procession ends, the Garcias produce baskets of peanuts and sweets for the children, and townspeople sit for conversation. Talk turns to the contrasts between Tehuixtla and New York: Tehuixtla has gentler weather and less crime (although a local man shot a teen-age boy here this summer for stealing his hand-made broom.)
But water is scarce and foul-tasting in Tehuixtla. Thinking a moment, Ms. Garcia adds that New Jersey water, though plentiful, is nothing to get excited about either. "It pours out of the tap cloudy," she said, sniffing.
Nonetheless, her son Norberto, 36, who was educated as a teacher in Mexico but works most of the year as a foreman on a landscaping crew in Garfield, says he has grown dependent on the comforts of urban life in the New York region.
"I suffer when I come down here," he said. "You can't get good coffee."
Some who left Tehuixtla seeking a happier life have failed to find it in New York, and their return is also difficult. Sofia Martinez moved to 116th Street and Second Avenue in 1989, working for a year in a garment factory. But she grew lonely and came home to Tehuixtla, where she teaches 24 students in a one-room school. "I'm glad to be back," she said. "But now I miss New York. Here we earn almost nothing. After dinner's over, the money's all gone."
Mayor Aguilar, too, went north six years ago, working for 11 months on a loading dock in Kearny, N.J. Standing in the plaza under a sky blazing with December stars, he described how he too eventually despaired and returned to Mexico. But then, looking around at Tehuixtla's cheerily decorated homes, his outlook brightened.
"Thanks to our brothers and sisters in the United States," he said, "our town is progressing."

A Baby Is Born: Will the Father Stay Around?

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
"Labor Day" is not about a national holiday. It is about a national catastrophe. Last January, a "Dateline" crew covered a dozen births at University Hospital in Newark with a view to answering the question, where did all the fathers go? Eleven of the 12 babies were born to single mothers, 5 of them under age 18. Eight fathers were unemployed, and four were no-shows at the big moment. Six had children by more than one woman.
Such figures, common to America's inner cities, are no surprise. What tomorrow night's enterprising report adds are close-ups of a few of the men who could be tracked down. Keith Kurkland, who was at the hospital, took off after losing his job. Thomas Lee says he was rejected by his girlfriend, who told him, "No job, no daughter." An unidentified father who attended the delivery explains that he couldn't live with the mother and their six children because it would jeopardize their welfare benefits. A man identified only as Rasul was found in jail on a charge of armed robbery; the mother of his infant son wound up at a homeless shelter. 
 Len Cannon, reporting, says that as summer approached "at least half of the 12 babies born at University Hospital were getting little or none of their fathers' time." He adds, "Full-time fathering seemed over, if it ever really began." A heartening exception is Isaac Cooper, a disabled man who is seen at home taking care of his two young sons.
Interviews find the here-yesterday-gone-today fathers expressing the best of intentions. "I'm going to be there when she takes her first steps," Mr. Lee said when his daughter was born. "I'm going to be there when she has her first day of school. I'm going to be there her graduation day. I'm just going to be there for her."
A few weeks later he wasn't there, and a few months later he was sued for child support. To add to his problems, Mr. Lee was also the father of a boy born 26 days after his daughter.
Noting that 8 of the 12 new fathers had not lived with their fathers, the program touches on the effects of growing up without a man in the house.
The explanations for the generation after generation of single-mother households are by now only too familiar: shaky families, little education, few available jobs, drugs, crime . . . and welfare. A man who runs a support group for young fathers speaks for some women: "The man doesn't have to be here. I'll get this check. The father, if he's not in the picture, so what? I can still live and survive; matter of fact, the check can help pay rent."
Perhaps the tougher welfare requirements will make a difference, but will the price be paid by the men or by the women and their children? The program ends with a discouraging quotation from a woman who deals with the problem of absentee fathers: "Not only is it acceptable; we expect it."

HEADLINE: Essay;
Step Aside, Newt

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich called the other night to chew over his situation as the House Ethics committee deliberated his penalty.
I wished him a Merry Christmas and told him that -- for the sake of the country, the conservative cause, the Republican Party and even his own long-term career -- he ought to step aside. 
 He had not been thinking down that line. On the contrary, he recalled how Nixon, unfairly under fire for a fund in 1952, rejected Dewey's pressure to quit the Eisenhower ticket, and persevered in a famous television speech.
I countered with de Gaulle, who twice voluntarily stepped away from power. The history professor in Newt knew more about that example than I did -- which shows he at least weighed the alternative to his present defiant contrition.
Gingrich has persuaded himself that volunteering to give up the Speakership would be tantamount to an admission of guilt. He has not been charged with an intent to deceive; in his mind, to be forced out for not hiring a tax lawyer years ago -- and then for not watching the lawyer he hired recently -- would verge on the irrational.
I disagree. The systematic use of tax-exempt funds for a political purpose is wrong, even if not unlawful in I.R.S. eyes; and Newt's contradictory statements did mislead the House, even if unintentionally. When committed by a high government official, such political transgressions must have consequences that sting.
Nor can Gingrich claim he did not personally benefit from his tax-supported drive to power. His book deal cashed in on his Speaker's celebrity to the tune of $700,000 while on the public payroll (which I have long denounced as unethical but seems not to trouble his colleagues).
But what galls Gingrich and the Republican high command is the prospect of letting the bad guys win. Newt was savaged by Clinton's corruptly financed admen, borked by the media, and demonized as heartless by union bosses. And now to reward the obsession for vengeance of the hot-eyed David Bonior? That would consign the G.O.P.'s successful heretic to history as "Newt Gingrich, who with Jim Wright was one of two Speakers who resigned for ethical reasons . . . ."
Newt and some he brought with him to the top wonder what kind of cause it is that dumps its driver with the destination in sight. But they forget J.F.K.'s wisdom: Life is unfair. As Newt himself sighs, "It's a tough business at this level."
Of higher value than any one leader is the cause being led. The central question facing Republican representatives now is not "Can we put this to bed with a reprimand?" but "Who, as Speaker, can best balance the budget, deregulate the economy, get to the bottom of the Clinton scandals and overhaul the tax system?"
Gingrich and the resentful sentimentalists on his listing ship insist that Newt is indispensable. They would have us believe that only he can hold House Republicans together, thereby preventing a Clinton coalition with moderate G.O.P. members.
Realists think not. We see the G.O.P. weighed down by the albatross of ethical condemnation around this Speaker's neck.
No wonder the Clinton White House and the entire liberal establishment are praying for Newt to stagger on for the next couple of years. A damaged Speaker is a damaged President's fervent wish, and the combination is the nation's worst-case scenario.
If the assault on Gingrich is, as he deeply believes, a war of the losers on the legitimacy of a winning heretic, what can he do to regain the legitimacy his cocksure carelessness endangered?
Hiding under the Speaker's desk next year to avoid bitter confrontations won't do it. Neither would a "Checkers speech," appealing for grassroots support after a House reprimand.
Gingrich should punish himself and promote his cause by honorably stepping down without being toppled. Then he should work in the vineyards, rebuild his reputation and -- if it's in him -- campaign with the members for Speaker or with the voters for President.
Self-sacrificing accountability is a lot to ask of any politician, and it's not what Newt wants to hear from those who wish him well. But if he expects to make a comeback, first he'll have to go.

HEADLINE: Food Stamps for the Unemployed

 BODY:
The new Federal welfare law ends the guarantee that all poor people will be fed and threatens to deprive some one million poor people of the food stamps that help them survive. The law prohibits able-bodied, childless adults between the ages of 18 and 50 from collecting food stamps for more than three months in any three-year period unless they work at least 20 hours a week. There is no exemption for recipients who look for but can not find work. They are left to shift for themselves without food assistance. Their only hope lies in the fact that the law invites states to seek waivers for recipients who live in areas with high unemployment.
Many states are now applying for waivers, as well they should. The waiver process is no loophole but a humane and sensible safety valve. But many other states have decided to forgo the option of applying for all waivers for which they are qualified. They often justify their inaction on specious philosophical or ethical grounds. But the end result is that they will expose their poorest residents to the threat of needless hunger. 
 Sponsors of the welfare bill claimed that the time limits would do no great harm because able-bodied recipients could either work in the private sector, accept a workfare slot from their local government or do volunteer work with a local charity, all of which could keep them eligible for food stamps. But only 10 states provide workfare slots for food stamp recipients, and even in these states workfare exists in only a few counties. Few states have organized programs of volunteer work. The problem for food stamp recipients is expected to get worse, because under the new welfare law states will be compelled to put single mothers into whatever workfare slots they create, making it harder for childless adults to get workfare.
Congress tried to take some of the sting out of the harsh time limits by providing waivers for areas with unemployment rates above 10 percent and areas without a "sufficient number of jobs," which the Clinton Administration has interpreted to mean an unemployment rate at least 20 percent above the national average. Today, that translates into an unemployment rate of about 7 percent.
Some states, like Mississippi, say that they seek no waivers because it would be wrong to exempt childless adults from food stamp time limits at the same time that they are imposing time limits on cash aid to single mothers. But childless adults already receive less support than single mothers. They generally do not qualify for any cash aid. Imposing hunger on them hardly rights an inequity.
New York is applying for a waiver to exempt communities where unemployment exceeds 10 percent although the Pataki administration says it will not seek all waivers available under the law because that would send the wrong signal to able-bodied recipients -- that they remain eligible for a free ride. But Mr. Pataki can obtain a Federal waiver on time limits without altering his plan to impose tight work requirements and provide workfare and volunteer slots. If counties provide all needed workfare or volunteer slots, then New York's childless poor would escape time limits because they would be working. But what happens if counties fail to provide the tens of thousands of slots that will be needed? After all, no state has yet to achieve such a mammoth goal. A Federal waiver would guarantee an undiminished Federal flow of food stamps in case local governments achieve less than what Mr. Pataki's program assumes.
Congress said it would not take food stamps from people who live in areas where jobs are scarce. That is a declaration of decency that the states should uphold.

HEADLINE: Catholics Plan Cathedral On New Site In Los Angeles

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 25

 BODY:
After threatening to move the center of Southern California's Roman Catholic worship to the suburbs, church officials have decided to build a new cathedral downtown.
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles on Monday announced the hilltop site and unveiled a preliminary model of the cathedral, with Spanish-influenced courtyards, colonnades and a bell tower, putting to rest at least part of a contentious secular debate here. 
 The bickering started last spring when the Archdiocese decided to raze its old cathedral, the graceful but crumbling St. Vibiana, and build anew at the same site. While many city leaders praised the project as a welcome example of urban redevelopment in one of downtown's most decayed neighborhoods, preservationists were appalled.
The old cathedral, surrounded by trash-filled lots and abandoned buildings, dates to 1876, when the city was a ranching and farming town. The Los Angeles Conservancy, a preservation group that recently helped rescue the oldest surviving McDonald's, sued to stop the demolition of the church just after cranes plucked a cupola from one tower.
The plan now is to sell the old cathedral to help finance some of the estimated $45 million cost for its replacement, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.
The design, by the Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo, mixes modern and Spanish styles, with the cathedral, meeting center and rectory set around a three-acre courtyard. Perched on a knoll, near the civic center, the cathedral will have an 80-foot ceiling, seating for 2,600 and a 35-foot crucifix over the main portal.
"When people approach the magnificent church and open plaza," the Rev. Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said, "they will feel welcomed, and it will draw them in like a pilgrimage site."
Construction is scheduled to begin in 1997 and be complete in 2000.
The news is being applauded by local politicians like Councilwoman Rita Walters, who represents the area.
"I think the symbolism of the church locating downtown really means that it is the cathedral of Los Angeles as opposed to the coast or the suburbs," Ms. Walters said.
The archdiocese brought up the idea of moving the cathedral out of Los Angeles to a place where land was cheaper, mostly as leverage for obtaining the city's assistance in finding a suitable plot.
The suit by conservationists has delayed the wrecking ball until an environmental impact report can be completed on razing the old cathedral. The Archbishop of Los Angeles, Roger Cardinal Mahony, declared that construction plans should go ahead to take advantage of donations that would be lost without quick action.
The church, Cardinal Mahony said, cannot afford the estimated $20 million to repair St. Vibiana from damage suffered mostly in the earthquake in the Northridge section in 1994. City inspectors ordered the structure boarded up after the quake.
St. Vibiana is too small, having only 1,100 seats for the area's fast-growing population of four million Catholics. The view of the pulpit from many seats is blocked by pillars, and there is no heating or air-conditioning.
To avert the embarrassment of losing the cathedral to the suburbs, city leaders worked with the archdiocese to find alternate locations. The archdiocese settled on a six-acre parking lot bordering the Hollywood Freeway. The lot is owned by Los Angeles County.
The archdiocese, which bought the property for $10.8 million, says the location allows for a grander building than the St. Vibiana site.
"The Cardinal wanted to be near the civic center because of the Latin tradition of the civic buildings representing the civil authority and the cathedral representing the spiritual authority," Mr. Coiro said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Economics is climbing into the trenches and the real world.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IF economists were inclined to borrow from Shakespeare, they might dub this the winter of their discontent. Wannabe movers and shakers pine for the days when Cabinet officers and captains of industry could not get through the day without advice from a dismal scientist. Undergraduates who once majored in economics as a stepping stone to riches at Goldman, Sachs are turning to math. Even The New Yorker has piled on, concluding in an article that economists need to be cut down a peg by abolishing their Nobel Prize.
Most economists wining and dining their way through the annual meeting of the American Economics Association in New Orleans next week would probably concede that the profession has not lived up to the inflated expectations of the 1960's and early 1970's. What's worse, solutions to the gnawing economic problems of the era -- widening income inequality and tepid rates of productivity growth -- remain elusive. 
 But it does not follow that contemporary economics is irrelevant, that an abundance of pointless academic research is overwhelming the good stuff. On the contrary: economists probably have more useful things to say about the real world than they have since the British economist David Ricardo explained why free trade meant more to his nation's future than the prosperity of its wheat farmers.
Start with the perennial complaint that economics has abandoned its roots in the real world in favor of mathematical games only the elite can play. There's a whiff of truth here: like most scholars, economists publish a lot of research that might as well have been written in Aramaic.
But that is no indictment of the profession's demand that young Ph.D.'s know more math -- especially more mathematical statistics -- than previous generations. For while economics can be done with cookbook knowledge of statistical techniques (plug in the numbers, press ENTER), it cannot be done well without a clear understanding of first principles. It is also worth noting that math has never proved a barrier for the most productive policy economists of this generation -- everyone from Lawrence Katz, the former chief economist of the Labor Department, to Lawrence Summers, deputy secretary of the Treasury.
The more serious criticism is that economists' reach has exceeded their grasp. In the heady decade of the 1960's it was glibly asserted that economics was on the verge of joining, say, physics and chemistry in its ability to explain and predict. Economists no longer make such inflated claims. Indeed, many have probably gone too far in distancing themselves from the old dream, wallowing in the nihilism of the "rational expectations" theory, which implies that activist policy economics is self-defeating. Even the sensible middle of the profession has forsaken ambitious computer model-building, disdaining cautious, hard-headed efforts to forecast economic change.
That said, there is no shortage of smart, relevant economic research out there. Some randomly chosen examples:
* Spurred by the collapse of central planning in the Soviet bloc and the stunning rise of the Asian tigers, economists are again working on issues of why some countries break out of poverty and others do not.
* The young field of law and economics is bearing fruit in proposals to minimize the cost of justice in everything from tort law to corporate reorganization in bankruptcy.
* Regulatory economics is enjoying a renaissance, driven by hot political debates on the environment, education reform and deregulation in the electricity and telecommunications industries.
* Labor economics is branching out, providing the empirical backbone for evaluating public policy toward immigration, discrimination, child care and investments in education.
* New interest in radical tax reform from the political right has given public-finance economists an excuse to go back to square one, with surprising consequences.
* The baby boom, and subsequent bust, has inspired a new field called generational accounting, a first serious attempt to analyze public policy in terms of equity between generations.
* "Natural experiments" in economics, incorporating clever analysis of data, are allowing researchers to mimic the controlled experiments of the natural sciences. One group from Princeton, for example, used the experiences of twins to isolate the impact of education on wages.
* Game theory is finally delivering on its promises. It was used to design the highly successful auction of the radio spectrum this year, and is working its way into all sorts of corporate decision-making in which one company must anticipate the competitive response of others.
Economics is not failing, it is changing. There is a new sobriety, perhaps -- a sense that more work has to be done in the trenches and less in the ivory tower. But to paraphrase John Maynard Keynes, the ideas of economists still rule the world.

HEADLINE: Upstate OTB Wants to Put Horse Wagering on Internet

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
In a move that could open the door to computer betting on horse races, the offtrack betting operation in the Albany area hopes to allow such wagering via the Internet.
On the surface, the proposal by the operation, Capital District Regional Offtrack Betting Corporation, is only an incremental improvement in an already elaborate electronic system that allows people to place bets by telephone. But critics warn that if New York State sanctions on-line betting, it could set a dangerous precedent that would weaken law enforcement efforts to control a potential explosion in on-line gambling. 
 The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance must still study a model of the system before it is approved, but state officials predicted that Capital OTB would soon be one of the first state-sanctioned gambling enterprises to offer on-line betting.
"It's likely to happen," said Bennett Liebman, a member of the State Racing and Wagering Board. "It's really an incremental improvement of their telephone wagering."
But critics contend that should the state approve the idea, it would weaken the state's legal arguments on limiting or banning Internet gambling. The proposal was reported yesterday in The New York Post.
Wagering through the Internet poses a potential regulatory nightmare for state attorneys general, since bettors can choose to gamble through Web sites across the country and around the world by credit card with little or no oversight. The potential for increasing the number of compulsive gamblers -- and fraud -- is enormous.
"If the government puts these on line, it's going to make it more difficult to make the legal argument that private companies can't do that," said Robert Goodman, a professor of planning and economic development at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., and author of the book "The Luck Business."
This summer, the National Association of Attorneys General asked the Clinton Administration to ban Internet gambling. The Justice Department rejected the proposal, saying that it would take hundreds of thousands of law enforcement agents to monitor what individuals were doing on line. Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, submitted a bill banning Internet gambling earlier this year, but the bill died in committee.
Capital OTB is based in Schenectady but its flagship operation is in Albany. It already has a Web site with a "virtual tote board," which gives bettors full race information, including jockeys and odds. The new service would allow gamblers to bet on the races through the site. The new system, according to Mr. Liebman of the State Racing and Wagering Board, would have more of an effect outside New York than in it.
"Inside the state it's not going to be that big a deal," said Mr. Liebman. "But nationwide, having on-line racing increases competition." If the plan becomes reality, gamblers anywhere in the country would be able to gain access to Capital OTB as easily and as cheaply as they can with their local off-track betting service.
Whether on-line gambling is legal remains unclear. Most state attorneys general have declared the practice illegal, but whether states have jurisdiction over the Internet -- which spans states and countries -- has not been tested in court.
In Minnesota, the State Attorney General is trying to prosecute Granite Gate Resorts, based in Las Vegas, Nev., for offering sports betting to Internet users in Minnesota. In California, the Attorney General is threatening to prosecute local phone companies if their customers gamble on line.
With the legality of Internet gambling still being decided, most companies in the $550 billion-a-year gambling industry are holding back. Several Web sites have been established that enable individuals to gamble, but only with imaginary money. A handful of companies operating small offshore casinos -- in Antigua, Belize and Monaco, for instance -- are testing the legal waters and have created Web sites overseas where Internet users in the United States can gamble.
Professor Goodman said Capital OTB's on-line gambling would only bolster private companies' efforts to turn the Internet into a seemingly limitless casino.
"This is the government itself jumping into on-line gambling," Professor Goodman warned. "I think it establishes a precedent for companies trying to get in."

HEADLINE: Crackdown On Drugs Brings Fear To Border

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: ROMA, Tex., Dec. 19

 BODY:
Hugging an isolated stretch of the Rio Grande along the Mexican border, Starr County has long had a reputation as a haven for smugglers. In past decades, the booty was alcohol or cattle; these days, it is drugs.
But even as people here have become accustomed to periodic crackdowns by drug enforcement officials and arrests of local citizens, no one can quite recall a sweep of the magnitude of a recent Federal operation. In all, 79 people were arrested and charged with involvement in a marijuana-smuggling ring that Federal officials describe as a multimillion-dollar enterprise. 
 Nearly all the defendants are from Starr County, which the Census routinely lists as one of the poorest in the nation, or two adjoining counties, Zapata and Hidalgo. Assets from the drug ring are said to have been plowed into several popular local businesses, including the Golden R Meat Market, a convenience store in Roma, and the Fronton Car Wash and Body Repair Shop.
In Fronton, a farming hamlet a few miles west of Roma where a half-mile dirt road leads to the Rio Grande, 15 of the 400 residents were rounded up and sent to jail in Houston, 350 miles north. These arrests were made in a one-day sweep last month that began when Federal and state authorities set up a roadblock and checked the licenses of everyone leaving Fronton.
The crackdown has stunned just about everyone here and left both supporters and critics of the operation fearful. Most family members and supporters of the defendants said they were afraid of retaliation by law-enforcement authorities if they spoke out against the Government's effort. And people who favor the crackdown said they feared retaliation by major drug rings based in Mexico or by the local families who they said had helped smuggle drugs for years. Many people refused to give their names when discussing the case.
In Starr County, even those with a public profile seemed disinclined to express their opinions.
"If these people are guilty, then what the Government has done is a good thing," Judge Jose Martinez, the chief elected official of Starr County, said.
But Mr. Martinez quickly added: "I'd hate to think innocent people are being harassed. I have no indication one way or another."
While some welcome the operation as a sign that the authorities are finally getting serious about drug smuggling, many others insist that the Government went much too far, with many innocent people swept up in its wake.
"This whole thing is out of control," said Clemente Sandoval, whose brother-in-law, Jorge Luis Garcia, a ranch hand for one of the families that has been described as ringleaders of the smuggling, was among those arrested.
"I just don't think Jorge was involved in this at all," he said. "If he was making all this money off of drugs, why was he broke all the time? Why were they cutting off his electricity every other month?"
Prosecutors in the United States Attorney's office in Houston, who plan to try all 79 defendants together, said they could not discuss the specifics of Mr. Garcia's or any other defendant's case. In offering a broad outline of the charges, though, the prosecutors have said that a few local families with ranching and other business interests have for years been allowing Mexican smugglers to bring marijuana onto their land and store it there.
Mr. Garcia, a 44-year-old father of six, is charged on a variety of counts, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute up to 2,200 pounds of marijuana and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Five men -- Pedro Moreno and Rudolfo Arias and three brothers, Ramiro, Ricardo and Roberto Riojas -- have been charged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise under what is often called the "kingpin statute" and could face life in prison.
Most of the other defendants, including Mr. Garcia, are charged with abetting them. The authorities say they have seized at least 13,000 pounds of marijuana in Starr County in the last three months.
George Garcia, 19, Mr. Garcia's son, was one of the few people willing to discuss the case. He said his family was trying to scrape together money to hire a lawyer. No one in the family has been able to travel to Houston to see Mr. Garcia, so their contact has been limited to a few brief telephone calls.
"Is there a drug trade here?" said the younger Mr. Garcia, who is studying law enforcement at a community college. "Yes, sir, right here on the river. Everyone knows that. But they've arrested a lot of innocent people, my father included."
Some people here said they did not wish to speak publicly because they were angry at both the smugglers and the law-enforcement officials.
"There are drugs in this area, and I blame the people involved, but the people I blame most of all is the Government," said a man taking a pause from yardwork in front of his small house in Fronton.
"They knew all about it for years, and they let it get out of hand," the man said. "They let sons get caught up with their fathers. They just let this go on too long."
The man also expressed bitterness that the crackdown on his neighbors, some of whom he considered friends, would do "next to nothing" in the overall war on drugs.
"They're never going to get the big guy in this," he said. "The big guy's in Mexico."
Federal drug officials, who say the Texas-Mexico border is an increasingly important conduit for drugs from South America, do not necessarily disagree with the Fronton man's assessment.
"For us to have a lasting impact, no question, more must be done in Mexico," said Donald F. Ferrarone, special agent in charge of the Houston field division of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Nonetheless, Mr. Ferrarone said, while the crackdown here did little to affect the overall supply from Mexico, it did succeed in breaking "an extremely important chain" in the distribution network.
At the Lamb of God Catholic mission in Fronton, the Rev. Hugo Van den Bussche declined to answer questions about the recent arrests or what they had done to the spirit of the community.
"I'm sorry, I never talk publicly about drugs or drug dealing," Father Van den Bussche said. "I feel my place as a pastor is not to talk about it. Even in church, I never talk about drugs. Never."
Especially in Fronton, a ramshackle collection of battered ranch-style houses and trailers on concrete blocks, a common refrain is that the place is so poor, the extent of the drug problem must be overstated by the Government.
"This is no Miami," said Luis Pena, owner of the Fronton Postal and Grocery, whose brother was among those arrested. "This is no millionaire paradise. You can see the houses; you can see how the people dress."
Others expressed anger that economic conditions were so bad, and said they understood, without condoning it, how people were lured into the drug trade.
"People are desperate," said Anna Sandoval, 32, a Fronton native who works as a teacher's aide. "They have kids, they have meals to eat, they have doctors' bills to pay."
Still, there are incongruous signs of wealth here, some of which, the authorities say, can be explained by drug money: new pickup trucks, satellite dishes, glimpses of impressive houses from padlocked gates.
Mr. Pena, the store owner, said that the vast majority of people in Fronton were decent and hard working, and that the crackdown had hurt many, himself included. He said his sales, typically around $10,000 a month, had dropped by half.
"Many of my customers were taken away, you see," he said. "And the people that are left, they're not coming out. The town is completely dead. I guess they're worried. Or scared. Or shocked."

HEADLINE: Despite Crisis, Fujimori Maintains His Iron Image

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Shortly after Marxist guerrillas took over the Japanese Ambassador's residence here last week, aides to President Alberto K. Fujimori interrupted an emergency Cabinet meeting to tell him that his mother, sister and brother were among the hundreds taken hostage.
Mr. Fujimori, whose autocratic style is well known, is said to have upbraided the aides for offering what he called "extraneous details" that were of little use in resolving the crisis. 
 The remark was quintessential Fujimori. The iron-willed leader was elected to a second term last year after slashing inflation and rampant terrorism, suspending the Constitution to do so. Now, facing perhaps the most difficult crisis of his political life, he shows no sign of abandoning his authoritarian ways.
While many of his critics have feared that his rigidity is jeopardizing the lives of the hostages, officials and foreign diplomats said they believe the President is a sensible leader who will compromise, but only if absolutely necessary.
"A great deal has been said about Mr. Fujimori's personality," said Alvin Adams, a former United States Ambassador to Peru, "but I can't think of another person who is as capable as the President of grasping details and concentrating on a viable solution to this most complicated situation."
More than 200 other hostages were released last week, including the President's mother and sister, and 225 were released on Sunday, but guerrillas continue to hold more than 100 people, including the President's younger brother and other international dignitaries, in a standoff many Government officials say may continue for weeks. Today one ailing Japanese diplomat was released. [Page A8.]
Rumors circulated in the local press today that several unofficial deals were being negotiated to free hostages, including one with the Japanese Government in which the guerrillas, of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, would receive millions of dollars and safe passage to Cuba. The reports could not be substantiated.
The United States has strongly advised Mr. Fujimori not to comply with the rebels' demand that their jailed comrades be set free. But Japan, a major trading partner with Peru, has encouraged Mr. Fujimori to end the crisis quickly through active negotiations and without force.
Mr. Fujimori, who is known to keep his own counsel in times of crisis, has so far taken what political analysts say is a balanced approach, offering to discuss safe passage out of the country if the rebels lay down their arms and release all hostages.
"Fujimori is autocratic, but he is also sensible," said Santiago Pedraglio, a political analyst. "He knows that this crisis will determine his political future, so he's taking his time."
Mr. Fujimori is said to be holed up in the Presidential Palace with intelligence advisers, military analysts and top generals, who are monitoring the crisis and mapping out strategy. Aside from receiving Japan's Foreign Minister last week, Mr. Fujimori has had little direct contact with foreign diplomats.
In fact, the President has not been seen in public since the crisis began on Dec. 17, except in a nationally televised address in which he condemned the takeover and made his offer to the guerrillas.
Perhaps the most influential advisor to Mr. Fujimori is the head of Peru's intelligence service, Vladimiro Montesinos, a figure who rarely appears in public but who appears to have Mr. Fujimori's trust.
But aides to Mr. Fujimori said that no matter how much advice he receives, once the President comes to a decision, which he usually makes on his own, he does not waver.
Asked why he often makes decisions in a vacuum, Mr. Fujimori has said repeatedly: "First you act, then you inform."
Mr. Fujimori (pronounced foo-hee-MORE-ee), a son of Japanese immigrants, was first elected to the presidency of this poor Andean nation of 24 million people in 1990.
Virtually unknown, Mr. Fujimori, rector of an agrarian university, ran a shoestring, word-of-mouth campaign, using a tractor called the Fuji-mobile. He handily beat Mario Vargas Llosa, the internationally acclaimed novelist, who ran a multimillion-dollar campaign.
Part of Mr. Fujimori's success was attributed to his promotion of his Japanese ancestry, which he said stood for hard work, austerity and honesty. Peru's large indigenous population identified with Mr. Fujimori and rejected Mr. Vargas Llosa as one of Peru's white elite.
Faced with out-of-control inflation and terrorism, Mr. Fujimori disbanded Congress and courts in 1992 to seize powers he said were necessary to reform the economy and control guerrillas.
Within a year, Mr. Fujimori had captured most leaders of guerrilla groups, and terrorist acts declined sharply, even as his neo-economic reforms brought inflation under control and attracted new foreign investments, netting international acclaim for what he himself described as his "self coup."
"If only we had a Fujimori," became a common retort throughout Latin America when countries faced gargantuan problems.
Mr. Fujimori then turned his attention to consolidating his political power. He persuaded a newly elected Congress to change the Constitution to allow him to seek a second term, which he won overwhelmingly over Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former United Nations Secretary General.
During the election campaign, Mr. Fujimori and his wife, Susana Higuchi, separated after a bitter public fight in which he locked her out of the Presidential Palace and she accused him of corruption and trying to kill her.
The couple divorced last year. They have three grown children, two of whom attend universities in the United States. Mr. Fujimori's daughter Keiko Sophia now serves as the First Lady.
The President, 58, whom aides describe as a workaholic whose days often end at 2 A.M., has said publicly that he wants to remarry.
Pledging that fighting poverty would be a top priority of his second term, Mr. Fujimori openly defied the Catholic Church last year when he announced that his Government would promote birth control as a way to reduce family size.
But so far, Mr. Fujimori has done little to produce jobs and improve living standards for the vast majority of Peruvians, and his popularity has declined sharply in the past year as the country entered a recession.
In recent months, the President's approval rating has dropped to as low as 41 percent from a high point of 75 percent in January, according to major opinion polls. The decline is attributed to growing discontent with Peru's sluggish economy.
Giovanna Penaflor of the independent polling firm Imasen, said Mr. Fujimori is paying the political price for raising expectations with promises of jobs and prosperity but failing to deliver them.
If Mr. Fujimori engineers a bloodless resolution to the hostage impasse at the Japanese residence, he is likely to benefit politically at a time when he is seeking popular support to run for a third term at the end of the century.
"The truth is he hasn't done badly so far," said Mirko Laurer, a political analyst and columnist who is often critical of the President. "But it could be a very long summer."

Japan's Cabinet Approves Budget Plan
Japan's Cabinet officially approved a budget proposal for the next fiscal year that would raise the consumption tax but would still fall short of economists' hopes for austerity measures to cut the fiscal deficit.
The Government projected another year of extremely slow growth, but even that outlook was called optimistic by some private economists. [Page D4.]
 
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto approved a proposal by his Liberal Democratic Party to reform the Japanese Finance Ministry. The plan, endorsed earlier by the two smaller coalition partners, will be submitted to Parliament for formal approval. It recommends that the ministry's inspection and supervision powers be split off to an independent institution. [D4.]
 
Baby Bells May Get a Break
Federal regulators, moving to reduce the fees regional telephone companies charge to connect long-distance calls, said they might let the industry bring the charges down gradually, without a timetable. They also said companies that provide access to the Internet via modems should not have to pay the same fees as long-distance carriers. Internet providers now do not pay access charges to the local phone networks. [D2.]
 
401(k) Borrowing Plan Is Dropped
Banc One abandoned a plan that would have allowed consumers to use credit cards to borrow as much as $10,000 against their 401(k) retirement funds. [D2.]
 
More Private Infirmaries at Prisons
As medical costs soar, more prisons around the country are hiring private companies to take over their infirmaries. Analysts estimate that the number of inmates cared for by these companies is growing about 20 percent a year. The largest company, Correctional Medical Services, has contracts in nearly 30 states and cares for 162,000 inmates -- twice the number in 1992. Complaints about the quality of care have been rising. [A1.]
 
Study Supports Managed Care
As managed care is being criticized for cutting hospital stays and penalizing doctors who order expensive procedures, a legislative committee in Connecticut has found that managed care seems to be reducing costs while satisfying consumers. [B6.]
 
Economists' Deflated Expectations
Economists might concede that their profession has not lived up to the expectations of the 60's and early 70's. Solutions to the gnawing economic problems of the era remain elusive. But economists now probably have more useful things to say about the real world than they have since David Ricardo explained why free trade meant more to Britain's future than the prosperity of its wheat farmers. Peter Passell: Economic Scene. [D2.]
 
Off-Track Betting May Go on Line
The off-track betting operation in the Albany area hopes to allow wagering on horse races via the Internet. But critics say that if New York State sanctions the plan, it could set a dangerous precedent that would weaken law-enforcement efforts to control a potential explosion in on-line betting. [B4.]
 
Still Going, but in New Direction
Like the Energizer bunny, advertising campaigns using the indomitable rabbit keep going and going and going. Now the TV commercials, however, are taking a different, documentary-style approach to tell "interesting and amusing" stories that suggest that the bunny has captured the imaginations of everyday consumers. Advertising. [D7.]
 
County Treasurer May Avoid Jail
Robert L. Citron, the former treasurer of Orange County, Calif., whose ill-fated investments preceded the county's bankruptcy, could end up picking up roadside litter or performing janitorial duties instead of going to jail, a sheriff said. [D2.]
 
Business as Usual
Most of the business world came to a halt on Christmas, but a priest at a Catholic church on 42d Street, a cab driver and a Criminal Court judge did not take the day off. [B1.]

HEADLINE: Abroad, the Flood of Holiday Gift Returns Is a Trickle: Japan;
Merchants Are Polite And Returns Rare

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
The chestnuts have been roasted, the wrappings torn open, the batteries misplaced. And as Christmas Day follows Christmas Eve, the urge to return gifts will drive Americans back to the malls today in the holiday's most predictable anticlimax.
From 8.6 percent to 12 percent of all goods are returned to United States merchants, the National Retail Federation said -- and the busiest days for returns and exchanges come right after Christmas.
Yet while store shelves around the world groan with American-made or -inspired goods sold increasingly in American-style malls, the American custom of dumping undesired gifts is a far less universal export. As these reports from foreign correspondents and reporters for The New York Times make clear, shopping retains its national identity, and returns, for the most part, are an exotic bit of Americana. 
 Japanese department stores are renowned for their service. Young saleswomen line up at the doors when the stores open to bow to customers as they walk in. And every item is wrapped with the attention to detail found in Japanese tea ceremonies and flower-arranging.
But the stores don't always accept returns. And in any event, retailers insist such requests are rare because it is considered an offense to the giver in Japan not to accept a gift.
Dec. 25 is a regular working day in this country, where the predominant religions are Buddhism and Shintoism. But Christmas is celebrated in a secular, commercialized fashion.
Young couples consider Christmas the most romantic time of the year. A proper young man is expected to buy his girlfriend a fancy present and a night on the town. Such extravagance has been toned down in the last few years of economic slump, but there has been a bit of a comeback this year. Christmas gifts are sometimes given to children as well.
Another year-end gift-giving custom in Japan is known as seibo, in which one gives obligatory presents to business associates, bosses, teachers, and the like. Some department stores devote an entire floor to seibo gifts, which are mainly canned or fresh foods and beverages.
Mitsukoshi and Takashimaya, two of Japan's fanciest department stores, will not accept seibo gift returns but will accept returns of other presents on a case-by-case basis.
Both Mitsukoshi and Takashimaya said that returned merchandise can be exchanged for other goods or for a certificate that can be used at the store.
Neither gives back cash, though Ito-yokado, a less expensive department store and grocery, will do so on occasion. ANDREW POLLACK

HEADLINE: Priest, Cabby and Judge Find Meaning in Work on Christmas: Driving to Opportunity;
A Cabby Expected A Slow Holiday

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
Saliba Hussein woke up yesterday morning with his head pointing east, toward Mecca. Most days he is out of his apartment in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, by 3:30 A.M. and cannot pray at home. But yesterday he lingered a little longer than usual, the covers pulled up to his neck.
It was Christmas and Mr. Hussein thought he could sleep a little later. He is a cabby and, like most of his fellow drivers, he has worked behind the wheel long enough to expect that the holiday would be slow. 
 Mr. Hussein, 38, is a Sunni Muslim who arrived from Israel, which he calls Palestine, 12 years ago. He has been driving cabs in New York almost from the minute he stepped off the plane, he said. His routine has remained the same: wake up, dress, drink the coffee his wife has prepared for him, kiss the children and take the train to Long Island City, where he picks up his cab.
"I've got a family who depends on me," Mr. Hussein said. "I live with my wife, my mother and father and my two children. Two-bedroom apartment. I must work. We are not Christians, but my children like gifts like everyone else."
He arrived at the garage to pick up his cab at 8 A.M. The battered Caprice he rented costs him $99 for up to 12 hours and $18 or so more for gas. Everything else he makes is profit.
Another cab dispatching company, the Yellow Management Corporation, also in Long Island City, gave its drivers a break for the holiday. Argy Avdoulos, 21, who spent the day behind bulletproof glass in the dispatcher's booth, said she was motivated by the spirit of giving.
"Usually, we charge them $85 for the day, but I gave them a break of $75," she said of the cabdrivers. "It's a Christmas gift. It makes them happy, so they work."
Ms. Avdoulos said she was working to give her father, Teddy, 48, the owner of the company who works most holidays, the chance to enjoy a traditional Greek Orthodox feast with the rest of the family.
"Somebody had to work if dad was going to get the day off," she said. "I didn't mind. I just hope that they leave me some food because I haven't had any lunch.
"Working really didn't bother me because Christmas means so much. It's not the gifts, or taking off from work or having fun that's important. Christmas is inside of me, it's being thankful and trying to give a little bit back."
Mr. Hussein's day at the wheel of his cab began with promise.
By early afternoon, he had had a fare to the airport that included a $10 tip, he had taken a European family on a sightseeing trip through Brooklyn and a reporter had asked to tour Manhattan, where the conversation turned to Christmas.
"I am Muslim, of course, but the day still has meaning," he said. "After all, for Muslims, Jesus was a holy prophet. So it is a good day to celebrate, yes?"
Mr. Hussein pulled up to a Dunkin' Donuts on lower Broadway downtown. Rain or shine, he finds a doughnut good company. He ordered a chocolate eclair and a cup of coffee with three sugars and cream and returned to his car.
The morning had been busy for Mr. Hussein, a short man with bushy hair and a Clark Gable mustache, but the afternoon was starting slowly. "Many cabbies are complaining that things are bad," he said. "Much worse than last year. People aren't taking cabs this Christmas. I don't know why. The economy is good. Perhaps it is because the Taxi and Limousine Commission licensed 400 more cabs last month."
Competition is good for America, Mr. Hussein said, but tough on his finances. Some day, he said, he would like to move his family out west, where the life is better and the weather warmer. "But I am a taxi driver," he said. "Are there a lot of taxi drivers out there?"
On the way to the South Street Seaport, Mr. Hussein talked about the things that made America great for him. He talked of opportunity, racial tolerance and Hollywood. He said he liked the Jimmy Stewart movie he saw on Christmas Eve.
When they arrived at the waterfront, the cabby and his passenger shook hands. The air smelled of fish and oil. Mr. Hussein leaned out his window and waved. "It's a wonderful life," he shouted. CHARLIE LeDUFF

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Against the Yen Over Fears for Japan Economy

BYLINE: The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar hit its highest level against the yen in more than three and a half years yesterday before profit taking in a thin market trimmed the gain. Traders sold the yen because of new concern about Japan's economic outlook.
Against other currencies the dollar ended little changed in slow trading. Many markets were closed on Wednesday for Christmas, and many remained closed yesterday. 
 "It's terribly illiquid out there," Jan Alvarez, chief foreign exchange trader at Corestates Bank in Philadelphia, said. "Dollar-yen is the only news there is to talk about."
In overnight Asian dealings the dollar surged to 115.08 yen, its highest level since April 1, 1993, before retreating a bit. The dollar cost 114.66 yen in New York, higher than its level of 114.44 yen late on Tuesday before the Christmas break.
The dollar cost 1.5550 German marks in New York, barely changed from 1.5552 marks on Tuesday. The British pound cost $1.6731, unchanged. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday: 1.3422 Swiss francs, up from 1.3406; 5.2490 French francs, down from 5.2500, and 1,527.50 Italian lire, down from 1,528.00.
The catalyst for the dollar's strength against the yen was another stiff drop in the Japanese stock market yesterday because of concern about the country's protracted economic malaise and disappointment over the Government's weak attempts to impose fiscal discipline. A new budget approved by the Japanese Cabinet on Wednesday includes tax increases but falls short of the measures sought by some economists. The Government also said economic growth would continue to be weak next year.
Renewed concern over the bad-loan problem clouding Japan's banking system also contributed to the selloff in Japanese securities, which diminished demand for yen.
Tetsuro Nishizaki, a business consultant who heads a Finance Ministry panel concerned with Japan's banks, said in a report released yesterday that "compared with U.S. institutions, Japanese banking situations are far less stable."
The mix of falling Japanese stock prices and concern about Japan's banks makes it likely that the central bank will keep interest rates low.

HEADLINE: Turkey Sending Envoy to U.S. to Clear Up 'Misunderstandings'

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Dec. 26

 BODY:
Turkey's Prime Minister has announced that he will send a high-level envoy to Washington with a pledge of friendship and assurances that the United States has "no reason to be afraid of anything we are doing."
Senior officials in Washington have been alarmed at Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's pan-Islamic political philosophy and his visits to Iran and Libya. They fear that he may be seeking to lead his country, which is a NATO ally, away from the Western fold. 
 "We need to explain ourselves better to our friend America," Mr. Erbakan said in an interview at his official residence on Wednesday night. "In the coming days our State Minister, Fehim Adak, will go to America as a guest. He will say that we want to increase our cooperation and will discuss other important matters. We were very happy to receive the invitation, and we are looking forward to this with great interest."
Mr. Adak, whose ministerial job focuses on economic planning, is one of Mr. Erbakan's oldest and most trusted aides as well as a leading figure in the ruling Islamic-based Welfare Party.
The United States Ambassador here, Marc Grossman, confirmed that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin invited Mr. Adak to Washington after a round of Turkish-American economic talks that were held in Ankara in October. But Mr. Grossman said he had not yet been notified that the invitation had been accepted.
"We would welcome any such visit and look forward to it," he said.
In his interview, Prime Minister Erbakan, who took office six months ago, said he wanted to clear up misunderstandings with Washington "which may have been our fault." But he stated several views that directly challenged long-held American positions, criticizing Israel as the chief obstacle to Middle East peace and asserting that it was unfair for the United States to isolate Iran, Iraq and Libya.
"There should be no double standard," Mr. Erbakan said. "Israel is an example of the double standard. For many years, Israel has been disturbing its neighbors. There have been many, many United Nations resolutions, but they were not strongly enforced. But when Iraq violates a resolution, hundreds of tons of bombs are dropped on it. It is a clear example of a double standard. In Bosnia, in Chechnya, in Kashmir, this double standard is applied all over the world."
Views like these, and more radical ones from militant figures within the Welfare Party, have raised concerns in Washington. So have Mr. Erbakan's warm visits with the leaders of countries that the United States is trying to isolate.
The State Department has criticized Turkey with unusual frankness several times since Mr. Erbakan took office. On Tuesday, reacting to talks this week between Mr. Erbakan and President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, Glyn Davies, a State Department spokesman, said the United States was concerned "by all efforts to intensify cooperative relationships with Iran until Teheran reforms its unacceptable international policies."
Mr. Erbakan has proposed the formation of what he calls the D-8, an association of eight large developing countries that would seek to confront world problems together with the Group of Seven, whose members are the world's most powerful industrial democracies. The D-8 would consist of Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Egypt and Nigeria.

HEADLINE: Trying to Slice the National Pie and Mend Social Security, Too

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
For the last few years, the debate over the future of Social Security has been cast largely in terms of what should be done to prevent the system itself from running out of money after baby boomers start retiring early in the next century.
But now, with the much-delayed report of a Federal advisory panel on Social Security ready for release, perhaps as early as Monday, a much more significant fault line is finally coming into focus. Ultimately at stake in the debate over how to solve the program's long-term financial problems, say those on both sides of the trenches, is a choice that will shape the very nature of the American economy in the decades ahead. 
 On one side are those who see the need to increase the nation's anemic savings rate as the paramount issue. They argue that Social Security should be transformed gradually into a hybrid public-private system that encourages people to save much more for their own retirement. To them, the only conceivable way to create an economy capable of supporting the outsized baby boom generation in retirement is to limit the program's role in simply transferring income from one generation to another.
"Reforms can only work if they increase the size of the pie that must be shared by retirees and workers," argues Robert Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now an economist at the nonprofit Brookings Institution in Washington.
On the other side, suggests Peter Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a consultant to the Government-sponsored Advisory Council on Social Security, is a group of "New Deal realists" who fear that any profound change in the way Social Security is structured would pit the "haves" against the "have-nots."
This group is convinced that recasting the nation's public retirement system into something resembling a collection of private 401(k) accounts -- particularly when combined with other popular policy proposals like cutting the capital gains tax -- would only accelerate the trend of recent decades toward greater inequality in the United States. And ultimately, they argue, that would damage the economy more than any gains that might be achieved through increased savings.
"An economy with vast amounts of people of middle income," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in a recent magazine interview, "will be a more successful economy over time than an economy with a very large income inequality."
The advisory group, appointed by Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, in June 1994, brought together 13 people with widely divergent views. The members of the panel -- economists, pension experts, representatives from business and labor -- are split into three groups. One, with six members, basically wants to maintain Social Security as it is, although it is willing to consider the idea that some Social Security revenues should be collectively invested in the stock market instead of just put into Government bonds, as they are today. A majority of the panel, divided into one group of five and one of two members, is pushing competing ideas on how to partly privatize the system. Each of the three factions says its own plan will guarantee the solvency of Social Security over the next 75 years.
On a few points, at least, the panel members were able to find common ground. They all agreed that the straightforward route to fiscal integrity -- an immediate 2.2 percentage point increase in the current 12.4 percent old age and disability insurance payroll tax paid by both employers and employees -- is a political nonstarter. Any solution to the parallel (and more acute) financial problems of Medicare is likely to include a payroll tax increase, leaving Congress with little taste for imposing a double tax hit.
By the same token, all agreed that a handful of relatively uncontroversial fixes ranging from an extension of Social Security to include state and local government employees to a broadening of the current tax on pension benefits, should be adopted. But these would only marginally trim the $3 trillion -- yes, trillion -- gap between what Social Security is likely to collect over the next 75 years and what it is obligated to pay under current law.
But beyond those relatively modest areas of agreement, fundamental differences on the goals of an overhaul pulled council members in very different directions.
In their own section of the report, the six council members who favor only modest changes in the system argue that the private alternatives are "inherently unstable, and could lead to the unraveling of the redistributional provisions that are so integral to Social Security and so crucial to its effectiveness."
This group, led by Robert M. Ball, a former Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, favors a variety of small repairs to secure the trust fund through the early decades of the 21st century, followed ultimately by a tax increase of at least 1.6 percentage points to prevent bankruptcy around the middle of the century.
The Ball group cannot expect much support from the financial establishment. In a Dec. 6 speech, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, derided the group's suggestion that a portion of Social Security revenues could be diverted into the stock market without setting up individual accounts.
Mr. Greenspan called that approach simply a "portfolio reallocation" that would do nothing more than raise returns on the trust fund at the expense of lower returns to private savers. The result would be a "zero sum," Mr. Greenspan said, because it does nothing to free new savings to invest in expanding the productive capacity of the economy.
The criticism does not bother Mr. Ball. "Important as national savings are," he explained, "they don't have to come from Social Security."
By Mr. Ball's reckoning, the first priority of reform is buttressing the public's weakening commitment to a system that insures against the risk of poverty in old age. And he is deeply worried that any plan that segregates a portion of the revenues in private accounts would plant new seeds of discontent: When affluent workers discover they can get a higher return on higher-risk assets in their personal Social Security accounts, he suggests, they will cease to be willing to share their bounty with the have-nots.
The other two groups, while differing on the details, see the problem in an entirely different light. They would require individuals to put some portion of the money that now goes to Social Security taxes into accounts that could be directly invested in the financial markets. If the stock and bond markets performed about the same in the future as they have in the past, they promise to deliver to the average beneficiary about as much in retirement income as can be expected from the current system. But much more important, from their point of view, is that by introducing mandatory contributions to individual accounts, the goal of increasing national savings through Social Security would become far more palatable.
Earmarking the money for individuals would make it less likely that Congress would appropriate the cash inflow as a slush fund to underwrite unrelated Government spending, they say. Edward M. Gramlich, the chairman of the panel, does not mince words on this point. "The important thing here," he said, "is to generate more savings" that will not be consumed by government.
While most people have remained consumed by the basic fear that the Social Security system will run out of money, to Mr. Reischauer, the former C.B.O. director, that is missing the forest for the trees. Only with high rates of savings and investment will the economy be big enough to support the retiring baby boomers in the style to which they have grown accustomed. With low rates, the debate over Social Security, he contends, will deteriorate into a battle between generations in which aging parents and their children end up squabbling over who will make the greater sacrifice.

Some Worries About the Rush Into Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Encouraged by continued growth in financial markets, the number of American households investing in mutual funds has risen by more than 20 percent in the last two years, recent research shows.
But a growing share of the largest segment of that group -- shareholders in funds that invest in the stock market -- have never experienced a significant market downturn, raising questions among market analysts about just how they will react if there is a sharp decline in stock prices. 
 In a survey conducted in April for the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, but not released until now, 37 percent of those questioned said they owned shares in a mutual fund that invests in stocks, bonds or money markets, up from 31 percent two years ago.
That would put the number of households that own shares in a mutual fund at 37 million, the institute estimates. In 1994, 30 million households owned funds.
In terms of individuals, the growth has been even more rapid. Based on its household survey, the trade group estimates that 63 million people own mutual fund shares, said John Rea, the institute's chief economist, up 66 percent from an estimate of 38 million individual shareholders that the institute has used for the last four years, based on census data.
Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said the growth of the mutual fund industry held significant implications for the future of the financial markets. "That does indicate that instead of being very narrow, ownership of mutual funds has really broadened during the 1990's," Mr. Wien said. "Since there are so many new investors in equity mutual funds, the real question mark is how they will behave when and if the market corrects. The answer, probably, is not well."
The significant increase in the number of fund-owning households helps to explain the rapid growth of the mutual fund industry over the last two years, and provides support for those who argue that the sharp rise in the stock market has been aided by the floods of cash coming from mutual fund investors, particularly those who invest through retirement savings plans.
Mutual fund assets rose to $3.39 trillion at the end of October, from $2.16 trillion at the end of 1994. Over the same period, stock fund assets have risen even more quickly, to $1.65 trillion, or 48.7 percent of the total, from $866.5 billion, or 40 percent of total fund assets, in 1994.
But the data also contain some ominous warnings. About one-fifth of all mutual fund owners made their initial investments within the last two years, and more than 60 percent of those buyers purchased equity funds. With the United States stock market not having experienced a decline of more than 10 percent in six years, what those new stock market investors will do when confronted with a downturn is uncertain.
Mr. Rea, the mutual fund trade group's chief economist, said he saw greater significance in the fact that two-thirds of the households that own mutual fund shares bought them before 1990. It was in October 1990 that the current bull market began.
"We've had an expansion in ownership recently, but we still have a significant base of owners who have had their mutual funds for quite a while," Mr. Rea said. Therefore, while it is possible that equity funds might suffer withdrawals in a market downturn, "I don't think it will be concentrated in a short period of time."
Over all, 23 percent of American households owned stock funds, 16 percent owned bond and income funds, and 13 percent had money market funds, according to the survey. Households might own more than one type of fund. The research also quantified for the first time the role played by retirement savings plans in mutual fund ownership. Of the 36.8 million households that now own mutual funds, 8.7 million, or nearly 24 percent, own their funds only in a tax-advantaged retirement program, like a 401(k) or other defined contribution pension account.
The survey, which was conducted for the Investment Company Institute by the Intersearch Corporation of Horsham, Pa., was based on a random sample of 2,644 households whose income and age distribution closely matched those of the 98.9 million households counted by the Census Bureau, the institute said. The survey had an error rate of 2 percent, meaning that 95 times out of 100 a similar survey would produce results within 2 percentage points of the current data.
Mr. Rea said that although the institute did not have similar data for previous years, retirement programs undoubtedly have become a larger part of mutual fund cash flows over the last several years. In 1988, for instance, when 24 million households invested in mutual funds, mutual fund assets accounted for only 10 percent of the $230 billion in 401(k) accounts. In 1995, however, mutual funds accounted for 39 percent of total 401(k) assets of $667 billion.
The implication of a greater proportion of mutual fund cash flows coming from retirement investors is that those investors might have a longer investment horizon, and therefore be less likely to stop investing or to withdraw their money if the financial markets hit a rough patch.
Not everyone agrees, however. Mr. Wien, of Morgan Stanley, said that if the market started to slide and new mutual fund investors got nervous, their selling might add momentum to any decline.
Elizabeth Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear, Stearns, said such a shift could have implications beyond the stock market. If a decline in equity prices is followed by a withdrawal of assets from mutual funds, "that could have a more destabilizing effect on the economy."
"The real test might be if we have a year of more average, single-digit returns, or a stock market that declines 10 percent and does not return to new highs within six months," Ms. Mackay said. "People might decide that getting 5 percent in a money market fund is not that bad," leading them to exit equity funds.
Mr. Rea agreed that many of the most recent buyers of mutual funds had not experienced a bear market in stocks, but he pointed out that many did own bond funds during the severe decline in bond prices in 1994.
But when confronted with a bear market in bonds, many fund investors did exactly what the fund industry fears: they withdrew $43.3 billion from bond funds, or roughly 5.6 percent of assets. Similar withdrawals from equity funds today would mean a cascade of $93 billion out of equity mutual funds.
In the first five months of 1996 -- the industry's five biggest months ever for equity fund inflows -- $123.4 billion was invested in equity funds, nearly as much as in all of 1995.
The increase in mutual fund ownership has come across all age groups, according to the Investment Company Institute's research. The greatest percentage of mutual fund ownership was found in households headed by a person from age 35 to 44, where 45 percent owned funds, up from 37 percent two years ago.
Among households headed by a person younger than 35 years, 34 percent own at least one fund, up from 28 percent two years ago.
The greatest gains over the last two years were among investors aged 45 to 54, which includes the leading edge of the baby boomers. The institute said 42 percent of households headed by a person aged 45 to 54 owned a mutual fund, up from 33 percent two years ago.
The research also shows that a substantial portion of the households owning mutual funds had moderate income. About 25 percent of the households surveyed that owned mutual funds had pretax income of less than $35,000, and another 18 percent had pretax income of $35,000 to $49,999.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Show Little Change On Slow Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities finished unchanged yesterday in quiet trading, with the European markets closed and many market participants electing to extend the Christmas holiday.
With no economic news to follow yesterday, what little movement there was in the Treasury marketcame chiefly on technical factors. Volume ran about 70 percent less than normal for a winter Thursday. 
 The weekly jobless claims report, usually released on a Thursday, was postponed until today because of the Christmas holiday, and will be released with November leading economic indicators and a report on durable goods. Regarding the jobless data, market expectations are for a small decline of about 5,000, from the 351,000 reported last week.
The 30-year bond remained at a price of 98 31/32 to yield 6.58 percent, unchanged from the close of Tuesday's abbreviated session.
One reason for the market's steadiness yesterday was the report of modest Christmas retail sales, in contrast to the stronger sales that retailers were talking about at the start of the season.
Many analysts attribute the sales shortfall to the five fewer shopping days this season, but others contend that regardless of the number of shopping days, people would spend whatever they intended to spend.
Two private retail sales reports on Tuesday were below expectations. The LJR Redbook Research index, which was released after the market closed, said sales at the stores it surveyed fell three-tenths of a percent. So even if there is a burst of spending going into the new year, it is unlikely that the Federal Reserve will see any reason to raise interest rates.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that yesterday's skeletal staffs at Wall Street firms were getting drowsy from the lack of activity and that traders were "eagerly awaiting tomorrow's economic statistics to see if they will provide some excitement and new information to an otherwise dull market."
Referring to the report on November new orders for durable goods as "the major release," Mr. Fine called it "a notoriously volatile economic indicator that has the potential to provide fuel for a market liftoff from its stationary state."
Market forecasts range from a decline of 1.5 percent to an increase of 2 percent, but most projections are clustered between unchanged to a rise of five-tenths of a percent. Discussing components in the report, Mr. Fine said that electrical machinery was likely to decline, while military orders seemed primed for an increase. Civilian aircraft, one of the key factors in these data, is capable of almost anything on a month-to-month basis, but the trend is still rising, and there have been announced orders that have not yet been reflected in the Commerce Department tabulations.
He pointed out that several economic reports would be released next week. Leading indicators and existing home sales are due Monday; consumer confidence, new-home sales and the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey on Tuesday; the National Association of Purchasing Management index, initial jobless claims and early motor vehicle sales on Thursday, and construction spending on Friday. He said all of them would "provide fodder for the market's insatiable demand for information."

HEADLINE: School District in California Settles Sex Harassment Suit

BYLINE: New York Times Regional Newspapers 

DATELINE: SANTA ROSA, Calif., Dec. 26

 BODY:
A school system in Northern California will pay a former student $250,000 to settle a lawsuit charging sexual harassment in a schoolyard, lawyers for the school district said.
The settlement involving the Petaluma schools, announced on Tuesday, comes less than two weeks before a scheduled trial and ends a case that had raised the issue of school officials' liability for students' behavior. It does not include any admission of wrongdoing by school officials. 
 The suit was brought by a former student who said she was subjected to lewd sexual references by other children at Kenilworth Junior High from 1990 to 1992.
The student, identified in court papers as Jane Doe and who was transferred out of the Petaluma public schools, said a school counselor and other officials ignored her plight.
The school district presented the settlement as a cost-saving move made in consultation with insurers and a Federal District Court magistrate, who mediated the talks with the student's lawyers.
"They had to look at economic realities," said Larry Frierson, a lawyer for the 7,400-student school system in Petaluma, about 40 miles north of San Francisco.
The school board president, Elizabeth Marquardt, said on Tuesday that given the likelihood of appeals by either side, "we were looking at something that was going to be going for many more years."
The district's legal fees already top $350,000, and Ms. Marquardt said the cost of pursuing the case to trial was prohibitive.
Lawyers for the student were not available for comment on the settlement. Efforts to contact the student, who is now 18, were unsuccessful.
Ms. Marquardt said that the school board was confident of winning the case but that the district faced a difficult task had the case gone to trial. Judge Claudia Wilken of Federal District Court had ruled that the student need only prove that the district knew or should have known about the situation and that officials had then failed to act upon it.
The district's lawyers argued that the girl should have been required to prove that school officials had intentionally discriminated against her. A Federal appeals court refused to review Judge Wilken's decision.
"We don't have the same kind of liability situation as an employer-employee type of case," Ms. Marquardt said. "We can't fire kids, and we're very limited in how far we can go in trying to establish the conduct of students when we're not constantly there."
Some students had been reprimanded and others suspended after the girl complained about their behavior, Ms. Marquardt said.
Federal law is unsettled in the area of how such harassment should be treated under anti-discrimination laws applied to the workplace.
In August, the Department of Education told the nation's 15,000 school districts to adopt clear policies against sexual harassment and to establish procedures to handle student complaints.
A 1972 Federal law bars sex discrimination in schools and colleges.
Courts have issued contradictory rulings on how the law works. Earlier this year, a Federal appeals court in Texas ruled that students were protected against harassment and discrimination by teachers and other school employees but not by other students.
In a Georgia case that is being appealed, a panel of Federal judges came to the opposite conclusion.
The United States Supreme Court refused to wade into the dispute when presented with the Texas case in August, but legal scholars say it will not be able to avoid the question indefinitely.

HEADLINE: THE FUND MACHINE: A special report.;
Building a Bulging War Chest: How Clinton Financed His Run

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26

 BODY:
In the ornate Map Room of the White House residence, with Vice President Al Gore at his side, President Clinton assembled his most senior advisers for an important budget meeting. It was not the Federal budget that was being considered, but the budget of the Democratic National Committee.
For more than an hour on that day last spring, the officials debated how much money the Democrats could realistically raise by Election Day and how the dollars should be allocated for different campaign purposes. 
 These decisions would help shape Mr. Clinton's final drive for re-election. And so the cast at the meeting, according to officials, included senior White House aides like Leon E. Panetta, the chief of staff, and Harold M. Ickes, deputy chief of staff, as well as party officials, among them Donald L. Fowler, national chairman of the Democratic committee, Marvin S. Rosen, the Democratic finance chairman, and Scott Pastrick, the party treasurer.
By the time the meeting was over, the group had reached a general understanding of how much money it would take to run the Democratic committee's end of the 1996 campaign. "There was no definitive judgment in that meeting," Mr. Fowler recalled. "There was no occasion where somebody said, "O.K., the budget's going to be $123 million," he said. "It's probably accurate to describe the median point of consensus as somewhere between $120 million and $125 million."
As controversy has grown over Democratic fund raising, Mr. Clinton has sought to distinguish between the practices of his own re-election campaign and those of the Democratic committee. But the Map Room meeting is just one example of how closely the committee worked with the White House.
Indeed, the meeting was a culmination of an evolutionary process that began after November 1994, when the President was shaken by the Republicans' Congressional victory and feared that it could be the prelude to his own defeat. He directed his political advisers to embark in 1995 on what they believed to be the earliest, most sustained television advertising campaign of any incumbent President.
And since Mr. Clinton did not know if he would face a primary challenge, and wanted to scare off rivals with the size of his war chest, he and his aides decided the money for many of the commercials during the primary season should not come from his personal campaign treasury.
That, in turn, put more pressure on the Democratic committee to carry out a fund-raising program of unprecedented scope.
In the frenzy, a small group of Democratic fund-raisers and donors amassed questionable, and, in some cases unlawful, contributions, some from Asian sources, that have left the White House and the Democratic Party embroiled in controversy and facing a new round of hearings from a Republican-controlled Congress.
The Democratic Party has returned more than $1 million raised by John Huang, the Democratic committee's principal fund-raiser among Asian-Americans. Congress and the Justice Department have initiated multiple investigations of Mr. Huang's activities, as well as those of Charles Yah Lin Trie, another fund-raiser, and of James and Mochtar Riady, donors to the party. The Riadys are Indonesian businessmen with longstanding ties to Mr. Clinton from Arkansas; Mr. Trie is an Arkansas businessman who brought in questionable contributions to Mr. Clinton's legal defense fund that were returned.
While party officials argue that only a tiny percentage of their donations have come under question, they have been forced to admit that they made a series of mistakes, beginning with a decision in 1994 to disband a unit that had previously screened contributions and contributors. Instead, they relied on the gut instincts of fund-raisers about what was seemly and unseemly. One of the results was that Mr. Clinton himself had to acknowledge that he had entertained the head of a state-run Chinese investment and weapons trading company at a White House coffee session with donors.
Such controversy has turned the spotlight not just on whether money was raised from foreign sources, which would not be legal, but also on practices that, while legal, ran counter to Mr. Clinton's own promises to clean up the election system. In his 1992 campaign book "Putting People First," Mr. Clinton said American politics had become a "hostage" to monied interests. He argued that "political action committees, industry lobbies and cliques of $100,000 donors buy access to Congress and the White House."
But this year Mr. Clinton relentlessly used all the perks and power of incumbency to raise money, according to both his aides and campaign finance experts. And White House and party officials met weekly to go over money goals and determine where the President would be needed to appear.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore presided over unpublicized, small gatherings aimed at rewarding the largest donors with access to the highest echelons of power. Donors who gave roughly $50,000 or $100,000 to the Democratic Party could have dinner with the President in small groups of 10 to 20 in luxurious Washington hotels near the White House: the Jefferson, the Hay-Adams, and the Carlton, according to Democratic fund-raisers and Administration officials.
Others were escorted in small groups to the Map Room in the White House residence for an hourlong coffee with Mr. Clinton. Democrats say the President was host at an average of two White House coffees a week this past year for a mix of political activists and large donors. Among the guests at one of those coffees last Feb. 6 was Wang Jun, who is chairman of Poly Technologies, which intelligence officials say is owned and run by China's People's Liberation Army.
Individuals who gave $10,000 and $25,000 met in small groups with Mr. Gore. Or else they attended dinners with the President in groups of about 100. In other cases, White House and Democratic officials say there were no explicit price tags, but there were rewards and incentives used to thank major donors and charm potential givers.
Mr. Clinton occasionally played golf with a potential donor while other large givers and fund-raisers were taken on overseas trips or invited to state dinners. Some stayed overnight in the Lincoln Bedroom. White House officials say that there was no dollar figure tied to the overnight stays and that not all large fund-raisers were invited. But Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, has acknowledged that some fund-raisers and other supporters and friends of the President were put up there as a gracious thank-you gesture by the Clintons.
"It's clear that Mr. Clinton and the First Lady are social by nature," he said. "They enjoy entertaining at the White House and made clear they were willing to have guests over. They actively invite friends, supporters, fund-raisers, interesting people over."
Democrats argue that only by using the President himself as their star attraction could they draw near the Republicans in fund raising.
"As long as I've been around, for several decades, there has been an ongoing concern that the Democratic Party is outfinanced in national elections," Mr. McCurry said. "The President had to work hard to correct that imbalance if he was to be competitive."
In fact, despite all their efforts, the Democrats still lagged behind the Republicans. According to the last report of the Federal Election Commission, which did not include the final weeks of fund raising, the Democrats brought in $242 million in 1995-1996, compared with $399 million by the Republicans.
But it is also true that the cost of this Presidential campaign was driven up by Mr. Clinton himself and his determination to use television commercials to spread his political message across the country.
 
The Strategy
Mr. President, Mr. Television
For years the increased reliance on television advertising in Presidential races has made the costs of national campaigns rise exponentially. But in the aftermath of the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994, when his own political fortunes looked bleak, Mr. Clinton turned to television commercials as no incumbent President had done before.
In 1995, Mr. Clinton hammered home one point again and again, his aides said. He felt that he had lost on his proposed overhaul of health care, the centerpiece of his first term, because he had allowed his opponents to win the debate through their television commercials. He was determined not to let this happen again.
Mr. Clinton was reinforced by Dick Morris, whom he had brought on as his new political strategist. Mr. Morris had long believed in using television advertisements early in a race to allow his candidates to get their interpretation of events on the record first and then force opponents to try to dislodge it.
In June of 1995, Mr. Clinton broke precedent and aired two commercials on crime in crucial electoral states almost a year and a half before the election. The nascent Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, which had just begun fund raising in April, spent $2.5 million for those ads, a decision that caused much dissent among Mr. Clinton's aides.
Mr. Ickes, the deputy White House chief of staff who was running the campaign, and Terence McAuliffe, the national finance chairman of the Clinton-Gore campaign committee, wanted to concentrate on amassing the largest primary season war chest allowed under campaign finance laws and to do it quickly in order to scare off primary challengers.
Spending the money as it came in would defeat that purpose, they said, arguing also that there was no proof that early commercials would have any lasting effect.
Mr. Morris countered that the President should opt out of the public finance system and forgo any Federal matching dollars. By doing so, Mr. Clinton would be freed from the strict fund-raising limits set under the public finance law and be able to raise and spend unlimited sums.
The idea, according to one White House aide "had some appeal to the President at first blush." Mr. Ickes and Mr. McAuliffe, officials say, argued strenuously against it.
The two said Mr. Clinton would be pilloried in the press for having presented himself as an advocate of reform only to break out of the public finance system that was established after the Watergate scandals. They also said that if the President began unlimited fund raising, he would dry up the well for Democratic Congressional candidates.
Mr. Clinton agreed, but still considered the television commercials imperative. In September of 1995, he and his aides hit upon another route that in effect would allow him to spend more than the $37 million limit set by the public finance law for the primary campaign period.
After consulting with campaign lawyers, Mr. Ickes presented Mr. Clinton with a plan for the Democratic National Committee, which is not bound by the same fund-raising restrictions as the President's primary season re-election committee, to pay for political commercials tied to the budget fight in Congress and featuring the President and his positions on issues like Medicare. The campaign would cost about $15 million through the end of the year.
This plan was legal, Mr. Clinton's advisers said, because the commercials concerned a legislative issue and would stop short of urging a vote for Mr. Clinton. "Our lawyer's opinion was that while it might be a tad controversial, we were well within our bounds to run issue advertising," a White House official said.
One pilot set of commercials paid for by the Democratic National Committee had already run in August at a cost of $900,000. With Mr. Clinton's approval and participation in editing scripts, the Democrats in October began running $1 million to $1.5 million worth of political commercials a week in important markets.
Except for a break over Christmas and New Year's, the President was on the air the rest of the campaign. The issue commercials alone ended up costing the Democrats about $45 million, party officials said.
It was that decision about advertising that several senior party fund-raisers privately blame for creating the fierce pressure for money that overwhelmed the Democratic National Committee. "They were pushed to do the media stuff and no one at the D.N.C. pushed back," said one fund-raiser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
But many in the White House and the party also believe it was those ads that turned the public against the Republicans' budget plan and positioned Mr. Clinton to win re-election.
"I think the decision to do that was absolutely the correct decision," Mr. Fowler said. "It worked. It absolutely worked both for the President and the Democratic Party."
He added, "The other side is, 'Hell, yes there was pressure to raise money.' We never raised that much money. But that was self-imposed. It was not inordinate. It was not callous. It was not done in any sort of cavalier manner."
 
The Money Drive
The Marathon Man: From Event to Event
To bring in the money needed for the 1996 campaign, the Democratic National Committee set up an extensive network of fund-raisers.
A Financial Advisory Board of 170-members was created for those who pledged to raise at least $350,000. The Business Council, composed of donors who gave $10,000 and $15,000, was expanded to 1,700 members from 240 members a few years ago.
There were Democrats who would specialize in raising money from Asian-Americans, from Greek-Americans, from donors of Hispanic origin and from women. In fact, Asian-Americans were considered such a lucrative new fund-raising source that Mr. Huang was given the title of vice chairman of finance to give him added credibility as he foraged for funds among that group
The Democrats knew they would also have to make extensive use of the President and the Vice President to meet their goals, sending them both to the $1,000-a-plate dinners, which were open to press coverage, and to the private soirees held in mansions, hotel suites and even a Buddhist Temple outside Los Angeles.
Once a week, officials from the White House and D.N.C. would meet, usually in the Ward Room in the basement of the White House, to review the fund raising and set schedules for the President. Those who usually attended were Mr. Ickes; Douglas Sosnik, the White House political director; David Strauss, the Vice President's representative; Mr. Fowler; Mr. Rosen, the D.N.C. finance chairman, and Richard Sullivan, the finance director of the party.
The intensity of the money drive can be seen in Mr. Clinton's activity. In the past year alone he stopped in to at least 90 fund-raising events across the country, according to public schedules, with virtually every road trip built around multiple dinners, lunches and receptions to raise money.
He brought in more than $10 million for the Democratic Party in a single night in an event at Radio City Music Hall in New York celebrating his 50th birthday in August. He not only courted the big donors but the small ones, too. After more high-priced dinners he would attend late night "Saxophone Club" events for young donors giving perhaps $150 each.
One principle of the fund raising was that the largest donors could be wooed by intimate access to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore. "For 99.9 percent of them, it's ego," said one party fund-raiser. "It's to be able to sit in a room with the President and later be able to say they had dinner with the President."
To attend a small dinner with Mr. Clinton outside the White House, those invited were usually asked for specific donations, often of $50,000 or $100,000, Democrats say. Still others who gave $50,000 and $100,000 -- or were considered prospects for such sums -- were invited to coffee at the White House. But their invitation came a discreet interval after they donated or before they were going to be asked for a contribution. The coffees were also attended by political supporters and local officials.
Those who attended the coffees and dinners said Mr. Clinton never asked for money and that the discussions covered a wide range of issues.
Lewis Rudin, a New York City real estate developer who customarily gives large donations to political candidates, said he attended a White House breakfast with the President over the summer along with other New Yorkers, mostly from the financial world. "It was a freewheeling discussion on the problems of the state of the union," he said. "I brought up issues that concerned New York City and infrastructure. The guys in the financial industry, they talked about the state of the economy."
Another New Yorker said he was invited to a White House coffee by a fund-raiser after he had given about $50,000. He recalled that in his session with Mr. Clinton, one lawyer discussed pending product liability legislation. A financial investor told Mr. Clinton that companies that laid off their workers during a restructuring should give their former employees stock options so that they could get some benefit from the layoffs. "It was not more than 45 minutes," the participant said. "It was substantive."
Asked at a White House appearance recently about the February coffee attended by the Chinese Government trade official, Mr. Clinton said: "There were disparate people from different walks of life, from all over the country there. And normally what would happen in one of those conversations is I'd talk for 5 or 10 minutes and then we'd either go around the table and let people say whatever they wanted to say."
Mr. Clinton's aides say they tried to stay away from industry-specific events. But that was not always the case. When Mr. Clinton went to a small dinner in August at the California home of Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Apple Computer, his aides openly said they hoped the President would woo back support and donations from chief executives of high-tech industry who were angry that he had vetoed a Federal securities law they wanted to protect them from shareholders' suits. (Congress overrode his veto.)
 
The Personal Diplomacy
Turning On Charm, Turning Out Gifts
In another instance, Mr. Clinton raised about $1 million at a $10,000-a-plate dinner thrown by William A. Brandt, a veteran Democratic fund-raiser, at his home in the Chicago suburbs on Sept. 17.
Mr. Brandt is the chief executive officer of Development Specialists Inc., which does bankruptcy workouts and most of the guests were from the bankruptcy industry. Bankruptcy issues are expected to move center stage next year when Congress is to receive a study it commissioned on ways to improve the Federal bankruptcy code.
Mr. Brandt said the donors at his house were sending a message: "We want you to know that we are aware our issues are being debated in the highest councils. It's of sufficient concern to us that we are out in demonstrable numbers."
"End of story," he added. "It's American participatory democracy."
In another case, Mr. Clinton charmed a donor on the golf course.
Last spring Brian L. Greenspun, the editor of The Las Vegas Sun, decided to try to heal a rift between Democrats and gambling interests. A friend of Mr. Clinton from college days at Georgetown University, Mr. Greenspun set up a golf game on May 31 between the President and Stephen A. Wynn, the chairman and chief executive officer of Mirage Resorts Inc. and a man widely regarded as the industry's leader.
"It was an opportunity for Steve to meet him in a different way from the way a citizen would meet the President through the media," explained Mr. Greenspun. "I wanted Steve to meet him face to face."
The President and Mr. Wynn rode together in a cart during 18 holes of golf at Congressional Country Club in Potomac, Md., discussing world events and raising daughters, but avoiding policy matters, one of Mr. Wynn's aides said.
On June 9, Mr. Wynn and his wife, Elaine, attended a $25,000-a-couple fund-raising luncheon for the Democratic Party at Mr. Greenspun's Las Vegas home that featured Mr. Clinton.
Mirage later gave another $10,000 to the Democrats, but the bulk of Mirage's money continued to go to Republicans. Still the Democratic donations were a big switch for Mr. Wynn, who in 1995 was host at a party for Bob Dole that raised half a million dollars for the Republican Party and who had described Mr. Clinton's philosophy of government as "ready, fire, aim."
"I don't think there's any question but that Steve's good feelings about the President helped change the dialogue among the industry people and the Administration," said Mr. Greenspun.
The White House also regularly made gestures of thanks to large contributors, whether through a holiday dinner at the White House, an invitation to a state dinner or the inclusion in a delegation accompanying the President on a foreign trip. Mr. Gore has also played his part in the care of donors. The night after he and Mr. Clinton were re-elected, a select group of political supporters, Democratic donors and fund-raisers gathered at the Vice President's mansion for cocktails.
These were 175 people to whom the Gores gave a special thank you before a larger, less exclusive victory celebration elsewhere in the city. Many in the White House also saw the group as the core of what will eventually become the Gore campaign of 2000.
Some of the guests were longtime Gore friends, like James Free, a Washington lobbyist and Norman Brownstein a Colorado lawyer who both raise funds for the Democratic party. Also invited were Mr. McAuliffe the powerhouse fund-raiser who was the national finance chairman of the Clinton-Gore campaign; Steven Rattner a New York investment banker; Walter Shorenstein, a California real estate magnate; Howard Glicken, a fund-raiser from Miami and Gore loyalist; Noach Dear, a New York City Councilman who is a prolific fund-raiser among Orthodox Jews.
"You call them donors," said Lorraine Voles, a spokeswoman for the Vice President. "They call themselves friends of the Vice President. They were a lot of people who contributed to the Democratic Party and Presidential campaign who are friends and colleagues of the Vice President."

HEADLINE: DEFYING MILOSEVIC, THOUSANDS MARCH IN SERBIAN CAPITAL

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Dec. 26

 BODY:
 Defying increased pressure from President Slobodan Milosevic to stay off the streets, tens of thousands of opposition demonstrators poured into central Belgrade today, apparently energized rather than cowed by the heavy police presence.
Mr. Milosevic's Interior Ministry announced on Wednesday night that demonstrations would be banned across Serbia today and that the police would intervene to stop them. 
 A far larger number of police officers were on the streets today, many with riot gear and tear-gas canisters, shutting off entrances to the main square and preventing demonstrators from gathering in one large crowd.
But despite police violence against anti-Milosevic demonstrators on Tuesday, and even though temperatures were bitterly cold, about 60,000 supporters of the opposition gathered today in the snowy downtown area.
A small group of protesters were beaten by baton-swinging police officers when they tried to leave the main square at the end of the rally, though apparently the police did not use as much force as they had on Tuesday. Other officers pushed crowds aside to open a street for traffic.
As Mr. Milosevic stepped up police tactics against people now in their 37th day of protesting his rule and the country's economic devastation, the United States continued its criticism, saying he was responsible for violence on Tuesday that left 58 people hurt.
"The issuing of orders restricting demonstrations appears to be an attempt to prevent the marchers from exercising their rights and can only increase the possibility of confrontation and violence," a spokesman for the State Department, John R. Dinger, said today.
The confrontation between Mr. Milosevic, one of the last autocratic leaders left from Europe's old Communist world, and the emboldened protesters entered a new phase of menacing unpredictability after the show of police force on Tuesday.
Many Western diplomats say they believe that Mr. Milosevic, after a month of hoping the demonstrations would peter out, is now trying to gain control of the situation, which is spinning further out of his grasp than he can tolerate.
But few here are prepared to predict what he will do. In 1991 he sent the army in to quell antiwar demonstrators, but he is now presiding over an economically ruined country. Rumors gripped Belgrade tonight that the three main leaders of the opposition parties, grouped as Zajedno, or Together, were about to be arrested.
Mr. Milosevic's frustration with events apparently multiplied after Tuesday, when the number of his supporters bused into Belgrade fell far short of the 400,000 his party leaders had promised.
About 40,000 turned up in the capital, and aside from some clear provocateurs, opposition demonstrators said, many of the rural people appeared surprised and afraid at being so outnumbered.
In a show of pique today, Mr. Milosevic refused to see the highest-ranking American diplomat here, Richard Miles, the charge d'affaires. Instead, Mr. Miles was relegated to seeing the Foreign Minister, Milan Milutinovic.
American officials said Mr. Miles was blunt in conveying the Clinton Administration's concern about the police violence on Tuesday and about Mr. Milosevic's refusal to begin a dialogue with the opposition. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott directly blamed Mr. Milosevic in a statement on Wednesday for provoking the violence.
The United States has called on Mr. Milosevic to respect the results of elections last month, which he annulled after the opposition won in many municipalities.
As his reliance on the police grows, he faces what diplomats call severe public criticism from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is to present a report on Friday in Geneva.
A former Prime Minister of Spain, Felipe Gonzalez, led an O.S.C.E. mission to Belgrade last week. American officials said they had encouraged him to be tough on Mr. Milosevic in presenting the report.
Diplomats at the security group's headquarters in Vienna said Mr. Gonzalez told Mr. Milosevic that he must accept the results of last month's elections. They said they expected Mr. Gonzalez to deliver the same message publicly on Friday.
The public reprimand from Mr. Gonzalez would further isolate Mr. Milosevic internationally. Germany and France, which have been among Mr. Milosevic's biggest backers in Europe since he signed the Dayton peace accord, both issued critical statements after the violence on Tuesday.
At home, Mr. Milosevic's friends seem to be dwindling in number. The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Pavle, distanced himself further from Mr. Milosevic, saying in a statement that the street violence had been caused by those in authority.
The leaders of Montenegro, which together with Serbia makes up the truncated Yugoslavia, have also made statements suggesting their unhappiness with Mr. Milosevic's standoff.
Some opposition leaders say the police force, which Mr. Milosevic has strengthened by increasing the number of units and providing good pay, may no longer be a totally reliable and cohesive weapon in a crackdown.
But there is little doubt, many opposition supporters acknowledge, that there enough special forces in the police ranks to carry out a crackdown. The officers who manned the demonstration today came mainly from the northern province of Vojvodina and from the Kosovo region, opposition supporters said.
In his inner circle, Mr. Milosevic is described as confronted with opposing forces, some counseling reason and others, led by his wife, Mirjana Markovic, looking for a crackdown. Mrs. Markovic, a hard-line socialist, heads one of the political parties in Mr. Milosevic's coalition.
But despite the threat of police violence that hung over the protesters today, most of them seemed undeterred by the dangers.
"The police are afraid, too," said Gubisav Standjele, a hydrologist. "And what is Milosevic going to do? He can't stop people forever coming to town. You can't block Belgrade. It's a free town."
Another protester, Branka Tomisovic, 26, an economics student at Belgrade University, who seemed to be enjoying the carnival atmosphere in the lightly falling snow, said she no longer saw Mr. Milosevic as a strongman.
"He doesn't know what to do," she said as she jauntily walked along with hundreds of others outside a police cordon that was preventing them from getting to the main square.
Vuk Draskovic, an opposition leader, suggested that people walk in large circles on the side streets, imitating prisoners in a prison yard, as a way of protesting their exclusion from the main square, known as Terazija.
Toward the end of the rally tonight, the police pushed many of the crowd in the area to the side of the street, allowing the traffic to flow.
The demonstrators good-naturedly clapped at the police and with intended irony congratulated them on doing a good job, jesting that unlike other state employees, they might now get their salaries on time.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Briefly Passes 116 Yen, Its Highest Level in 45 Months

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar briefly surged past 116 yen to another 45-month high yesterday after the Japanese Trade Minister expressed concern about the economic outlook next year, inciting a new round of weakness in the Japanese currency.
The yen's decline also contributed to a broad rally in the British pound, which rose nearly 2 pence to hit the highest level against the dollar in more than four years. 
 The dollar was mostly higher in other foreign-exchange dealings, lightened by the absence of traders at the end of this holiday week.
Although the low volume distorted price movements, market participants said the dollar's breach of 115 yen and 116 yen this week laid the basis for a possible advance toward 120 yen, an exchange rate last seen nearly four years ago.
"Even with the thin liquidity, the move was very significant," said Dennis Heidt, chief dealer at the New York branch of Banque Paribas. "We have broken an important level."
In early dealings the dollar rose to 116.12 yen, the highest since 116.59 yen on March 31, 1993. Sellers later emerged to trim the dollar's gain but it still settled in New York at 115.50 yen, up from 114.66 yen late on Thursday. The dollar traded at 1.5558 marks, up from 1.5550 marks.
Demand for pounds lifted the British currency to $1.6929 in New York from $1.6731 and the highest since mid-October 1992.
The main theme of the day was the yen's weakness on anxiety over Japan's economy and its wobbly stock market, which has fallen to the lowest levels of 1996 in the last week.
The selling of yen intensified after the Trade Minister, Shinji Sato, said that he was worried about the prospects of the economy's during Japan's next fiscal year, which will start in April.
His remarks reinforced the view that interest rates in Japan would remain low, which has helped contribute to a nearly 12 percent gain in the dollar against the yen this year. Low interest rates diminish demand for a currency.
Traders who had bet on a rebound in the yen from its weakness earlier this week scrambled to sell yen instead after the dollar reached 115.70 yen. That further helped the dollar.

HEADLINE: Mohawk Memories;
An Indian Community Flourished and Faded In a Section of Brooklyn

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
It has been years since she last stopped there, but sometimes, when she is driving through downtown Brooklyn, Verlain White glances down Nevins Street and remembers when it was Mohawk territory.
These days she is an alcohol-abuse counselor, but in the early 1960's Ms. White tended bar beneath a framed picture of Jim Thorpe in a dark Nevins Street tavern called the Wigwam, a job that gave her a unique vantage point within a distinctly unusual community of Brooklyn immigrants. 
 "It was a lot more than just a bar; it was like Grand Central for the Mohawk Indians who came here," she said. "People sometimes picked their mail up there. They got rides back to the reservation there. They found out about jobs there. They met there. I saw everybody."
But the bar is gone now, and, over the last 10 years, all but a handful of the hundreds of Mohawks like Ms. White who lived in downtown Brooklyn for more than half a century have finally left there, too. "I don't hear anything about the neighborhood anymore," she said. "It's strange. When the past is past, I guess it's gone."
One of the most important links to the old neighborhood was broken last week with the death of the Rev. Dr. David Munroe Cory, who learned to speak the Mohawk-Oneida dialect and translated the Gospel of Luke into the language when dozens of Mohawks joined his congregation on Pacific Street.
And sometime next month, the last Mohawk will move out of 375 State Street, an apartment building where for many years there was a Mohawk name on every buzzer.
Of the countless immigrant groups that have shaped the streets of Brooklyn over the last two centuries, the Kahnawake and Akwesasne Mohawk Indians provided one of the most unlikely and fleeting presences.
They began to come in the late 1920's, mostly from Kahnawake, a Quebec reservation of about 3,000 Mohawks on the St. Lawrence River, and then from a smaller reservation, Akwesasne, when dozens of the men, renowned for their prowess at working on the dizzyingly high steel skeletons of railroad bridges, found jobs on skyscrapers and bridges as New York City feverishly pushed up and out.
They settled within about 10 square blocks of each other in an area then known as North Gowanus, now Boerum Hill, but their numbers were always more fluid than those of the immigrant neighborhoods around them. The men joined the Brooklyn and Manhattan locals of the international ironworkers union, but for reasons that no one can remember today, they all gravitated toward boarding houses near the Brooklyn local on Atlantic Avenue.
For the first years especially, though, Brooklyn was no more than a way station.
Joe Deer, a retired 74-year-old iron worker who came to Brooklyn when he was 16, recalls his first apartment: a $10-a-month cold-water flat on Warren Street, where he burned planks from grocery crates to keep warm. And no sooner had he bought his first car, for $15, than he joined his fellow Mohawks in faithfully making weekend trips back to the reservation.
"It was a 12-hour drive in those days," he said, "but everybody went back if they had a way."
At the drop of a hat, the men also "boomed out," or traveled wherever there were lucrative or daring iron working jobs around the country, spending weeks or months in Detroit or Chicago or San Francisco.
But after the Depression, the men's wives and families came down to stay with them for longer periods. The women also found work, some in factories, some as sales clerks and maids. And the neighborhood became for many years the largest community of Mohawks anywhere outside a reservation, with its size estimated at up to 700 people in the 1940's.
Their presence in the largely Irish and Italian enclave provided for no shortage of jarring cultural intersections. For Daniel Cory, Dr. Cory's son, one such moment occurred when he heard, through the open windows of his house, the sound of his father preaching sermons in Mohawk, which he had learned over several years with help from the ironworkers and their wives.
Besides translating the Gospel of Luke, Dr. Cory, who died Dec. 18 after suffering a stroke, also helped translate a hymnal into the dialect to make his parishioners feel more comfortable. (Many Mohawks who have returned to the reservation still refer to the church as "o-non-sa-to-ken-ti-wa-ten-ros-hens" or "the church that makes friends.")
Mr. Cory, an auto parts dealer who now lives in Bay Ridge and keeps yellowed copies of his father's papers, said that his father's church, Cuyler Presbyterian Church on Pacific Street, is still probably the only Presbyterian church ever to have sponsored a yearly pow-wow, which drew Mohawks from around the city to watch traditional dances, prayers and smoke signals. "Which I guess was considered blasphemous by some in the church," he said. "But everybody had a great time."
The Wigwam, at 75 Nevins Street, had been a bar under two different names since the late 1800's, but the ironworkers quickly made it their own. When a Spanish immigrant and his Mohawk wife bought it in the 1950's, they posted a sign over the door: "The Greatest Iron Workers in the World Pass Thru These Doors." Another bar around the corner on Atlantic Street, the Spar Bar and Grill, also became a gathering place and at a makeshift lunch counter across the street from it, a woman sometimes cooked a Mohawk dish of white cornbread with kidney beans.
The talk over the beer mugs at the Spar Bar and the Wigwam was always of the latest job: the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the hangars at Kennedy International Airport, the Seagrams Building, the Time & Life Building. "There were a lot of skyscrapers built over those two bars back in those days," said Ms. White, who came to Brooklyn from Akwesasne in 1959, when she was 19. "It was like I didn't leave home because they were there, my people were there, and I felt safe."
Over time, historians, sociologists, journalists and novelists found the neighborhood, drawn by the romantic lure of the Mohawks and their livelihood. And while they sometimes had to contend with outright racism, the Indians more often had to endure the patronizing amusement of New Yorkers. (Headlines like "Indians Netum Wampum on Heap Big Skyscraper" were not uncommon in the 1950's.)
But for several years after World War II, the Mohawks seemed so entrenched in their Brooklyn home -- some called it "Downtown Caughnawaga" (an older English rendering of the reservation's name) -- that many assumed it would stay that way. Joseph Mitchell, in his famous 1949 article for The New Yorker, "The Mohawks in High Steel," wrote that "there are approximately 400 men, women and children in it, it is growing, and it shows signs of permanence."
Little more than a decade later, though, it had already started to change and dwindle, and many families that Mitchell chronicled had left for good.
Many left for the same reasons that others fled the inner city, as the economy eroded and crime rose. Some like Margaret Diabo Cioffi, who now lives in Queens, and Sonny Rice, who owns a structural steel company in Rockland County, married non-Indians and settled more or less permanently in more suburban areas.
Most, like Mr. Deer, and his cousin, Floyd Brooks, who still speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent, retired back to Kahnawake and Akwesasne, where they had always intended to spend their last days.
Like many of the older men, Mr. Deer does not wax nostalgic about Brooklyn. "I've got to tell you, I don't miss New York City one little bit," he said recently in a telephone interview from Kahnawake.
In June, after their stories of iron work were recorded at the American Indian Community House in Manhattan for an oral history project called 'High Steel and Corn Meal: Recounting an Era," Mr. Deer, Mr. Brooks and another Kahnawake Mohawk, Joe Regis, piled into a car and drove through the old neighborhood in the pouring rain. When asked recently how it made him feel, Mr. Deer paused, hummed, and said: "Well, I guess I was amazed at how much the city has changed. That's about all I can say."
Today, there are no more than a dozen Mohawks still living in the old neighborhood, mostly older women who are reluctant to talk about the old days and who have little contact with each other, besides infrequent get-togethers in Manhattan, at the Community House.
Though the numbers are hard to come by, many Mohawks still live scattered throughout other neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the city. At least 10 percent of the city's ironworkers are still Mohawk, said R. Victor Stewart, a spokesman for New York City area locals. (A group of Mohawks recently worked on the repairs to the Queensboro Bridge, he said.)
But virtually all of the landmarks of the Mohawks' years in Brooklyn have now disappeared. The building on Pacific Street that housed Cuyler Presbyterian Church, which once had as many as 50 Mohawks in its congregation, has now been divided into apartments. The Wigwam is a pizza parlor. The Spar Bar is shuttered, and the union hall has moved to Queens.
And next month, Linda Deer Palozzola, the last Mohawk remaining in 375 State Street -- an apartment building once owned by a Mohawk that was long a center of Indian life -- will move to Pennsylvania with her new husband after a half-century at the address.
It is an act that carries great symbolic weight for Brian Rice, 37, Mrs. Palozzola's cousin and a Mohawk Indian who works at his family's steel company in Mount Vernon.
When he was younger, Mr. Rice often went to State Street with his family for holidays. "And it was always so nice because the whole building was just family, just Mohawks," he said. "All the doors to all the apartments were open and you could go into any of them. It was always very emotional for me when people moved out of that building."
"So this," he added, "will really be the end of an era for us."

HEADLINE: Weak Reports Bolster Bonds in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday, gaining in light trading after a report showed an unexpected drop in orders for durable goods in November.
The report helped reinforce expectations that moderate economic growth was continuing and that the Federal Reserve would not need to raise short-term interest rates. 
 "Obviously people are thinking inflationary pressures aren't developing as strongly as they thought a week ago," said Alan Day, who helps manage $900 million at Stratevest Group.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 19/32 , to 9918/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.53 percent from 6.58 percent on Thursday. Prices of shorter-term maturities also rose, with the yield on the two-year note falling to 5.78 percent from 5.83 percent.
Bond prices received an early lift from the Commerce Department report, which showed that orders for durable goods, which include everything from blenders to aircraft engines, fell 1.6 percent in November after rising a revised five-tenths of 1 percent the previous month. Economists had expected a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent before the report.
The report "showed at best continued modest growth," said Paul De Noon, who manages $2 billion in bonds at Alliance Capital Management.
Such growth would hearten bond investors because it would keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates to combat inflation.
"The outlook for bonds continues to be positive," Craig Coates, head government bond trader at Prudential Securities, said.
Bond traders and investors took comfort from the fact that the bulk of the decline reflected a drop in orders for electronics, semiconductors and communications. Excluding transportation, orders for durable goods fell 2.2 percent.
That suggests consumer spending, a driver of growth, may be waning, said Alan Levenson, a money market economist at UBS Securities.
There were also signs of strength. Compared with a year ago, for example, total orders rose almost 6 percent in November. Traders may look for more evidence of slowing growth before pushing prices much higher.
"The durable goods number is a pretty volatile series from month to month," said Kevin Sluder, a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. "Anytime you get some big surprises, people will want to see what the overall trend is."
Traders shrugged off a greater-than-expected decline in initial unemployment claims.
Jobless claims fell by 15,000 last week, the Labor Department reported, more than the 6,000 drop expected by economists.
Helping push bonds higher was a gain in the dollar to a 45-month high against the yen. The dollar's advance raised expectations that foreign investors would continue to exhibit strong demand for American assets.
With stocks and bonds in the United States rising, and Japanese stocks languishing, investors in Japan are likely to keep their appetite for American assets and the dollars needed to buy them.
"The market continues to grind higher as the dollar improves versus the yen," said Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of government trading at Cowen & Company.
These events affected prices in a market where trading was slowed after the Christmas holiday.
About $37.7 billion in government securities was traded yesterday, according to Govpx Inc., a bond pricing service, 33 percent below average for a Friday in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: STATE OF FEAR: A special report.;
In Algeria, Oil and Islam Make a Volatile Mixture

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: HASSI MESSAOUD, Algeria

 BODY:
Deep in this desperate country there are Americans, dozens of them, ensconced behind high walls topped with barbed wire, living in anonymous camps, pouring billions of dollars into an Algerian state racked by civil war.
The Americans never set foot in northern Algeria, where political scores in a fierce undeclared war are settled daily by the slitting of throats. They never move without security guards. 
 They never fly on what they call "couscous airlines" -- Air Algeria. Rather, they jet into this desert town on chartered flights from London or Zurich and try to adapt to what one of them called "an environment that drives you so crazy you need soft white rooms and jackets that buckle at the back."
What lures them is a lot of oil and even more natural gas. "Is it worth it?" asked one of the oilmen, who spoke on condition that neither his name nor corporation be identified. "Well, we're sitting right here on about 3,000 square kilometers of oil. At near $25 dollars a barrel, that's interesting. If the Government can stay stable enough for us to get our money out, there is a lot of profit to be made. But if the Islamic extremists take over, I guess we're out of here."
Such calculations by the likes of Arco, which recently decided to invest more than $1.5 billion in Algeria, and the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, which is investing $100 million this year alone, are also being made by the Clinton Administration and other Western governments as they confront a war that shows no sign of ending.
Presented with a choice between a secretive military-backed Government and the violent currents of political Islam -- a choice that in Algeria has also been one between authoritarianism and democracy -- they have tended to come down on the side of the army and repression in a war that has already taken tens of thousands of lives.
The decision has kept the oil and gas pumping, but has not brought an end to the conflict any closer.
Algeria poses, in a form perhaps more acute than anywhere else, the increasingly widespread quandary of how to sift moderate political Islam from Islamic militancy and terrorism. The Clinton Administration has been at pains to draw a distinction between the two, repeatedly stating that it has no quarrel with Islam per se.
But in Algeria, where Islam first triumphed at the ballot box and was then forced underground, such principles have proved hard to apply. A result is deadlock and daily terror.
Up in what the American oilmen apprehensively call the "North," hundreds of miles from the camps cocooned in the state-within-a-state that is the Algerian Sahara, fear is never far from the surface. Military roadblocks abound and unmarked cars carrying what are presumably security personnel career around with submachine guns dangling ostentatiously from their windows.
Although the Government describes terrorism as "residual," brief announcements talk daily of 20 people killed "in a cowardly way" on a bus, or 31 people slain "in a cowardly way" in a village like Sidi Kebir, 30 miles from Algiers. To slit a throat in Algeria is, in official parlance, to be a craven killer and an Islamic fundamentalist.
No announcements mark the often brutal reprisals by security forces. Nobody knows exactly how many people have died -- the use of mass graves is widespread -- and, increasingly, nobody knows exactly who is killing whom.
 
The Impetus
Canceled Election Set Off Long Crisis
The conflict began in 1992 when the military-backed authority that has ruled Algeria since independence from France in 1962 canceled the country's first multiparty elections as the Islamic Salvation Front appeared set to win. The party, a populist movement of protest calling itself simply "the party of God" and thriving on Algeria's rampant economic woes, then split into armed factions pursuing insurrection and a more moderate wing.
Diplomats said President Clinton had written two letters in the last year to President Liamine Zeroual, a retired general, urging him to be "inclusive" -- to reach out to as wide a spectrum as possible of the nonviolent opposition in seeking national reconciliation.
But President Zeroual has recently appeared to ignore this advice, pushing through a repressive constitution last month and trying to eradicate not only the Armed Islamic Group, the most ruthless of the factions to split from the Islamic Salvation Front, but also any trace of the party itself.
The new Constitution, establishing a Parliament unable to pass laws without the President's approval and banning any parties based on religion, was met by silence in Washington and other Western capitals.
"By any estimate, the Constitution is deplorable," said Robert Mortimer, a political scientist at Haverford College. "But the United States has kept a determinedly low profile ever since the war began. Basically, the line has been it's more a French problem than ours."
France has been disinclined to embark on any peace initiative in its former colony. Algeria gives Paris the jitters.
With French unemployment already high and the politics of immigration already tense, the thought of young Algerians flooding across the Mediterranean in the event of an upheaval has dominated French thinking. More than half of Algeria's 28 million citizens are under 20.
At the price of attacks in Paris by Islamic guerrillas, France has quietly backed a Government that has kept the oil flowing, paid its debts to French banks and provided what France sees as the only alternative to a radical Islamic movement that has already proved seductive to some of the 800,000 people of Algerian descent living in France.
Other European countries have fallen in behind France, and a diplomatic silence has fallen over Algeria.
 
The Players
A Deadly Symbiosis Between Combatants
Isolated, little talked about, the war has taken on a quality as surreal as the contrast between the desert and Algiers. The police, it is commonly said in Algiers, are often disguised as bearded Islamic radicals; the guerrillas, in turn, it is said, are often neatly groomed in leather jackets. American and French diplomats are not allowed to leave their compounds and so have scant chance to glean any meaningful intelligence.
Between the extremes, a growing number of Algerians have the disturbing impression that a twisted symbiosis may now exist between the country's Islamic violence and its military-backed Government.
These Algerians say that an army discredited by decades of economic mismanagement that saw the decimation of Algerian agriculture and a disastrous drive to industrialize has now saved itself by having a monstrous enemy to fight. The more throats that are slit, the more Algeria is polarized, the more remote seems the democratic reform embarked on in 1989 and aborted in 1992.
"The aim of the regime is now to govern society through violence," said Saddik Debaili, a leader of the Front for Socialist Forces, an opposition party with its base in the Berber region east of Algiers. "It wants to manage, rather than eliminate, a violence that is not without its uses."
In Tizi Ouzou, the capital of the Kabylie Berber region, Ahcene Taalbi, a supporter of the Rally for Culture and Democracy, another opposition Berber party, said that the location of Islamic guerrillas in the region was widely known, but that the Government showed no real determination to eliminate them. Guerrillas slit the throat of his 62-year-old mother on May 22.
The criticisms of the Government from Algeria's large Berber minority must be weighed against the fact that the new Constitution angered them because it imposed Arabic as the state's sole official language. But the sense of an impasse that is almost willed, of a country held hostage to two dark forces, is widespread.
The threat from the Armed Islamic Group -- now widely thought to be a splintered movement lacking a unified leadership -- remains formidable. Omar Bellouchet, the editor of the Algiers daily El Watan, knows all about it.
He had just dropped his two children off at school. He looked back to be sure they were safely through the door. Then he saw the two gunmen with pistols. They ran forward, firing at him and the tires. He lay almost flat on the front seat, floored the gas pedal and survived.
That was on May 17, 1993. Since then, at least 56 journalists have been killed by the Islamic guerrillas, who have also attacked intellectuals, singers, writers and artists whose work they deem incompatible with Islamic law.
Last Feb. 11, a bomb went off outside Mr. Bellouchet's office at the Algiers press building, shattering his window and killing three journalists -- Allaoua Ait M'Barek, Djamel Derraz and Mohamed Dorbane -- from another newspaper, Le Soir d'Algerie.
In the face of such violence, more than 500 journalists have left the country. Several hundred others, including Mr. Bellouchet, now live in a specially guarded residence to the west of Algiers. He has sent his two children to live with a relative in France. His wife, shaken by the terror, died of a heart ailment. He is afraid but feels he cannot leave his country.
"We went through a war of liberation to fight off French colonization that was unbelievable in its savagery," Mr. Bellouchet said. "One million dead to be free. But after the war the military power simply dilapidated the strength of the country and its resources through waste and corruption. And there was a revolt. That is what the Islamic Salvation Front was: a revolt. There is no way the three million Algerians who voted for the Front wanted a fundamentalist state. And that in turn produced this tragedy, this second Algerian war."
The editor picked up a copy of another paper, Le Matin, whose front page marked the anniversary of the death of one of Algeria's best-loved columnists, Said Mekbel, shot on Dec. 3, 1994, in a cafe opposite the press building. Mr. Bellouchet shook his head.
"Only democracy can save this country," he said. "That is why I publish. So that we can have a real debate. Of course, the Government tries to shut us down every time we publish something they don't like, but without a debate there is only the darkness."
For a time in 1994 after he was appointed by a military-dominated committee, and in 1995, when he won a presidential election, Mr. Zeroual seemed open to such a debate. He was widely seen as a conciliator rather than an "eradicator" -- the term used for those within the amorphous body known simply as Le Pouvoir, or The Power, who favor all-out war on the Islamic Salvation Front.
Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, the imprisoned leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front, were taken out of prison and placed under house arrest in September 1994. There were talks. Mr. Zeroual seemed receptive to the American conviction that an end to the war could be found only by casting the net wide.
 
The Society
Increasing Fatigue With Endless War
But Algeria has never been an open society. Its aging rulers, who emerged from a war against France in which the secrecy of the insurrection's operations was paramount, prefer to rule from the shadows. The revolutionary cell of an anti-colonial war has lived on as the secretive Pouvoir.
Mr. Zeroual retreated. Mr. Madaani and Mr. Belhadj returned to prison. The President took to speaking more and more about heeding "the voice of the people" even as the vehicles for that voice to be heard were eliminated.
Mustafa Bouchachi, Mr. Belhadj's lawyer, said it was now more than two years since he had seen his client. "The rule of law no longer exists in this country," Mr. Bouchachi said. "There are thousands of people being held in prison without trial. They are charged with helping armed groups. Which armed groups? Where? How? Nothing is specified."
On July 28 of this year, Rachid Masli, another lawyer who has clients in the Islamic Salvation Front, went for a trip outside Algiers. He was stopped by four men in an unmarked car who dragged him away. For a week he disappeared.
Then, his eyes puffy and blue, Mr. Masli abruptly emerged in police custody to be formally charged with "helping armed groups." He had been held blindfolded and subjected to a mock execution. Now he languishes in prison, with no date set for his trial.
Mr. Bouchachi said: "The West is against the terrorists but silent on the regime. But everyone should know that when the state acts as the criminals act, the heart of the nation is polluted."
The lawyer is afraid that Mr. Masli's fate, or something worse, may also prove to be his own. Between his fear of state security forces and Mr. Bellouchet's fears that guerrillas will get him in the end, does any middle ground still exist in Algeria?
It is certain that the violence has alienated many people who voted for the Islamic Salvation Front. The vast majority of Algerians seem tired of war and yearn for peace.
But with unemployment at 25 percent, the Islamic Front retains some of its appeal. The complete "eradication" of those in it, or close to it, who are ready to use violence seems impossible.
Without negotiation, it is hard to imagine an end to Algeria's violence or to the continued threat that Algerian terrorism will spill over into France and perhaps elsewhere in the Mediterranean. In what now appears to the best possible outcome for Western governments, the military will continue to inflict heavy losses on the guerrillas, parliamentary elections will be held next year, International Monetary Fund programs will be honored and Algeria will settle down to the facade of a democracy with peripheral violence.
"We're increasing our investments and we're committed for the long term," said Paul Taylor, a spokesman for Anadarko in Houston. "We think Algeria makes sense for us."
The Algerian Government aims to make sure things stay that way. The oil-production zone in the Sahara, the source of $12 billion in annual export earnings, has been cordoned off by the army. Algerians need special passes to enter the area.
In Hassi Messaoud, an unreal atmosphere prevails as Malaysian and Turkish delegations are greeted at garden parties beneath palm trees where kebabs sizzle and drinks flow. "This is paradise, isn't it?" said a dutiful guide for Sonatrach, the national oil company.
But a few weeks ago, on a road in the desert between Ghardaia and Laghouat, guerrillas stopped a bus full of Sonatrach oil workers, dragged out 36 of them and slit their throats. Two other ambushes in the desert followed in which 26 people were killed.
Western officials said some Americans were within 15 miles of one of these ambushes. Up to now Americans, unlike countless other foreigners, have been spared.
Some angry Algerian officials attribute that to the dialogue intermittently maintained in Washington with members of the Islamic Salvation Front and to the fact that many leaders of the Armed Islamic Group were trained in Afghanistan at bases where the C.I.A. once backed Islamic guerrillas fighting Soviet troops.
Whether it is luck, Draconian security or diplomacy that has saved Americans, it seems clear from the attacks in the oil-rich desert that the potential still exists in Algeria for things to get worse.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods In Unexpected Drop of 1.6%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Orders for big-ticket factory products declined unexpectedly in November, providing more evidence, analysts said, that economic growth is likely to remain subdued in early 1997.
The report from the Commerce Department contributed to a modest rally in the bond market as interest rates on 30-year Government bonds fell to 6.53 percent, from 6.58 percent. On Wall Street, blue chip stocks, encouraged by the lower rates, rose in the quietest trading day of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record 6,560.91, up 14.23 points for the day. The report showed that orders for durable goods slumped 1.6 percent last month after increases in September and October. While experts had expected a modest advance, they noted that the numbers tended to be erratic from one period to the next and that the latest decline was concentrated in just one category, electrical equipment. 
 "It's a little weaker than October, but still pretty strong," said Russell W. Sheldon, senior economist with Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. He noted that a 16.9 percent increase in orders for electronics equipment in October preceded November's 9.3 percent decline.
Another report, from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, also suggested that the economy was in no danger of generating enough inflation to cause the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. The association disclosed a sharp decline last week in applications for mortgages to buy or refinance homes.
The markets seemed to shrug off a third indicator, one suggesting that the labor market remained tight. This was the Labor Department's report that first-time claims for unemployment benefits declined 15,000 last week, to 335,000, after a 20,000 increase in early December that was sustained the following week.
The 1.6 percent decline in orders for durable goods -- items intended to last at least three years -- pushed the November total down to $171.8 billion, or $2.9 billion less than in October.
At the same time, factories increased shipments of durable goods by eight-tenths of 1 percent last month while their backlogs of unfilled orders rose three-tenths of 1 percent, according to the Commerce Department's report.
By coincidence, the $2.9 billion overall decline in orders was exactly the same dollar amount as that for electronic and other electrical equipment, meaning that the other categories averaged no change.
"The economy's kind of on an even keel," said James W. Coons, chief economist at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. "We're about as close to equilibrium as we ever get." For the first 11 months of the year, orders were 6 percent ahead of the comparable period in 1995.
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment rose three-tenths of 1 percent while orders for primary metals rose two-tenths of 1 percent, the report showed. Orders for transportation equipment remained at the October level.
Excluding transportation equipment, orders fell 2.2 percent, which was also the first decline in that category since August.
New orders for military goods, a relatively small category that gyrates wildly, soared 55.2 percent last month but was not enough to keep capital goods from an overall 1.4 percent decline.
A widely watched gauge of plans by business to modernize and expand -- orders for capital goods other than aircraft and military items -- eased the same 1.6 percent as orders for durable goods as a whole.
The mortgage figures showed a 24 percent decline in applications for refinancing and a 12 percent decline for purchases in the week ended last Friday, a retreat from a pre-Thanksgiving surge.
The Labor Department's report on initial jobless claims showed that the four-week moving average edged down by 1,000, to 341,250. The latest week's result "challenges the perception of a moderating labor market," economists with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities said.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 14.23, to Record, But Trading Volume Is Low

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks extended their year-end advance yesterday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average to a record.
The Dow added 14.23 points, to close at 6,560.91, topping its previous high of 6,547.79 on Nov. 25. The Dow gained 76.51 for the week. 
 It opened higher as bond prices rallied after a report showed an unexpected drop in orders for durable goods, but the Dow gave back half of its 22-point gain in late-morning profit taking before recovering in the afternoon.
Yesterday was the 44th time that the blue-chip index set a record this year.
Several broader indexes were also higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.97, to 756.79, just below its Nov. 25 peak of 757.03. The advance would have been greater had it not been for losses in computer shares as Computer Associates International slid 27 percent.
Trading volume yesterday was light, at 253.8 million shares, below even Thursday's volume of 254.63 million shares.
Since so many investors were absent, yesterday's rise may have less conviction than market bulls would wish. "It's just hard to draw any conclusions from this session," said Jim Weiss, an investment officer at State Street Research and Management Company in Boston.
Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee, was more optimistic, noting the gains in the bond market, where prices on 30-year Treasuries rose more than $5 for each $1,000 invested and yields fell to 6.53 percent, from 6.58 percent, on Thursday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.
"Right now, the path of least resistance is higher, and that trend should hold through next week," Mr. Berman said.
The tone of the market was also helped by a report that investors added a net $2.5 billion to stock mutual funds in the week preceding Christmas, following a net outflow of $3.92 billion in the previous week.
But the Nasdaq composite fell 3.19 points, to 1,291.38, hurt by weakness in computer, semiconductor and software stocks.
Those stocks were dragged down by a plunge in shares of Computer Associates. The company said third-quarter revenues would probably be $1 billion to $1.1 billion; analysts had estimated $1.2 billion. Computer Associates shares fell 13, or 21 percent, to 48 3/4, and was the most actively traded stock yesterday.
Among other computer stocks, I.B.M. fell 5/8, to 155 1/8; Intel was off 1 1/4, to 135 3/8; Microsoft dropped 1 1/4, to 84 1/4, and Micron Electronics fell 1 1/8, to 19 3/8.
Telecommunications shares were broadly higher on strong volume, with BellSouth shares up 3 1/8, at 44, and Bell Atlantic up 2 7/8, at 67 7/8. Traders were hard pressed to say why telecommunications issues were higher.
Mr. Weiss of State Street speculated that they might be driven higher by investors who want to take profits in computer shares but want to keep their money in the technology sector.
AT&T shares were second in volume, rising 1, to 43 5/8, with 4.3 million shares changing hands.
Westinghouse shares were third in volume and were up 7/8 at 19 3/8. The Federal Communications Commission approved its proposed $3.7 billion acquisition of Infinity Broadcasting, a transaction that will create the nation's largest radio group.
Among other issues, shares of Invision Technologies surged 6, to 31 1/2. Invision was awarded a $52.2 million contract with the Federal Aviation Administration to build and install X-ray machines to detect explosives in airport baggage.

HEADLINE: Farewell to Hong Kong's Freedom

 BODY:
Every step toward the transfer of Hong Kong back to China is a somber reminder that after the recent liberation of so many countries from Communism, a vibrant and relatively free society is soon to be swallowed up by a Communist dictatorship. The rigged selection this month by China of the future chief executive and legislature of Hong Kong make clear that political freedoms will be severely curtailed if not entirely eliminated once China assumes control on July 1, 1997. The remaining question is whether China will also crush Hong Kong's bustling economy and independent judiciary.
The dismantlement of Hong Kong would not just be a tragedy for Hong Kong and China, which can prosper together if Hong Kong's freedoms are preserved, but would also represent a serious setback to China's emergence as a world power. By imposing its political and economic system on Hong Kong, China would break the international agreement it reached with Britain 12 years ago that committed Beijing to the preservation of Hong Kong's freedoms for 50 years after the transfer. 
 The agreement, known as the Joint Declaration, and an accompanying constitution for Hong Kong called the Basic Law made clear that for the next half-century China would grant Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy in all matters except defense and foreign affairs. Hong Kong's capitalist economy, its legal system and other liberties would remain intact. The breach of these treaty obligations would undermine China's claim that it has become a dependable, law-abiding member of the world community.
China's disdain for the agreement with Britain was demonstrated by the manner in which Hong Kong's future political leader and legislature were chosen. A committee of 400 Hong Kong citizens carefully picked by China made the decisions without the slightest accommodation to democracy.
The chosen chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, is a shipping tycoon whose family business was rescued from imminent insolvency in the 1980's by a secret $120 million investment by the Chinese Government. Though university-educated in Britain and employed for 10 years in the United States, Mr. Tung has offered a tepid defense of Hong Kong's political freedoms since his appointment. His references to the importance of "Chinese values" suggest he will have little interest in defending Hong Kong's press freedoms and its more recently established democratic political institutions when he takes office next summer.
Mr. Tung's enthusiasm for Hong Kong's entrepreneurial spirit looks stronger, but it is unclear whether he or his Chinese patrons appreciate the importance of maintaining the rule of law and open access to information that are the foundation of Kong Kong's economic vitality.
There was even less reason to cheer the appointment of the new provisional legislature. Though Britain only belatedly permitted its colony a freely elected legislature, Hong Kong residents embraced the idea and a varied field of candidates contested elections in 1995 for the Legislative Council. It will be eliminated come July 1, and the 60-member body appointed by China will take its place and serve for at least a year before some other group is picked.
Any pretense of democracy was abandoned when China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, presided over the appointment of legislators at a meeting in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, safely removed from Hong Kong where the proceedings would have been challenged in an independent court system. Ten of the members selected had been rejected by Hong Kong voters in 1995 when seeking election to the Legislative Council. They subsequently tilted toward China in their views.
President Clinton and his new national security team ought to give some thought to the fate of Hong Kong before they roar down the road to improved relations with China and two planned summit meetings with China's President, Jiang Zemin. The sight of Mr. Clinton welcoming Mr. Jiang to the White House as China strips Hong Kong of its freedoms is not something Americans are likely to applaud.

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Casting a Shadow Over New York's New Year

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
Dropping a ball is all very well, of course. Quaint, really.
But when New Year's Eve rolls around in Las Vegas this year, the revelers on the Strip will be watching giant fireballs burst before their eyes, dancing to live bands and, on the stroke of midnight East Coast time, witnessing the implosion of a 12-story, 900-room hotel that will send the year out with a kaboom. 
 "It's gotten to be one of the biggest parties in the country," said Rob Powers, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors' Authority, who predicted that the Strip crowd might surpass the multitudes in Times Square this year.
Even if it does not, the question -- one that may ruffle many a New Yorker's civic pride -- is whether the year-end party in the desert capital of glitz is supplanting Times Square's festivities as the nation's signature New Year's Eve spectacle.
New Year's Eve celebrations in Las Vegas, which bring in tens of millions of dollars in business, have grown steadily over the last several years, as the city has found new ways to send entertainment over the top, out-doing the other gambling spots sprouting around the country through sheer scale and ingenuity. The city's boom -- the Las Vegas metropolitan area is now the fastest growing in the nation -- has added thousands of locals to the celebrating masses, and its reconstituted image as more of an adult Disneyland has helped bring in more visitors.
Last year, 186,000 visitors spent New Year's weekend there, and this year's estimates top 200,000, filling hotels almost to capacity despite the 8,000 new rooms available. The police and Las Vegas officials say they expect 200,000 to 400,000 revelers on the Strip on New Year's Eve, and an additional 20,000 or so at a tickets-only gala in the downtown Fremont Street section.
"We're trying to rival New York," said Kara Kelley of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce. "It's becoming something people put on their calendars to do. It's now, 'Where do we want to spend New Year's Eve?' 'Oh, let's go to Las Vegas.' "
But New York is running hard to stay ahead. The Times Square Business Improvement District took over the management of New Year's Eve celebrations four years ago and has done everything from refurbishing the ball that drops at 1 Times Square to starting a confetti drop, giving away pompons and, this year, even planning to provide 3,000 "confetti bags" so people can gather up souvenirs to take home.
With the publicity generated by the new six-foot, light-covered ball, officials from the Times Square improvement district estimate that nearly a half million people attended the festivities last year, though a more usual attendance is about 300,000. And they bridle at the suggestion that the upstart Las Vegas could ever rival Times Square as a midnight venue.
"I don't think there's any way to compete with a 92-year-old tradition," said Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square group. "There's something quite magical and magnetic about a tradition that has lasted so long in a pure form."
Ms. Dykstra added that the group had also made New Year's Eve more telegenic and would this year be providing a free live video feed to stations around the world. "Las Vegas is going to have a lot of catching up to do when last year we estimated that 300 million people saw the event worldwide," she said.
Gathering New Year's crowds is far more than a matter of prestige; it means tens of millions of dollars in business.
The Times Square group estimates that last year's revelers spent a total of $24.5 million on things like hotel rooms and food, an average of $53 a person, and had an overall economic impact on the city of $49 million. The event, in contrast, cost only $400,000 to stage, Ms. Dykstra said.
In Las Vegas, the Convention and Visitors' Authority estimated the economic impact of last year's New Year's visitors at $82.8 million, excluding gambling, over the three-day weekend. They expect this year's awkwardly mid-week celebrations to bring in $55.9 million over two days.
By and large, the two cities do not appear to compete directly for the same visitors. Las Vegas draws most of its guests from California and other Western states, and Las Vegas officials said it might be best to see the Strip simply as the Times Square of the West for New Year's partygoers.
But though they tried to stay diplomatically uncompetitive, some of the people staging this year's celebration in Las Vegas could not resist a dig at the stodgy traditionalism of New York's show compared with the brash flashiness of blowing up a building to mark the new year.
And seemed no coincidence that the implosion was to come at midnight Eastern time, though Las Vegas police said that was done partly to keep the crowd at midnight Las Vegas time from getting totally out of control.
The Fox network, which is planning to carry much of the revelry live, is also hoping that the explosion, as the centerpiece of its New Year's Eve coverage, will draw viewers away from the ball in New York and the other networks.
Mark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition Inc., the Maryland company that will blow up the 10-year-old, 900-room Hacienda hotel to make room for a new 4,000-room mega-resort owned by Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., said the night on the Strip would be wild, wild, wild.
His 26-year-old daughter, Stacey, will run the pyrotechnical display before and after the Hacienda is blown up, Mr. Loizeaux said, after an initial fireworks show by the Grucci firm of Long Island. She will run a waterfall along the entire 600-foot length of the building, he said, and send out waves of flashes of bright lights, loud reports and balls of fire.
At exactly midnight East Coast time, he said, a huge fireball will erupt from the Hacienda's roof "and kaboom! A few wings and the center will just collapse, and as the dust goes up into the air, your eyes will follow the dust and you'll see another aerial pyrotechnical display."
How exactly it all works will depend on factors like the wind, he said, but "no matter what, it's got to be better than Times Square."
Times Square officials pointed out that the New York celebration would also have a light and laser show as well as fireworks visible over Central Park, but they said there would be nothing like the live performances that will fill the Strip in Vegas.
The Strip, which will be closed to traffic from 6 P.M. until 2 A.M. on New Year's Eve, will feature Hootie and the Blowfish, Salt and Peppa, Sinbad and the Doobie Brothers.
"Times Square will always be Times Square," said Ms. Kelley of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce. "But I think Las Vegas is becoming a viable alternative."

HEADLINE: Who Is 'Buddhist Temple'? Campaign Donor, Democratic Files Say

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Just as the 1992 Clinton victory produced its definitive shorthand marching order -- "It's the economy, stupid!" -- so has the 1996 Clinton victory now produced an explanation in the same ringing meter for its forced retreat from some questionable political fund raising:
"It was a temple, you idiot!" screams the fine print on page 637 of the Democratic National Committee's newly released documents explaining some of the hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations that had to be returned as suspicions of abuse surfaced. 
 Anonymous himself could not have penned the pain and chagrin any better under the box listing "reason" for giving back $5,000 10 days after the election to a donor whose name was offered simply as "Buddhist Temple" in the box where a person or corporate donor is supposed to be listed.
"It was a temple, you idiot!" is listed near the bottom of a page that otherwise tends to list such unsensationally gray reasons as "determined to be inappropriate" for rebuffing various generous supporters who, in retrospect, turned out to be noncitizens or, in two cases, a suspected drug trafficker ($20,000) and someone accused of being an income-tax deadbeat ($450,000).
That odd burst of candor, in the face of all the reasonable sounding explanations, stands out in the raft of paperwork released by the Democratic committee this week in an effort to reassure the public that nothing was amiss in its financial operations after what turned out to be the costliest campaign in the history of American democracy.
Republicans, who outraised and outspent the Democrats, are asserting that access to President Clinton and the inner sanctums of the White House was virtually for sale at set campaign rates. The President and the Democratic Party deny this.
The pages in the campaign paper trail released thus far give details on what the Democrats' new category of $250,000 super-donors were promised for their largess, right down to the "exclusive lapel pin" -- a gimcrack Croix de Guerre from the Democratic National Committee. Similarly meager spoils are on the official list of benefits to these donors. Not a wink of sleep is promised in the Lincoln Bedroom, only commemorative podium photos, "V.I.P. exclusive skybox" privileges and special concierge services at the Democratic Convention.
Of all the glints of revelation emerging in the party documents made public, none might have proved more useful and prophetic, perhaps, than a "Crisis Management" series of instructions for political press secretaries bedeviled by scandal charges.
"In a legitimate press crisis, whether it's money and politics or a personal issue (sex, drugs and alcohol are the big three), there are some basic rules to remember," press secretaries are told by one of the Democratic Party's major sources, Emily's List.
The points of advice begin plainly enough -- "Don't lie." -- and move on to this: "Announce an internal investigation, independent investigation or 'white paper' to examine the matter. This buys you time, but it's risky."
Further advice moves from how to "impugn the source" of a hurtful story to the possibility of undermining a scoop-laden reporter with a "pre-emptive strike" by quickly releasing the campaign's more favorable version of the story, "denying the initial reporter the exclusive and insuring the story will be written by many reporters who don't have the same access to information as the initial reporter did."
If the problem is bad enough, it is conceded, a "let it all hang out" press conference may be necessary, but press secretaries are cautioned to keep it late in the day to force reporters to hurry to meet deadlines. (Originally, a single set of the Democratic documents were opened to all reporters' scrutiny in the traditional deadest moment of the news week, last Friday evening, but then copies were made available in the face of complaints.) When all else fails, the final instruction is to "apologize and move on," but with a caveat: "This works well for small problems but not for large ones."
The Clinton-Gore team's confidential advisory on "designing your message" proceeds through a list of what aficionados recognize as the campaign's ultimate spin: the painstaking, now familiar winning prescriptions and linguistic nostrums of Dick Morris, Mr. Clinton's masterful, though now dismissed, campaign strategist (spin doctor).
The word "values" is invoked as a mantra in this passage, just as Mr. Morris so firmly advised. "Use values-based language," the campaign workers were instructed, and lay off talking about detailed programs and policies. "Leaders are chosen on the basis of values, not programs or legislation," the winning team contended.

Dow Sets 44th Record, But Nasdaq Index Eases
Stocks extended their year-end advance, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average to a new record -- its 44th of the year. The Dow added 14.23 points, to close at 6,560.91, topping its previous high of 6,547.79 on Nov. 25. The average gained 76.51 for the week. Trading volume, however, was light.
Several broader indexes were also higher, but the Nasdaq composite fell 3.19 points, to 1,291.38, hurt by weakness in computer, semiconductor and software stocks. [Page 40.]
 
Talks on New York Utility Merger
The Brooklyn Union Gas Company and the Long Island Lighting Company are scheduled to meet tomorrow in hopes of reaching an agreement calling for the Brooklyn utility take over Lilco's operations, sources close to the talks say. [29.]
 
Prices of Treasuries Rise
Treasury prices gained in light trading, as traders took an unexpected 1.6 percent drop in orders for durable goods in November as evidence that moderate economic growth was continuing and that the Federal Reserve would not need to raise short-term interest rates. The price of the 30-year bond rose 19/32 , to 9918/32 , sending its yield down to 6.53 percent. [49.]
 
Markets' Drop Worries Japanese
With Japanese stock and currency markets on the skids, officials are voicing concern. Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka promised to monitor the markets closely. But he denied that their slide resulted from a large increase in the nationwide sales tax that was included in the Government's budget this week. [40.]
 
Dollar Reaches a 45-Month High
The dollar briefly surged past 116 yen to another 45-month high, before settling at 115.50 yen, up from 114.66 yen late on Thursday. It also rose slightly against German mark, settling at 1.5558 marks. The British pound, however, rose to its highest level against the dollar in more than four years, $1.6929 from $1.6731 on Thursday. [42.]
 
Computer Associates Off 21%
Shares of Computer Associates International plunged 21 percent, after the company stunned Wall Street by announcing late Thursday that it would have weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue because of sales difficulties in Europe. The Long Island-based software company, the nation's second largest after Microsoft, said that its revenue for the quarter ending next week would be flat at about $1 billion, well below analysts' estimates of $1.2 billion. The shares closed at $48.75 a share, down $13. [41.]
 
Nordstrom Issues Earnings Warning
Nordstrom Inc., the department store chain, said after the market's close that its quarterly earnings would be below Wall Street analysts' expectations because of slow sales. Nordstrom is the first large company to report that its holiday sales were below last year's. [40.]
 
Las Vegas Seeks New Year's Money
Las Vegas, Nev., is vying to surpass New York as home of the country's biggest New Year's spectacle, seeing tens of millions of dollars in business. But New York is fighting to stay on top. Last year's revelers spent a total of $24.5 million on things like hotel rooms and food, and had an overall economic impact on the city of $49 million. [1.]
 
Searching for Oil Despite War
Deep in Algeria, a country racked by civil war, dozens of Americans are ensconced behind high walls topped with barbed wire, living in anonymous camps. Companies like Arco and Anadarko Petroleum are pouring billions of dollars into developing oil and gas. "If the Government can stay stable enough for us to get our money out, there is a lot of profit to be made," one oilman said. [1.]

HEADLINE: The Law of Supply on Demand;
New Technology Helps Keep Inventories Just Lean Enough

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: YORK, Pa.

 BODY:
Just inside a receiving dock at a Bon-Ton Stores distribution center here, a clerk wields a radio-frequency device to scan the bar codes of roughly 10 percent of a shipment of kitchen gadgets. Then, instead of stacking the boxes in the warehouse, workers move them by conveyor to another truck for delivery to one of the company's 68 stores.
"Until this year, we did this all this with pencil and paper," said a proud Michael L. Gleim, vice chairman of the regional department store chain. "We used to open all that merchandise, count it, check it, mark it with tags and repack it" -- and then store it. 
 With startling suddenness, this modest-size retailer has eliminated all those steps for nearly half the goods it buys, and it expects to get the figure up to 60 percent in 1997. Better yet, the same sophisticated electronics that eliminates much of Bon-Ton's processing and warehousing costs also track consumer buying patterns, preventing overshipments and reducing losses from post-Christmas markdowns.
And what is good for Bon-Ton Stores Inc. -- a low-profile chain with stores mostly in Pennsylvania and upstate New York -- is good for the American economy, too. Economists say that the spread of sophisticated inventory-management techniques pioneered at Detroit's auto makers, perfected at retail giants like Wal-Mart and now being adopted by smaller businesses like Bon-Ton helps the economy run more efficiently and quite possibly lessens the sting of business downturns.
Economists typically cite three causes of business downturns -- credit tightening by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation, a disruption of oil supplies or some other such external shock, and inventory swings created when overly exuberant businesses are forced to cut back sharply to bring supply into line with demand.
But if goods flow more smoothly along the supply chain, inventories are less likely to build to unwanted levels, Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, explained, putting business in a better position to avoid the kinds of surprises that add to recessionary pressure. While overinvestment is still an inherent characteristic of capitalism, these improvements already appear to be helping to smooth out some of the ups and downs of the business cycle.
"This is definitely reducing the impact of the inventory cycle," said Richard M. Cyert, professor of economics and management at Carnegie-Mellon University's graduate school of industrial administration. In the future, he added, "fluctuations will be much lower than historically."
Nobody expects undesirably large swings in inventory to disappear entirely, of course, especially when it comes to fashion, where customers are notoriously fickle, and imports, where lead times are considerably longer. Even with all its new efficiencies, Bon-Ton, for example, has allowed its inventories to grow to keep up with the stocks and selection of its competitors, Mr. Gleim said.
And nobody expects retailers to let down their competitive guard to expose details of their distribution system for all to see. Typically, manufacturers are told how their own products are selling in stores but are not permitted to find out how their rival suppliers are doing.
Still, there are sound reasons to expect further improvements. For all the progress of recent years, the process has much further to go, according to Colleen Crum of the Oliver Wight Companies, a consultant. Ultimately, she predicts, there will evolve competing alliances of retailers, distributors and suppliers.
Already, the United States has reduced inventory dead weight by an estimated 9 percent, or $82 billion a year, from the levels of the 1980's, according to Everett M. Ehrlich, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs.
Yet many stores, Mr. Ehrlich said, are "only now beginning to get it" in terms of efficient management of goods. The retail sector, he added, is "right on the threshold of the dream manufacturers have been living" for the last decade.
Indeed, with the Kroger Company and other grocery chains in the vanguard, retailers have begun making strides, tying checkout scanners and related computers to refined software systems that in many cases transmit sales data and even orders to suppliers who can then arrange their own production more efficiently.
Michael J. Saylor, founder and chief executive of Micro Strategy Inc. of Vienna, Va., a maker of software that helps companies "mine" their data bases for better decisions about logistics and promotion, recalled what used to happen at Du Pont, where he began his career.
"The order rate would just double overnight, and we'd feel like the end of a whip that got cracked," he said. "So what you want is for the person at the back end of the supply chain to have as much information as the person at the beginning."
Increasingly, a tradition of reticence about sharing proprietary information is giving way to teamwork as retailers and their suppliers recognize the benefits to all parties. "The cooperative attitude is one of the really striking things about all of this," Professor Cyert said.
For Bon-Ton, the adoption of electronic data interchange -- harnessing computers for everything from keeping track of whether the Elmira store has enough snow shovels for a wintry weekend to informing the maker of Hanes hosiery that it is time to ship a truckload of pantyhose -- may well be crucial to weathering hard times.
The company, which has 1,300 suppliers, needs every competitive edge these days after a restructuring in 1995, attributed mainly to overly rapid expansion, caused its first money-losing year since the Depression.
Mr. Gleim acknowledges that not so long ago much of the talk about cooperative effort with suppliers was simply hot air. "The negotiating side was so intense," he said, "you didn't think it was a partnership."
But it is now clear to all parties, he added, that "we can wring some duplicate costs out of the system" with the benefits shared by all parties, including the consumer.
Much of the motivation behind the efficiency drive rests on the fact that business can no longer simply raise prices to improve profitability. "You can't make it on the price side because consumers won't pay it," observed Terence J. McEvoy, a retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, the brokerage house, who follows Bon-Ton. "So you've got to get it on the cost side."
Robert A. Novack, associate professor of business logistics at the Smeal College of Business at Pennsylvania State University, said, "There have been some instances in which inventories have been reduced up to 50 percent," liberating millions of dollars for more productive uses.
One of the most advanced practitioners is the Dayton Hudson Corporation's huge, highly successful Target chain, which recently began to invade the Northeast.
With 730 stores carrying an average of 50,000 items each, Target's Minneapolis headquarters needs to make billions of decisions a year to keep shelves full enough to appear presentable while also avoiding costly overstocks.
"We couldn't do it without technology," said Richard N. Maguire, the chain's senior vice president for merchandise planning. Each Saturday night, Target's computerized system forecasts how much of every item in every store will be needed and then on Sunday automatically generates orders for these products to the chain's suppliers. Several of the suppliers will get an order on Monday, ship goods on Tuesday and have them in Target stores by the end of the week.
From an average of 27 days in the late 1980's, Target has slashed its supplier-to-store period to 12 days now and plans to cut it in half again in the next five years.
"That reduction in lead time means less inventory in the stores and reduces markdowns, so it enables us to have the most competitive prices," Mr. Maguire said. And, he said, merchants who had been "a little hesitant" to sign up for such swift response now embrace it, even "coming to us with ways" to move still faster. Primarily because of the improved efficiencies in the supply chain, Target stores now hold 10 percent less inventory than they did just a year ago, he said.
"These computer systems," said the Mr. Ehrlich of the Commerce Department, who previously worked for the Unisys Corporation, "kind of erase the boundaries between companies and their suppliers."
Target is at the forefront of the movement. While Bon-Ton's next step is to start handling suppliers' bills by computer -- electronic invoicing in industry parlance -- Target already does this for more than half its transactions. It also electronically tracks shipments all the way from manufacturer to freight company to distribution center to store. The next frontier is on-line product development and integration of financial and purchasing systems.
"What I want," Richard J. Sherman, director of supply-chain management at Numetrix Ltd. in Toronto, which provides supply-chain software, "is to have product that seldom pauses versus product that seldom moves."

For the first time since the Depression, Bon-Ton Stores, a Pennsylvania retailer, lost money in 1995. One way it hopes to return to profitability is by better controlling inventories, using technology pioneered by larger companies. At its distribution center in York, Pa., above, Joyce Colyer uses a radio frequency scanner to log merchandise arriving from manufacturers. In a nearby store, Laura Boyer, a sales associate, uses another scanner to record a sale. Graph shows Bon-Ton Stores net income, 1990-96. (Source: Company reports)

HEADLINE: Who's in Charge of NATO?

BYLINE: By Walter Russell Mead; Walter Russell Mead is the President's Fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School for Social Research in New York.

 BODY:

The Dawn of Peace in Europe
By Michael Mandelbaum.
207 pp. New York:
The 20th Century Fund Press. $19.95.
Michael Mandelbaum has written a brilliant book that combines the most lucid exposition yet of the post-cold-war order in Europe with a devastating critique of the Clinton Administration's foreign policy. "The Dawn of Peace in Europe" is all the more devastating because its tone is so cool. Mr. Mandelbaum, a professor at the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and the director of the Project on East-West Relations of the Council on Foreign Relations, has no obvious axes to grind, and he speaks more in sorrow than in anger. Nevertheless, this slim volume deftly exposes the evasions, muddles, self-deception and bad faith that to an alarming degree currently shape American policy in Europe. 
 At the center of this book stands NATO, formed, in the words of its first Secretary General, Lord Ismay, "to keep the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans down." After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO looks increasingly like a solution in search of a problem.
Since Russian forces have been unable to subdue even the tiny, ill-equipped Chechen rebels, there seems little prospect of a Russian blitzkrieg across the North German Plain. And with no obvious threat to Western Europe, NATO bureaucrats and security intellectuals worry that the alliance might gradually wither. To keep it relevant, they have come up with two possible reforms. One would be its transformation into a force capable of acting in concert for "out of area" missions. The sole aim of the old NATO was to defend the territorial integrity of its 16 members; an "out of area" NATO would act as a global gendarme wherever, in the views of its members, international security faced a serious threat.
The other proposal to keep NATO relevant would involve retaining its identity as a defensive alliance but expanding its membership east. Initially, membership would be offered to Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Later, NATO would extend still farther east -- though not, it is currently assumed, to the newly independent states that have emerged from the carcass of the Soviet Union.
Transforming NATO into an "out of area" alliance, Mr. Mandelbaum argues, is desirable but not feasible. Expanding NATO eastward, he contends, is feasible but not desirable.
NATO cannot function effectively "out of area," Mr. Mandelbaum says, for the same reason that other international alliances have proved of limited use in the past. Just as the Holy Alliance, the League of Nations and the United Nations were largely paralyzed by differences of opinion among their members, so NATO's ability to act on a global scale will be constrained by inevitable internal disagreements about policies and priorities.
Look at Bosnia, Mr. Mandelbaum says, a crisis that borders NATO and affects it profoundly, but one in which NATO has yet to develop a true consensus. The Dayton accords, trumpeted as a triumph of policy coordination, actually paper over what are still deep differences among the NATO powers. There are two separate and incompatible elements of the Dayton accords, Mr. Mandelbaum insists: a provision for the partition of Bosnia along the current cease-fire lines, and a plan to revive a Bosnian state, with provisions for the return of refugees to their original homes. These contradictions reflect the still unresolved disagreement between the Europeans, who have long sought a partition of Bosnia as the best way to stop the fighting, and the Americans, who insist that ethnic cleansing is unacceptable and should not be rewarded.
The resulting muddle has led NATO troops into what looks more and more like an open-ended commitment in Bosnia, a policy that fails to provide the basis for a political solution to the crisis. This is not a good omen for other "out of area" NATO activities. Since future crises are unlikely to affect European interests as closely as the Bosnian war, allied cooperation will be even harder to arrange.
Most of Mr. Mandelbaum's fire is reserved for the proposal to expand NATO eastward. This, he charges, will make Europe less secure. He is almost certainly right.
Mr. Mandelbaum does not oppose NATO expansion because he trusts Moscow. Our inability to predict Russia's future course, or to be confident that future Russian governments will honor their international commitments and observe international law, is a fact of life we must deal with. But, Mr. Mandelbaum argues, expanding NATO eastward will cause a nationalist backlash in Russia, reducing the chances that it will follow a course of peaceful integration with the West.
Worse, expanding NATO to include Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia will leave the countries that really have something to fear from Russia unprotected. Putting up "No Trespassing" signs in nations like Poland and the Czech Republic implies that trespassing is permitted in Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic republics.
The danger in Europe, Mr. Mandelbaum explains, is not that Russia will attack Poland or the Czech Republic. That is far beyond Russia's military capacities today, and the world would have many years of warning before a Russian military revival posed a genuine threat to these nations. The real danger in Europe today is Russian pressure on Ukraine, still a weak state with a feeble economy and a sizable, restless Russian minority. Clinton Administration plans to expand NATO to the old Soviet frontier will make Russia more likely to attempt to assert control over Ukraine, yet without helping Ukraine to resist.
Last fall's American Presidential campaign was a depressing spectacle; with an eye toward East European ethnic voters, both candidates went into high-pander mode whenever NATO came up. One hopes that with the election behind it and with the financial constraints produced by the effort to balance the Federal budget, the Clinton Administration will take another look at its current commitment to NATO expansion. As Mr. Mandelbaum so cogently demonstrates, the European security system ain't broke, so there is no need to fix it.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN ARCHITECTURE;
Renewal in New York, Thinking Big Beyond

BYLINE: By NORA KERR

 BODY:
THE TOURIST TIDE NOW coursing through Times Square, America's newest theme park, is but one sign of a spirit of urban renewal and architectural possibility that animates even the traditionally difficult New York cityscape.
A 47-story office and retail tower, designed by Fox & Fowle, will become the new home of Conde Nast Publications, on Broadway between 42d and 43d Streets. The building is expected to anchor and extend the area without undermining its character as an entertainment strip. An earlier plan for four huge office towers straddling Times Square, designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, was abandoned by the end of the 80's in the wake of nearly universal scorn and a collapsing real estate market. 
 Farther north, at Columbus Circle -- another dramatic and contentious corner of Manhattan -- a similar sense of possibility is in the air. Earlier this year, city and state officials set new guidelines for development of the Coliseum site and expanded the area to include the Moorish-looking 10-story buildingat 2 Columbus Circle, by Edward Durell Stone.
By November, nine developers had submitted proposals for the spot, ranging from a high-tech amusement park and rooftop arena to an eight-store retail mall anchored by Sears. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's Midas touch-up of the formerly drab Gulf and Western office tower and the renovation of the southwest entrance to Central Park are adding luster to the area. Officials are culling finalists for the Coliseum project and expected to make a choice in the spring.
Nearby, on 57th Street, a slim 23-story tower went under construction only weeks after plans were completed, though in this case it was private, not public, money at stake. The building, the first American commission for the French architect Christian de Portzamparc, a Pritzker Prize winner, is being built for Louis Vuitton, the manufacturer of luxury leather goods. It will be sheathed in specially designed glass that turns from clear to opalescent white. At night, hidden neon tubes will wash the exterior in soft colors.
Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch architect who has made a specialty of thinking big, also won his first American commission this year. In March, a week after publication of his "S, M, L, XL," 1,344 pages of writings and designs organized by project size, MCA named him master planner for Universal City, the media giant's Los Angeles headquarters.
Another leading practitioner and theorist of architecture, Peter Eisenman, created a buzz with his design for the Aronoff Center for the Arts at the University of Cincinnati. Long before its official opening in October, the project had became a mecca for his peers. The center's main attraction was an unorthodox 800-foot underground concourse uniting three existing buildings devoted to art, architecture, planning and design. Many of them gathered for a two-day symposium that was taped and edited for public television's "Charlie Rose Show"
 In San Francisco, the new Main Public Library, by James Ingo Freed of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, drew praise for providing room for imagination within the deceptively classical walls of a temple of reason. Designed to fit into the Beaux-Arts context of its Civic Center neighbors, the building presents a modern interior: a cylindrical six-story atrium with a spiral skylight and a cantilevered, glass-enclosed space four stories above the floor.
In June, Franklin D. Israel, whose designs for private houses and film-industry offices represented the leading edge of California design, died in Los Angeles at the age of 50. In July, many of the leading lights of modern architecture gathered at the Seagram Building designed by Mies van der Rohe, in the Four Seasons restaurant designed by Philip Johnson, to celebrate Mr. Johnson's 90th birthday.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
In Last Decade, Innovation Is Buzzword

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY 

 BODY:
WHAT a difference a decade makes. When I began writing the Dining Out column in January 1987, tiramisu was the Island's cutting-edge dessert, portobello mushrooms and focaccia were virtually unknown and radicchio was just beginning to rear its little red head. At year's end, it is natural to look back and review the months gone by. At the end of 10 years, that reflection becomes a retrospective.
Then as now, Italian was Long Island's favorite cuisine. But there have been changes there as well. The late 1980's marked the arrival of the now ubiquitous, sleek pasta cafes with their designer pizzas, innovative pastas, spectacular salads, open kitchens, neon and unspoken price cap of $20 on entrees. Economical Italian family-style restaurants also proliferated. And all those lovely, trendy Tuscans that now dot the Hamptons were still to come. 
 Speaking of the Hamptons, its restaurants have undergone the most noticeable transformation of any on the Island. There were a handful of good restaurants there in 1987 but very few outstanding ones. Today, stylish dining places match the sophistication and reputation of the region. This year three restaurants received a rating of excellent. Two of them were in the Hamptons: Paolo's, a new Southampton spot starring the exciting food of Paolo Penati, and Mirko's, a charming country inn tucked away in Water Mill, which was always good and has got even better.
Another East End change is Montauk's recent splash into the culinary mainstream. This tip-of-the-Island community is no longer just the home of burgers, pancakes and seaside lobster rolls. The suave spots that have arrived in the last few years would be at home in East Hampton.
The years 1995 and 1996 have witnessed the return of the steakhouse. In addition to the debut of upscale entries like Wellington's in Centerport, Abbott's in Hauppauge, Ruth's Chris in Garden City, G. Roberts in Woodmere and the Stockyard in Westbury, these years have also seen the growth of the $10.95 24-ounce steak places like Major's in East Meadow and Woodbury and Chaps in Syosset as well as the arrival of inexpensive chains like Outback and Boulder Creek.
Ethnic groups, including Salvadoran, Colombian and Caribbean, have begun to make an impact. The established Portuguese restaurants of Mineola have been joined by Portuguese barbecues and rodizios. There has also been a mini-revival of French restaurants, especially bistros. Bistro Cassis in Glen Cove is the newest example.
Cajun restaurants have taken off. The Cajun epicenter is situated in southern Nassau at Bayou in North Bellmore, Bayou Uptown and Jackson Square in Rockville Centre, Big Daddy's in Massapequa and the Catfish Cafe in Merrick, but the mid-90's has seen the spread of Louisiana cooking to Suffolk at the Pepper'd Owl in Huntington, Paula Jean's in East Setauket and Cajun Joe's in Smithtown.
There were plenty of Chinese restaurants on the Island in 1987 just as there are today. In the late 80's, Homer Lee's empire numbered more than half a dozen outposts. Today none remain. The new 1990's Chinese spots usually have a menu with "healthy selections" and, more often than not, have borrowed from other Asians. They invariably include a sushi bar.
What trends fizzled? The much heralded arrival of Mediterranean cuisine (which brings together Spanish paellas, North African cous cous, Middle Eastern hummus and Italian pastas on one menu) never gained a toehold on the Island. Typical was Millie's in Great Neck, which opened My Mediterranean Cousin under its roof in 1994. It was short-lived.
Southwestern food has also had little impact here. From the Coyote Grill in Island Park to Santa Fe Junction in East Hampton, there are few stops in between.
Mexican restaurants have not exploded in Nassau-Suffolk as they have in the rest of the country, where they are often top dog. The Island has only a few upscale beachheads, like Tequila Sunrise in Roslyn Heights, the expected chains, some hybrid spots known mainly for their margaritas and Coronas, and a handful of storefronts like the Tortilla Grill in Huntington.
Restaurants at vineyards is yet another unfulfilled expectation. The North Fork's wine has come into its own in the last decade, but its restaurants have not. Vineyard dining is nonexistent, but brew pubs are booming. These casual places are popping up from one end of the Island to the other.
This period has also given rise to the super-star chef. A handful of range whizards on the Island have become legends. Starr Boggs at his namesake restaurant in Westhampton Beach, Guy Reuge at Mirabelle in St. James, Paolo Penati of Paolo's in Southampton, Michael Meehan at Tupelo Honey in Sea Cliff and Tom Schaudel at 107 Forest in Locust Valley and the Downtown Grill in Montauk are all as well or better known than their restaurants.
In addition to these high-visability chef-owners, there are the modern day Pied Pipers who gather plaudits and followers as they move from restaurant to restaurant. The late 1980's saw Ali Barker at the Polo Grill of the Garden City Hotel as he made his way from top spots in Manhattan to establishing his own restaurant in Cleveland. In 1990, Brendan Walsh, who had made a name for himself at Arizona 206 in the city, brought his spirited Southwestern food to the Coyote Grill in Island Park. Later, devotees also sampled his fare at the North Street Grill in Great Neck. The year 1992 was noteworthy for the arrival of Richard Allen from California to the Crescent in Bayville. His fans followed him when he later became chef at the Polo Grill. The latest California name to make the Long Island scene is William Valentine, who came from the Citrus restaurant to the Maidstone Arms in East Hampton in 1994.
The last 10 years are noteworthy, too, for the coming of age of American cuisine. Whether the restaurant be steakhouse, California clone, innovative fusion dynamo or a nostalgic spot like the Cooke's In in Huntington serving Southern fried chicken and sweet potatoes, the emphasis today is on fresh, local ingredients. Creative chefs and savvy restaurateurs see the evolution of a Long Island regional cuisine as the next wave.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Marvin M. Sirota;
Aiding Humanitarian Projects in Israel

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG 

 BODY:
MARVIN M. SIROTA, who has achieved success in the drug business, is a man on a mission. He is president of the Israel Histradrut Foundation in Manhattan, a nonprofit organization that finances health, education, social service and other humanitarian projects for Jews in Israel and North America. Since its inception, the foundation has raised more than $50 million for these causes.
Mr. Sirota is trying to educate Americans to l view Israel as a vibrant, economically viable country that needs "partners" to further its rapid development and preserve it as a haven for Jewish culture. 
 Mr. Sirota, 55, is a graduate of the School of Pharmacy of Long Island University. He is founder and president of Interactive Health Management, a Westbury-based company that creates medical "teams" to suit a new managed care environment through specific software and mail-order programs that link medical providers like doctors and pharmacists on the Internet.
Before that, he was president of Choice Drug Systems Inc., now Capstone Pharmacy Services, a publicly held drug distribution company. He has been a member of the Israel Histradrut Foundation board since 1990, and president and chairman since 1993. He is also a member of the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation. Recently Mr. Sirota was appointed to the board of directors of Long Island University.
Mr. Sirota and his wife , Barbara, are longtime residents of Great Neck. They have two daughters.
Q. How was the I.H.F. started?
A. It was started over 40 years ago by then-Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg and Dr. Saul Stein. The concept was to deal with the estates of American Jews as a means of supporting Israel. The charitable remainder trusts, which are so common today, they pioneered them 40 years ago. They had the idea to take the estates of American Jews and treat Israel like another child. So, if you didn't have the cash flow to support it, they came up with the idea of a bequest.
Today, planned giving is the rage. But these old-time Zionists were doing it 40 years ago, just accumulating estates, and they've built a lot of hospitals, nursing homes and orphanages based on that concept.
Q. What is the Mishan Fund?
A. It supports Israeli youth and senior citizens through more than a dozen residential and cultural facilities. The fund enables the elderly to live with dignity and an appropriate quality of life. It is also used to build orphanages for children. The Mishan children's villages offer a safe and secure home environment for children from dysfunctional or abusive families. That need grew tremendously with the influx of Russian immigrants, many of whom are orphans. Government and industry are pulling back their support of these services. The Histradrut in Israel is becoming more of a labor union. We're trying to pick up where they leave off.
Q. Tell us about the foundation's Amal Fund.
A. It supports science and technology education through the Amal School System, a network of almost 100 schools throughout Israel. These institutions provide academic, vocational and technological training to more than 50,000 students. They play a vital role in preparing young people for their military service and their entry into Israel's commerce and industry. With the Government now casting off much of the Amal, it must be supported by the Histradrut.
Israel is very high-tech, not unlike Japan. Today's Israel is an Israel on the move, and it has special needs. The mayor of Ramat Gan told me that the Government wouldn't supply him with the money for a computer classroom in one of the schools, and the kids were very disappointed. So, we built them a computer classroom.
Q. You feel very strongly about increasing higher edcuation.
A. Yes. I think elevating the level of higher education, not just vocational training, is essential if we want Israel to become, not just a regional power, but a global one. We're looking to expand these opportunities.
Q. Your organization finances research into diseases that affect the worldwide Jewish population. What is being done?
A. We're very heavily involved in research into dystonia, a degenerative neurological disease which mainly affects the Jewish population. This is a hereditary disease carried by a dominant gene, so some people are more prone to it than others. It affects thousands of people. We're funding research into genetic sequencing, working to isolate the gene that carries this disease and hopefully eliminate it. We're also funding research into Alzheimer's, which can obviously strike anyone.
Q. Has the role of your organization changed with the election of a right-wing Prime Minister, Benyamin Netanyahu?
A. Not really, no. As a foundation, we're looking to fulfill the "social" needs of Israel. We try not to get into the politics, because everyone has their own opinion on it. And, on the social level, there's an unbelievable number of projects which need to be done. This is a country which was constantly in a state of siege and now, obviously, it is again. Any which way you turn, there is need.
Q. What is your view on the future of Judaism, and the preservation of Jewish heritage and culture?
A. As Jews, we are five million in America and four million in Israel, and some people say the demographics don't look too good for us here. With inter-marriage and absorption, they think our numbers will fall to three, two, one million. And in Israel, they think the number of Jews will go way up, and that will be the center of Jewish life. And there are others who believe we're going to thrive in America, and that there will be two paths of Judaism -- one in North America and one in Israel. It's an interesting question. But I'm afraid I believe the first scenario.
Q. On a social level, what would you like to see occur?
A. I'd like to see American Jews re-invigorated an re-enthused. I'd like them to understand who we are, what we've contributed to mankind and what we can do in the future. I'd like to see more enthusiasm about what Israel is, who we are, what we've given to art, science, peace. I'm not sure people are aware of these things. For example, every major city in Israel has a museum. Some have many museums, and some of them are very elaborate. There are 10 ballet companies, there are opera companies and symphonies in Israel. It's all quite incredible, given the size of this country and the number of people there.
Q. Is there a role for Christians in your organization?
A. I've always thought so. I've wanted to bring people onto our board who are Christian, and whom I know are wonderful, talented people who love Israel. But some people said I was crazy. It's a question that I probably didn't go into deeply enough or analyze enough the ramifications of it. But, at this juncture, I'd say, "Why not?"
Q. You travel to Israel rather frequently. How important is that to your organization's mission?
A. Well, we've opened an office there, and we have American Jews putting up money and building a computer school. I needed to see that school, those computers, the kids, though I don't recover from the jet-lag nearly as quickly as I used to. It's fascinating to go and meet people from the political spectrum and the social spectrum. The greatest thing I could possibly do at this point is to share what I see with with everyone; try to give them my enthusiasm and excitement so that they can, in turn, excite others.
It's also important for others to go. Last year, my wife and I went to Israel with eight or nine other couples who hadn't been there in years. They'd been asking me, "Marvin, what is the Histradrut? What is it you're so excited about?" So I showed them the trauma centers we've built, the orphanages, the schools. They said they had no idea that these things existed, and I said, "Maybe now you'll try and make a contribution."
Q. You believe that, in the attempt to support Israel, people should change the way they view the country, and the way they view giving help?
A. Yes. In the past, when people gave charity to Israel, they always treated it as a "beggar," in a sense, saying, "Here's my money, take it." Now, with Israel's' coming of age, they're in a very different posture. They're a high-tech society. They're an economic powerhouse. If there could only be peace there, Israel could be the garden spot of the Middle East.
Israel is quite advanced in computerization, biological engineering, the drug industry, telecommunications. And they just absorbed more than 700,000 people from Russia, many of whom are very well-educated.
I think that, if we're going to be supportive of Israel now, we can no longer look at them like they are "the beggar." They're looking for a relationship with us that's almost a partnership, a fit. Sure, they need our help with social problems and services. But they want to feel it's a two-sided venture. I view Israel as my partner. I want to keep my partner healthy. If my partner is healthy, then I'm healthy and vice-versa.

Taking U.S. Pulse: Self-Reliance Is Back

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
RALPH WALDO EMERSON would be glad to hear what Edward B. Keller of Hastings-on-Hudson says consumer research has shown: Americans are embracing the kinds of self-reliance that Emerson wrote about more than a century ago.
Mr. Keller, 40, is president and chief operating officer of Roper Starch Worldwide, one of the oldest and largest marketing and public opinion research firms in the world. Headquartered in Mamaroneck, it has other offices in Manhattan, Chicago and Newport Beach, Calif., and it plans to open additional offices in London and Hong Kong. The firm's clients include large corporations, media companies and government and nonprofit agencies. 
 Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Keller, who joined Roper Starch in 1986:
Q. How is consumer research done? By phone, focus groups, other things?
A. It's quite varied. Telephone interviewing is the dominant method right now. But there still is a lot of research that gets done in the old-fashioned way, which is door to door, in a randomly selected way so you get a good national sample. That's the way this business started. There are also people who stop you in shopping malls and ask you a few questions or maybe take you down to a test kitchen and have you sample some products.
And then there are focus groups. Focus groups are very good if you want to get the emotion and language that consumers use and be able to observe the consumers in action. What focus groups can't do for you is to quantify. You can't say that just because six or seven people feel a certain way that that is an accurate indication that 60 percent or 70 percent of the population feels that way.
Q. Are you doing scientific polling as well?
A. We almost predominantly do that. Roper, along with Gallup, invented the scientific method for marketing research back in 1933 when both Roper and Gallup were founded. It was really the accurate prediction of the 1936 Presidential election that caused people to realize that scientific sampling of a small but projectable group of people was more accurate than having tens of thousands of people write in their responses. This is still a hard thing for people to believe, that 700 or 800 scientifically sampled people can provide a more accurate prediction than 10,000 to 20,000 people who call in to a 900 poll on a television station. It's like drawing a blood sample. The doctor can draw a very little bit of blood out of you and determine if something is wrong with you or not. The doctor doesn't need to drain all your blood to figure out if there is something going on.
Q. What does your research show as to how people feel about things?
A. Our read is that consumers are feeling much better than they have been feeling over the last few years; 1991-92 was really a very down period. It was very hard psychologically, if not economically, and it was a real slap in the face to a lot of people. But there has been a shifting of anger to one of self-reliance. For almost 30 years, from the 1960's to the early 90's, they relied on large institutions, such as government, to solve problems and large businesses to provide an employment safety net for us. In the early 1990's, when the recession hit, consumers got angry at the failure of government to do its job; they got angry at large businesses for all the layoffs.
This has led to a major change in the mind-set. We've now moved into what we call the age of autonomy -- a strong period of self-reliance where consumers have decided that they need to rely on themselves, their families, their communities and ad hoc networks of people to get ahead. We find that consumers aren't so much angry anymore about what is going on on the national level but rather see it as irrelevant to them.
Consumers are beginning to figure out what it takes to succeed in this new mind-set of theirs. And they're feeling good. We're seeing large increases in the number of people who say they are pleased or delighted with the way things are going for them personally. We found declines in the number of people who say someone in their household has lost their job or had a pay cut or all sorts of other things that were happening in the early part of the 90's. So people are less nervous about what might happen tomorrow.
Q. What other trends are you finding in the public thinking?
A. We're seeing that pride is back in American-made products. And people are feeling really good about America again. There have been large increases in the last six or seven years in the number of people who rate the U.S. the No. 1 country in the world in terms of the highest-quality new products, the most creative new products, products offering the most value. Our inferiority complex, particularly with respect to Japan, has turned itself around completely.
Q. Does this cover all ages, all socioeconomic groups and both sexes?
A. This is pretty much across the board, although I would say there is still somewhat of a polarization, if you will, so that people who are better educated and have higher incomes are succeeding better in the new self-reliant environment because they know how to succeed better. So they're more optimistic, and they're getting ahead. The people at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum are still suffering, but I think they are beginning to turn themselves around, too. Maybe more slowly.
But while there are dramatically fewer people who are worried about some negative economic factor hitting their households, there are still groups of people who are much higher than the average in worrying about that. This includes working women and dual-income couples. There is a little bit of nervousness that "We're getting by with both of us working, but if one of us lost our job, it would be difficult."
Q. What about the advent of psychotherapy and drugs like Prozac? Could that be why we feel better, that we are seeking help for our problems?
A. I'd say that is a factor. Most of the things that people do to make themselves feel better when they're blue are things to indulge themselves. But we're also taking care of ourselves. People know there can be tough times, but instead of having a "woe is me" attitude, they say, "I need to do small things to indulge myself."
Sometimes that's splurging on a gift for yourself, sometimes it's eating food that you know in your heart of hearts isn't healthy for you. I think doing things like getting help through a therapist or taking drugs that make you feel better, prescription drugs, is one piece of it. And I think the self-help movement and the search for alternative types of religion have helped also. We have people telling us that prayer has helped them.
Q. Is this more so than in the past?
A. Yes. We call it the search for meaning. People are beginning to rely much more on their family. There's no question in our minds -- the family is back and people are remembering that the family can be a source of emotional support. Some of that is demographically driven. The baby boomers are now firmly in their family years, having kids. And it's not necessarily the traditional family. There is much more tolerance for a broad and expanded definition of families.
Q. What do you see ahead in 1997 and beyond?
A. There is a lot of discussion about the graying of the population and about baby boomers turning 50. There is no question that that will have a major impact on the marketplace and on our society. Baby boomers remain indulgent, as they always have. But there is a perspective that comes with middle age. They become less focused on themselves and more on their kids, their family and their community. They're also much more pragmatic and practical.
The second thing on the horizon, which I don't think is being much talked about, is the effects of the boomlet -- the boomers' kids. There has been a prolonged period where we've had four million-plus births a year, equal to what we had during the baby boom. Over the next 10 years, we will see a rebound occurring in the youth generation as these kids get older. And there will be a sufficient number of them for us again to have a youth culture.
As a society over the next 5 to 10 years, we will simultaneously be getting older and younger, and it's going to have an interesting type of tension. I think it will be one of the most interesting dynamics to watch.

Deep Roots Meet 90's Pressures in Orange

BYLINE: By FRANCES J. BENDER 

 BODY:
ROBERT C. SOUSA represents change to the town of Orange. At the age of 36, he's not only the youngest First Selectman the town has ever elected, but also the first Democratic First Selectman in the town's 173-year history.
Orange's picture logo -- a farmer pulling a tractor across his field -- speaks to the town's conservative history and to generations of families -- Capecelatro, Hine, Treat, Knight are among his First Selectman predecessors -- who've thrived within its quiet neighborhoods and highly regarded schools. 
 Mr. Sousa said it was precisely those qualities that brought his family, including his wife, Denise, and four young children, to town in 1990 following his graduation from the University of Bridgeport law school.
"I researched towns the way employers research employees," said Mr. Sousa, a Massachusetts native who opened his own law firm in Shelton in 1993. "We came here for two things: the public school system, and the pride people have about the town. The politics came after."
Now halfway through his two-year term, Mr. Sousa finds himself at the helm during a time of dramatic economic and demographic change for Orange. Shopping malls along the town's stretch of Route 1 continue to spring up or expand at a remarkable pace. Along Marsh Hill Road, a Stew Leonard's dairy store is planned, and last year a 130,000-square-foot Christmas Tree Shop opened its doors to large crowds. Tracts of farmland in town, nurtured for generations, are one by one being sold and subdivided. And quiet back streets are becoming cut-throughs for motorists zipping from the Boston Post Road to Route 34.
It is perhaps these changes that are defining Mr. Sousa's term as First Selectman even more than his age or political party. On a recent Saturday morning, Mr. Sousa settled in to talk about developments reshaping the town of 13,000. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q: Is this your first run for public office?
A: I always thought I'd be in politics at the state level. I ran for the state House of Representatives in 1992, but lost by 190 votes. I wasn't well known yet, and it was a learning experience for me; much like losing a legal case.
Q: Why did you run for First Selectman in Orange?
A: A few years ago, my wife and I saw the public schools take a downturn and we wanted to get involved. She ran for the Board of Education, and now she's serving a four-year term. She jokes now that she's the only one in the family with a perfect 1-0 record.
I also got involved in local politics because it bothered me that in 173 years, the town had always elected a Republican. I strongly believe in competition. Without it, a town becomes complacent. The best thing to happen to the Republicans is that I won. They're working harder now, re-energizing. From now on, the races will be more competitive. I don't think the town will ever go back to the way it was.
Q: Have Orange residents expressed concern that, as a Democrat, you'll raise their taxes?
A: If voters thought they were getting a "tax and spend" Democrat, they're mistaken. I had the first tax cut in 40 years in this last budget. But there are also things worth spending money on: open space, renovating the police and fire stations, computers in the schools, a new library. When you run a town like a business, you can buy what you need and still balance the books.
I like to say I'm a "new ideas" Democrat. I firmly believe that government can learn a lot from business. The Orange Taxpayers Association is relatively pleased with what I've been doing. A number of them have become my informal advisors.
Q: I know you hear concerns at town meetings that Orange is developing too rapidly; that the town is losing is rural character. Specifically, residents say the traffic on their roads has increased, that more cars are driving by, faster than ever.
A: I'm aware of traffic concerns. They're legitimate concerns. I don't want speeding cars where my four children play. But the answer isn't to ignore applications for development. I think we should hire our own traffic engineer.
In 1997, the state will widen the on and off ramps to Marsh Hill Road off I-95. We're proposing to keep the road four lanes all the way to the Post Road, and we've applied for Federal funding to do it. We're almost there, and it looks very good. About $2 million of that project is funded by state and Federal dollars. That's what separates us from past administrations. We pursue available grants.
We also have a commitment from the state to place a turn lane in the middle of the Post Road by the year 2000. I'm trying to get them to move that date up.
But the only way business will succeed is if traffic can go through. I believe we can maintain the rural character here, but we need to bring in revenue.
Q: What about the ongoing opposition to bringing in a Stew Leonard's dairy store?
A: They still have to prove that they're addressing traffic concerns. That's my only reservation. The criticism I hear is that Stew's will change the character of the town; I don't believe it will do that. The property was once zoned for light industrial/commercial anyway. If the store winds up in West Haven or Milford we'll get the traffic anyway, but none of the tax benefits.
I talk to people in Norwalk and Danbury, and they say the traffic from the Stew Leonard's there is controlled. It will also create 700 new full-time and part-time jobs. Many of those will go to Orange high school kids.
Q: Are there proposals in place to preserve any open space in town?
A: The Hine family is talking to developers about selling 10 acres of their 78-acre farm off Route 34 to developers, for an assisted living facility. I'd like the town to acquire development rights for a significant portion of that farm -- to take the remaining 68 acres off the market. I'm trying to get Federal funding to buy it. A bond referendum has already passed overwhelmingly.
Within my first three months we bought all 67 acres of Amity land (an open parcel located off Pine Tree Road) for $1.4 million. We already owned half; we paid the remaining $700,000 out of the general fund.
I'd also like to acquire Camp Cedarcrest. My concerns are that the owners have entered into an agreement to allow a 185-foot tower for cellular telephones to be installed. The state has jurisdiction, but we'll oppose it. We've already intervened. If we want to preserve big tracts of open space like those, we have to buy them. The town doesn't mind spending money to do it. But we also have to work to increase the tax base, to attract new businesses.
Q: You did a promotional video of Orange as one way to do that?
A: We hired a local university to create the video, and we'll market it to businesses nationally and internationally. It's a take-out from the Marine theme: We're looking for the few and the proud.
Q: Will the local schools remain a selling point for the town?
A: The schools once again have art, music, physical education and academically talented programs. Our next goal is to work on playgrounds. Real estate brokers say home values are starting to turn around. Quality education will turn those values around even faster.
Q: Orange has one of the highest percentages of senior citizens in the state -- more than 16 percent over age 65. What do you tell them when they say they're concerned about the town's rapid changes?
A: I tell them that progress is necessary. No matter how nostalgic for the 1940's and 50's, we don't want to live the old days again. You don't run from the future, you plan for it.
Maybe my critics say I'm doing too much too quickly. But too little was done for a long time. The voters will decide how long I stay. When I'm done, whether it's two, four, six or eight years from now, the town will be a better place to live in.

HEADLINE: Outlook Is Linked To Lilco Again in '97

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
IN closed meetings, members of the Long Island Power Authority have discussed plans for long-awaited dramatic action to lower electric rates. Since its creation in 1986, the state agency, intended to reorganize electrical service on Long Island, has been debating such plans.
What to do about high electric rates remains near the top of regional concerns, as it has for years. But now the talks have a sense of urgency. The new year, according to those close to the talks, brings with it the best and perhaps last opportunity for the agency to carry out Gov. George E. Pataki's pledge to reduce rates at least 10 percent. 
 Many politicians expect a major announcement early in the year, to be followed by months of debate on Long Island, where a poor plan might wreak as much harm as the failed $5.5 billion Shoreham nuclear power plant, a root cause of the high rates.
Any plan would also require approval in Albany, where a state board would have to consent unanimously. The three votes on the board are controlled by Mr. Pataki; the majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan.
Politicians said the most likely time for final approval would be before the Legislature adjourned in June or July.
The plan would also need the approval of the board of the Long Island Lighting Company and the utility's shareholders. A rejection by Lilco would force the power authority to carry out threats to take over the company through condemnation, a rigorous court action that would probably continue beyond next year.
Long Island enters 1997 with a gradually strengthening economy that appears to have moved beyond lost military contracts and corporate shrinkage. Small high-technology companies, an economic foundation for the Island, are part of the reasons for an increase in demand for commercial space, real-estate agents said, and larger technology companies like Computer Associates of Islandia continue to prosper.
Additions and alterations for existing commercial sites, coupled with the building of a new Federal courthouse in Central Islip, make the outlook good for the construction trades.
A regional economist, Thomas Conoscenti, has forecast regional economic growth of 1.5 percent for the year. Mr. Conoscenti said that pace would continue the trend of gradual unspectacular growth that business liked best.
The record stock market also enriched the regional economy, particularly Nassau County, where Wall Street workers go home to spend higher disposable incomes. Purchases of luxury items like jewelry rose in the Christmas season, according to retailers.
As shoppers shopped, Nassau and Suffolk repeated benefits that may lessen budgetary pressures. Higher sales taxes in the early 90's produced higher revenues as the economy improved, a trend that experts say will continue if there are no major disruptions.
Amid good times for people with jobs and money, those who depend on welfare programs are braced for hard times. Major overhauls of the welfare system, begun in Washington and enthusiastically furthered by Mr. Pataki, have sharply increased state and county control over programs while pressuring recipients to find work.
The new year will provide early signs of whether the changes are an improvement or whether they leave gaping holes in people's safety nets. In Nassau and Suffolk, social service officials are preparing for wide-ranging changes in their duties. But uncertainty over how the Legislature will act on Mr. Pataki's plan leaves the local officials uncertain about how to proceed.
In Suffolk County, the departure of Donald R. Blydenburgh, Republican of Smithtown, as presiding officer of the County Legislature is a major change. Mr. Blydenburgh, who was elected a justice of State Supreme Court last month, was the longest-serving presiding officer. His legacy may well be the quelling of the sometimes unruly Legislature. Whether his successor, to be chosen early next month, can also accomplish such a goal may be known before the end of the new year.
In Nassau, the new Legislature enters its second year with higher expectations. If the first year in the transition from the Board of Supervisors was needed to work out institutional bugs, the second year may see the chamber under pressure to perform more effectively.
But the main political event may be the race for County Executive. Thomas S. Gulotta, the Republican incumbent, is widely expected to run for a third full term. No clear Democratic candidate has emerged. Richard M. Kessel, who lost a primary to a former Supervisor from North Hempstead, Benjamin L. Zwirn, three years ago, and Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli of Oyster Bay are possible contenders.
Unless unforeseen developments hurt the economy, Mr. Gulotta will be bolstered by a record of holding down property taxes in a county where registered Republican outnumber registered Democrats, 3 to 2.
That edge was not enough to prevent Carolyn McCarthy of Mineola from winning election to Congress last month as a Democrat. Mrs. McCarthy, who entered politics as an advocate for gun control after her husband had been shot to death and her son was wounded in the Long Island Rail Road shootings in 1993, will have a chance to show her mettle in 1997. The new year may answer the question of whether Mrs. McCarthy, a Republican who ran as a Democrat, will be brought back into the Republican folds by the party chairman, Joseph N. Mondello.
On the East End, a drive is under way for a binding referendum in November on creating a new Peconic County that would include East Hampton, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southampton and Southold.
On Election Day voters in the five towns overwhelmingly approved a proposal to ask the Legislature in Albany to order the referendum. But Suffolk officials said a financial settlement on buildings and properties had to be in place.
State approval of a referendum in the face of opposition from Suffolk officials seems unlikely to politicians.
Long Island's share of money from the $1.75 billion state environmental bond act approved last month should start flowing in 1997. The total included $200 million for cleanups in Long Island Sound. Additional money is to protect Peconic and South Shore estuaries and to reclaim old industrial sites.
The new year may also bring a decision by the Board of Regents on what to do about the president of Adelphi University, Dr. Peter Diamandopoulos, and the board of trustees.
Reports have said the Regents may announce a decision as early as next month. They are considering allegations that Dr. Diamandopoulos is highly overpaid, to the detriment of the university.
The case also involves questions about conflicts of interest involving trustees and an inquiry into whether the university is carrying out its mission.
The stakes are high for Adelphi, whose damaged reputation and future are on the line.
Politicians say 1997 may be the year for dramatic action to cut electric rates or for final tacit admission that the status quo is unlikely to change as a result of executive and legislative action in Albany. The time for action is ripe, the politicians say, because of the gubernatorial election in 1998, a schedule that allows time for a complex and potentially bruising task to be handled without the pressure of an impending election.
The chairman of the authority, Frank L. Zarb, a former Federal energy official and a seasoned figure from Wall Street, also appears to many to be the sort of political and financial technician to do the job. But whether Mr. Zarb remains for the long haul is questionable. His departure would be a signal that no action was coming soon.
Because talks between the authority and Lilco about a partial or full takeover have been under a confidentiality agreement, little is known about progress. Mr. Zarb has continued to make the goal of an immediate and sustainable rate reduction of at least 10 percent the agency's top objective. But an objective to disband Lilco, set by Mr. Pataki, appears to have been stricken from the list.
A key to any plan would be how it resolves a tax refund of more than $1 billion owed Lilco by Suffolk County, the Town of Brookhaven and the Shoreham-Wading River School District. The refund is for excess assessments at Shoreham. Mr. Zarb has warned that no perfect plan is possible.

HEADLINE: Island Moves to Front in Telecommunications

BYLINE: By ADAM L. PENENBERG 

 BODY:
DR. RICHARD MANDELBAUM said he knew 10 years ago that the Internet would, some day, herald a revolution in telecommunications.
What Dr. Mandelbaum, who helped to create the state's first Internet hookup, could not have known is that Long Island would end up providing many of the revolutionaries.
"Large businesses have been laying people off," Dr. Mandelbaum said, "but the Internet, which is a boon to small business, has led to the creation of more than a thousand companies across the state. It's generated billions of dollars for website designers, software makers, consultants and telecommunications companies."
Because of its educated work force, world-class research institutions and proximity to New York City, Long Island is home to a number of these cutting-edge companies. With advances in wireless telecommunications, Long Island is poised to become an Internet server to the world.
Already Long Island companies like Applied Theory, which is headed by Dr. Mandelbaum, Worldcomm Systems and Netsat are pushing the technology envelope, selling their wares and expertise to other countries. In addition, Interdigital, a Pennsylvania-based company specializing in wireless digital technology, maintains a major research facility on the Island.
Their businesses range from setting up satellite ground stations to providing access to the Internet from remote places not served by telephones, designing websites and software to setting up systems to transmit of video and sound via satellite.
All of these companies are growing rapidly with the rest of the telecommunications industry -- the telephone communications industry showed $210 billion in revenues in 1995, an increase of 8 percent, according to the Census Bureau -- and expect to double their Long Island work force within a year.
"Long Island suffered a loss of its technical base because of the disappearance of military contracts," said Dr. Gary Lomp, vice president and general manager of Interdigital. "Grumman and Hazeltine downsized, while many other companies that relied on the military disappeared. But now we find that the supply of jobs for those with engineering jobs is greater than demand. We're actively seeking qualified engineers."
Three years ago, Interdigital started its Long Island operations with 20 people. Today, 110 are crowded into their Great Neck plant. Within a year, the company expects to move their Long Island branch to Huntington Quadrangle and hire about 100 more people.
The United States is well ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to Internet related technology. In Europe, Internet access is also three times as expensive.
Poly Ventures, a high-tech venture capital firm, has been working to bring the Island's telecommunications companies together, to benefit from combining their technologies.
"The objective is to go into regional partnerships around the world to provide Internet access at a very high bandwidth, particularly in areas where access is difficult or impossible or both," said Shelley Harrison, who heads Poly Ventures. "If you're in Russia and the phone lines don't work, what do you do?"
This is why Dr. Mandelbaum sees a bright future for Applied Theory, which, after Mr. Harrison introduced them, recently negotiated an agreement with Netsat Express of Hauppauge to combine its Internet technology and expertise with Netsat's satellite technology. "It's a perfect match," said Jerry Guttman, president of Netsat, which is ownedby both Hughes Network Systems and Worldcomm Systems. "We have a strong satellite background and Applied Theory has the ability to create asophisticated network design, the know-how to run an Internet facility, plus experience with customer support and training facilities." Netsat and Applied Theory plan to unveil a new facility in Hauppauge early next year, which would have a two-way satellite gateway system for international Internet traffic -- to developing nations and other places where telephone systems may not be fully developed.
But people with reliable phone service could also benefit. "A satellite feed would offer greater speed and quality of service," Mr. Guttman said. "We can provide a 400-kilobit connection. The normal connection speed in the U.S. is 28.8 kilobits, so ours is 14 times as fast," which would speed up the interminable wait many net surfers suffer when downloading graphics, photos and video.
"Together, we're targeting markets in Africa, Eastern Europe and Central America, and eventually we'll have satellite feeds in every major region."
The idea, Dr. Mandelbaum said, is to become a Long Island-based Internet service provider for the world.
Dr. Mandelbaum's visions should not be given short shrift. A Long Island native, he founded Nysernet in 1985, a consortium of 15 key New York universities and research laboratories -- including Brookhaven, Stony Brook and Polytechnic -- that needed a way to communicate with one another.
Grumman, Kodak, I.B.M., G.E. and Nynex climbed aboard and helped Nysernet get financing from heavyweights like the National Science Foundation, the Defense Department, NASA, the Department of Energy and New York State to develop the Internet.
"This was the best investment New York State ever made," Dr. Mandelbaum said of the state's $3 million investment over 10 years. "They've gotten way more back in incremental taxes, let alone in direct economic benefits. I wrote a paper back in 1987 where I claimed that telecommunications would be a harbinger of a new industrial revolution, on par with the highway system when it came to connecting people. I said that there'd be traffic problems on the Internet by the year 2000. I was off by only a few years."
Applied Theory, a for-profit company, was spun off of the not-for-profit Nysernet this year. Three other founders of Nysernet left to form PSI, one of the nation's largest telecommunications companies, and traded stock in their then-fledgling company for technology. The result was that Applied Theory started with millions of dollars in backing.
In its first year Applied Theory has worked with the Department of Labor to integrate its existing database into a website. The result was America's Job Bank. The company has also trained 2,000 employees of Kodak, 1,000 employees of Corning, and teachers in the Oneonta school district.
But it has been recent advances in wireless digital transmission that will bring the world to Long Island -- and Long Island to the world. Existing telephone lines are limited in their capacity to carry digital information. But wireless systems have almost no limit as to the amount of information they could carry.
This is what Interdigital's Long Island research centers on.
"Telecommunications used to mean just the telephone, but now it means many things," said Dr. Lomp, who grew up, went to school and worked at Hazeltine before joining Interdigital. "There are hundreds of potential subscribers for wireless telecommunications systems, because it's cheaper, more flexible and rapidly deployable. Hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake here, from your simple telephone to complex computer networks."
In the future, with the world more interconnected, it may be possible to have a job in another country without leaving your living room or "telecommute" to your job, even carry your whole office -- computer, phone, fax, Internet connection, all your files -- in your briefcase.
"It will be like combining the 18th century craftsman with the mass manufacturing of the 20th century,." Dr. Mandelbaum predicted.

HEADLINE: Experts Look To Economic Future Of the County

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
PROS, cons and prospects for Westchester in 1997. As the new year approaches, seven business leaders were asked to go out on a limb to predict the economic future of the county. Here are their views:
P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president, Westchester County Board of Realtors. 
 It's a sure bet that 1996 will end as one of the busiest if not an actual record-setting year for residential real estate sales in Westchester County. All the right conditions were present -- an ample inventory in all price ranges, fairly low mortgage interest rates, reasonable pricing expectations by buyers and sellers and a generally healthy local economy.
Price levels and interest rates aren't likely to change much in 1997. That leaves the health of our economy as the controller of whether real estate will fare well or poorly next year. I think we'll do well again, but I also note that perception counts as much as fact when it comes to real estate transactions. Thus I think potential real estate buyers will still need to see new companies and jobs coming into the county as well as the absence of any further heavy corporate downsizing in order to have the confidence about their own situations that will prompt them to buy housing here.
Ross J. Pepe, president of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester and Hudson Valley.
For the first time since the late 1980's, construction work in Westchester is a blend of retail, commercial and public works. The laggard, industrial construction, remains weak.
Large commercial retail projects like the 766,000-square-foot Cortlandt Town Center, Swiss Re and I.B.M. in Armonk, Nine West in White Plains and Morris Companies' "Big Box" retail center in Yonkers are this year's banner works. A proposed $150 million revitalization of New Rochelle's downtown area will create more than 1,500 new construction jobs. A multitude of smaller projects -- a $20 million senior housing complex, $10 million Ferncliff Cemetery renovation in Hartsdale and the Price Club relocation in New Rochelle -- will also start in the spring. Residential construction shows steady growth through 1997 with several town house condominiums and single-family developments planned.
And the New York State Department of Transportation and Thruway Authority continue to upgrade their facilities. A $86 million rehab of two viaducts on Cross Westchester Expressway starts this winter, and the $130 million rehab of the Tappan Zee Bridge continues. Local government work remains spotty. Passage of the $1.75 billion Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act will provide $200 million for treatment facilities discharging into Long Island Sound, of which Westchester seeks $28 million for pipeline projects this year.
But strong employment reports are misleading. Over the last five years, some trades have lost up to 25 percent of member base by attrition. Yet contractor and material supplier capacity for more work remains strong. If approved, Federal transportation and environmental funding proposals before Congress could considerably brighten our industry's future.
Lawrence E. Dwyer Jr. president the Westchester County Association.
The economic future of Westchester will, in large part, be dependent on expanded partnerships at all levels. The need to do more with less, to be aggressively hospitable to business and to plan for the needs of an expanding economy will test not only Westchester but also the entire Northeast as it seeks to be competitive with the world as the place to do business.
The Business Retention and Expansion study now under way, sponsored by a partnership of public and private groups, will produce a road map for what must be done to retain and expand business in Westchester. Six hundred businesses interviewed for the study provided the information.
What is also important is a skilled work force. It is to that end that we must maximize the resources of our higher-education institutions and work-development programs.
Countywide, in order to maintain a competitive work force, mass transporation should be expanded, and diversified housing, particularly rental housing, should be provided.
Also in 1997, we must continue to support the business-friendly attitude of the Governor and state government. The recent progress has been remarkable.
Andrew N. Karlen, vice chairman for small business, Westchester County Chamber of Commerce.
There are certainly grounds for celebration whenever a major employer like Nine West relocates to Westchester. But it was small business that paid the taxes and supported the communities that make the county so desirable for large companies today.
Now, following a decade of corporate downsizing, which altered workplace values, small is better. When corporate executives were forced off commuter trains, many became self-employed and opened small businesses.
In 1997, a deep matter of concern for every small business owner and municipal planner will be the plight of the small retailer, under siege from the national chains now campaigning to saturate Westchester. The challenge for our municipalities will be to strike a balance between the allure of the "power box retailers" and protecting the family and local businesses, which for decades have provided thousands of jobs for local residents and contributed millions of dollars to local economies. Moreover, their owners and employees have been our mayors, legislators and community leaders.
Valerie Maitland-Smith, president, Westchester Association of Women Business Owners.
The small business community in Westchester employs more people than the Fortune 500 companies, and 40 percent of small businesses are now owned by women.
A recent survey of our members revealed an average gross sales of $526,000 with 37 percent reporting an increase in sales from the preceding year. Almost all said they expect to keep investing in their businesses with 20 to 25 percent planning expansions.
With statistics like these, the encouragement of more women as employers is important. Access to available start-up or expansion capital is vital. Reducing the tax burden on small businesses would allow all small business more capital for expansion and investment in their businesses.
Marcia Dmochowski, president, Westchester Hotel Association.
The hotel industry in Westchester will enjoy another good year in 1997. Occupancies will continue to be strong, which will limit last-minute availability on Mondays through Thursdays during peak months. However, there will be opportunities for corporate retreats and team-building activities, which have become increasingly popular, particularly with companies in Manhattan seeking a different venue.
There will also be plenty of opportunities for meetings and events in months which traditionally are not as busy, such as January through April, July, November and December. With the P.G.A. Tournament at the Winged Foot Country Club in August, the demand for guest rooms has already exceeded the supply in the county for that time period.
Steven Cohen, president of the Westchester Bankers Association.
Banks report record profits this year, and business in 1997 should remain strong, especially as many banks will be expanding services into the investment and brokerage fields. Despite the spate of mergers, the banking industry in Westchester will continue to grow in 1997 because the banks here have carved out their own niches, and they sense that business in Westchester will be strong. For example, Key Bank and M. & T. Bank of Albany now have come into White Plains as has the Private Bank, a subsidiary of the Bank of Boston.

HEADLINE: ART;
Tableware Designed With an Eye on Economics

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, the Newark Museum mounted a show called "The Painted Pot," a survey of hand-painted ceramics. Now it's "The Printed Pot: Fine China for Everyone," which traces the history of a decorating shortcut, the process of transfer printing, through about 100 pieces of tableware from the museum's collection.
Ulysses Dietz, the museum's decorative arts curator, who is responsible for the show, sees in these objects the origin of two modern economic concepts: niche marketing and planned obsolescence. And he has succeeded in serving up fascinating New Jersey lore, since the state has long been a major center for the manufacture of tableware. 
 A comprehensible lexicon of terms is posted at two places in the gallery. Transfer printing is described as follows: "An engraved image is printed on damp paper, which is then applied to an unfired piece of pottery or porcelain. The unfired clay soaks up the ink in the image, which is then fired into the glaze."
The process originated in England with a famous name in tableware, Josiah Wedgwood. By the 1760's, Wedgwood had made one-of-a-kind dinnerware for most of the crowned heads of Europe and was coveting middle-class customers in both Britain and America. He sold them creamware, which looks like porcelain but is made of coarser clay and is off-white. It was decorated by the transfer process with landscapes and other florid subjects. The process permitted the manufacture of multiple items with the same decoration.
The subsequent perfection of white porcelain in England gave rise to blue decoration imitating Chinese porcelain. A small saucer with a transfer-printed pagoda and willow trees, owned by the Ward family of Colonial Newark, was apparently valued as a status symbol, for the family kept it despite a prominent chip.
The ease of transfer printing made it feasible to target specific audiences by customizing the decoration of generic items. "This was the beginning of niche marketing," Mr. Dietz says. Methodists were the intended buyers of a bulb pot bearing a stern profile of John Wesley. An English company in the early 19th century swallowed its pride and mass-produced a pitcher for the American market decorated with "The Apotheosis of George Washington."
Mr. Dietz credits Wedgwood with formulating planned obsolescence. Copper oxide applied thinly on white clay produces a lustrous glaze of shocking pink. The color was popular, but its novelty would wear off, or it would literally fade. And in any case, china will break. The consumer could readily find the same basic object with different decoration.
In the first decades of the 19th century, English manufacturers saturated the American market with a deep cobalt color that has come to be called "historic blue." Much of it was made specifically for the New Jersey market, including a plate showing the house of the prominent Stevens family of Hoboken, now the site of Stevens Institute of Technology. The most popular patterns featured Passaic Falls. A revival of historic blue in the first half of the 20th century resulted in such endearing souvenirs as a plate commemorating the opening of the Newark Museum in 1929 and one from 1930 to 1940, updating the Stevens house after it grew into a mansion in the Victorian era.
A ROUND 1830, New Jersey china manufacturers came into their own. The American Pottery Company of Jersey City produced a pitcher promoting the 1840 Presidential candidacy of William Henry Harrison. The major motif was the log cabin in which Harrison was born (on his family's large plantation in Virginia), and its rawness was in sharp contrast to the usual sinuosity. Decoration lacking true esthetic appeal became entrenched because, in Mr. Dietz's words, "these images could be slapped on anything." Therefore he has included costly objects that relied on transfer printing, among them a plate with an elaborate Near Eastern design featuring a Persian star, circa 1884-90, made by Greenwood China in Trenton. Even gold could be transferred, as a gilt cup and saucer made in Moscow shows.
Artists were always involved in transfer printing; they drew the initial engravings. At the end of the 19th century, members of the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain allied themselves with industry to improve the quality of design, and they signed their patterns. But the movement's more conservative, anti-industry wing also used transfer printing. A fruit bowl with spare abstract decoration was made for the Roycroft Inn in East Aurora, N.Y.; the Roycrofters, an artistic community that lasted from 1903 to 1938 there and taught crafts through an apprentice system, were major rivals of the Stickleys.
Decorating became even easier with the rise of the decal, an entire image that slides off a piece of paper to be easily stuck on unfired clay. Decals became important to high-end tableware as well as the mass-produced because elaborate decals could be expensive in themselves. Decals also assure uniformity of pattern, a demand of 20th-century taste. The official White House china made for President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1931 by Lenox in Trenton was a milestone. As an economizing gesture during the Depression, the Great Seal of the United States was printed as a colored decal rather than hand-painted in gold.
The final pieces in the show illustrate the continuing versatility of decal transfer printing. A 1989 teapot by Dorothy Hafner is decorated all over with a relentless lightning pattern. In contrast, Michael Graves is represented by a restrained pattern from the same year in Attic red, which alludes to ancient Greek pottery. Following the New Jersey trail to the end, Mr. Graves is also the architect of the renovated Newark Museum.

A Modest Proposal, With Recipe

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
THE man at the King's supermarket butcher counter in Upper Montclair said the price was $3.99 a pound, and he had only a few Canada geese left. New Year's goose orders have to be in early, butchers say. And don't forget that with a goose, you're lucky to get four servings from a 10-pounder. So if you're planning on traditional succulent roast goose for a New Year's dinner party, figure on spending about what it costs for a pair of Broadway tickets.
Given these prices, economics would argue that there is a basic shortage of supply in the goose market. But don't tell that to anybody driving along Route 1 south of New Brunswick, where fat Canada geese squat on corporate lawns like acres of feathered tombstones. Don't tell it to people goose-stepping with their kids or dogs in local parks whose grounds are slick with droppings from hundreds of geese. 
 And don't tell it to Joe Vicari, the director of Ocean County Freeholders, where geese have reached Biblical plague proportions.
"It used to be a typical goose would stop off for 24 hours or so, and then migrate," he said. "But for the last seven years, geese have been staying, with absolutely no intention of leaving at all. People used to think they were cute, but not any more," said Mr. Vicari, who fields phone calls every day from people unhappy about the expanding population of Canada geese.
He warmed to the topic:
"Listen, each one leaves over 40 pounds of droppings a year. Forty pounds! Unbelievable bacteria counts. Polluting lakes, lagoons, waterways throughout Ocean County. Thousands of them, on soccer fields, lawns, golf courses. They're mean, too, even though that will get me in trouble with the bird lovers. Very territorial. They'll attack a youngster, walk right up to a school. They'll even walk up to an adult, poke you. They walk right in the streets.
"We have beautiful waterways, clean water, fresh air," he said, unable to resist the opportunity to promote Ocean County, the state's fastest-growing. "The quality of life is wonderful, for people and geese too. We have the biggest geese in the state. Whatever the average size of a Canada goose is, add another 25 percent for ours.
"If we could register them as Republicans, I might be happier," he said.
The problem is that strict Federal wildlife laws protect migratory geese, whose numbers have been declining sharply. But at the same time, populations of what are called resident geese have been "going through the roof," said Ted Nichols, a waterfowl biologist with the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife. Except for attitudes toward travel, it is difficult even for biologists to differentiate between a hardy migratory Canada goose and a contented resident goose, Mr. Nichols said.
"We've created these ideal habitats," he said. "All geese really need to thrive is water to drink and roost on, and grass. When they get into these areas where we've put all this fertilized bluegrass that goes right down to the water, they have everything they need to prosper."
Since 1990, the population of resident geese in New Jersey has more than doubled, to more than 70,000. What's more, Mr. Nichols said, geese take two to three years to breed, and the population of "teen-aged" geese is swollen disproportionately. "They're kind of waiting in the wings," he said.
Since geese are not susceptible to the usual New Jersey methods for discouraging residency, such as staggering property taxes and extortionate car-insurance premiums, the problem is a tough one. In recent years, the state has allowed limited hunting of resident geese in a few areas. But not all solutions include sending more hunters into the fray with shotguns blasting.
In recent months, resident Canada geese have been rounded up by hand in parts of New York, Michigan and Minnesota for food processing, like farm-bred turkeys. The geese have then been distributed to food pantries.
"They are a good food source," Mr. Nichols said. "Very tasty birds."
It is, of course, illegal without a hunting permit to shoot or snatch a goose from any place in the wild, which includes your local park. But it is not illegal -- and it might even be useful, for policy purposes -- to consider how easy it is to cook a goose. At my request, my mother-in-law faxed the following for our New Year's consideration.
CAROLYN'S ROAST GOOSE Obtain a 10- to 12-pound pound goose; criss-cross breast fat with diagonal slices; rub with salt; stuff lightly; brown at 450 degrees, reduce to 350, add water, baste regularly; time: 3 to 3 1/2 hours.

HEADLINE: A Bronx Antiques Row Brings Hope for Renewal

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
A CHARTER bus from Holyoke, Mass., was parked outside Lou Newkirk's antiques shop in the Port Morris section of the Bronx on a recent raw Saturday afternoon. Inside, Anne Tracy and her daughter, Becky, from Berkshire, Mass., were browsing.
The bus driver, Gary Despres, had deposited other in-town-for-the-day shoppers from Massachusetts in midtown Manhattan earlier in the day, and would soon be driving back to Manhattan to pick them up. But on his route south from New England he had passed Mr. Newkirk's shop and others nearby so many times that curiosity at last overcame him. He wanted to spend part of his idle afternoon discovering what lay behind those intriguing facades, and so did a few of his passengers. 
 "I've got an old house to furnish," said Mr. Despres, who drives for King Ward Coach Lines, of West Springfield, Mass. "Anyplace is good to look. Sometimes you find something, sometimes you don't."
Mrs. Tracy, in the store, concurred. "We're just looking. It's not too expensive."
Curiosity has served to build the customer base at this off-the-beaten-track shopping strip in the South Bronx, where so far there are half-a-dozen shops carrying mostly modestly priced merchandise. The location is on the route of buses and cars that drive south on Interstate 95 and leave the elevated Bruckner Expressway in Hunts Point to take Bruckner Boulevard at street level to the Third Avenue Bridge to Manhattan. Weekend browsers from distant places find old furniture, antique jewelry, custom furniture finishing, and even an art gallery in the ground-floor commercial space of turn-of-the-century walk-ups.
Now New York City has come through with an $875,000 "commercial street revitalization" project, a three-month construction job that was completed this month. It has brought new curbs and sidewalks, a strip of cobblestone paving, new trees, planters and lighting to a high-visibility location. The benefits for shoppers will no doubt blossom more fully in the spring and summer.
The street improvements have pushed the Bruckner Boulevard commercial strip closer to becoming the focal point of what economic development officials say has become a more vibrant industrial center in Port Morris. Borough President Fernando Ferrer speaks of the strip as the "gateway to the Bronx," a small-scale version of the Atlantic Avenue antiques district in Brooklyn, between Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill. It has proved useful in attracting industrial tenants to the area, officials say.
It has also improved the position of a new class of small property owner on the street -- the shop owners themselves. As their businesses have become established, some of them have found the means to buy and operate neighboring properties.
The owners have shown interest in upgrading the residential apartments that lie above the stores, which can draw rents of $700 to $800 a month or more, depending on the level of rehabilitation provided. But so far, this work cannot be done on the street's handful of vacant, though privately owned, buildings because the land is zoned for light manufacturing, and new residential space cannot be created as-of-right in a manufacturing district. A zoning liberalization, long proposed, may eventually permit new residential uses in the district's vacant walkups.
Only last week the Giuliani administration confirmed its interest in allowing residential use in many areas zoned for manufacturing -- Port Morris among them -- as part of a general effort to encourage housing construction. As a broad citywide rezoning initiative, however, the plan is expected to become highly controversial and therefore long-delayed. The small Bruckner Boulevard strip is a hostage to a broader debate.
The street revitalization work has been advocated for years by Sobro -- the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation. Its role underscores the part that local nonprofit development companies play in spurring both public and private investment in commercial areas where local organization is barely possible without outside help. They organize and advocate for small businesses, and act as an intermediary on behalf of business with agencies of city government, usually with assists from Borough Presidents' offices.
In Brooklyn, for example, a $9 million street improvement program was completed in July on a 14-block stretch of Smith Street, which runs parallel to Court Street one block away, through the communities of Carroll Gardens and Boerum Hill, above the subway tracks on which the F train runs.
THERE are 210 stores along the stretch, which has long been a "poor man's shopping street" supported by a big stock of brownstone housing on side streets, said Bette Stoltz, executive director of the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation, which promoted the project.
About 10 new stores have opened since the spring of 1995, Ms. Stoltz said, drawn in large part by the improvement work, which brought new lighting and Victorian-style light poles as well as extensive street repairs. Among the new stores are a restaurant, a frame shop, a bakery, a coffee bar and three antiques shops. "The lighting makes a statement that attracts those types of businesses," Ms. Stoltz said. The community waited 12 years to see the improvement project financed, she said.
Across the city, roughly 200 neighborhood shopping districts in moderate-income or low-income locations have benefited from commercial revitalization work since the 70's. The governmental assistance program began in 1978 in response to the street disturbances and shop destruction that occurred during the citywide blackout of 1977.
Budget cuts have squeezed out much of this work, and whatever amenities are built now tend to be add-ons to basic street and sidewalk improvement work. More and more, street improvements that enhance commercial districts may become the task of business improvement districts, with owners taxing themselves to finance the work, economic development officials say.
In the Port Morris antiques district, the city installed 23,400 square feet of concrete sidewalks and driveways, 1,930 linear feet of curbs, 19 new street lights, 34 trees, 12 planters and 6 benches, according to the New York City Economic Development Corporation. The site runs along Bruckner Boulevard from Alexander Avenue almost as far as Willis Avenue.
Over the years the wider area has developed a reputation as a favored location for drug dealing. In the the movie "Bonfire of the Vanities" an intersection on Bruckner Boulevard not far from the antiques district was used for the filming of the accidental killing and racial confrontation that establishes the plot.
A few days ago 61 people were arrested in a raid at Jose de Diego Beekman Houses between 138th Street and 143d Street in the neighboring residential community of Mott Haven. Officials said they were dismantling 12 violent drug gangs in these raids. The success of efforts to spur industrial development is linked to the ability of the Police Department to control drug trafficking, Sobro officials say.
ANOTHER issue is whether industrial employers in the new Federal empowerment zone in the South Bronx will be able to make use of the tax-credit program designed to spur local employment. The area has many industrial buildings and the potential for greater employment, but as the law stands the credits are available only for people already living within the area. The population of the Bronx empowerment zone is only 33,000.
The immediate beneficiaries of the street improvements are the property owners themselves, some of whom had already been putting new investment money into their buildings. The Esposito family has run a business called Satellite Plumbing at 65 Bruckner for 12 years, when it bought the property to establish offices close to regional roads and the bridge to Manhattan. Since then it has also bought No. 61, plus a few other small properties, so that it now runs 50 residential apartments.
Now that a vacancy has occurred in a two-bedroom floor-through at No. 65, the Espositos are spending $8,000 to completely rebuild the space for a new tenant, who will probably pay about $800 a month, said Paul Esposito, a partner in the business.
"Every time I walk past my neighbor Billy he laughs at me," said Mr. Esposito. "Billy gets $1,000 a month for a fancy job."
Billy's surname is Sheriff. He owns and runs an art gallery called Gallery 69, featuring Third World paintings, at 69 Bruckner Boulevard. He is also an audio engineer with the American Broadcasting Company. He bought the building in 1981 with a partner, Trevor Edwards, also an audio engineer, and a year later he moved in.
"A week after I got there the boiler blew up," Mr. Sheriff said. "It cost $1,000 to repair. Next store there was a hubcap store -- hundreds of hubcaps outside. They rattled all night. And people were selling drugs at night on the street, under a big tree."
One by one he improved the apartments as they were vacated, doing the work himself and bringing in artistic touches like sconces and fixtures purchased at neighborhood antique stores. He says he gets $900 to $1,100 for a modernized 1,300-square-foot apartment.
His partner, Mr. Edwards, said he was now negotiating to buy two other buildings on the block as a pure investment. "We're four subway stops from Manhattan and in the middle of all those roads," he said.
At another shop, the Custom Design Studio, at No. 47, Denise Ramirez and her husband, Enrique Cruz, do custom reupholstering for regional customers. Ms. Ramirez said they were in the process of buying a huge nearby building "that is perfect for factories or shops." It would be their first real estate venture.
Sobro, the nonprofit catalyst for South Bronx development work, is a 25-year-old organization headed by Phillip Morrow, formerly director of development of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation. Sobro sees the antiques center as the beginnings of a cultural center for the sizable residential population in Mott Haven just north of Bruckner Boulevard, and as an attractive focal point for the Port Morris industrial buildings. Paula Espinosa, the head of its commercial revitalization program, organized the local campaign that led to the funding of the street improvement project.
"Industrial companies nearby have put up money to guarantee the maintenance of the new city installations," said Neil W. Pariser, senior vice president of Sobro. The money is channeled through the Port Morris Local Development Corporation, to which 114 companies belong. When the corporation was formed 12 years ago it had only five members, Mr. Pariser said.
Sobro has itself become a developer of commercial space in the South Bronx. Most recently it developed 6,500 square feet of new stores at 183d Street and Davidson Avenue in University Heights, the first new commercial building in that area in perhaps 25 years, Mr. Pariser said. A laundromat has leased half the space and a food store is expected to take the rest.
Occasionally the old industrial buildings of Port Morris find a buyer. In November Truro College purchased a mostly vacant five-story building with 120,000 square feet of space, built in 1885 as the Estey piano factory, at Bruckner Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue, one block from the antiques district.
TRURO, which operates programs at 23 locations in the metropolitan area, hopes to open a liberal arts and sciences program there next year, said Akiva Kobre, director of operations. "Our mission is to go to areas where the students are to deliver education," Mr. Kobre said.
The Bruckner Boulevard antiques district exemplifies the type of location that would benefit from a zoning change to allow residential use in a manufacturing district, borough officials say. With mixed-use zoning, upstairs space in vacant buildings could be rehabilitated for residential use, while businesses could occupy the street-level space, a typical pattern on well-traveled thoroughfares with old walk-up buildings throughout the city.
"The present zoning stands in the way of economic development," said Bernd Zimmermann , director of the bureau of planning and development in the Bronx Borough President's office. In low-income areas in particular, he said, it is desirable to make it possible for start-up businesses to utilize space for residential as well as commercial purposes. "It promotes creativity," he said. "People can tinker."
The absence of appropriate zoning probably restricts the rise in property values, but there has been a gradual rise even so, owners say, as the antiques district attracts publicity. Mr. Newkirk, who runs Bruckner Antiques at 37 Bruckner Boulevard, is the best example of a store operator who has become a property owner as well.
Mr. Newkirk, 65 years old, had an antiques business in Engelwood, N.J., called "Gemini Moods" 20 years ago, and used to drive by the building at Bruckner Boulevard and Alexander Avenue that he now owns as he commuted to his Engelwood store from his home on Long Island. "It had an antiques shop that was always closed," he said.
He tracked down the owner and made an offer for his merchandise, mostly furniture. It was accepted. As he was moving the stock from the building to load it on his truck, drivers were stopping their cars and buying. "I thought, 'Oh boy, this is the place to be.' "
SO he rented the store and a year later bought the owner's two buildings, 37 and 57 Bruckner Boulevard. Now, through Harding Realty Corporation, a family company, he owns five neighborhood buildings, all with upstairs rental apartments. When a rental apartment becomes vacant he gets $700 or $750 a month for a six-room apartment, he said.
Not all shop owners wants to become property owners, however, and sales are also made to outside investors. A few days ago store tenants heard that an agreement had been reached by the owner of Nos. 45 and 47 Bruckner Boulevard to sell to another investor, reportedly for $140,000 for each building. The parties could not be reached for comment.
The tenant in one of those buildings, No. 45, is Ronan Clarke, who has been in business there for two years running All-Boro Estate Liquidators. He buys out estates, does some auctioneering in Westport, Conn., and runs a retail business in furniture and other household remains. "I used to be a picker," he said, using the term for people who find merchandise for antiques dealers. "Now people poke for me."
Mr. Clarke said he knew that his building was for sale, but he wasn't interested in buying. "I'm very busy in my business," Mr. Clarke said. "I don't need people calling me up saying my heating's not working."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Jersey City Riverfront Getting Hotel

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FIRST came the office towers, followed by the residential buildings and stores -- mostly in a huge regional mall -- that now line Jersey City's resurgent Hudson River waterfront.
But what is still missing in the area's transformation from a gritty industrial strip to a modern residential/commercial neighborhood is a hotel. 
 That may soon change. Plans are advancing to build a 200-room, 8- to 10-story limited service business hotel on 2.5 acres at the southeast corner of Washington Boulevard and Sixth Street, one block from the river's edge.
At the same time, an improved economy and a higher occupancy rate have nudged hotel development elsewhere in the state where there is a concentration of office buildings.
Conceived two years ago, the $20 million Jersey City project is to be developed by a joint venture between Hartz Mountain Industries, based in Secaucus, and Garden State Development of Jersey City.
"A hotel is conspicuous by its absence," said Emanuel Stern, executive vice president at Hartz, by way of explaining his company's involvement in the project. And, echoed Peter Mangin, president of Garden State, the project is a "good opportunity" because the market is short of rooms.
The hotel, which will be part of the Hudson Exchange mixed-use project, will rise adjacent to the Newport Mall and to the planned light rail system along the river's edge, said Mr. Mangin, whose uncle, former United States Representative Frank J. Guarini, is a significant investor in all projects pursued by Garden State.
The partners acquired the site in December and will choose an operator over the next two months. They expect to start construction in the first quarter of 1997, with completion expected in mid-1998. Financing is to come from conventional lenders and the partners' own equity.
Only one hotel was built along the 18 miles of shoreline from Bayonne to Fort Lee before the market sputtered. It is the 242-room Ramada Inn Suites Hotel in Weehawken, which opened in 1991 as part of the 62-acre Lincoln Harbor mixed-used project. That hotel was developed by Hartz, the developer of Lincoln Harbor. The company also built the 367-room SoHo Grand Hotel, which opened on West Broadway in Manhattan last August.
The waterfront hotel is being advanced at a time when the lodging industry in New Jersey and the nation is improving, analysts said. As of last October the occupancy rate in New Jersey hotels was 71.5 percent, up from 68.4 percent the same time last year, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., which reports on the market for hotel companies nationwide. The rate for the nation rose slightly to 67.8 from 67.2 percent.
At the same time daily room rates in New Jersey hotels averaged $78.94, up from $74.47 in 1995; in the nation it was $71.73, up from $67.33.
Among the factors stoking the rise, analysts said, is an improved domestic economy that increased business travel and domestic tourism. That along with the weak dollar, which drew an increase in visitors from Europe, was particularly strong in New York City and in turn is spilling over to New Jersey, said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting in Manhattan, with a specialty in the hotel industry.
The increase in demand, he added, is also outpacing a supply that has not grown in recent years throughout the New York area. In New Jersey 20 permits were issued for hotels so far this year, down from 33 in 1995, according to state figures.
ONE factor limiting construction activity is that the cost of buying and renovating existing hotels is still less expensive than building new ones, analysts agree. And while financing is available lenders require at least 25 percent equity participation from builders, said Arthur Adler, a principal of the hospitality group at Coopers & Lybrand, national accounting and consulting firm based in Manhattan.
Most of the hotels that are being built are limited service or all-suite, he said. They are smaller and less expensive to build because they do not have the full-scale restaurants or the large amount of meeting space found in traditional hotels. They are therefore easier to finance.
That does not mean full-service hotels are not being built. At the International Trade Center in Mount Olive work is under way on a 141-room Wyndham Garden Hotel. The $15 million project is being developed, using public and private funds, by the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation, a sub- sidiary of the Rockefeller Group, and Leslie E. Smith Jr., a builder who is the center's executive director. They are also developing the 670-acre multi-use Trade Center off Interstate 80. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts in Dallas will manage the hotel, which is to open this summer.
Others are planned. One is the up to 500-room hotel proposed in Hoboken as part of that city's effort to revive its riverfront from First to Fifth Streets. Request for proposals will be issued to developers this month and returned to the city by April, said Robert Drasheff, director of Hoboken's Office of Waterfront Development.
But most of the development is of hotels that do not offer full-service amenities, such as the one in Jersey City. Others include the 134-suite hotel Summerfield Hotel Corporation of Wichita, Kan., is building on Route 10 in Hanover. It is on that town's side of the 600-acre Prudential Business Campus that also straddles Parsippany. Completion is expected in May.
Prime Hospitality Corporation of Fairfield is also planning two AmeriSuites hotels. Construction on the first, with 159 suites, is to start next month on a site within the more than 2-million-square-foot Harmon Meadow mixed-use development, a Hartz project in the Secaucus Meadowlands. The other, with 124 rooms, will rise over the next year along the Route 1 business corridor in West Windsor.
Mr. Stern of Hartz said the success of the Weehawken hotel along with Jersey City's office population make the rest of the waterfront ripe for more hotel rooms. Hartz had considered expanding the Weehawken hotel, but dropped it to pursue the project in Jersey City, where 8.6 million square feet of offices line the waterfront and 13.4 million more square feet are planned.
Mr. Adler of Coopers & Lybrand said while the amount of office space was high it was not filled entirely with front-office users who would use a hotel. But he said the hotel would benefit from the overflow of Manhattan corporations looking for more favorable rates. Mr. Fox of PKF added that "overflow should continue for some time since there is little new construction in the pipeline in Manhattan."
THE Jersey City project has had its share of ups and downs. A key issue was the $9.3 million in public funds Garden State had been negotiating for the project, first planned as a full-service, 245-room hotel to be managed by Prime Hospitality.
"We just couldn't come to an agreement on the terms," said Mr. Mangin, noting that his company then scaled back the project to 173 rooms. But by the middle of this year Prime Hospitality bowed out of the project and Garden State reconfigured the hotel to its current scale and concept and joined forces with Hartz. The changes still must be approved by the city.
Andrew Merin, an executive director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage, added: "A hotel is key to the development of Jersey City's waterfront into a business district and to its continued growth."
"We need a hotel as an asset on the waterfront," said Robert Cotter, Jersey City's planning director. "It's long overdue."

HEADLINE: FROM THE DESK OF;
How to Whip the Bullies On the Mortgage Playground

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor in the Money & Business section.

 BODY:
I AM sad to see that mortgage rates have moved below 8 percent again. That will likely tempt many people to buy their first homes or to refinance their existing mortgages.
Oh, the horror, the horror. 
 There are few experiences as ugly as applying for a mortgage. Asking to borrow money from complete strangers can be painful and frustrating. After all, we really can't imagine being able to ever repay such a huge amount. This makes us ask for the loan with our heads lowered, our hats in our hands, hoping no one will see what frauds we are. Mortgage bankers must look down at us from their desks in the same way Ebenezer Scrooge gazed at Bob Cratchit, wondering if we're trying to pick their pockets.
Oh, how I dislike asking them for money. So I have been almost apologetic when I've applied for a mortgage. Maybe it's the "I'm sorry" I write on top of the application that makes my lenders so nervous.
I asked for my most recent mortgage three years ago. It was for $200,000 for a house in Connecticut. It was twice as much money as I had ever borrowed before. I was scared, and I think my lenders sensed this. They could smell my weakness. So they began to treat me as if the name on my application read "John Dillinger."
They didn't believe anything I said. How in heaven's name, they seemed to be asking, can someone like me afford a mortgage like this? So they demanded more and more reassurances. And no matter how much information I gave them about myself and my wife, Christine, they wanted more, more, more -- just like children.
They asked if I had any assets. I said yes, and I listed them. They called back. Prove it, they said. I sent them copies of stock certificates and bank statements. Again they called. Give us more proof, they demanded. I sent more copies.
They called again, and the conversation went something like this:
They asked, "Are you sure that you sent us the copies?"
"Are you blind?" I said.
"We want to be careful," they said.
"We want our money," I said.
They asked for pay stubs from my job. I said I was moving and was between jobs; indeed, that was why I was buying a house in the first place. "Won't the last stubs from my old job be O.K.?" I asked.
"But you don't have that job anymore."
"Right. I'm moving to start a new job."
"So give us those pay stubs."
"But the job hasn't started yet."
By then, I was almost breaking into sobs.
If Joseph Heller had written "Catch-22" in the 90's, it would have been about mortgage bankers.
They finally gave in and accepted my old pay stubs. Then, a day before my mortgage commitment was to end, they called again. "Where are your pay stubs?" they asked.
"In your file labeled John Dillinger," I said.
"No, your new pay stubs."
"Didn't we already work this out?"
"Apparently not. We need them."
"Don't hold your breath."
"Nor should you."
Then they demanded my wife's pay stubs. We calmly explained that her new job wouldn't start until a few days before we closed on the house.
"So what?" they asked. "We want them."
"The stubs don't exist," I said, pleading.
They wouldn't let up. It was as if they were jumping up and down, clenching their little fists and screaming, "We want them, we want them, we want them!"
So we did the adult thing and called a high-powered lawyer (my sister-in-law) to write a firm letter to one of their high-powered lawyers (my sister-in-law's friend) explaining how childish they were being. Now that we knew someone on the inside, we figured, the road would be smooth.
What we got was this: Although the lender had a letter from my wife's employer saying that, yes, they had hired her and, yes, they would be paying her, too, it wanted another letter, this one promising, with sugar on top, that she really had the job, no fibbing. "So there," they seemed to be saying, probably sticking out their tongues.
I BET negotiating with kidnappers is easier. We eventually got the mortgage, but I promise it's my last. I will never move out of this house, and I happily paid four points on that loan to get the lowest interest rate possible: 5.65 percent. The bankers can send me all the "Refinance Now!" junk mail they want. I am untouchable.
But my mortgage experience has left me with an insight. Now, whenever I see my children throw a tantrum because they can't get their way, I think, "There goes a future mortgage banker."

HEADLINE: HEALTH;
I'm (Sniffle) Fine (Cough). Let's Get to Work (Achoo!).

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
"Headache," said Diane Bobal, enumerating her symptoms. "Congestion. Achiness. Horrible stuff. It went into my inner ear and I had to take steroids.
Nevertheless Ms. Bobal, assistant to the president of Beacon Looms in Teaneck, has taken only one day off in three weeks of the flu. Her reason? "I'm a lunatic who can't stay home and watch TV." After a single morning of staying in bed while Sally Jesse Raphael interrogated "big beautiful women who are really men" she fled back to the office. There, she can commiserate with her secretary, who is working despite a diagnosed case of bronchitis and ample paid sick days. 
 "Stoic is the way we go," Ms. Bobal said, of the ethos practiced by Beacon's 500 employees.
Stoic is the way that many workers -- from lawyers to plumbers to directory assistance operators -- are going. In hoarse whispers, these workers talk about their aching joints and fever -- but still, they're making it into work. Yes, they know they should stay home and rest and drink fluids and refrain from spreading their germs around. They even exhort one another to follow that advice. But they just can't bring themselves to follow it. Their reasoning has many strands -- some pleasant, like a desire for the camaraderie of fellow workers; others dark, like the immediate fear of losing a few day's wages and the long-term fear of losing the job.
"If you got a bill to pay, you got to pay it," said Alfredo Santiago, a dispatcher at BFI Waste Systems in Fairfield, which collects and disposes of industrial waste. "Most of our guys, even the sick ones, are working."
But it's not just laborers who have used up all their sick days who struggle in to work. Many white-collar workers do too, however much co-workers or even bosses urge them not to.
"I've got it," said Lily Schmitz, a legal secretary at McDonough Korn & Eichhorn in Springfield, referring to an uncategorized but undeniable illness, the course of which she could track precisely: "Wednesday, a little phlegm, a little tickle. Thursday, coughing like crazy. Achy, Friday. At night, a temperature, hot flashes, chills."
Having paused several times during this recitation to cough, she paused again when asked why she didn't take advantage of her paid sick days. "I don't know," she said. "They all yell at me" to go home. "But I like to downplay when I'm sick."
An unofficial survey of workers indicated that many, like Ms. Schmitz, try to ignore their illnesses. Unfortunately, even illnesses deprived of attention tend to flourish. New Jersey's rate of influenza and other respiratory illnesses is high this year, though not epidemic -- a two on a scale of three, according to statistics from the State Department of Health based on reports from school districts. In some counties, including Passaic and Burlington, illness is especially widespread. In others, like Hudson and Cape May, it's almost nonexistent, which could indicate either a miraculous blossoming of good health or officials who have neglected to report school absences.
A popular image of a flu sufferer is this: a wan person propped against pillows and nestled beneath blankets, within reach of a bedside table loaded with aspirin bottles, tissue boxes and glasses of flat ginger ale, whiling away the day watching soaps and reading paperback mysteries. But this picture has become as dated as "The Loretta Young Show" and "Queen for a Day," daytime television programs that entertained flu sufferers of the 50's.
An uncertain economy and the all-pervasive threat of being downsized -- which people of the 50's called being fired -- have destroyed these lovely silver linings of illness. In the 90's, sick people go to work.
"If you're comatose with a fever, you stay home," said Margot Sage-El, explaining the sick-leave policy of Watchung Booksellers in Montclair, which she owns with a partner. "If you're at the relaxing-at-home-with-tea stage, you come in."
Certainly some ailing employees do still stay home, secure in the knowledge that they're pulling in sick pay. And firefighters and police officers who remain healthy are equally secure knowing they can eventually cash in unused sick days -- accumulating thousands of dollars over a 30-year career. But many employees say they were raised to soldier through chills and coughs. "I'm from the shake-it-off-and-go-on, don't-buckle-under school," said Judy Bell, a bookkeeper at McDonough Korn & Eichhorn, at work despite those symptoms.
A more common -- and pragmatic -- reason to work through an illness is this: money.
For weeks, the four plumbers at Drain Doctor in Hackensack have been sick, one after another, or several at once. Considering their working conditions, this seems unavoidable. "Every other house we go to, people have flu, sniffles, colds," said Gene Puntasecca, the company's president. But because they work on commission, a day home sick means a day without wages -- and a day when impatient customers might just take their business to one of the other 800 plumbers available to the 800,000 residents of Bergen County. So the incentives to continue to unstop pipes despite a sore throat are compelling.
But even workers with paid sick time are frequently chary of taking it.
"There's an enormous amount of intimidation with downsizing," said Clayton Alderfer, a professor at Rutgers University Graduate School of Psychology. "Whatever people say, underneath is terror."
If terror doesn't do it, there is guilt at the idea of forcing fellow workers to pick up one's duties. Or fear of what will happen if fellow workers do end up doing their jobs -- which can be particularly acute in the case of people who are convinced that the place will fall apart without them.
Of course, there are always the lucky companies, the workplaces where employees, for no apparent reason, are in good health -- where nobody coughs uncontrollably and all have retained the ability to inhale through their nostrils. The bosses of these companies are all too aware of what's going on outside their corporate halls -- the ubiquitous clogged sinuses, the laryngitis broken by guttural coughing spells, the snappishness resulting from lingering headaches and low-grade fevers.
Some bosses are humbly grateful, readily admitting that their good fortune could disappear at any moment.
"We're not cocky," said Tim Ireland of Bell Atlantic New Jersey, where few of the 15,000 telephone operators have called in sick. "We know next week it might be our turn."
But other bosses flaunt it, strutting and bragging about their luck, daring the flu germs to go ahead -- make their day.
"We don't let our people get the flu," said Ted Buyer, executive vice president of S.K. Realty and Development Corporation in Fairfield. "We only hire people with great pedigrees. People who come here know they can't get sick. If you'd like to come here and work for us, we'll guarantee you won't get the flu, too."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOOKING BACK, LOOKING AHEAD -- TIMES SQUARE;
After Years of Sleaze and Decay, the Great White Way 'Suddenly' Looked White Hot

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
This was the year the glare of the Great White Way became blinding. As the Walt Disney Company and other purveyors of wholesome entertainment rushed in for a chunk of the new Times Square, the once-pervasive signs of sleaze nearly disappeared. Once a textbook case for urban decay, Times Square has become a paradigm of inner-city renewal.
"I'm afraid the haughty, bawdy Times Square is a thing of the past," said Frederic Papert, president of the 42d Street Development Corporation. 
 For Gretchen Dykstra, who heads the Times Square Business Improvement District, 1996 was a year for vindication. "I think we turned the corner and finally put the cynics to bed," said Ms. Dykstra, who has been plotting Times Square's rebirth for nearly a decade. "We are no longer New York's red light district."
Since 1993, crime has plummeted 47 percent, the number of adult entertainment businesses has dropped from 47 to 13, and camera-toting tourists have replaced the pimps, hucksters and three-card monte dealers on the neighborhood's sidewalks. Area hotels boast the highest occupancy rates in the city, the Virgin Megastore is reportedly grossing more than double its initial projections, and more than three dozen movie screens are planned for 42d Street.
"Times Square has become like a scene from the musical '42d Street' where Dick Powell tells Ruby Keeler to go out there and become a star," said Charles Millard, chairman of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "Who would have thought a crime-ridden, has-been neighborhood would come back a glimmering tourist attraction?"
While the state's powers of condemnation cleared away most of the area's porn theaters and peep shows, it was the arrival of Disney that helped lure such entertainment giants as Madame Tussaud and AMC Entertainment, which will soon break ground on a 25-screen multiplex on 42d Street. Livent, a Toronto-based company, is busily carving a 1,839-seat theater within the old Apollo and Lyric Theaters, and Warner Brothers will open a retail store at the base of 1 Times Square sometime next year.
In another sign of the area's white-hot allure, a French bank last month beat out a slew of bidders by paying $31 million for a dilapidated building at the corner of 47th Street and Broadway.
"A few years ago, I couldn't interest anyone in Times Square," said C. Bradley Mendelson, a broker with Edward S. Gordon company, who led Planet Hollywood International to 45,000 square feet of space in the Paramount Building at 43d Street and Broadway. He said his biggest problem was finding anything at the heart of Times Square. "I have lists of big clients looking, but there's nothing out there," he said.
But not everyone is celebrating the corporate triumph. Mr. Papert, one of the earliest boosters of a revived 42d Street, mourns the loss of what he calls the area's eclectic, spontaneous character. "To me, New York is seltzer, not orange juice," he said. "There are already more than enough neon Mickey Mouses on 42d Street." ANDREW JACOBS

HEADLINE: Cars That Made the Heart Race in '96;
A Preference for Sport Over the Sport Utility

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
PEOPLE who drive a lot of new cars may disagree about the merits of a particular model -- or about the future of the automobile, for that matter. But they are nearly unanimous on this: The new vehicles sold in America have never been better.
While critics of the auto industry argue that much more progress can be made on safety, durability and fuel efficiency -- and even that the internal-combustion engine should be retired -- there is little doubt that today's cars are far superior in all respects to their predecessors of just a decade ago. Fresh designs use space more effectively. Computer controls make engines start easier and run smoother. Electronic transmissions shift gears for optimum power and economy. Air bags, side-impact beams and "crumple zones" -- not to mention antilock brakes and traction controls -- have helped to reduce fatalities and serious injuries. More thought goes into the controls and more care goes into the way the pieces are assembled. 
 All of these improvements have a price, of course. Only a handful of bare-bones models can be had for less than five figures, and the average price of a new car is in the range of $20,000. On the positive side, that $20,000 Ford Taurus is likely to last far longer and require much less maintenance than the $2,000 Ford Tudor that your parents or grandparents might have driven in the years after World War II. And although the manufacturers still turn out lemons, there seem to be far fewer of them these days.
With cars becoming better, they are also becoming more similar. Without looking at the nameplates, it can be hard to tell one subcompact coupe (or sport utility vehicle, or Japanese luxury sedan) from another.
Yet some models remain memorable after just a few days, or even a few hours, behind the wheel. As the year closes, four contributors to this page were asked to choose the cars they drove in 1996 that stood out from the pack.
Their selections do not attempt to represent a list of the best or most significant vehicles of the year, though in many cases it would be hard to argue otherwise. The choices obviously reflect personal styles and preferences, but in each case the vehicles listed made an impression above and beyond many others.
NO doubt about it: this was the year of the sport utility. And Detroit is betting heavily that 1997 will demand more of the same, what with all those 40-somethings itching to trade in their oh-so-suburban, child-seat-equipped mini-vans for something that might be more suitable for the Dakar-to-Timbuktu off-road rally.
This is bad news for aficionados of real cars -- I count myself among them -- who get their kicks from crisp acceleration, tight handling and brakes that never say never. For even at their best, sport utes are just trucks with better-sprung seats and a great view of the golden arches.
 Still, there's hope. While many Americans yearn for an Explorer or a Tahoe with all the trimmings, the auto companies are hedging their bets with some very nice and -- surprise! -- often affordable cars for those of us who dream of Porsches and Ferraris. Some possibilities:
 
MITSUBISHI 3000GT VR4 With its garish looks and gadgets galore, the 3000GT belongs on one of Aaron Spelling's prime-time soap operas. But don't hold the Mitsubishi's "Baywatch" curves and bulges against it. It is among the last of the barely affordable Japanese sports cars, and it can run with German and Italian predators that cost twice as much. Twin turbo-chargers push it to 60 in considerably less than 6 seconds. Four-wheel drive, giant disk brakes and an unflappable suspension make all that power relatively easy to handle. It is the wondercar for Everyman with $45,000 to spend.
 
HONDA CIVIC HX The Civic has always been a cut above the competition in subcompact land. This Civic is a cut above the others, thanks to a transmission that combines the best of stick shifts and automatics. Honda's "continuously variable" transmission offers an infinite set of gear ratios between very low and very high, along with a computer that chooses the right one to suit road conditions and the demands of the driver. Maybe someday all cars destined to run in heavy traffic will come equipped with CVT's. For now, it is available only on this peppy if somewhat austere $14,000 coupe.
 
NISSAN 200SX SE-R As symbols of unfettered youth, sporty coupes have given way to mini-sport utilities like the Toyota RAV4. Unfettered youths who also enjoy serious driving would do well to buck the trend with this very polished, very practical runabout. A quiet ride, a usable back seat, a good sound system and a power sunroof make it a coupe of choice for long commutes. The fast-revving 140-horsepower engine (borrowed from the Infiniti G20), the silky five-speed manual transmission and the exceptionally stable rear suspension (from the 200SX's big brother, the Maxima) make it a blast to toss around.

An Emotional Rescue From More of the Same

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

PEOPLE who drive a lot of new cars may disagree about the merits of a particular model -- or about the future of the automobile, for that matter. But they are nearly unanimous on this: The new vehicles sold in America have never been better.

Their selections do not attempt to represent a list of the best or most significant vehicles of the year, though in many cases it would be hard to argue otherwise. The choices obviously reflect personal styles and preferences, but in each case the vehicles listed made an impression above and beyond many others.
SINCE nearly any modern car will take you from Point A to Point B reliably and comfortably, I am more interested in the manner in which I travel. What emotions does the car or truck evoke along the way? How much did it make me smile? How does it distinguish itself from its competition?
I gave a rave review to the '97 Toyota Camry, which provides solid, comfortable, reliable transportation at a reasonable price. But the Camry has never been a car that knocks you over with exciting styling or exhilirating performance, and it doesn't quite make the cut of my favorite cars of the year. I also really liked the big Ford Expedition, which clearly improves on its General Motors' competitors, the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon.
 But the five most memorable vehicles I drove this year are those that follow. Their prices range from the mid-teens to the $70,000 range, but all provide an emotional connection between car and driver.
 
BMW 528i While I never connected emotionally with BMW's Z3 roadster, the '97 5-Series enchanted me the moment I laid eyes on it at the Frankfurt Auto Show. This would be the car I would select for my daily transportation, if I had the money. The 5-Series has handsome styling, a comfortable interior with all of the niceties of the expensive 7-Series, and innovative safety features. Yet it truly stirs the passions with its speed, strong body structure and road-gripping capability.
 
JAGUAR XK8 Jaguar's first new sports car in 21 years, the XK8 is a raving beauty that properly respects the illustrious past of its precedessors. Of any car I've driven, the XK8's interior is the most sumptuous and distinctive, but there are great things going on beneath the surface, too, including Jaguar's first V8 engine, a smooth and spirited performer.

MERCEDES-BENZ SLK230 Mercedes-Benz clearly recognizes that it is not enough to engineer and build great cars with innovative safety features. It must make drivers feel something. The '97 SLK stirs the emotions with its looks and performance, down to touches that evoke the SL roadsters of the 50's and 60's, like the shape of the body and the chrome encircling the gauges.
 
PONTIAC GRAND PRIX GTP With this car, G.M. rekindles fond memories of great American driving machines in an up-to-date, affordable package. With its wide stance and aggressive styling, the Grand Prix stands out from the crowd, and it is wildly fun to drive. I couldn't resist cranking up "Little GTO" on the stereo and squealing the tires.
 
 
TOYOTA RAV4 Toyota has done what other auto makers have long promised -- delivered a small, affordable, car-based sport-utility vehicle aimed at young drivers on tight budgets. The RAV4 carves out a new market niche, and it offers more smiles per mile than just about anything on the road. MICHELLE KREBS

HEADLINE: Cars That Made the Heart Race in '96;
Reborn, Audi Joins A German Renaissance

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB 

 BODY:
PEOPLE who drive a lot of new cars may disagree about the merits of a particular model -- or about the future of the automobile, for that matter. But they are nearly unanimous on this: The new vehicles sold in America have never been better.
While critics of the auto industry argue that much more progress can be made on safety, durability and fuel efficiency -- and even that the internal-combustion engine should be retired -- there is little doubt that today's cars are far superior in all respects to their predecessors of just a decade ago. Fresh designs use space more effectively. Computer controls make engines start easier and run smoother. Electronic transmissions shift gears for optimum power and economy. Air bags, side-impact beams and "crumple zones" -- not to mention antilock brakes and traction controls -- have helped to reduce fatalities and serious injuries. More thought goes into the controls and more care goes into the way the pieces are assembled. 
 All of these improvements have a price, of course. Only a handful of bare-bones models can be had for less than five figures, and the average price of a new car is in the range of $20,000. On the positive side, that $20,000 Ford Taurus is likely to last far longer and require much less maintenance than the $2,000 Ford Tudor that your parents or grandparents might have driven in the years after World War II. And although the manufacturers still turn out lemons, there seem to be far fewer of them these days.
With cars becoming better, they are also becoming more similar. Without looking at the nameplates, it can be hard to tell one subcompact coupe (or sport utility vehicle, or Japanese luxury sedan) from another.
Yet some models remain memorable after just a few days, or even a few hours, behind the wheel. As the year closes, four contributors to this page were asked to choose the cars they drove in 1996 that stood out from the pack.
Their selections do not attempt to represent a list of the best or most significant vehicles of the year, though in many cases it would be hard to argue otherwise. The choices obviously reflect personal styles and preferences, but in each case the vehicles listed made an impression above and beyond many others.
WHAT may be most remarkable about an industry that builds Cadillacs in Germany, BMW's in Dixie and right-hand-drive Jeeps for Japan is how much national identity still comes with each car.
The Jaguar XK8 could only be British, even if Ford's name is on the factory door. Honda Civics that roll off the line in Ohio are paragons of Japanese value. And what represents American aspirations better than postmodern Conestogas like the Chevy Suburban?
 But the Germans are now the ones to watch. After getting a shock from Japanese upstarts like Lexus and Infiniti, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have fought back with exciting new models, advanced technology and a lid on prices -- not to mention cup holders and gizmos.
And then there's Audi: Recently among the living dead, Volkswagen's luxury unit has gotten a jolt from two highly competent new models. Both are winners.

AUDI A8 4.2 QUATTRO An aluminum sculpture on wheels, the A8 is a lighter-weight, lighter-priced, lighter-on-its-feet alternative to the Mercedes S-Class and BMW 7-Series. It is also a technological tour de force. An innovative "space frame" borrows from aerospace design and relies on 40 new patents and 7 new aluminum alloys. The body panels resist dents better than steel. There are six air bags and side-impact beams that lock into the door sills. And there is Audi's wonderful Quattro system, which makes this $70,000 cruiser the only all-wheel-drive choice among premium luxury cars.
 
AUDI A4 If I were shopping for a car -- thankfully, I'm not -- the A8 is sized and priced too big to tempt me. But I caught a bad case of new-car fever from the A4 Quattro. A jewel box of a sedan, the compact A4 is stylishly sophisticated without pretension or adornment. And it is lithe, agile and confidence-inspiring. Comfortable for two, it can cozily accommodate four, and you can spend hours at the wheel without a trace of fatigue.
 
FORD CONTOUR GL Some great cars can be had for $30,000, and quite good ones for $20,000, but the pickings are slimmer in the mid-teens. So how can it be that about $15,000 -- after rebate and haggling -- will buy what is perhaps the best-handling American sedan ever made? Though no feast for the eyes, the most bare-bones Contour is a treat at the wheel, with a lively dual-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine, a smooth five-speed manual gearbox and a firm, corner-flattening suspension. The radio is a case study in bad design and the workmanship of my test car was disturbing, but with innards this good, all else can be forgiven.

HONDA PRELUDE Outgunned in macho appeal by sport utility vehicles, a lot of sporty coupes are biting the dust. So Honda has taken its Prelude back to basics, paring down the '97 to appeal to hard-core enthusiasts who want minimum frills and maximum thrills. This is a remarkably fine-handling front-wheel-drive car, with a suspension that tames every corner and forgives the driver for any misjudgments. JAMES G. COBB

Some Spots for Detroit On the Shopping List

Their selections do not attempt to represent a list of the best or most significant vehicles of the year, though in many cases it would be hard to argue otherwise. The choices obviously reflect personal styles and preferences, but in each case the vehicles listed made an impression above and beyond many others.
WE were headed for the mall for some last-minute shopping, my friend Jim and I, when he asked what I thought of this latest test car, a dark cherry Chevrolet Malibu.
"Ha," I said with a snort. "You heard the seat-belt chime when we got in? Loudest and most annoying ever. And there's cold air coming through where the door handle is -- feel it?
"The brakes squeal. And then there's this ashtray. The opening's so small that you're bound to miss and burn the plastic on the dashboard."
Jim nodded. "You always seem to have trouble with ashtrays," he said. "But you wouldn't buy one of these, huh?"
Well, no. The Malibu nameplate may have returned to Chevrolet's midsize menu, but it won't ever be my entree, even if General Motors does succeed in its plan to make this bland family sedan the best-selling vehicle in its lineup.
 
ACURA NSX Truth to tell, this $85,000 Japanese sports car is what I lust for. Its sideways V6, mounted behind the two seats, has the best snarl I've ever heard, and the performance is equally ripping, matched only by the gorgeous lines.

PONTIAC GRAND PRIX GTP To be fair, there are some great offerings from G.M. and the rest of Detroit, and almost no domestic car comes close to the Acura's extravagant price tag. The '97 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP, at about $22,000, is a hot-footed bargain. The all-new GTP has a heads-up display that ought to be on every automobile. The system projects the speed and other vital information onto the windshield, where you can absorb it without taking your eyes off the road. And it has a supercharged V6 that puts out 240 horsepower, a sport suspension that makes it fun to drive, and enough room for the entire family.
 
MERCURY GRAND MARQUIS Still, if I wanted a grand sedan, I'd probably plunk my thousands down on this. I am, I guess, a fuddy-duddy, but I like rear-drive cars of the old school, and the V8-powered Merc is a baby Lincoln, a four-door with a comely face, quiet pizazz and a ride that rivals a Rolls. One thing I'd do if I bought one, though: I'd put on two-tone paint and dress it with whitewalls.
 
CHRYSLER SEBRING CONVERTIBLE I'm not really in the market for a full-size four-door, and the car I actually might buy next is this four-seat ragtop. It shares little with its like-named coupe brethren, since it uses a different platform and is built from the ground up for wind in the hair. With a sticker of about $24,000, the Sebring convertible represents attainable fun, and a 168-horsepower V6 lets it perform. But what really turns me on is the car's profile, a voluptuous cab-forward wedge on neat five-spoke aluminum wheels. I want one, and I don't even care about the ashtray. MARSHALL SCHUON

HEADLINE: Cities Will Bear Brunt of Welfare Law Fallout

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Food Stamps for the Unemployed," your Dec. 26 editorial on the Federal welfare law's provision prohibiting able-bodied, childless adults from collecting food stamps unless they work at least 20 hours a week, asks the right question about jobs: "What happens if counties fail to provide the tens of thousands of slots that will be needed?" The answer is an upsurge of calls to 911. 
 Federal and state disinvestment in the nation's poorest families will impose harsh and expensive burdens on cities and towns, the providers of last resort and the home of almost every jobless American.
President Clinton's signature on the welfare bill set in motion fundamental changes affecting hundreds of thousands of families and children. It also had significant consequences for city leaders. Even though few cities have direct responsibility for welfare services and benefits, these changes are likely to affect municipal credit ratings, services and revenues.
For cities and towns, especially those that have had disproportionate numbers eligible for assistance, less income for families translates into sharply reduced business and empty rental buildings, resulting in losses to the property tax rolls.
Most cities have neither the experience nor the resources for the responsibilities that are coming their way by default. There is more passing of the burden here than reform, and that burden will stop at the last level of government serving citizens.
President Clinton has said that the welfare reform bill as enacted into law should be modified before its full implementation.
We agree and ask to have a seat at the table when the changes are considered.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOOKING BACK, LOOKING AHEAD -- GRASS-ROOTS BROOKLYNPLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD;
A Ripple of Neighborhood Crusades on Issues of All Kinds

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
Across Brooklyn over the last year, battles for change and preservation rippled through the borough from Red Hook to Dead Horse Bay, in strikingly grass-roots fashion.
The neighborhood crusades were large and small, the issues profound and esthetic. There were victories and defeats and, for some, nebulous results. But whatever the outcome of the missions each community undertook, however tiny or tremendous the demands, people were moved to act. 
 In Red Hook, the people of a troubled waterfront neighborhood created and fought for a far-reaching plan for urban renewal. In East New York, residents concerned about pollution went after an energy company and stopped it from building a wood-burning incinerator. In Bay Ridge, residents thwarted a plan to build an eight-screen movie theater; in Boerum Hill, residents stopped McDonald's from building a drive-through restaurant and in Red Hook, residents persuaded the Independence Savings Bank to open what would be the neighborhood's first bank branch in years.
In Bushwick, a nun organized parents and took on a school district plagued by corruption and low achievement. At the Barren Island Marina, off southern Flatbush Avenue on Dead Horse Bay, a group of boat owners took on the Federal Government and persuaded the United States Department of the Interior to rescind its plan to close the marina.
On the quality-of-life front, a formidable gadfly in Bensonhurst named Rocco Miele successfully campaigned against fliers on lampposts and "grand opening" banners on 86th Street shops. And seven civic groups from four Brooklyn neighborhoods banded together to protest overflow traffic from the Gowanus Expressway onto local streets, persuading the State Department of Transportation to conduct a study of the air quality and noise levels in the area.
"I see a revival of activism in Brooklyn," said Charles Barron, chairman of East New York United Front, the community group that fought the incinerator. "For some, I think it may be that they had hit rock bottom. People come together because they have to, that's coming together out of desperation. Then they come together out of inspiration. Once we had our victory, we were inspired."
Last summer, Mr. Barron's group hired a lawyer and found that a proposal by the Atlas Bio-Energy Corporation to build a wood-burning incinerator to generate electricity was illegal. Responding to community opposition, Atlas Bio-Energy proposed building a power generator that would run on natural gas, but ultimately departed from East New York in the face of continued pressure from Mr. Barron's group.
Similarly encouraged by victory was William H. Woodroffe, the owner of a 32-foot sloop who, along with about 200 other boat owners, docks at the Barren Island Marina. After the marina's operator was convicted of tax fraud, the United States National Parks Service, which operates the marina, had declared it too expensive to run. But the Barren Island Boatowners Association, well aware that affordable mooring space is in short supply, would not give up their vessels that easily. "In the beginning people said, 'Forget it. You can't fight City Hall, let alone the Federal Government,' " Mr. Woodroffe said last week. "But we did and people were amazed."
Others were not so victorious. In Sunset Park, a group of Chinese-American church leaders, upset at the establishment of an adult-business zone in their neighborhood, plotted against the opening of a strip club, Spectrum Disco, but in the end did not act in time to stop its opening. In Sheepshead Bay, residents lost their battle to convince the city that Loehmann's Plaza, a large shopping complex, was in flagrant violation of city zoning laws.
The most ambitious grass-roots effort, the urban renewal plan in Red Hook, which has been riven by opposition and bitter debate, remains unresolved. The plan envisions hundreds of units of new housing, a new high school and a revitalized waterfront. It proposes rezoning part of Red Hook from manufacturing to residential and commercial use.
"We ended up with a grandiose industrial wasteland," said John McGettrick, chairman of the Red Hook Civic Association, which has fought for the plan. But local business leaders opposeit, saying it will drive out industry. The City Council approved a slightly watered-down version of the plan in September, but the plan cannot go forward until the Council rezones Red Hook, an issue it is expected to take up sometime in 1997.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOOKING BACK, LOOKING AHEAD -- HARLEM;
On 125th Street, Upbeat Era Is No Sure Thing

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON 

 BODY:
Optimism prevailed this year as streetscape-transforming projects were announced for 125th Street, Harlem's main crosstown commercial thoroughfare. The most ambitious is the $56 million Harlem U.S.A. entertainment and shopping complex, planned for the south side of 125th Street between St. Nicholas Avenue and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. A Cineplex Odeon movie theater, a skating rink, an HMV record store, a Disney Store and a Gap are planned for the 275,000-square-foot glass-enclosed structure.
Also this year, the popular Fairway market in West Harlem survived a zoning challenge, and the developers of the Pathmark supermarket planned for East Harlem amassed financing, completed its design and began searching for a general contractor. 
 Still, it would not be the first time, skeptics say, that grand development plans had been heralded for Harlem, only to languish and disappoint. The difference this time, say some who have been working on Harlem's economic development for years, is that concrete financing exists for these projects, in no small part because in 1996 the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation, which has $300 million in Federal, state and city money to dispense, finally got off the ground. In the first round of applications, the corporation awarded low-interest loans and grants to 10 businesses and nonprofit job-training groups. A fresh batch of applications is due for consideration on Jan. 10.
Harlem residents were hard pressed to think of a time when there were more projects in the pipeline.
"This was the year when many seeds were planted," said Barbara Askins, president of the 125th Street Business Improvement District. "In the next year, hopefully they will be cultivated."
If all goes according to plan, some of them may even begin to sprout. Harlem U.S.A. is approximately 75 percent rented, according to Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum Realty, the exclusive leasing agents for the project. With financing nearly complete, including $11 million in empowerment zone money, Mr. Fox anticipated that construction might begin in the third quarter of 1997.
The Pathmark project should also begin construction in 1997, said Darren Walker, director of development and spokesman for the Abyssinian Development Corporation, co-developer of the $15 million project. "We anticipate being halfway through construction by this time next year," Mr. Walker said.
A little more than a year ago, Harlem was devastated when eight people were killed in a fire at Freddy's, a clothing store, after a racially charged lease dispute. But even that incident did not stem the momentum that appeared to be building.
"We've been getting calls from all over the country," said Mr. Fox, of New Spectrum. "There's a groundswell of interest among developers and commercial tenants in Harlem now." JANET ALLON

HEADLINE: Estate Tax Avoidance Didn't Increase Inequity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 22 front-page discussion of estate and gift taxation is remarkable for what it does not disclose. 
 You quote 1995 figures, but you do not report that in the third quarter this year the payment of Federal estate and gift taxes was at a record annual rate of $18.5 billion, up 20 percent from 1995. Including state and local levies, which totaled more than $23 billion, estate and gift tax payments were $41.8 billion, up 11 percent from the prior year.
Wealthy Americans may not be paying as much in estate taxes as some would like, but they are not rushing away from taxes.
You use the opinions of Prof. Edward N. Wolff to bolster your case that avoidance of estate taxes has made wealth distribution in the United States less equal.
Professor Wolff says there has been a sharp increase in inequality since the late 1970's. He wants a $40 billion annual tax on wealth to support programs that he believes would level the playing field.
However, by his own comprehensive measures of wealth, the share of assets owned by the richest Americans was about the same in the 1980's as in the 1950's and 1960's and much lower than in the 1920's.
The basic policy question is this: Should the United States, with a chronic shortfall in net saving and investment, sluggish productivity gains and limited improvement in real wages, tax investment assets to provide additional subsidies for consumption? Professor Wolff would presumably answer yes. I say no. If economic growth is the goal, there is a better case for eliminating estate taxes than for increasing them.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOOKING BACK, LOOKING AHEAD -- DOWNTOWN;
Hopes Are Moving East on 14th St.

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
As the Union Square area enjoyed a much-ballyhooed renaissance in recent years, East 14th Street remained the sorry stepsister, a bedraggled strip of low-end discounters and graffiti-scarred storefronts that has stubbornly resisted rejuvenation. But the street's fortunes are looking up these days, fueled in part by a growing real estate market and revised zoning rules that have increased its appeal to developers.
On the block bounded by Broadway and Fourth Avenue, Related Companies broke ground last month on a 22-story tower that will feature 230 apartments above a commercial base housing Virgin Records, Circuit City, the Sports Authority and a multiplex operated by United Artists. One block east, at the former site of Luchow's, New York University is constructing a new dormitory for 640 students. School officials are reportedly negotiating to purchase the nearby Palladium Theater and an adjacent parking lot for a new building that would house several hundred more students. 
 "I think we've finally broken the ice and demonstrated that there is a 14th Street east of Fourth Avenue," said Benjamin Fox, a partner with New Spectrum Realty. "If you put all these developments together, that's a lot of activity for a lonely street."
To many real estate industry experts, the eastward creep of Union Square's economic rebirth makes sense. The blocks surrounding the park, they say, are already saturated with new arrivals, including Petco, Barnes & Noble, Heartland Brewery and a Staples Express, which is under construction on Union Square West.
"Union Square itself has more than fulfilled everyone's expectations," said Robert B. Pauls, a real estate consultant who has worked in the area for two decades. "The only place left to go is east."
There remain, however, a few stumbling blocks. Con Edison, whose headquarters occupies the full block between Irving Place and Third Avenue, is uncertain whether to convert 20,000 square feet of ground-floor offices into commercial space. "That's a critical block," Mr. Pauls said. "So until things change, the north side of the street will essentially remain a solid brick wall."
On the northeast corner of Third Avenue and 14th Street sits another question mark: the empty Sahara Hotel. Once a crime-ridden single-room occupancy hotel, the Sahara's owners are awaiting a legal decision that could force them to sell the building. Already, a slew of potential suitors have indicated interest in the site, which under new zoning rules, would accommodate a 15-story building. ANDREW JACOBS

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN BUSINESS: The Battle for Your Dollar: Superstores and Gyms Take New York;
After the Vote: Superstors' Future

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON 

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS, it seems, are ambivalent about superstores. As shoppers, they often speak of the stores' convenience and selection, even as they tell of feeling guilty for betraying their local mom and pop shops, and the megastores that have opened in the city have tended to do well. But as neighborhood residents searching for peace and quiet and congestion-free streets, they usually try to make it as difficult as possible for the retailing behemoths to open near their homes.
Several years in the making, Mayor Giuliani's proposal to rezone some of the city's old manufacturing areas to make it easier for warehouse-style supermarkets and discount stores to open died earlier this month after negotiations with the City Council collapsed in acrimony. 
 In actual terms, the Mayor and the Council were not that far apart when they stopped talking. Mr. Giuliani's plan was to bring an estimated 57 megastores of up to 200,000 square feet to certain manufacturing districts. The Council offered a counterproposal that would have allowed 25 stores, each with a maximum of 125,000 square feet. The administration wanted to bump it up to 37 stores and 140,000 square feet.
The Council also wanted to bring hardware and toy stores, which have been exempt from the zoning rules, under the same regulatory code as all other superstores. As negotiations faltered, accusations flew.
And when the Council voted down the Mayor's proposal 47 to 1, Mr. Giuliani accused Council members of being too beholden to the food wholesalers and small-business interests who benefit from keeping the superstores out.
"In fact, both the Mayor and City Council members received a lot more money from the development community and advocates of the superstore proposal," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens, chairman of the zoning subcommittee. "If you follow the Mayor's logic, we should have been voting for it."
Despite the regulatory obstacles thrown in their path and even barring any zoning change, large retailers are still eyeing the five boroughs for locations and loopholes, and the superstores' invasion of the city is likely to continue, say retail brokers and specialists. "The superstores will take more of the multilevel spaces abandoned by banks at transportation hubs," said Faith Hope Consolo, senior managing director at Garrick-Aug Associates, pointing to the Kmart that opened recently in the old American Express headquarters on lower Broadway. "There are at least a dozen sites in lower Manhattan that could accommodate superstores. The customer base is there. It's just a matter of working out the logistics."
Around the time the superstore proposal went down in flames, a two-year fight over a 38,000-square-foot Toys "R" Us on the Upper East Side ended in defeat for the store. It was a glaring example of how superstores and neighborhoods often clash.
On the legislative front, the Council leadership says it intends to introduce its own superstore proposal in the first few weeks of the new year, but the issue has stirred up so much personal animosity that no one expects it to go anywhere. "I think a grand total of nothing will happen,' said Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff of the Upper East Side, who cast the lone vote in support of the Mayor's proposal. "And that's a shame."

Chart: "OPENINGS AND CLOSINGS: Familiar Names In New Guises"
New Yorkers hustled, planned and plotted to make a buck in 1996. Some businesses capitalized on the city's rebounding economy, while others found the going simply too rough and closed up shop. Here's a sampling:
 
OPENED THIS YEAR
RETAIL Stores more familiar to mall rats than city dwellers opened all around town: Kmart on Astor Place and in Herald Square, J. Crew in SoHo, Sears and Marshall's on Queens Boulevard.
RESTAURANTS Two Brooklyn restaurant institutions re-opened: Lundy's, a seafood house in the shadow of the few fishing boats that still dock in Sheepshead Bay, and Gage & Tollner, the gaslit landmark that drew politicians and Court Street lawyers for decades.
BANK Three years ago an electrical fire destroyed the headquarters of the Carver Savings Bank on 125th Street in Harlem. But it was only a glancing blow to the only black-owned savings bank in New York. In late February, Carver opened its new, four-story, $5 million home on 125th Street near Lenox Avenue.
VIDEO 125th Street also got a shot in the arm when Blockbuster Video moved into an area that residents had complained was a video wasteland. Blockbuster, the largest video renter in the world, was the first video chain to establish a presence in Harlem. About 1,500 people got membership cards in the first two weeks the store was open.

CLOSED THIS YEAR
BARBER SHOPS High-end hair salons flourished, but neighborhoods lost two of the last old-fashioned barber shops: the Broadway Barber Shop on the Upper West Side and Benny's Barber Shop in Midwood, Queens.
BOOK STORES Two neighborhood landmarks, Brentano's at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street, and Shakespeare & Company, at 81st Street and Broadway, closed. Both blamed competition from a nearby branch of Barnes & Noble.
RESTAURANTS Fans of sports, sportscasters and sports talk mourned the closing of Runyon's saloon on East 50th Street. And a fire and rent increase shut down Teachers Too, where West Siders had gone for countless burgers and beers.
CINEMA Slow business and old technology combined to close the four-screen Cineplex Odeon, which had operated in the Fulton Mall in downtown Brooklyn for five years.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
As U.S. Giants Soar, Foreign Ones May Be Bargains

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRUSH

 BODY:
WITH big price tags hanging off American stocks, investors may be tempted to look overseas for more economical equities. And that temptation may be the strongest with large foreign companies, because their American counterparts have been the leaders in the long-rising United States market.
Mutual funds are the most popular and practical way for Americans to gain exposure abroad. But many blue-chip foreign companies trade here as American depository receipts, giving investors who are interested in these large overseas corporations a realistic alternative to the funds. In fact, there are well over 1,500 A.D.R.'s -- certificates representing foreign shares -- trading here, and most of them represent large companies. 
 These foreign concerns, which are often multinationals, offer American investors the safety of blue chips as well as an underused way to globalize portfolios, said Edward Bousa, a senior portfolio manager at Putnam Investments. Even as Americans pursue the stocks of Coca-Cola and other home-grown giants precisely because of their global prospects, he said, they are overlooking these A.D.R.'s just because they are for foreign companies.
Right now, many blue-chip A.D.R.'s offer an additional benefit: low prices. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 22.9 percent so far this year, while the Dow Jones industrial average, which includes 30 huge corporations, is up 28.2 percent. Foreign stock exchanges have not performed as well; in local currency, for example, the German market is up 17.2 percent this year.
"If you can buy a German company that looks just like a U.S. company trading at a huge discount, even though it has good businesses and brand names, then why not?" Mr. Bousa said.
This perspective has led Mr. Bousa to add large foreign companies to three funds he manages -- the Equity Income fund, the George Putnam fund and the Balanced Retirement fund. One German stock he has been buying recently is Bayer A.G., the pharmaceutical and chemicals giant.
"This is a world-class company trading at much less than a world-class price," he said.
To compare stocks from different countries, Mr. Bousa uses the price-sales ratio, which divides an equity's price by the company's sales per share. He prefers this measure because national accounting differences can have a big impact on reported earnings, making it difficult to rely on a more common measure of cheapness, the price-earnings ratio.
By the price-sales measure, Bayer stock looks cheap. It trades for just 1.15 times sales, compared with 2.6 for the stock of Monsanto, an American company that earns roughly the same proportion of income from drugs and chemicals. Mr. Bousa also likes Bayer's new programs for management incentives, cost-cutting and global acquisitions.
Of course, investors in these overseas companies must still contend with foreign accounting rules as they try to interpret a company's numbers. They also need to understand foreign stock markets and economies, which can be a daunting task.
But because of the size of these companies, there is often more information about them than about smaller foreign concerns; by offering A.D.R.'s, many must also adhere to strict accounting and disclosure rules required by the exchange on which they are listed. And because most of them do business in many countries, their shareholders are somewhat -- though hardly entirely -- hedged against the currency risks of international investing.
When the dollar strengthens against the French franc, for instance, the value of an A.D.R. based in France will drop for the dollar-based investor. But if that company does business in the United States, the currency shift will also increase the value of the company's dollar-based earnings.
And many big foreign multinationals that trade as A.D.R.'s have such currency protection, because they do a lot of business here. Marks & Spenser, the British apparel company, owns Brooks Brothers, for instance, and just this fall British Telecommunications announced its $20 billion merger with MCI Communications.
Indeed, foreign multinationals often do as much business in the United States as do American multinationals.
Investing in one of the former "is a lot like buying a U.S. company," Mr. Bousa said. "These companies could just as easily be headquartered in the U.S., and nobody would know the difference."
The more similarities between foreign and domestic multinationals, the more weight an investor may give to a low stock price. Low cost is one reason Mr. Bousa likes Elf Aquitaine, the recently privatized French oil company. This A.D.R. sells for just 0.53 times sales, compared with 1.05 for Exxon. And while Elf never worked hard to contain costs when it was state-owned, Mr. Bousa said, it has now embarked "on a very serious cost-reduction program." The company is also very good at finding and extracting oil.
Neil George, the chief economist for Mark Twain Bank in St. Louis, sees Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, as another undervalued A.D.R. It trades at a price-sales ratio of 2.25, compared with 5.65 for Merck. Moreover, its upcoming merger with Sandoz A.G. will create a $27 billion company, Novartis, second in the industry only to Britain's Glaxo Wellcome. Mr. George says that combining the research and development teams of the two companies will help Novartis create better new products, and that its profits will improve with the planned spinoff of some chemical divisions.
As with most of the Swiss- and German-based A.D.R.'s, Ciba-Geigy should be helped in its bottom line by growing pressure at home for reductions in traditionally liberal benefits for workers, Mr. George continued. He also said cost-cutting should save Ciba-Geigy $1.5 billion over the next three years.
BASF, the German chemicals giant, also looks cheap from Mr. George's perch.
"Its earnings growth has been about double that of Du Pont during the last year," he said, "but it is selling at less than half the price-sales value." By that measure, BASF is trading at a ratio of 0.77, while Du Pont's is 1.47.
OF course, if earnings are to keep growing at BASF, the economic climate in Europe must improve. But many economists, including Mr. George, think economic growth will accelerate there.
Even if it doesn't, many of these blue-chip companies, as multinationals, have a hand in fast-growing economies.
Mr. George also likes the A.D.R.'s of the Swiss Bank Corporation, which carries a price-to-book ratio of 0.7, compared with 1.73 for a similar American company, J. P. Morgan. (Because banks have no sales, price-sales ratios cannot be used to evaluate their stocks.)
Swiss Bank's low price is not unjustified: "The bank is trading at a discount in part because there is a deep recession and banks are in a precarious situation," Mr. George said. But he also sees many hopeful signs.
For example, the Swiss central bank is expanding the money supply and lowering interest rates, which should spur the economy and reduce bankers' cost of borrowing money from creditors. And deregulation in Europe has led to more mergers and acquisitions, which has helped Swiss Bank's underwriting division, SBC Warburg.
The bank has also benefited from large deposits from people in countries like Germany and Denmark. These nations have strong currencies, and savers there are concerned that their money might lose value once it is linked to weaker European currencies by the planned monetary union.
Their worries may prove true, of course. But Mr. George thinks these savers might do better by just buying shares of the bank.

HEADLINE: Is New York Back?

 BODY:
YES. No. Maybe. This being New York, consensus is rare. But themes do come into focus when you listen to 27 New Yorkers, not all talking at once.
Few dispute that the city is getting better for those who were better off to begin with (especially wealthy, white residents), but not for others (blacks, immigrants and the poor). 
 Examples of racial and economic disparities roll off the lips:
Property values in the northeast Queens neighborhoods of Douglaston and Bayside soar; business stabilizes in Jackson Heights and picks up in the Bronx, but the economic recovery in Harlem is a much chancier proposition. Uptown, even established stores and restaurants complain that few banks are willing to lend the money they need to grow and hire more workers.
For the first time, though, financing for some Harlem businesses seems somewhat surer, thanks to the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation, with $300 million in Federal, state and city financing to spread around.
With the crime rate dropping -- in Mayor Giuliani's eyes nearly as fast as a World Trade Center elevator -- most people say they feel safer. And saner. More optimistic and energized, willing to take on the challenge of raising children in Canarsie, Cobble Hill or the Village, instead of fleeing to the suburbs.
Or is Manhattan becoming too much like a suburb -- with mall-like chain stores selling cookie-cutter merchandise in an environment sanitized for tourists?
In many neghborhoods the police are hailed as a revitalizing force. But blacks and Latinos often see them as the opposite -- as agents of brutality, not law-enforcement.
There is widespread agreement that the schools need fixing desperately -- and that parents, teachers, principals and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew are going to elbow each other trying to get the job done.
Homelessness is still seen as pervasive, and there is concern that road repairs -- although seemingly everywhere and always at rush hour -- are not keeping up with the damage wrought by cars, trucks, buses and weather. But the city has taken steps to make things happen. An emergency room doctor points to the strides made in medical training and reducing violence and accidents, while a preservationist applauds improved teamwork between public and private groups.
California is recognized as a strong competitor and gaining, in the eyes of some; nothing more than a cultureless crater for others, who couldn't wait to get back East, to get back to New York.

RACE, CLASS & MONEY
 
Angelo Falcon
Executive director, Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group.
New York is back, but it's back for the better off in the city. People with the good jobs who have the resources. For the other half, the people who are poor, and for the majority of blacks and Latinos, it's not. When they see it, there's a lot of resentment. It divides the city even more.
For every positive thing you can point to, there's a negative you can point to also. The question is, How do you bring the city back for everyone? You can see the cynicism in the Latino community. For example, crime is down, but police brutality is a big, big issue in our community.
In terms of the cachet of New York, of New York being seen as the social and cultural capital of the world, it's back. But all that is geared toward the well-to-do.
 
Rasheed Shabazz
Cabby for 22 years
No, it ain't back. Technically it's making advancements, but from a moral point of view the people are worse off. They're worse off mentally. Ten years ago when we came out on Christmas Day to work, we made money. For the last four or five years, Christmas was horrible. Maybe people are on the Internet with each other or maybe they're just not traveling.
 
Moises Perez
Executive director, Alianza Dominicana, the city's largest Dominican human services and community development agency.
There are parts of our community that are not back, for whom the prospects are bleak. By no stretch of the imagination can we say that New York is back for immigrants. They have a lot to be apprehensive about. The future looks bleak for many immigrants. It's not even the undocumented immigrants, but the legal immigrants that they're coming after now.
And when you consider that one and a half billion dollars have been pumped out of the education system in New York City, and there are a million minority children in that system, you cannot say New York is back. Those children are not faring terribly well, and that's something all New Yorkers have to be apprehensive about.
 
Douglas H. Lasdon
Executive director, Urban Justice Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.
Is New York back? I'd have to answer no. This is the age of materialism and the corporation, and the conditions right now resemble prerevolutionary France, with this grotesque overconsumption in the face of abject poverty. Every time I go to a soup kitchen, I see the result of our politics and our culture. I see longer lines than ever -- more people with even greater needs than I can remember, and I've been working with the homeless since 1981. Good things have happened. Our lawsuits have helped reduce the number of homeless in armory shelters from 800 to 200, on the grounds of fire safety violations and overcrowding. But I go back to the soup kitchens, I see the pain in their faces. We're in a sorry state.

Phase Two
One of the original "piecers" who spray-painted large murals on subway cars in the early 70's. His work is currently showing at the Martinez Gallery at 10th Avenue and 45th Street.
Is New York back? Depends on where you live. It ain't back uptown. The roads are rotting, there's garbage everywhere, the buildings are falling down. The schools are the worst around. We are losing a whole generation to negligence.
A lot of the things they're calling art in SoHo is wacked. It seems that tasteless, bland and corny is in. Art has become like basketball. Instead of love, it's done for the money. Big canvases with dots selling for $10,000! And to get it up in the galleries is all politicking.
People can say what they want about the so-called graffiti. Why the trains? Because they was there. Today, they're cleaning the subways, so the subway art's gone. So what? There are a lot of murals going on in the neighborhoods, but no one sees that.
Mr. and Mrs. Subway Rider see graffiti, and they think crime. Well these kids ain't no stick-up artists. But I don't like seeing scratch graffiti either. I don't know if it's because I'm older, but I like order. I like an entire piece untouched and calm, not people scribbling on each other, crazy everywhere. But that's a sign of the times. It's ugly, but it's a pretty innocuous outlet for bored and directionless kids with nothing to do. And what outlets there are are pacifying. For kids uptown they're given a ball and that's what they got to do. The programs have been cut out. There are no art classes. There's nothing to try for. If you don't know about Mars, then you don't dream about Mars.
 
Cyril Nishimoto
Director, Japanese-American Social Services Inc.
New York is back for the rich, but not for the poor, and especially not for immigrants. I'd say New York was going backwards. It has now become politically acceptable to be anti-immigrant, to make them scapegoats.
In March and April, the provisions of recent welfare and immigration reform are going to start hurting real people. If immigrants do not become citizens before that deadline, they could lose benefits. I have a client, an unemployed single Japanese woman with an 8-year-old son, who passed the citizenship exam in August but has no word yet on when she can be sworn in. She worries about losing her $550 a month in Supplemental Security Income benefits.
And if you've overstayed your visa, immigration reform means that if you leave the country, try to return and then are discovered, you could be banned for 3 years or even 10 years from entering the United States. The law is trying to discourage people from overstaying their visas, but it could have the effect of splitting up families.
 
Herbert Young
At 110 years old, Mr. Young is considered to be the oldest living New Yorker by the City Department for the Aging.
When I first came to New York, things were already looking bad. You saw men standing in the streets with no job, selling apples, nothing to do. Hoover promised a chicken in every pot. But when he got in, people didn't even have a pot to wash in. The good times started when Roosevelt got here. At least people had the hope that things was just around the corner. Me, I was lucky. I had work. I was a used-car mechanic for Pontiac. In those days, nobody was buying a new car. They were getting their old cars fixed, so I made a pretty steady income.
I liked the 30's. I used to come home with plenty of cash in my pockets and nobody would bother you. I would go out with the boys, have some fun, drink a bit and come home. If you couldn't make it home, somebody would make sure you got in your door, and your money would still be there in your pocket. You didn't even have to lock it behind you. I'd like to see you do that now.
New York is no good today, because if you look like you got something, you can't walk the streets. It changed about 1969. That's when dope came in, and the war, and riots. Since then, people don't care about nothing. They don't care for their homes, they don't sweep the walks, nothing. I plan to stay around for a while, but I don't walk around by myself.
 
CULTURE
 
Clay Felker
Founder, New York magazine
Wall Street has led the city's economy out of the doldrums, and New York has its old swagger back. It's a 'we're-the-capital-of-the-world-and-everything-else-is-a-colony' attitude. But the California colony, very possibly, will take the crown away from New York in terms of economic and political power.
New Yorkers are so self-centered, they don't really see what's going on. California is the biggest state with the most electoral votes. It leads the nation in trade and innovation like information and biotechnologies. New York's importance is diminishing as the U.S. now trades four times as much with Asia than with Europe. New York's fashion leadership in many ways has been surrendered to Levi Strauss and the Gap, both San Francisco-based companies. Only New Yorkers see New York as back.
 
Angelina Fiordellisi
Actress and co-owner, Cherry Lane Theater
Absolutely New York is back! There's an artistic renaissance going on here. It's why lots of artists, including me, have moved from Los Angeles to New York, for heart, soul and intellectual stimulation. It's always been my dream to start up an artists' colony, with a children's theater, with directing classes and acting workshops. I don't want to do it in L.A. -- it's so soul-less.
 
Lydia Wills
Literary agent
New York is where the book community is, and that's the way it has always been. There's no way you could be a good book agent in L.A. New York is the outgrowth of the literary community.
Right now there's a great youth culture in New York that has permeated the country. Television shows reflect it. Look at MTV cable, it all comes out of New York. Young New Yorkers are so much in fashion. Scouts are all over New York looking at books about them for inspiration for their movies. They are looking at the fashion, the culture, the Internet, the intellectual culture of young New Yorkers.
 
Gillian McCain
Poet and co-author with Legs McNeil of "Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk."
I moved to New York City 10 years ago because I wanted to live inside a Frank O'Hara poem, not a suburban shopping mall.
New York was unlike any place in America, and now it's becoming like every place in America. What was once an adult playground has been pasteurized and homogenized into a yuppie wasteland inhabited by sterile, corporate franchises like the Gap, K-Mart and Starbucks. Even Times Square has been bought by Disney. Personally, I'd rather live in a paragraph written by Jack Kerouac than a stage set for a G-rated cartoon.
Don't get me wrong. New York is still the best city in the world, but unless respect is paid to what made it unique in the first place -- dirt, chaos, filth and sleaze -- the only magic surrounding New York will be in memories conjured up by its name.
 
Kevin J. Farrelly
President, Bayside Hills Civic Association
In the neighborhoods of northeast Queens, signs of recovery abound. Property values are up, homeowners are investing heavily in improving their houses, and there is a demand for home sales driven by the many new immigrant groups seeking a more tranquil life and by those who grew up in places like Bayside and Douglaston and wish to raise their families there. Decreasing crime, improvements in the school system and a cleaner environment have made the neighborhoods competitive with suburban communities.
But if Mayor Giuliani persists in his anti-neighborhood policies, such as diminishing the role of community boards, weakening zoning restrictions and dismantling community policing, homeowners may seek refuge just a few miles away in the suburbs.
 
Nathaniel Harvey
Cook and owner, Pan-Pan Coffee House on Lenox Avenue and 135th St. in Harlem.
Harlem at one time was going downhill. All these buildings that you see that are boarded up out there weren't boarded up. But everything was taken out of Harlem and nothing put back in. But now you look around and you see all that construction, and you see Harlem's on the rise again. Another five years and you will really see a difference.
Help is a problem nowadays. When I was coming along, I was interested in the food business. I was eager to learn so I could be in charge. Very seldom you come across somebody like that. They just want a job. And I'll be honest with you, for a black man, when it comes to finances, it's a rough road to travel. We've been here 18 years, and the biggest loan we could get until last year was $25,000. Since then a few doors have opened, but it's rough.
I've lived in this neighborhood for 24 years. I've been pretty happy here. But if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't get stuck in New York City. Because unless you own the building, this rent will kill you. I'll be here maybe another five years. It's not that we're looking to run away -- because we do make a living-- but at this stage in the game, it shouldn't be as hard as it is.
 
Maria Torres
Associate director, the Point Community Development Corporation in the South Bronx.
The Bronx is back. Retailers are coming back, business is good and crime is down in these parts. Housing is looking good too. The Bronx is being rebuilt and it's bringing back families. You're even seeing some places with lawns. It probably started in the mid-80's. You have the people who decided they weren't going to leave to keep it strong. The city planning efforts, the renovations and the nonprofits have all helped.
 
Daniel Karatzas
Board member, Jackson Heights Beautification Group
You can feel a palpable sense that real-estate prices aren't going down anymore. There is a sort of less intimidating vibe in terms of homelessness or street fear -- not just here in Jackson Heights, but all over the city. The mentality of most New Yorkers was that these things were intractable, that it couldn't get better, that they were actually going to get worse.
In the last five or eight years, people have planted in their front gardens, things are taken a little bit better care of. Our commercial district has not continued to slide into the abyss. I think by and large it is perception and reality.
New York is a more in-your-face kind of town than most. For people whose constitution can stand it, I don't think it's as bad as they ever thought it was.
 
Steve Stein
Canarsie manager, Seaview Estates apartment complex
There's been a massive change in Canarsie. Minorities have basically become the keynote in the area and have basically changed the area. The older folks here -- the homeowners -- have moved and retired. A whole new population has entered the market. It's an area that is still in demand. The changes have not been negative. It is just something that is happening as the East New York area is expanding. Good-income people are coming in and renting at higher prices. I'd like to see an increase in services. Otherwise, the feeling is positive.
 
THE ECONOMY & SERVICES
 
Robert R. MacDonald
Director, Museum of the City of New York
New York is unlike any other city in the world in thinking that it is always coming back, when it is simply renewing itself, usually because of a new wave of immigration -- Eastern Europeans, Puerto Ricans and other Spanish speakers, and most recently Asians.
Right now, it is easy for New Yorkers to feel self-confident because the economy is recovering. Unlike the other 12 colonies, which were established for political or religious reasons, the Dutch built New Amsterdam specifically to make money, and so when the economic wheel turns, New Yorkers feel optimistic or pessimistic in relation to the economy, rather than for spiritual or ideological reasons.

Dr. Lewis Goldfrank
Director of emergency services, Bellevue Hospital Center
The 100 people who come through every eight hours represent every imaginable event in the city, so if you look, listen, feel and smell, you know everything that's going on.
If you look at violence, fewer people are being killed; fewer people are being maimed by others. We built systems for help with domestic violence, for help with sexual assault, to help crime victims, the homeless, help everybody. Although the numbers are fewer, those that come are getting better care because we're geared up to do it better. Simple things are happening. More people are wearing seat belts, so even when there are injuries they are less severe. And there are fewer shootings in the streets. We're seeing less cocaine, fewer people coming in who are untreated who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
The big thing we did in the last decade was train people in emergency medicine. So there are people who love to see the chaos and like to be the choreographers of our society. In the past, people just came for a few hours each week or a few days each month. But now we find people who spend their lives here and who find solving these problems is what they like to do. We get optimists. Pessimists couldn't survive here.
 
Samuel I. Schwartz
Director, Infrastructure Institute at Cooper Union, and former First Deputy Transportation Commissioner
New York is back on top, but don't look below. Streets are jammed with pedestrians and traffic day and night. Subway ridership is the highest in more than a decade. Theaters, restaurants and hotels are packed, the result of safer streets. Finally, perception of New York has caught up with reality.
We're taking care of many of our human infrastructure needs, but our physical city continues to age and deteriorate beneath our feet. By early next millennium, one-quarter of our water mains, sewers and bridges will reach the ends of their useful lives and have to be replaced or repaired concurrently. The toll will be a loss in the quality of life as monies are diverted from police and human services to the infrastructure. New York will be back down. If we'd only make corrosion a crime, I'd rest easy.
 
ATTITUDES
Ann Reinking
Dancer and choreographer, currently starring in Broadway production of "Chicago"
Things are generally more energetic now in the city, if that is possible, because even in its downtime New York is a mass of nerves.
There is so much theater these days. There are more shows on Broadway and more people taking risks on Broadway. Off Broadway is surging. And there seem to be more writers now coming to the theater, both older ones returning to theatrical writing and newer ones.
I love living here. There's this great sense of excitement on the streets of the city and a sense of neighborhood. My friends and I are all raising families now. I have a 6-year-old son, and that gives us a greater connection to what's going on. There is still so much out there in the city to help families. It's harder to get help with the Federal funds disappearing, but people are galvanized by that.
 
Brendan Sexton
President, Municipal Art Society
New York never really goes away. Even though there are deep and difficult wounds, like the racial segregation of our schools, the notion of preserving our heritage has pretty much taken hold. Buildings that used to be candidates for demolition are now being converted into apartments, like 40 Wall Street, which has a wonderful copper roof.
What's made the preservation of the city a much easier proposition is the greater number of public and private partnerships, not just the high-profile ones but also ones that are less-noticed like the Metrotech Business Improvement District.
And look at the South Bronx: there are no more burnt-out, vacant, decayed buildings. The South Bronx is now unrecognizable, and that is something of a triumph.
 
Dr. Marsha Rosenberg
Psychiatrist
New York is back because people are having fun again. I'm out late; my kids are out late; you can enjoy the city. The drop in crime has a lot to do with that. I have several elderly patients. They used to be afraid of being mugged when they went to the market, and that doesn't happen anymore.
The exception is the homeless. They have not been changed by the changes in the city. They are disenfranchised, and until the politicians see them as a group with clout they will remain disenfranchised.
 
Paul Rudnick
Author and playwright
I am becoming ashamed of New York. Our murder rate is plummeting, 42d Street is turning Epcot, the shops with huge neon-lit signs reading "anal" and "she-male" are being driven from school crossing zones, and even Al Sharpton is looking increasingly sane and cuddly.
Whatever happened to the New York that terrified the rest of America, the New York that dared folks to even visit, the New York where mobsters were gunned down over steak dinners, where Bess Myerson could shoplift and Leona could fire pedestrians, the New York where, during the desperate heat of August, mothers would routinely accuse their squalling children of being possessed by Satan, and hurl them like Nerf balls? Today your typical Post headline reads "Shoving Match Erupts Over Chess Game." If it weren't for the endless and repeated roadwork, New Yorkers would scarcely have anything to gripe about. We've been reduced to resisting Kmart and Today's Man. Come on, guys! Let's all get out there and grab someone else's cab, slide into their parking space and make kissing sounds at single women! This is New York!
 
Alex Lee
Chef de cuisine, Restaurant Daniel
Things have gotten better. Riding the subways is better; a lot of the panhandlers seem to be gone. The subway seems cleaner; police are visible. I remember seeing people wilding on 57th Street. I know a lot of people who feel safer. I hear less about bad things happening.
Part of it is the economy, but the Mayor is also a strong-arm guy. I like him a lot. I think they can work on places like Port Authority, which is a terrible eyesore. Some older people I've worked with, people in their 50's or 70's, say that the city will never be as good as it used to be. But I definitely think it's better.

Abbey Lincoln
Jazz vocalist, recording artist and actress
When I first came here, in 1957, it was another city. The music is not in Harlem anymore, it's moved downtown, and the quality of life is not as great as it used to be. There was a time -- it was a pain, but women wore blue shoes and blue gloves and a blue hat, and people weren't allowed to wear shorts on the street, except Bermuda shorts. We all need to be free, that's true, but something's missing.
It's like the paper cup. I really hate paper cups and plastic things. I think it's reflected in our lives, that we don't take ourselves as seriously as we used to. Hopefully, the city will grow into something else that I hope is better than this.

Milton Glaser
Designer
For New York, the issue is largely a question of spirit rather than reality. The same situation that seems unendurable one day seems better the next. The city seems to be going through a period now when it feels O.K. about itself. The city got tired of feeling depressed. I don't think it has to do with any objective reality; suddenly the city started feeling desirable again.

What Child Is This?

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING

CHRISTMAS PAST
Merchandise Hangover
What IS all this stuff? As Thursday dawned, that cry echoed across the land as an astounded citizenry gazed at what it had wrought. Inflation is dead, economists say? Ha! What about gift inflation? You simply can't buy less stuff than you did last year -- not in America, land of the wide-open wallet. (Shame on you for even thinking such a thought!) There are only so many different kinds of stuff, though, so the stuff makers have to constantly dream up new, even more outlandish goodies. You probably didn't know, for instance, that your dog was pining for a set of "doggie bandannas" -- one for each of various holidays. So on the day after, when there's stuff under your every foot, the shopping ordeal must be followed by a truly cruel and unusual ordeal: schlepping to the stores, again, to return unwanted stuff. By some estimates, 10 percent of gifts are returned. No one has been brave enough to estimate how many gifts are put in attics "for now."
 
YEAR-END BONUSES
It's a Wonderful Life (Really)
Talk about split personalities! We let out a collective cheer when Alastair Sim, as Scrooge, dances a jig to his new-found charitable urges. We weep in joy when Jimmy Stewart, as George Bailey, is bailed out by his neighbors. Yet in real life, Scrooge Inc. -- better known as corporate America -- writes $90 million checks to people like Michael Ovitz, while sending the Bob Cratchits nothing but greeting cards embossed with cloying poetry. Exceptions crop up, though, and here's a whopper. A California company called Kingston Technology got a $1 billion windfall recently, and, sticking to a commitment to give 10 percent of profits to employees, it's putting $100 million into bonuses for all. Part of that will be deferred, but that still leaves $75,000 for an average worker. And it's no fable.
 
APPLE COMPUTER
Return of a Wandering Genius
Any self-respecting culture has its legends, epic stories you simply don't mess with, and the computer industry is no exception. One biggie: the tale of Steve Jobs, the blazing visionary who ignited a revolution at Apple Computer, then blasted off in new directions as Apple hit corporate middle age. Could Mr. Jobs return to Apple? Absurd. It would be like Robin Hood becoming chief financial officer at Nottingham Arrows Inc. Scrap that legend, though: Apple, in search of a new operating system, just bought Next Software -- run by, yes, Mr. Jobs. And Apple is clearly in need of any second childhood its founding father might help create.
 
HEALTH CARE
Last, Heal Thy Bottom Line
Ever since H.M.O.'s appeared, a debate has raged over whether health care can be treated like any other industry. The question, basically, is whether the "bottom line" has a dollar sign on it or a beating heart. In the first rush to profits, some managed-care plans offered bonuses to doctors for keeping the cost of services down, but worries quickly grew that patients were being denied needed care just so the numbers would look good. The Federal Government has decided that such an approach is unacceptable, last week adopting a policy limiting those bonuses. The new policy applies only to Medicare and Medicaid, but it is expected to set a standard for the industry.
 
NEW YORK DREAMING
Bagels, Bagels Everywhere
It used to be a mantra of New Yorkers transplanted to the wilds of, well, anywhere else. "It's great," they'd say, sounding as if they'd just stepped out of one of those fuzzy "best places to live" magazine articles. But then, a look of true agony distorting their faces, they'd add: "If I could only find a decent bagel." It's a good line, but like many good lines, it just isn't true any more. In case you hadn't noticed, bagels are everywhere. Einstein/Noah has grown to 300 stores, Bruegger's to 450. Kellogg just paid a mint for Lender's Bagels, and Dunkin' Donuts added bagels this summer. According to the American Bagel Association -- yes, there is such a thing -- bagel sales have grown fivefold in just three years. And one research firm -- yes, they're watching you -- says bagels figure in 3.5 percent of breakfasts at home.
 
MUTUAL FUNDS
Everybody's Got 'Em
Mutual funds. Those two little words have such a comforting, safe-as-houses ring to them, don't they? "Play it safe," you hear. "Put it in mutual funds." Or: "Invest for retirement -- in mutual funds." This country seems to be turning into one giant mutual fund. According to a recent survey, 37 percent of households invest in mutual funds, up from 31 percent two years ago. In 1988, just 10 percent of 401(k) money was in mutual funds; that mushroomed to 39 percent last year. Is this a giant, and quite shaky, house of cards? That's what some people are warning. Because if this stock market ever decides to take a breather, and investors who are hooked on 12 to 15 percent returns, year after year, face the unthinkable -- fund losses -- it might all come crashing down. Or, of course, it might not.
 
LABOR RELATIONS
Let Them Eat Popcorn
In most strikes, issues like free popcorn and free breakfasts would never come up. But strikes by the United Auto Workers against Caterpillar have seemed more the rule than the exception lately, with the most recent one ending a year ago after 17 months. So the little things add up. Over the years, Caterpillar gave nonstriking workers all sorts of goodies, from unlimited ice cream and popcorn to flu shots. And last week the National Labor Relations Board said that this discriminated against striking workers, and that they had to be compensated. No estimate was given of the value of these perks, though presumably 17 months' worth of ice cream and popcorn will not be plunked onto workers' porches -- and it's too late for last year's flu shot. But whatever the amount, Caterpillar complained that the labor board was going to "ridiculous lengths to support the U.A.W.'s harassment tactics against Caterpillar."
 
SOCIAL SECURITY
Tinker or Overhaul? Stay Tuned
Ask most younger working people about Social Security and you'll get a cynical snicker and some comment like "I'll never see a penny of it." Never fear: Even as we speak, a high-level Federal panel is on the case. (All Federal panels are "high-level"; "low-level" panels are as rare as Fed Ex letters that aren't "Urgent.") In fact, the panel has been on the case for two and a half long years, groping for ways to pull more money out of the hat when the thing goes bust in 15 or 20 years. The debate seems to be this: Do we tinker with the system but leave it pretty much intact, or do we transform it into a public-private hybrid, forcing people to save more themselves? The radical approach has drawn fire from those who say it would worsen the split between "haves" and "have nots." But here's the amazing news: the panel is about to issue its report, possibly as early as tomorrow. In the meantime, keep worrying.

HEADLINE: The Sky Is Falling;
Three Cheers For Chicken Little

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"TIME is running out," Peter G. Peterson, financier and former Federal servant, warns in his latest book, "Will America Grow Up Before It Grows Old?" Mr. Peterson is writing about the imminent bankruptcy of Medicare. No matter. It easily could have been global warming, overpopulation, declining sperm counts, drug-resistant germs, designer genes, nuclear terrorism, AIDS, the national debt, Apple Computer, Democrats, Republicans, the two-party system, wetlands, desertification, moral decline, moral zealots, killer asteroids or, for that matter, software that does not recognize the year 2000.
Happy New Year? Right. Enjoy your delusion of a fresh start: the world is going to hell in a handbasket. 
 Or so it seems. There was a time -- the '50's -- when America was hopelessly upbeat, a place where men touted atomic bombs as friendly, if noisy, tunnel-diggers and Interstate highways as adventures in manifest destiny. Nineties America, on the precipice of a new millenium, paces anxiously and prays it doesn't trip and fall into the abyss. Alarmism is a national obsession. It is also big-time entertainment, rife with pop Cassandras hawking digitally enhanced jeremiads, egged on by a news business with a bottomless appetite for thrills.
From the land of glee to the home of the grave -- are Americans getting too much of a bad thing?
Of course they are. In their endless pursuit of a risk-free Utopia, Americans have developed a Texas-sized neurosis about mortal threats that never quite seem to match their advance billing.
But that begs the real question: why doesn't the sky fall? And that question is a tougher one.
Sure, plenty of alarms are raised over threats that are, to put it kindly, overstated. Some are undiluted hype; some may reflect the fact that Americans' threshold for a good scare has fallen as their lives have become more insulated from harm. Upton Sinclair struck terror in the hearts of carnivores 90 years ago by exposing horrendous meatpacking conditions in "The Jungle." Today Scare City is bad hamburger at a Jack-in-the-Box, surely tragic and just as surely infrequent.
But just as often, maybe, the sky doesn't fall because alarms work as the alarmists intended. Maybe the apocalypse never fully arrives because the alarmists' wretched excess frightens people into taking action. Maybe -- go ahead, choke on the words -- maybe the world will avoid fatal blunt asteroid trauma in 2050 because Dan Quayle urged the electorate in 1992 to watch for falling meteors.
Maybe. There's no way to know for sure. The only evidence that an alarm works is in its being proved false -- which may also be evidence that the alarm was unnecessary to begin with. And from this it's hard to avoid the unsettling conclusion that a bit of windbaggery can work better than wisdom to insure the public good, at least sometimes. It's a shrill world, after all, and alarmism may be both a cause and a result of it.
Recent history is filled with examples of Chicken Littles -- hype artists and otherwise -- who have clearly had an impact on their cause. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, is an alarmist, and a good one. Mr. Greenspan is a fire bell against raging inflation. His latest tack was to imply (mostly by lifting his eyebrows) that the stock market has been taken over by lunatics and ought to fall. Other alarmists have said the same thing to no effect, but investors watch Mr. Greenspan's brows the way Filipinos watch Mount Pinatubo. The market fell, if briefly.
Rachel Carson, the writer and biologist, single-handedly jump-started the environmental movement in 1962 with "Silent Spring." She indulged in her share of exaggeration, devoting one heart-rending chapter to the looming extinction by pesticide poisoning of the American robin, a bird that was not a dodo then and is not now. That said, not many would deny that she had a good point, or that her book changed the world.
Paul Ehrlich's 1968 jeremiad, "The Population Bomb," said flatly that humankind's race against famine was over and man had lost; that starvation would sweep the world in the 1970's as the number of hungry mouths outstripped the food supply. The book altered Americans' basic concept of progress and popularized the idea of sustainable growth. It also was wrong: the 1970's "green revolution" eased the hunger crisis, at least for the time being. Modern famines occur because of political problems, not agricultural ones.
Mr. Ehrlich says his error was scientific misjudgment, not hype, and still believes the day of reckoning has only been put off. He nevertheless agrees that "The Population Bomb" was a polemic, start to finish. "It would be intellectually satisfying to say the real impact is through reasoned discourse," he said. "But in my view the real impact isn't in reasoned discourse. Media attention, press coverage and, if necessary, alarmism at least set an agenda. And that way you can have a debate."
He is not exactly arguing that the end justifies the means. But as "The Population Bomb" shows, even the gravest alarm has a sort of credibility trip-wire. Forecast the apocalypse and at least one horseman had better show up quickly; long-term urgency is an oxymoron.
The environmental movement has suffered a credibility backlash as its exponents have sounded louder alarms about the overheated, under-shielded, deforested planet while ordinary Americans gazed out their Ford windshields and saw less smog each summer than the one before.
The environmentalists and the declining-America school of doomsayers have spawned their own counter-alarmist movements, squads of social and scientific bright-siders aiming to debunk the Gloomy Gusses. Some are flat-Earth types who deny the existence of obvious threats. But others like Gregg Easterbrook, who wrote a book about environmental alarmism, and Robert J. Samuelson and James Patterson, whose recent books question the basis of the national funk over jobs and living standards, are serious authors with serious points to make.
Mr. Ehrlich, who has written a new book bemoaning the debunkers, argues that there is nothing less than a conspiracy to roll back environmental progress. Ben J. Wattenberg, the American Enterprise Institute scholar who may be the original counter-alarmist, says doomsayers in general are well-intended exaggerators -- he calls their tactics "lying for truth" -- but exaggerators nonetheless. In his view, alarmists divert people and money from real problems by raising the specter of a sky that is always about to fall, but never seems to actually start dropping.
"Gomorrah, Gomorrah, I love ya, Gomorrah; you're always a day away," he mocks.
Public-policy wise, Mr. Wattenberg is probably right. European scientists hurled half the planet into a tailspin last spring by declaring that male fertility was plummeting, perhaps due to pollution, only to have American scientists conclude six months later that males were plenty virile; it was the scientists' math that had lost its potency. Silicone breast implants terrified the other half of the planet and spawned a multibillion-dollar legal industry before other scientists began to conclude that the threat may have been artificially enhanced.
But there are at least two flaws in asking alarmists to be reasonable, soft-spoken folk. For one thing, a reasonable alarmist is not an alarmist any more: he's the host of a Sunday news interview program, prattling on about the other hand. "Will the Earth Remain Habitable?" asked an Op-Ed article in The New York Times 10 years ago. Such a question does not deserve an answer like "Some say yes; some say no; still others don't know."
The second is that the alarmists could be right. Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland was the butt of jokes in the 1980's when he began to suggest that spray deodorants and leaky car air conditioners posed a threat because they were eating away the Earth's shield of atmospheric ozone. Last year he won a Nobel Prize, and the world's production of chlorofluorocarbons has been cut so dramatically that the ozone layer is now expected to heal itself ahead of schedule.
And though Mr. Quayle has never really recovered from his alerts about incoming meteors and Murphy Brown, many now agree that somewhere out there a rock big as Pluto probably has Earth's name on it, and that TV makes most cesspools look like Source Perrier.
Alarmists can be self-promoting pains, and they are often wrong. So ignore them. How bad could life be on an Earth slow-cooking in a sauce of melted icebergs, populated by genetic experiments gone wild and fated to an eternity of Windows 95?

Lacking Barricades, France Is in a Funk

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
THERE is a new idea afoot here, being pushed hard by French leaders: France -- land of revolutions, the avant-garde, the upheavals of 1968 -- has become a "profoundly conservative" country deeply resistant to change.
The theory, espoused by President Jacques Chirac, is supposed to explain why France is in a funk -- unreceptive to reform, unconvinced by its leaders, unclear about its place in a changing world. In this visceral conservatism, if French leaders are to be believed, lies the reason that France, more than any other European country, has found itself disoriented before the prospect of curtailing the welfare state, creating a flexible labor market, adopting the new technologies of cyberspace and embracing a single European currency, all in order to compete in a global economy. 
 On the face of it, the idea is an odd one. There were the events of 1789. More recently, in the postwar years, France has transformed itself from an overwhelmingly rural economy to a highly modern industrial one, opened its borders, freed its financial markets, created the Airbus and the world's fastest train and become the fourth largest exporter behind the United States, Germany and Japan. It has, on balance, been anything but stuck in its ways.
Yet, of late, it is true that France has shown signs of digging in its heels. A single European currency, increasingly stringent worldwide competition, a changed strategic equation in Europe -- all these issues pose tough choices that touch on national identity and ultimately cannot be fudged.
The challenges the country faces are perhaps no more daunting than those of Germany or Italy or even Britain. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl has given Germany unification. Italians have always been inclined to see Europe in a positive light, dragging them northward toward modernity. In Britain, the Thatcher years produced changes that have already made the country more competitive and flexible. Only in France, the most centralized of European states and the most ambitious in its lingering dreams of somehow incarnating world power, does the whole range of challenges seem to provoke a kind of collective dread.
The response has been striking. Suggest reforming the state-owned railroad company, which lost $3.3 billion last year and has debts of about $40 billion, and the trains stop. Hint that social security, health insurance and other mandatory wage contributions are so high that they dissuade companies from hiring and contribute to France's crippling 12.1 percent unemployment, and there is an outcry. Try, in short, to tamper with what the French call their "acquis" -- the established cocoon of a protective state -- and the reform is stillborn.
It is certainly this mood that French leaders have sought to evoke in their charge that, as Prime Minister Alain Juppe put it, France has become a place of "deep-seated conservatism." Mr. Chirac went even further: France, he said, is "sclerotic."
The idea is intriguing not least because "conservatism" is here being used to identify people who, until recently, would have been identified as "progressives" or "of the left." People, that is, who believed in a central role for the state in the economy, in the extension of social benefits, enveloping welfare and a strong public school system.
These have all been defining characteristics of the French republic. A pact developed between the technocrats who, after emerging from top schools, planned the future of France as highly respected "fonctionnaires," and the labor unions that put those plans to work. This provided a bedrock for the country's development.
 
 
 
What Now?
 At the heart of the unease now gripping France, there is the question of what new model, what new idea, to put in the old idea's place. In France even a partial dismantling of the state appears to threaten the core of the nation's values.
Moreover, in France the end of the cold war has proved most troubling, not principally because of the strategic implications but because it meant the end of a dialectic between two ideologies.
The French mind has great difficulty with what is now called "la pensee unique" -- that is, the single American-rooted ideology holding that a largely untrammeled market economy is good for mankind. The French want somehow to represent an alternative model, one in which France's charity and its cheeses are preserved. This in turn produces a form of conservatism.
Andre Glucksmann, a philosopher, said: "France is indeed in a crisis, with respect to its own history and with respect to its place in the world. But it is not inherently conservative. It wants to know what image of itself to have." Mr. Chirac and Mr. Juppe, he added, "are simply not providing answers to these questions."
Mr. Chirac has recently suggested that a German model might work in France. He talks a lot about the need for "dialogue"and "responsibility" -- clear references to the German way of managing the economy through negotiation between employers and labor unions. But Germany still bothers France. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall it has absorbed 16 million new people and developed a successful economic drive to its east that has turned much of central Europe into a German "near abroad." France, in the same period, has stagnated.
Many French foreign policy decisions -- including initial resistance to German unification and to Boris Yeltsin, and support for Slobodan Milosevic and for Rwanda's Hutus -- have given an impression of disarray or cynicism that is hard to square with the ambition, expressed by Mr. Chirac, of being "an example to the world." Flailing to be such a presence, France has clashed repeatedly with the United States.
Inconsistencies also appear rampant in domestic affairs. In a single interview this month, Mr. Chirac suggested repeatedly that France's state should be slimmed and money better spent. But then he said the state railroad "will never be touched," French public service "will not be called into question," and the "acquis" will not be diluted.
 
 
 
Mixed Signals
 As for European integration, the President and Prime Minister have recently made impassioned pleas for the introduction in 1999 of the common currency known as the Euro. At the same time, however, the Government has maintained the border controls it had vowed to abolish and has not made clear what sort of United States of Europe, if any, France has in mind.
Finally, Mr. Chirac and Mr. Juppe have held out as a goal the old French republican model of an inclusive society, marked by its humanism and its commitment to the equality of all before the law. But this appeal -- rooted in the notion of the universality of French civilization -- has come as France has turned inward, essentially scrapping the old law that established that anyone born in France was French.
"The message from the Government is confused," said Dominique Moisi, the deputy director of the French Institute of International Relations, an independent think tank. "The French are not being told very clearly what Europe to expect, what type of economy, or what society. The result is that people try to defend a status quo that is indefensible."
The new conservatism in France is real. It is the expression of a society unmoored, with respect to the world and its past. But this conservatism also owes much to Mr. Chirac and Mr. Juppe themselves, both products of the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the school that always produced the "fonctionnaires" who guided France. The President and the Prime Minister thump the table, throw up their hands, inveigh against conservatism and talk of reform. But their old-school instincts are deeply "conservative" -- and it shows.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
10 Years After Tax Overhaul, the Loopholes Expand

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
TEN years ago this week, the United States put into effect what political leaders hailed as a fairer tax system, wiping out shelters that many wealthy Americans used to prevent much of their income from being taxed. At the same time, maximum tax rates were lowered.
For years, many affluent citizens who had used shelters paid far lower taxes than others who earned the same income. Oil-drilling ventures and real estate partnerships, among other activities, had flourished for no reason other than the circumvention of taxes. After Congress passed a sweeping overhaul of the tax code in 1986, these loopholes largely disappeared and the richest Americans were forced to pay more. 
 Now the tax engine is shifting into reverse. Top tax rates have crept up again, though they are still lower than they were before the 1986 tax overhaul. And the shrewdest among the wealthy, in collaboration with eager expert advisers, are finding ingenious new shelters to keep the tax collector at bay in three big areas -- their salaries and bonuses, investment profits and estates.
These techniques are not available to most Americans. And they are spreading largely without attention from policy makers in Washington, even though they are costing the Treasury money. Exactly how much money, no one knows. But the amount is expected to grow significantly because the full impact of these techniques will be felt in years to come.
The appearance of the latest tax shelters raises old questions of fairness. They are chipping away, tax experts say, at a longstanding principle that the American tax system should be progressive -- that the well-to-do should pay the biggest share of their income.
Some of these techniques replace gimmicks that Congress stripped from the tax code 10 years ago. For example, Congress cut the annual limit on tax-deferred investments in Individual Retirement Accounts and the employee savings accounts called 401(k) plans to $9,500 from $30,000. But now, new deferred pay plans help some executives skirt that limit by delaying income taxes for years, even decades, sometimes on millions of dollars in pay. Hundreds of thousands of higher-paid managers have been offered these plans by their employers, most in the last few years.
Congress in 1986 also closed some loopholes in the estate tax, which is incurred when wealth is handed from one generation to the next. But today new kinds of trusts allow the most prosperous and resourceful citizens to leave homes, family businesses and stock options to their heirs with minimal taxes.
And even as a bull market has exposed a large number of middle-class Americans to the capital gains tax through their mutual fund investments, some Wall Street firms have started offering complex deals that let their top customers get most of the benefits of selling a valuable asset without actually having to sell it and pay the tax on the profit.
These maneuvers may exacerbate widespread feelings that the tax system is inequitable. "The more these products multiply," said Richard McGahey, former executive director of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, "it feeds the perception that the system is unfair."
 
 
 
Raising the Top
 The reforms of 1986 and subsequent increases in maximum tax rates in 1991 and 1993 helped make the Federal income tax system more progressive, as measured by effective tax rates, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Some analysts fear that avoidance maneuvers will erode those gains.
"Much of these tax issues are going to come down to fairness, one way or the other," said David Hackett Fischer, the author of "The Great Wave: Price Revolutions and the Rhythms of History" and a historian at Brandeis University. "We have to think of what kind of nation we want to be."
One concern is that higher-income taxpayers are already reaping a growing share of the nation's economic wealth. Research by the economist Edward N. Wolff of New York University shows that from 1983 through 1992, the richest 20 percent of the population saw its share of the nation's wealth grow to 83.7 percent from 81.3 percent.
The Clinton Administration's response to the latest twists in tax avoidance has been to propose closing some loopholes, chiefly those that Wall Street is peddling to avoid capital gains taxes. Congress has responded to that idea with a chilly indifference, and the most energetic advocacy has been on the side of cutting taxes, flattening tax rates and clipping the powers of the Internal Revenue Service.
The I.R.S. response has mostly been a tower of ad hoc "private letter" rulings, brief decisions that permit one specific tax-avoidance technique. These rulings, although tailored to the facts of one case, often become a key ingredient of the next popular tax-avoidance device to emerge. Even when the agency fights back in court, its track record is poor, lawyers say, as its workload has outstripped its budget and its litigation staff.
Positions on what should be done to change the tax system diverge in large part on differences in definitions of fairness. According to numerous surveys, most Americans think that the fairest tax system is one in which the rich pay a larger share of their income in taxes than the less-rich do. But many say fairness is achieved when everyone with the same income pays the same tax. And others say fairness prevails when all taxpayers pay the same percentage of their income to the tax collector, whether that would leave them with millions or thousands.
Jack Kemp, the former vice presidential candidate, and Steve Forbes, the publishing executive turned Presidential candidate, campaigned for the single tax rate, calling it a flat tax. This presumably simpler approach, according to its proponents, would promote growth and lead to less wasteful spending on tax accountants and lawyers.
End-runs around the tax code, some economists and business executives contend, are the inevitable result of a system that, in their eyes, still penalizes savings and investment while rewarding spending and borrowing.
"You ought to encourage people to get wealthy," said Theodore Forstmann, a Wall Street investment banker who served on a national panel set up last year to advise Republican leaders on tax reform. "You don't want to penalize people for that."
Yet tax lawyers say privately that most of the proposed alternatives to the current system would be equally vulnerable to tax avoidance. The reason is that wealthy people can make adjustments in how they receive and use their money to take maximum advantage of the smallest loophole.
For example, eliminating or greatly reducing the capital gains tax would simply increase the demand for financial techniques that could replace ordinary income with capital gains. Instead of a higher salary, a company might give top executives a low-cost personal stake in a subsidiary that stands to become more valuable; the initial value of the stake would count as taxable income, but the increased value might well accrue to the executives as tax-free capital gains.
A pure flat tax, one that applies the same tax rate to any level of income and to income from any source, would be least prone to gimmickry, economists say. But a flat tax's vulnerability to circumvention grows once income generated by investments is exempted, as proposed by Mr. Forbes, whose investments generate most of his income.
In the debate over how the nation should tax itself, the ability of the wealthy to engineer a way around their tax burden will need to be considered, said Herbert Stein, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Richard M. Nixon.
"Financial engineering should be addressed," he said. "People are now saying that since the upper income can escape taxes, why not make it available to everyone? But that will make it very hard to finance the Government's activities."

Sam Wanamaker's Great Obsession

BYLINE: By KARL E. MEYER 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
A curious and stirring sight awaits an American visitor to Southwark Cathedral, a surviving relic of medieval England on the south bank of the Thames. Among monuments in the nave to titled worthies and deceased prelates is a plaque "In Thanksgiving for Sam Wanamaker, Actor, Director, Producer, 1919-1993, whose vision rebuilt Shakespeare's Globe Theatre on Bankside in this parish."
Had Mr. Wanamaker died two decades ago, he would doubtless have been remembered as an eccentric American who upheld a hopeless cause. This year, however, the nearly finished Globe's premiere production, "Two Gentlemen of Verona," has ended a sellout run and will move to New York next month. As important, a grimly derelict neighborhood is recovering something like its Elizabethan gusto. 
 As a reporter present at the 1970 launch of Mr. Wanamaker's campaign, I remember the good-natured ridicule it provoked. Scoffers, myself included, owe his ghost an apology. The Globe is not a toy or theme-park fabrication but is as convincing and evocative as the smells and sounds of the nearby Thames.
Performances are in daylight, so that actors have direct eye contact with the groundlings in the yard facing the raised rectangular stage. The plaster, marbled wood pillars and oak beams recapture the style of the original Globe, which was built close by in 1599 and destroyed in 1613 when a stage cannon ignited the thatched roof during a performance of "Henry VIII."
Still, for an American, the Globe's rebirth also recalls the pain that attended it. As a teen-ager in Chicago, Mr. Wanamaker saw a half-scale reconstruction of the Globe at the 1934 World's Fair, and later joined its Shakespeare troupe. He made his Broadway debut in 1942, fought in the Pacific theater in World War II and seemed destined for a successful career as director and classical actor, whose roles included a Stratford-on-Avon Iago opposite Paul Robeson's Othello.
But like Robeson, who was an avowed Communist, and innumerable other Americans who were former Communists or vaguely leftist, Mr. Wanamaker became unemployable in the blacklist decade. Some sought to salvage acting careers by confessing error and informing on colleagues before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Summoned to Washington for such a rite, Mr. Wanamaker chose exile in Britain. As punishment, his passport was revoked in the 1950's.
The Shakespeare project helped Mr. Wanamaker keep his sanity and dignity intact. On his first visit to London in 1949, he had sought traces of the original theater and was astonished to find only a blackened plaque on an unused brewery. He found this neglect inexplicable, and in 1970 launched the Shakespeare Globe Trust, later obtaining the building site and necessary permissions despite a hostile local council. He siphoned his earnings as actor and director into the project, undismayed by the skepticism of his British colleagues.
Mr. Wanamaker lived to see the Globe's walls rise, this time with safeguards against fire. At his death in 1993, a cavalcade of players filled the memorial service in Southwark Cathedral. What might have pleased Sam Wanamaker more is the throng of students from all corners of the world who crowd the reborn Globe, its fine exhibition hall and its varied menu of readings. KARL E. MEYER

HEADLINE: Raising Medicare Standards

 BODY:
The agency that oversees Medicare and Medicaid has issued sensible rules that limit the financial penalties managed care plans can impose on doctors who exceed a plan's targets for ordering tests and procedures. Other new rules reflect a growing recognition that the Federal Health Care Financing Administration must assume responsibility for monitoring the quality of care that health plans operating under its auspices deliver to enrollees. That is a notable change of direction.
Though the Medicare and Medicaid plans are the last refuge of traditional fee-for-service coverage, almost 5 million elderly, or 12 percent of the Medicare population, and about 13 million poor people, a third of the Medicaid population, are enrolled in managed care. These numbers make the agency the largest purchaser of managed care in the country. 
 Managed care has cut health care inflation in half by generally paying doctors fixed fees regardless of their patients' needs. But that powerful incentive to cut out needless care also creates anxiety that doctors will cut out some necessary care, even though studies show no systematic problem. The new rules are designed to alleviate public anxiety.
The agency previously told managed care plans to eliminate so-called gag rules, which prevent doctors from informing patients about procedures the plan will not cover. Now the agency will prohibit plans from exposing doctors to financial penalties that exceed 25 percent of their annual income. These are reasonable rules that will not substantially alter practices of most managed care plans.
The agency has also issued an important rule that will improve practices by Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans and potentially by plans throughout the private sector. The policy requires each plan to survey its enrollees each year to ask how patients were treated and how satisfied they were with their treatment. The agency has often pointed with pride to extremely low administrative costs as proof of its efficiency. But what the rock-bottom administrative costs really proved is that the agency was not doing much administering at all.
The survey marks a new direction. Initially, the information will be rudimentary, probably documenting little more than how long it took patients to see their primary doctors and how satisfied they were with the results. But over time the survey could evolve into a sophisticated report card that would tell the agency which plans, including its fee-for-service system, were treating patients the best. Of course, processing surveys and taking action will increase the agency's administrative costs -- but that is an outcome Congress should accommodate.
The new rules are constructive and well designed to alleviate worries about managed care among the elderly and poor. They also move Government oversight to a higher standard.

11. Power is realigned as (a) Daschle and Gephardt form coalition of united Democrats and rebellious moderate Republicans to back Clinton and overwhelm the G.O.P. "majority"; (b) contrariwise, united Republicans join with blue-dog Democrats to overcome Presidential vetoes; (c) Aleksandr Lebed makes surprise deal with the Communists, forcing Yeltsin to replace dull Prime Minister Chernomyrdin with lively Moscow Mayor Luzhkov and hated staff chief Chubais with reformer Yavlinsky.
12. President's popularity (a) drops under impact of Congressional hearings on Asian connection and revelations of Independent Counsel; (b) rises slightly as new White House counsel employs balance-of-contrition strategy with ethically wounded Speaker Gingrich; (c) holds steady as people grow bored with scandal and economy stagnates, interest rates drop, stock market marches on up; (d) soars as Madonna's sympathetic portrayal of the First Lady in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Trial of Hillary" smashes Broadway records.

HEADLINE: DOWNSIZING: A Year-End Look;
A Follow-Up Look at 5 Workers Who Lost Their Jobs to Downsizing

 BODY:
Last March, The New York Times, in a series called "The Downsizing of America," told the stories of Americans dealing with the changes that accompany the loss of a job in the fast-changing economy. Talks with five of them in recent weeks reveal that some who were cast from their jobs have found new ones at similar pay, while others are still struggling to re-establish themselves. All share an optimism tempered by a new sense of vulnerability.

Working, at One-Third the Pay
Steven A. Holthausen, laid off in 1990 from his job as loan officer at a bank, found work in 1995 as a tourist guide for the State of Connecticut. He is still doing this, stationed at a tourist center along Interstate 95, and earning less than a third of what he was paid at the bank. But the bitterness is fading. He no longer dwells on the past. He is adjusting.
"There is really nothing else you can do," he said. "You can beat your head against the wall or get on with your life."
He talks now of small achievements. His fee as a contract worker has gone up 29 cents an hour, to $10.67, and he works more hours, so his income has gradually risen to $1,200 a month from $1,000. That is still a far cry from the $1,000 a week he earned as a loan officer. But Mr. Holthausen, 51, does not harp on that comparison now -- except to note that he is less generous and patient than he was in his banker's life. "My state of mind now," he said, "is looking out for No. 1."
But he speaks optimistically of the day he will rise from clerk on contract to state employee with broader responsibilities.
After the layoff, he and his wife divorced. His daughter, Gretchen, kept her distance. But she came to realize, he says, that other fathers had lost their jobs, too. With Mr. Holthausen proudly in the audience, she graduated from Westbrook High School last June, second in her class.
Scholarships pay more than half the $28,000 cost of Gretchen's first year of college, at Bryn Mawr. "If I were still a banker," he said, "she would not have qualified for so much in scholarships, and I could not have afforded Bryn Mawr."
 
At Last, a Job to Be Proud Of
The transmission on James E. Sharlow's Mercedes does not slip anymore.
It was one of the first things he fixed after he was hired by a plant in Irvine, Calif., as director of operations, last May. It is a job -- after three years and four months of soul-killing unemployment -- that seemed heaven sent.
The slipping, limping Mercedes had become a kind of symbol of his two lives: the old one, before he was laid off from his $130,000-a-year job as director of operations at a subsidiary of Kodak, and the new one, the long, empty, despairing days as he searched for a job like the one he had lost, siphoning money from his retirement accounts to shore up his family's comfortable life style.
He wakes each morning now to "happiness," he said, after so many mornings of numbing monotony, when every trip to the mailbox seemed to bring only rejection letters.
His new plant, owned by the Newport Corporation, makes research equipment, the kind of highly technical work on which he built a career. The company is growing; his job seems safe. His pay, he says, is about the same as at his old job.
Still, he knows how many others were not so fortunate, who are still waiting, or working jobs far, far below their old stations in life. He knows how fortunate he is.
What happened to him before "really, really scared him," said his wife, Gayle. "It's always in the back of our minds, that it may not last. So he's almost afraid to like it too much."
 
Salvation in a Callback
In March 1994, Northrop Grumman closed the machine shop where Robert Muse had worked since 1971. He had been a machinist who did exacting work on aircraft parts. Making planes was all he knew. He was good at it; his bosses honored him with awards. But he believed, as he walked out the door for the last time, that 22 years of good money and blue collar dignity were at an end. There would be no callback this time, he believed.
"Things were going downhill pretty good," he said.
For nearly three years he did whatever he could to put food on the table and pay for a modest house in Torrance, Calif. He trimmed trees and unclogged toilets, with a smile. Yet, in his mind at least, he would always be an aircraft worker, would always search the skies for vapor trails.
Then, out of that blue, came his salvation. Northrop needed a few good workers back. An old boss remembered him.
He was rehired in November, for a little more than his previous $20 an hour. Suddenly, he and his wife, Nancy, dared again to hope that they would not have to live on just Social Security in their old age.
The work is different. Instead of machining parts by hand, machines play a larger role now. "That don't bother me," he said.
He is working eight-hour shifts, seven days straight.
"That don't bother me," he said.
He is surviving.
"I been down a dark road, and I didn't like it."
He will never, he says, feel safe in a job again: "It's like walking over trap doors."
 
A Manager Now on His Own
Richard A. Baumbusch is ending 1996 alone in his basement -- and happy to be there. Mr. Baumbusch has had a bumpy ride in corporate life since the mid-1980's. As a manager, he once had to withhold secret information about a mass layoff from a co-worker, only to see the man buy a house just before his termination. Then Mr. Baumbusch was laid off himself -- twice.
Now he is out of the corporate circus, he said, probably forever. In June he decided to leave his job at US West, the telecommunications company in Denver, after he became convinced his job as an executive director was headed for the ax. "The clouds were forming," he said.
His new consulting company, grandly called the Knowledge Advantage Group, is really a group of one: Mr. Baumbusch. "It does feel very good for me to be in control of my destiny," he said.
Mr. Baumbusch said that leaving the corporate fold was only part of a personal journey that began about three years ago, after he had an epiphany at a corporate training session. The speaker was talking about people who live in a "knowing mode" and those who live in a "learning mode." Mr. Baumbusch realized that people who can constantly learn will constantly grow, that those who rely on what they know will stagnate, and that he was becoming a know-it-all.
"I will catch myself now and say, 'Dick, shut up and start listening,' " he said.
The decision to learn again made leaving his company all the easier. He now looks forward to his 50's in a way he didn't before.
 
Adjusting to a Hellish Commute
A year ago, Jeff Woodward was one of the new nomad dads, commuting weekly from his home in Dayton, Ohio, to Gainesville, Fla., for a job as the chief financial officer for an electronic publishing company.
He had left his Dayton job at Mead Data Central the previous spring after the company was acquired by a Dutch-British conglomerate that eliminated 400 jobs. Mr. Woodward decided it was better to commute temporarily than to uproot his family.
Now 48, he is still commuting to Gainesville. "This may be how I finish my career," he said. "As long as it meets the company's needs, it meets mine."
The company is doing well, and Mr. Woodward has adjusted his schedule so that he spends one week in two working at home, allowing him to spend more time with his wife, Cinda, a schoolteacher, and his son, Paul, 15. His daughter, Leslie, is in her first year at Ohio State.
"He's more upbeat when I'm around," Mr. Woodward said of his son, adding that he is grateful for the flexibility his job allows him. "There was a time when dads were in a no-win scenario in corporate America. Now guys are having time to re-examine that balance in their lives."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Says Improvements in Education and Child Welfare Should Be Felt in 1997

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani predicted last week that in 1997 New York City residents would begin to feel the impact of recent changes in education and child welfare, just as 1996 was the year in which reductions in crime became evident.
In his traditional year-end interview with City Hall reporters, held late Friday afternoon, the Mayor said he particularly hoped that those changes would be felt in low-income and predominantly black neighborhoods, where voters tend to be more suspicious of his policies than in white areas. Polls have shown Mr. Giuliani to be far more popular among whites than among blacks, and though he maintained that his support among black voters had improved, he said that more communication was necessary beyond his largely white, middle-class base. 
 "In crime reduction, the place that it's had the biggest impact is in the poorer sections of the city, and particularly in minority areas," he said. "So yes, those are places in which we will try to get our message out more effectively, try to get more people to understand it. It has real possibilities, because it's an area where there's been a tremendous amount of confusion and a certain amount of demonizing."
He also said he would continue to press his so-far unsuccessful effort to lower the sales tax on clothing. He has scaled back his proposal several times and dropped it from the current year's budget in negotiations last summer with the City Council because of the deficit. The city's current financial plan calls for the sales tax on clothing to drop next December to 6.25 percent from 8.25 percent, and he held out a vague hope that he could cut taxes even more than that if the economy continued to improve.
"What I am saying is that as we look at a possible modest surplus, the decision that I'll make is how do we escalate some of the tax cuts, and which ones," he said. "And one of the candidates for that will be the sales tax," which he described as more regressive than the income tax, and thus a better candidate for cutting .
Next year's preliminary financial plan comes out in late January, and Council members have said they are eager to see how much tax cutting the Mayor will propose in light of long-term deficits that continue to grow.
It was last year at this time that Mr. Giuliani first began talking about improving the city's record on protecting child welfare, an idea that later led to the formation of the Administration for Children's Services. The new agency reports directly to the Mayor, and even some of his critics have acknowledged that it is doing a better job. The Mayor said he hoped there would be further improvements next year.
But in sketching an outline of the final year of his term, in which he plans to run for re-election, the Mayor offered no new programs or initiatives that he was likely to propose. Instead, he described a year in which he would build on the changes in law enforcement, welfare and education that he has already begun.
"What I expect for the next year is to hold the changes that we've made, and to keep them continuing," he said, noting that it often takes months for statistical changes in crime to be felt by citizens. "This year you can now see that happening with crime, safety, improvement in the quality of life. I think next year you'll see it happen with education, maybe into the year after."
Earlier this month, the State Legislature and the Mayor reached agreement on a new plan for governing the schools that gives far more power to the Chancellor to appoint superintendents and fight corruption among community school boards. But the new system does little to directly address such issues as school overcrowding or the chronic imbalance in educational quality between rich and poor areas. Without being specific, the Mayor said he hoped the educational changes achieved this year would begin to make themselves felt more strongly next year.
In other areas, the Mayor said:
*He hopes to use the pending long-term lease of Coney Island Hospital to a private company as an example of how privatization of public hospitals will work, and that it will lead to the eventual sale of other municipal hospitals around the city.
*The current modest improvement in the local economy could produce more entry-level jobs for welfare recipients who are being moved off public assistance by his policies and by the new Federal welfare bill. He cited low-level jobs in hotels as a particularly promising area for former welfare recipients.
*He would consider himself fortunate if his challengers in next year's election campaign could find nothing worse to criticize than his not getting along well with others. He said that the city's voters are much more interested in whether he has effectively kept his promises than in his personal style.

HEADLINE: When Revolt Was Order of the Day

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
In 1968, there were 986 homicides in New York City. No one knew it then, but 28 years would pass before the figure was below 1,000 again. Through the mists of time, 1968 might appear a halcyon year.
Far from it. 
 The world was in tumult. That was the year the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot to death in Memphis and Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles.
In that year of the Tet offensive, more than half a million United States troops were at war in Vietnam, and the toll of enemy dead at year's end stood at 422,979.
Besides war, there were riots and rebellions. Students were on the march, seizing control of the Columbia University campus in New York, demonstrating 200,000 strong in Mexico and clashing with the police in Paris. When Dr. King died, riots broke out in at least 100 American cities, and the count of the dead reached 46. Soviet troops invaded Czechoslovakia.
That was the year President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not run again, and in November, Richard M. Nixon defeated Hubert H. Humphrey in the Presidential race.
Inflation stood at 4.2 percent and unemployment at 3.6 percent. America's international balance of payments stood in the plus column by $1.5 billion. You could buy a new Chrysler for $2,249, a Toyota for $1,666 and a hot dog for a quarter. In February, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority expressed confidence that the 20-cent subway and bus fare could be maintained throughout the year.
At home, people were watching "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In," "Bonanza" and "Here's Lucy." And when they went to the movies, they could see "Oliver!," "Funny Girl," "Rosemary's Baby," "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "Yellow Submarine."
Besides being hot at the movie box office, the Beatles saw their "Magical Mystery Tour" album become one of the year's hits, along with the soundtrack from "The Graduate" and Simon and Garfunkel's "Bookends."
On Broadway, theatergoers were flocking to "Plaza Suite" and "The Great White Hope," and readers were making best sellers of Arthur Hailey's "Airport," John Updike's "Couples" and Gore Vidal's "Myra Breckenridge," as well as such nonfiction as Eldridge Cleaver's "Soul on Ice" and Tom Wolfe's "Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test."
But crime took no holiday.
Homicides alone increased to 986 from 746 in 1967. And besides the homicides in what was sometimes known as "Fun City," 1968 brought 1,840 rapes, 54,405 robberies, 28,515 aggravated assaults, 173,559 burglaries, 216,245 larcenies and 77,448 motor vehicle thefts, for a not so grand total of 552,998 major crimes.
As the year proceeded, concern was expressed about the safety of women traveling around the city at night, about crime on the subways, about the possibility of widespread underworld warfare and about attacks on workers in slum areas.
In January, Mayor John V. Lindsay announced plans to increase the size of the police force but said that the war on crime was "far from being won."
In February, 10,000 New York City sanitation workers struck for nine days. In the autumn, police and firefighters, also unhappy with their contracts, began slowdowns. Some people were calling New York "Strike City." The leader of the Transit Patrolmen's Association called for more daytime patrols and said subway riders were at the mercy of "purse snatchers, drunks and degenerates."
In March, the Police Department said that reports of crime were 31.8 percent higher than the comparable figure for 1967, with arrests up 15.9 percent.
In April, 30 rampaging youths were arrested for robbing and assaulting passengers aboard a BMT train. A month later, 6 teen-agers were held on charges of staging a series of knife-point holdups of bus drivers on Manhattan's Upper West Side. In June, 5 boys, all under 13, were arrested for stealing pocketbooks in the subways.
The police reported that the crime rate was up 27.7 percent from the figure for April 1967; the figure for May was 32 percent higher than its 1967 counterpart.
In June, the Manhattan District Attorney, Frank S. Hogan, said his investigators had collected evidence that Police Department members had taken bribes from gamblers and club owners; 37 men, including 19 present and former policemen, were indicted for accepting "protection" playoffs.
In the summer, the city inaugurated 911, the new citywide police emergency number, and by July, the police reported receiving 18,000 calls a day.
In September, 150 white men, some of them off-duty and out-of-uniform police officers, attacked Black Panther party members and sympathizers outside a Brooklyn court, the site of a hearing for three party members charged with assaulting a police officer. Crimes in New York City were 19.2 percent higher than those in the previous September.
In November, a survey showed that thousands of crime victims did not report incidents to the police because they felt that the police were unable to apprehend criminals and were often not interested in the cases. Police officials refused to comment.
In December, some policemen were found to be "cooping" -- sleeping on duty -- especially between 2:30 and 7 A.M. when they should have been responding quickly to calls for help.
As the year ended, Mayor Lindsay warned of worsening racial tensions but said he did not believe that the city had been lastingly damaged by the year's turmoil.
New York City was about to begin nearly three decades of homicide by the thousands.

HEADLINE: Though Upbeat on the Economy, People Still Fear for Their Jobs

SERIES: DOWNSIZING: A year-end look.

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Beth Cheney Mendes is well educated and well off. Ms. Mendes, a skilled nurse with a graduate degree from Yale University, and her husband, a bank executive, enjoy a six-figure income in Columbia, Conn.
The nearest brush Ms. Mendes, 37, has had with being laid off came five years ago when the private practice she worked for said it would be making cuts. She called a friend at Yale and had another job in 24 hours. 
 The economy, Ms. Mendes says, is healthy, but her experience has left her doubtful that any job can offer lasting security. "You never know when you might be laid off," she said.
Like Ms. Mendes, a growing number of Americans believe the economy is in good shape; even so, the number concerned about their own jobs has not changed significantly in the last year.
Their anxiety is not unfounded. A recent report by the Labor Department showed a high rate of layoffs from 1993 through 1995, even as unemployment was extremely low, with millions more jobs created than were wiped out. An analysis by The New York Times of the Labor Department figures found that the number of people laid off in 1995, the most recent year for which Government data are available, rose to nearly the peak reached in 1992, right after the last recession. Through November of this year, even after more than five years of economic recovery, the number of layoffs announced by companies had increased 14 percent from a year earlier, according to one study.
The new findings confirm that layoffs have become a durable fixture of today's economy, occurring steadily in good times and bad. Three-quarters of all American households have seen a family member, friend, relative or neighbor lose a job since 1980. "It makes you less secure and trusting of employers even after you get another job," said Rich Kapatos of Aberdeen, Wash., who was laid off in 1989 and found another job within six months.
In a poll by The New York Times earlier this month, 67 percent rated the condition of the economy as fairly good or very good. That was up from 51 percent in a New York Times poll that was conducted last December for a series of articles entitled "The Downsizing of America," published in March.
Despite the improvement, economic insecurity persists at virtually the level of a year ago, according to the new poll. And the job apprehension is spread remarkably evenly across society. This year, 49 percent of those polled said they were somewhat worried or very worried that someone in their household might be laid off within two or three years. Last year, 51 percent said they were worried.
The finding of a gap between people's perceptions of economic health and of their own job security could easily be explained away early in a recovery, analysts say. Economic activity typically accelerates for a year or so before the job market firms up. "But you wouldn't expect that gap now, well past five years into an economic expansion," said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University.
Seventy percent of those polled said they thought layoffs were not just a temporary problem in America but a feature of the modern economy that would continue permanently. Last year, 72 percent said layoffs would continue permanently.
Just how the current level of job insecurity compares with years past is impossible to measure accurately. Comparable polls were not done in previous decades.
The issue of layoffs and job insecurity emerged briefly in the Presidential campaign, especially after Patrick J. Buchanan, whose message was laden with anti-corporate populism, won the Republican primary in New Hampshire in February. About that time, The Times and several other newspapers and magazines published prominent articles on layoffs.
Today the issue has faded from the nation's political debate and has lost the attention of many news organizations. But recent studies help explain the qualms still felt by many Americans in the midst of a generally healthy economy. Layoffs announced by companies increased 14 percent through November, to 439,745, from 384,645 during the corresponding months a year ago, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The consulting firm tracks publicly reported layoffs, so it tends to be a gauge only of cuts at larger companies. In the last few months, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reports, the pace of layoffs has eased.
Labor Department figures released in late October and analyzed by The Times show high rates of layoffs from 1993 through 1995 even though unemployment was low. In its series last March, The Times made projections of the layoff rate for 1994 and 1995 because the Government numbers for those years had not been tabulated. The Times projections were criticized by some economists and the Clinton Administration as little more than guesses and probably too high. In fact, the latest Labor Department numbers show, the Times projections were slightly lower than the official figures.
The Labor Department's October statistics, corrected from figures made public in August, indicated that 8.2 percent of the labor force identified themselves as having lost a job involuntarily in the 1993-95 period, compared with 8.1 percent in the Times projections. The layoff rate was significantly lower, at 5.7 percent, during the years from 1987 through 1989, a period of roughly comparable unemployment rates.
In the huge American labor market, a difference of a few percentage points in the layoff rate translates into millions of workers -- 10.1 million people laid off from 1993 through 1995 versus 6.7 million in 1987-89.
"Right now, the job-loss rate is higher than it was in the late 1980's," said Henry Farber, a labor economist at Princeton University. "We would have expected job losses to be much lower by now, given the low level of unemployment."
Some economists emphasize that the high turnover -- however wrenching for people who lose their jobs -- is a byproduct of a fast-moving economy that has created far more jobs than it has destroyed in recent years. Yet others say that the elevated layoff rate also reflects the diminished bargaining power of workers in today's economy.
Since early 1992, America has generated 12.3 million net new jobs. In the last year, the number of new jobs created has outnumbered the ones wiped out at a rate of 208,000 a month. The American performance is the envy of the developed world, leaving the United States with far lower unemployment than many countries in Europe, where companies are often restrained by tax penalties and social pressure from laying off workers.
"The high job-loss rate in America is real and it's significant, but it is not the whole picture or even the general picture of the economy," said Paul Krugman, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "What economists call 'labor market flexibility' is a euphemism for a certain amount of brutality. But it seems to be an unfortunate price we have to pay for having as dynamic an economy as we do."
Many people laid off do suffer a loss in income, sometimes a sharp drop, notes Thomas Nardone, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Labor Department. So if higher levels of job loss do continue for years, the phenomenon should at least contribute to greater variability in incomes as more people move between jobs.
In its October report, the Labor Department tracked the layoff, re-employment and earnings experiences of workers who had had a job for three years or more and were then laid off from 1993 through 1995. These so-called long-tenured workers, analysts say, are more likely to reflect trends in the labor market than are workers who frequently change jobs.
Of the long-tenured workers laid off, 74 percent had found a job by February 1996. Still, only 34 percent of them were making as much as or more than in their previous jobs. The rest, about two-thirds, were still looking for a job, were working part time, were self-employed or were working full time for less money than before.
Michael Rodgers was one of those hit hard by an unexpected layoff. In February 1994, Mr. Rodgers, now 40, was laid off from his job as manufacturing manager at a Pennsylvania chemical plant in a cost-cutting drive by Allied Signal. During his 14 years at Allied Signal, he had gone to school at night, earning a bachelor's degree and then an M.B.A. But the education did not shield him.
Mr. Rodgers sent out 240 resumes, and by the fall of 1994 he had a job as a manufacturing manager at a smaller company. The salary, though, was half the $75,000 he had been making at Allied Signal.
In the same year, Mr. Rodgers was divorced and, he says, nearly went bankrupt. The lost job and income, he says, contributed to both personal crises. But in 1995, he landed a better-paying job at another company.
Two months ago, Mr. Rodgers was hired as a manufacturing supervisor at a Philip Morris cigarette plant in Richmond. The job pays more than $50,000 a year with a chance for a bonus if he does well. Things are looking up for him now, but his recent experience brought a lesson. "Nothing is secure," he said.
The insecurity is pronounced for supervisors like Mr. Rodgers, according to a survey of 1,400 companies released in October by the American Management Association. The association found that among supervisors, the lowest level of management, two were laid off for every one hired. The biggest cuts, though, were made one level up, as three middle managers were let go for every one hired.
Yet as they lay off administrative workers, companies are also hiring to change the mix of skills of their work forces, trying to put more people directly at work developing products and selling them. The association's study found that companies are now hiring two technical and professional workers -- a category that includes engineers, computer programmers and salespeople -- for every one let go.
The highly publicized cuts at the largest corporations could be considered more symbolic than representative of the American labor market as a whole. After all, more than half of American workers are employed by companies with 500 workers or fewer. Still, the churning of the work force at many big companies contributes to the sense of insecurity.
"People worry about their own jobs, not jobs as a whole," said Eric Greenberg, director of management studies for the American Management Association. "In the current environment, a sense of job insecurity on the part of the individual is very rational."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 8-11 with 1,432 adults throughout the United States. The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 36,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for those who are very worried about losing their job in the coming year it is plus or minus seven percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Final Peace Near, Guatemala Braces for Complications

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, Dec. 28

 BODY:
This country's civil war has gone on for so long that most Guatemalans have no memory of a time when their nation was at peace. So when Remigio Gutierrez contemplates the final accord the Government and guerrillas are to sign here Sunday to end 36 years of armed conflict, he cannot help being skeptical.
"The two sides fought their war against us, the people, and negotiated a cease-fire without us taking part," said Mr. Gutierrez, 30, a clothing salesman who roams the rugged highlands where some of the worst brutalities of the war occurred. "It's their peace, not ours, and while I believe some things will improve, other things are going to become more complicated." 
 After inflicting incalculable destruction, the guns may have finally fallen silent in this country of 10.5 million people. But as Mr. Gutierrez and other people recognize, the toll of the last, longest and bloodiest of Central America's guerrilla insurgencies far exceeds the most obvious casualties: at least 100,000 killed, 40,000 estimated to have "disappeared," some 250,000 children orphaned and more than one million people driven from their homes.
The hostilities, which began when President Eisenhower was in the White House, have also left Guatemala materially and intellectually impoverished, deeply embittered and with its institutions and infrastructure devastated. For President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen and his foreign allies, overcoming that legacy is likely to prove an even more daunting challenge than the nearly six years of talks that preceded the Accord for a Firm and Lasting Peace.
"Manna is not going to fall from heaven the day after the peace accord," Mr. Arzu cautioned his countrymen last month. In an interview on Friday, a day after leftist rebels holding more than 100 hostages in Peru released the Guatemalan Ambassador there in recognition of the negotiated end of the conflict here, he elaborated on that concern. "We're done with the first stage, and now comes the hard part," he said. "It's going to be a real challenge."
The task is made all the more difficult by the very scope of the preliminary agreements that Mr. Arzu's Government and the leaders of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity have already signed under United Nations auspices.
 
Programs for Peace, And Appeals for Funds
Altogether, there are 11 such accords, ranging from those that guarantee Indians' rights and land reform to others that reduce the size and authority of the all-powerful 46,000-member armed forces and provide for the resettlement of refugees and displaced people.
"With peace, there are going to be a lot of expectations and demands," said Jorge Briz Abularach, president of the country's leading business federation. "But the underlying reality will continue to be the same until we can change it, and the only way we can do that is through development and dialogue."
Carrying out all the programs required by the agreements, from bilingual schools for Indian children to vocational training programs for former guerrillas, will require a huge investment much beyond Guatemala's capacity. Mr. Arzu estimated that nearly $2.3 billion would be needed during the next four years, and said he was counting on the international community to supply about two-thirds of that amount.
"One of Arzu's worst nightmares is that this is going to fail," said a diplomat here. "He needs tangible results in the first year so that people don't give up on this and go back to recrimination."
Mr. Gutierrez is a Kanjobal Indian who spent a decade in the United States after fleeing army and death-squad massacres in his home village in the late 1970's. Interviewed at a bus station in the market town of Chichicastenango, he said he was hoping the Government would give priority to programs that will help his two children, such as education and health. A bystander, Crispin Perez Ixtuc, 74, interrupted to say that roads, electricity and running water were even more important, but then thought again.
"There's no point in arguing about this," he said. "The truth is that we need everything, and the sooner the better."
 
Words of Skepticism And of Apocalypse
How much money will be available remains uncertain, at least until Guatemala sits down with donors in Brussels next month. Friendly countries and international organizations have already underwritten similar processes in neighboring El Salvador and in Nicaragua, and are showing signs of fatigue.
"I have my doubts we will get that much money," said Mr. Briz, the business leader. "These days, countries don't have enough money to solve their own problems, let alone those of others."
The United States, which organized the 1954 military coup that started the cycle of Government-sponsored violence and repression here, is a case in point. Though American officials say they hope to double the figure quickly, the Clinton Administration has committed about $40 million in grants and other aid to Guatemala next year, down from $90 million in 1991.
"Guatemala took too long, if you will," said an official. "If they had done this at the same time as El Salvador, there would have been plenty to go around."
Mr. Arzu is further hamstrung by the debility of almost every Government agency, chronically underfinanced because the war machine has traditionally eaten up the largest chunk of the budget. Other than its military or police garrisons, the Government simply does not have a presence in many areas in the interior of the country, and the demobilization of the security forces leaves a vacuum in many areas.
"They see the way forward very clearly," a European diplomat said of Mr. Arzu and his team. "The problem is implementation. An extremely weak state structure has to carry the burden of an extremely ambitious program."
Even before the final document has been signed, naysayers are weighing in with apocalyptic predictions. Humberto Preti, president of the national association of ranchers and landowners, argues that the accords on the rights of Indian peoples and on land tenure are "ill conceived" ventures that will reignite land disputes that are centuries old and encourage Indian peasants to invade and seize large estates.
"The assumption is that all the various indigenous peoples, despite their 23 different languages, are united by the same ideology, religion and customs, which is not at all the case," he said in an interview. "If this isn't handled intelligently, it could generate a situation of ethnic strife like that of Bosnia."
In the military, whose ranks and budget are to be thinned by at least a third under the accords, there is resentment of the imminent passing of the status quo. Soldiers feel that they won the war on the battlefield only to lose out at the negotiating table, because of external pressures, to an enemy they still view as untrustworthy.
"The guerrillas had better keep their end of the bargain," a lieutenant in charge of a military checkpoint in Quiche province grumbled earlier this month, speaking on condition that he not be identified. "There are going to be a lot of officers without troops to command, so if the Reds start making mischief again, it's going to be tough to put them back in their place."
But many people seem equally concerned about what soldiers will be doing once they are demobilized. In recent months the country has seen a wave of kidnappings, killings and robberies in which former combatants on both sides, taking advantage of the reorganization of security forces, have been implicated.
 
Amnesty Law Leads To Feeling of Cynicism
"These guys are a threat to everyone's security because the only things they know how to do are fight and shoot," said Luis Fernando Palma, a marketing executive who lives in the capital. "They can't get jobs, so they turn from political violence to ordinary violence and common crime."
Cynicism about the peace process has further been fed by the amnesty law Congress approved two weeks ago. For 20 years, Rolando Rodas, 44, an accountant, has been hoping that the man he believes to be his brother's killer, the chief bodyguard of a death-squad leader, would eventually be brought to justice.
"He hasn't spent a day in jail, and now, because of this, it's even more unlikely that he ever will," Mr. Rodas said. "Respect for human rights has to be the foundation of everything, and I don't see that that has been achieved."
Indians, who bore the brunt of the fighting just as they have had to bear racial discrimination for centuries, have an even longer list of grievances and demands. Not only do they want those who obliterated hundreds of their villages held accountable for their actions, but they also feel they can now insist on playing the leading role due them as the majority of the Guatemalan population.
"This cannot be just a peace for the criollos and the ladinos," Miguel Rosales Tahy, 64, a Quiche Indian who grows broccoli on a plot of land near San Jose de Argueta, said, referring to people of European and mixed-race descent. "It has to be a peace for everyone, us indigenous people too, in every corner of the country."
Yet there is also confidence that Mr. Arzu, who has proven to be a tough and resourceful leader in less than a year in office, is up to the task. Even as the negotiations were going on, he did not hesitate to purge the army officer corps twice, sack various local police chiefs and order the arrest of a top customs official accused of skimming millions of dollars in state revenues.
"Nobody thought this war could be resolved at the negotiating table," said Mario Flores Ortiz, majority leader for the ruling National Advancement Party in Guatemala's one-chamber Congress. "But our platform was to end the war, and we have done it."
Now it is time for his fellow citizens to rise to the challenge, Mr. Arzu suggested. That the peace agreement is the end of one phase is clear, he indicated; whether it will also prove to be the start of another remains to be seen.
"This brings a close to a very painful period in our history," he said. "Of course it will depend on Guatemalans, because I cannot make peace all by myself just by signing some documents. Peace is something we are going to have to achieve all together, in our hearts. It will mean nothing if I sign a general peace and everyone is planning to continue with their private wars."

Chronology: "Guatemala: 40 Years of Conflict"
 
1954 President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman, a supporter of land reform viewed with suspicion by American banana companies that dominate the economy, is overthrown in a coup organized by the Central Intelligence Agency. The military takes power.
 
1957 After suspending constitutional guarantees and violently suppressing the left, Arbenz's successor, Col. Carlos Castillo Armas, is assassinated by a disgruntled palace guard.
 
1960 A military uprising fails, but some rebel officers take to the mountains, where, inspired by the Cuban Revolution, they study Marxism-Leninism and form the kernel of the first guerrilla insurgency.
 
1966 United States sends Green Berets and spends millions of dollars to help train the Guatemalan Armed Forces. More than 8,000 people are killed in the resulting counterinsurgency campaign, and army-organized death squads appear.
 
1968 Facing defeat in the countryside, guerrillas retreat to cities and adopt an urban warfare strategy. The American Ambassador, John Gordon Mein, and his West German counterpart are kidnapped and killed.
 
1971 Gen. Carlos Arana Osorio becomes President and starts a "pacification" campaign that steps up pace of killing and disappearances. Systematic vote fraud assures continued military control. "If it is necessary to turn the country into a cemetery in order to pacify it, I will not hesitate to do so," he proclaims.
 
1978 Responding to massacres of peasants, widespread human rights violations and election fraud, the Carter Administration bans arms sales to Guatemalan Army.
 
1981-1983 Peak of military counterinsurgency efforts, especially after Gen. Efrain Rios Montt seizes power early in 1982. Hundreds of Indian villages are destroyed, thousands of people are killed and many more either displaced or driven into exile, largely by "civilian self-defense patrols" forcibly recruited by Armed Forces among Indian peasants.
 
1982 Four guerrilla groups join to form Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity.
 
1983 The Reagan Administration resumes arms sales, with official American economic and military aid following in 1985.
 
1986 A popularly elected civilian takes office as President for the first time in 20 years. But the President, Vinicio Cerezo, proves corrupt and ineffective, and the military remains the chief power.
 
1990 After years of informal contacts, guerrillas and the Government begin peace talks in Norway. United States again bans military aid because of widespread human rights abuses.
 
1993 President Jorge Serrano attempts to suspend Constitution and dissolve congress, but is driven from office by a coalition between civilian opposition and the military. His successor, Ramiro de Leon Carpio, makes some initial progress in peace talks, but process later stalls.
 
1996 A conservative businessman, Alvaro Arzu, is elected President after promising that he will bring a negotiated end to the civil war, now in its 36th year. A cease-fire in March is followed by several other major accords. Final toll of the war: at least 100,000 dead, an estimated 40,000 disappeared, and more than a million people driven from their homes.

HEADLINE: Peru's Growth Leaving Poor Behind

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The Marxist guerrilla group holding 83 hostages at the Japanese Ambassador's residence here has long sought to promote a Robin Hood image of stealing from the rich to help the poor.
As a condition to free their captives, 20 more of whom were released this evening, the guerrillas have demanded that the Government revamp its economic policies. Those policies have curbed runaway inflation and fueled huge growth as measured by gross domestic product but have so far failed to produce new jobs, higher wages or better social conditions for poor Peruvians. 
 By insisting that the Government do more to help the poor, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, which takes its inspiration from the Cuban revolution, has focused new attention on the debate over economic reform and the poor that sharply divides Peru and much of Latin America.
While they do not sympathize with the guerrilla insurgency, many politicians, economists and advocates for the poor have called for major changes in Peru's economic plan, even as the Government of President Alberto K. Fujimori and foreign investors tout the benefits of the neo-liberal economic model.
"The takeover of the Japanese residence gives pause to the free marketers who have implemented economic liberalizations without a human face," said David Scott Palmer, a political science professor at Boston University who specializes in Latin America.
"As they restructure the economies of Latin America, governments have to provide resources for the disadvantaged, or they can expect more social unrest like what we are seeing in Peru," Mr. Palmer said.
The rebels, who are also seeking the release of their jailed comrades, have said the main reason they took up arms in 1984 was to fight for an improvement of the economic conditions that they say have impoverished most Peruvians.
"During all of Mr. Fujimori's Government, this situation has not changed, and moreover it has gotten worse, and today the poor in Peru have increased dramatically," the rebels said in a statement read by freed hostages this week. "It is for them that we continue our fight."
After a debt crisis, deep recession and loss of investor confidence in the 1980's, Latin American governments began deregulating their once-closed economies, selling unprofitable state-owned industries and changing labor and social legislation.
The proponents of the so-called neoliberal policies promised to make Latin America countries more efficient, stabilize inflation, improve productivity, attract foreign investment, create new jobs and in the long run improve social conditions.
Peru became a showcase for those economic changes, which reduced inflation from 7,650 percent in 1990 when Mr. Fujimori took office to 10 percent now. In 1994, with 13 percent growth in the gross domestic product, Peru had the most robust economy in the world, although it had only modest growth this year.
Billions of dollars of foreign investment have changed the face of Peru's capital, Lima, which now has new office towers, five-star hotels, elegant shops and franchises with United States companies. While the wealthy benefited greatly from the economic growth, the poor are still waiting for the "economic miracle" to be translated into meaningful jobs, better health care, education and other Government services.
Close to half of Peru's 24 million people live in poverty, 85 percent of workers do not have full-time jobs and some 93 percent of children do not have access to school books.
Manuel Benza, a former member of the Peruvian Congress who is now a sociology professor at the University of Huacho, said the portion of the population living in poverty had increased to 49 percent from 46 percent in the last two years, mainly because of economic policies.
As the economy has become more efficient, the public and private sectors have let go hundreds of thousands of workers. But the Government has not focused on social programs like training for laid-off employees, education, health care and housing.
"The cost of the reform has been distributed in a very unequal way, with the poor bearing most of the burden," said Pedro Sainz, an economist for the United Nation's Economic Commission on Latin America and the Caribbean. "The new, more efficient system needs fewer people to produce the same thing, and without a safety net you end up with more poor. That is true for Peru and many other countries."
In Argentina, for example, workers have staged national strikes to protest the Government's economic policies, which have tamed inflation but have led to record unemployment and left millions of people, who long depended on the state, without a safety net.
But many analysts say that changing Peru's economic plan to devote more resources to social spending could cause a flight of capital from investors and lead to a devaluation of currency and higher inflation.
The country is on a very tight budget. Its current account deficit -- a measure of its trade in goods, services and investments -- was nearly 8 percent of gross domestic product last year, and the country is one of the most indebted in Latin America.
The economic situation has been made worse by a recession resulting from major cuts in public spending that have been imposed to meet debt payments. As a result, Peru's economy grew 6.7 percent last year, and projections for this year's growth are as low as 2 percent.
Business executives recently set free by the guerrillas have said that based on conversations with the leader of Tupac Amaru, Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, the rebels agreed with many facets of the Government's economic program, including privatizing some public enterprises and opening markets.
But the executives said Mr. Cerpa had criticized the Government's sale of Peru's oil and electric companies because the Government had not taken steps to insure that consumers' interests would be protected. Mr. Cerpa said he would not sell what he called strategic public companies, they said.
The rebel leader was also said to be in favor of opening Peru's markets and gaining membership in regional trading blocs. "The main part of the economic model they don't like is that the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer," said Manuel Romero Caro, a former hostage who is director of Gestion, a leading financial publication.
"For this reason Tupac Amaru would focus economic development on the agricultural and industrial sectors, which they believe would provide more jobs, as opposed to mining and capital-intensive industries," Mr. Romero said.
Despite the latest rebel attack, investors have so far expressed confidence in Peru. Stocks and bonds declined modestly in the days after the assault, which came on the evening of Dec. 17, but they have regained most of their losses.
Local and foreign investors defended Peru's economic program, saying poverty and the large disparity in income distribution had existed before the policies were put in place.
"It's difficult to wave a magic wand over decades-long problems and see them immediately wiped away," said Larry Goodman, an economist for Salomon Brothers. "The economic reform process will take a minimum of a decade to reach fruition. To suddenly see income distribution change is an unrealistic perspective."
Although the Tupac Amaru rebels have shown that Peru is not yet free of guerrillas, the concern of most Peruvians is no longer personal security, but rather their economic situation. "There is a direct link between poverty and terrorism," said Mr. Palmer, the political science professor. "But you can't hope to eliminate guerrilla groups until you give people hope, and then you have to follow through."

HEADLINE: Urban Sprawl Strains Western States

SERIES: BECOMING LOS ANGELES -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: CAREFREE, Ariz.

 BODY:
The plane dips below the brown cloud and lands in the urban heart of the American Southwest: hope, commerce and chaos stretched to the horizon in the Sonoran Desert. Consuming land at the rate of an acre an hour, metropolitan Phoenix -- and its new frontiers like Carefree -- is now bigger than Delaware.
You drive to Scottsdale, a gangly suburb. It is brimming with prosperity, resorts and lawyers in tank-tops doing business by cellular phone in the shade of saguaro cacti. 
 In 1950, barely 2,000 people lived on the single square mile that was Scottsdale; today it is three times the physical size of San Francisco, with 165,000 people.
After coursing through traffic for nearly an hour, you arrive at the edge of the megalopolis. Here the desert buckles up toward national forest land, in the sweet-smelling exurb of Carefree. Developers are scraping away mesquite and paloverde, replacing them with signs offering "one-acre lots in a future gated community."
But after years of being restrained only by how fast it could pour concrete, Phoenix may finally be reaching its limit.
The air is so bad at times that people who came to the desert seeking good health are warned to stay indoors. While some schools have swimming pools, others are short of textbooks and a Federal court has ordered the system to get more state financing. And something called "the inner city," built about 30 years ago, is an urban orphan -- denounced for its crime, racial conflict and abandonment.
It was not supposed to be this way, this early. Phoenix, like other Western cities swollen with California exiles, has matured under a mantra that it would not become another Los Angeles -- an all-purpose put-down. Community leaders vowed to build a new kind of American city here in the desert and in places like Seattle, Salt Lake City and Denver, cities close to nature, livable and sustainable.
But as the urban West goes through the third major growth boom in four decades, some Western cities are becoming their worst nightmare. Los Angeles symptoms -- bad-air alerts, traffic gridlock, loss of open space, huge gulfs between the rich and the poor -- are becoming impossible to ignore.
For all their open space, the 13 states of the West make up the most urban region in America. Sixty years ago, little more than half of all Westerners lived in cities. Today, 86 percent reside in urban areas. Utah, at 87 percent, has a higher percentage of city dwellers than New York, at 80 percent, according to a Census Bureau ranking of people who live in places with at least 2,500 people or a density of 1,000 per square mile.
The new urban West has 6 of the 15 fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the nation. They are the magazine-cover cities: the trendy, high-tech centers of Seattle and Portland, Ore., flourishing in a climate with eight months of drizzle; the nature-defying desert cities of Phoenix and Las Vegas, paradise for developers, and the Rocky Mountain kingdoms of Denver and Salt Lake City, thriving on their proximity to vertical playgrounds.
On average, these metropolitan areas are growing by 50,000 people a year. Their new jobs come from the kind of industries that are made for a world economy: tourism, telecommunications, trade and computer technology. These cities consider themselves blessed by nature and circumstance.
"There's a pride people take once they move here, people pinching themselves as they say, 'God, I'm glad I'm here,' " said Dr. Ray Studer, director of the Urban and Regional Planning Program at the University of Colorado in Boulder. "That's sometimes followed by, 'Now let's close the door.' "
But as healthy as these cities are in jobs and scenery, they, like California, are discovering that luck, benign climate and optimism are not enough.
Indirectly, some of these cities have put the full force of their taxpayer-financed infrastructure behind urban sprawl. Taxes paid for roads that quickly brought fourfold increases in congestion and dirty air. And the very tax structure that attracted new industries and home builders with promises of rock-bottom property-tax rates is now crippling schools and fostering a shortage of parks and community space.
"My rule of thumb is that the faster the rate of sprawl, the faster the rate of abandonment," said David Rusk, the former Mayor of Albuquerque, N.M., who has studied urban patterns in more than 300 cities. "You look at Detroit, which has lost a million or so people. It consumed land at 13 times the rate of population growth."
Some people attribute the bloated urban areas to a political climate that holds private property concerns up as a sacred right and is opposed to taxes intended to finance the ultimate cost of growth. Under the flag of property rights, developers have been able to resist efforts to curb excess, or set aside open space.
"It's an old Western ethic: don't tell me what to do on my property," said Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado. But others say the paving of paradise is happening at an incremental enough rate that few people see the big picture.
"We are repeating the mistakes of L.A.," said Steven Boand, the former Mayor of Castle Rock, a city of 16,000 people just south of Denver. "But it's happening slowly, so that the average Joe only sees part it, like the traffic congestion, and doesn't connect it to everything else."
Only Portland, which long ago decided to defy the boom mentality and consciously design a future city, seems situated to enter the new century without having to spend billions of dollars to fix problems brought by excesses at the end of the old century.
"These cities all think they're special, because they're set in such special places," said Robert Liberty, the director of 1,000 Friends of Oregon, a group that monitors urban growth issues. "But they are delusional."
 
The Symptoms
Growth, Congestion And Polluted Air
In Phoenix, where the sound of air-powered nail guns is almost a civic anthem, there is a group called "Not L.A.," reflecting the general sentiment of people trying to avoid past urban mistakes.
But the city of Phoenix, with just over a million people, now surpasses Los Angeles, which has three times as many people, in sprawl, its city limits covering 469 square miles. Most days, its air is among the dirtiest in the nation, outside of Southern California.
"I've been driving from one meeting about sprawl to the other for the last 15 years, and the only thing that's changed is that now it takes a lot longer to get there," said Rob Melnick, director of the Morrison Institute for Public Policy at Arizona State University. Las Vegas, the fastest growing city in the United States throughout the 1990's, now ranks among the five metropolitan areas with the worst air. The region will reach the limit of its current water supply within the next 10 years or so. Just a five-hour drive across the desert from Southern California, Las Vegas has become, in some respects, the ultimate extension of Los Angeles.
In keeping with its founding character, the city is jazzy and electric, with 9 of the 10 largest hotels in the world.
The construction crane is the most common city bird. There is a labor shortage. New residents come for the climate and for the hyperactive job market in construction and gambling. Thousands of stucco-walled, red-roof-tiled homes on artificial lakes are sold for nearly half the price they would fetch in metropolitan Los Angeles.
But putting a city that may soon be bigger than Detroit in an area that receives only four inches of rain a year has forced a reckoning. Unlike Arizona, which requires proof of a 100-year water supply before development can go forward, Las Vegas promises water to virtually all new developments -- regardless of the prospect of shortages.
The city's initial reaction to its water deficit, in the early 1990's, was to put a moratorium on new development. But after coming under heavy pressure from home builders and hotels, Las Vegas again opened the gates to unrestricted growth in 1992.
Following a path taken by Los Angeles when it tripled in size near the turn of the century, Las Vegas is going after distant water supplies in the fragile desert, and it has threatened to sue if it does not get a change in how water in the West is allocated.
Some new Denver suburbs are projected to run out of water within a decade. But what people living along the Front Range in Colorado complain about most is the loss of open space. From Fort Collins in the north to Colorado Springs in the south, a swath of beige-colored, two-story homes and boxy megastores has been planted along a 110-mile strip, with Denver in the middle.
"I can't believe that you all want to become one big city," Governor Romer said this year at a conference on growth, where he warned of Los Angeles-style problems.
The last Denver boom, nearly 20 years ago, came from big oil, mining and coal companies, ripping open the Rockies to meet energy needs. This time, it is nonpolluting industries, and Denver has become the cable television capital of the world.
On the other side of the Rockies, in Salt Lake City, is a mirror image of greater Denver's problems. Nearly 80 percent of Utah's two million people live along an 80-mile urban strip abutting the Wasatch Mountain Front. There is full employment, with thousands of new jobs in high-tech firms.
But it has come at a price. The New York-New Jersey metropolitan area has better air quality than the Salt Lake Valley when measured for carbon monoxide, one of the main components of unhealthy air.
City officials say that unless Salt Lake acts to limit sprawl and curb auto emissions, the face it will present to the world during the 2002 Winter Olympics could be obscured by a soup of pollutants.
Seattle, often rated the most livable city in America, now ranks among the top five worst cities for traffic congestion. Residents in a 60-mile-long metropolitan area, hemmed in by Puget Sound on one side and the Cascade Mountains on the other, have just voted to build a $4 billion mass transit system and have adopted strict laws to end sprawl.
But many fear that Seattle, as it goes through yet another enormous population surge prompted by job growth at the Boeing Company and the Microsoft Corporation, will become a city where only the upper middle class can afford to own homes.
The Microsoft millionaires, about 3,000 past or present employees of the software company who made it big on stock appreciation, are a dominant obsession in the area as they build waterfront techno-castles on Lake Washington.
But with the state projecting that 300,000 more people will move into the Seattle metropolitan area in just the next four years -- the biggest growth spurt since the monumental hiring binge at Boeing during World War II -- political leaders say there will be a severe shortage of moderate-priced housing in the area.
 
How It Happened
Using Expansion To Pay for More
American cities form in a blink, and that is particularly true in the West. California had the first big wave of auto-driven urban centers in the West. They promised the best of all worlds: orderly city life just down the road from orange blossoms or walnut groves.
It changed almost overnight. In the 1930's, California's population was at 4 million -- not far from where Colorado is today -- and Los Angeles County was still one of the country's leading agricultural producers.
By 1994, California's population hit 32 million, and more than 500,000 jobs, net, disappeared from the state in the 1990's. The ironic highlight, perhaps, was a 1994 report issued by the Bank of America on the dangers of California-style growth.
Titled "Beyond Sprawl," the document stunned some people with its blunt conclusions. "Unchecked sprawl has shifted from an engine of California's growth to a force that now threatens to inhibit growth and degrade the quality of life," the report said. "We can no longer afford the luxury of sprawl."
The report had all the more power, coming from a bank that had financed much of the sprawl. But just as California was having second thoughts, the newly robust Western cities were going down a path taken by the Golden State.
Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Phoenix and some Denver suburbs went on road-building binges and offered cheap land, low taxes and minimal interference for developers.
Water, always a problem in the arid West, was offered with few restrictions. At a cost of more than $4 billion, most of it financed by Federal tax dollars, water from the Colorado River was brought to Phoenix and Tucson, through the Central Arizona Project.
Phoenix completed the Superstition Freeway, going east; bulldozers followed. It is sometimes called the "Cul de Sac Freeway," because a nearly 50-mile stretch of developments has built up on both sides of the road.
The huge new developments that are taking root here lure buyers with a promise of a secluded desert life style. And indeed, coyotes and javelinas dash across fresh pavement. Herons swoop for prey on golf course lakes. But there is less seclusion and less desert with every passing hour.
The Arizona Republic has been publishing a series on sprawl titled, "An Acre an Hour." In the nearly three years that the series has been appearing, 25,000 acres of Sonoran Desert have disappeared to pavement.
"Nobody in this town has ever said no to a developer," said Don Steuter, an air-conditioner repairman and avid hiker who has been fighting the new developments on the northern edge of Phoenix. "We spend tax dollars to encourage sprawl, and then it comes back to us as air pollution."
Seattle, using Federal dollars, completed Interstate 90, the most costly seven-mile stretch of road ever built at the time, $1.5 billion. Finished in 1991, it cleared an eight-lane path through the forest east of Lake Washington and encouraged development in the Cascade foothills.
What road building did to further sprawl, certain tax structures did to create budget crises. Utah has passed a law that stipulated that as property values rise, the tax rate of a given area must fall. It has also limited what localities can charge developers for new services like roads and sewers.
The result, some officials say, is that each new home in suburban Salt Lake City puts local government further in debt. And there have been plenty of new homes -- 200,000 people, enough to create a city bigger than Salt Lake, have moved to the greater metropolitan area in the last five years.
"What happens as we build new subdivisions is that there has been a crisis in local government," said Michael Christensen, director of the Utah Foundation, a think tank.
Colorado's tax structure indirectly encourages smaller cities on the edge of expanding urban areas to build malls or other commercial structures, killing their main street businesses. Unable to raise property taxes beyond a certain ceiling, local governments are forced to get most of their money from as many retail outlets as they can attract.
"We were losing all our sales tax dollars to these big regional malls," Mr. Boand said. "To compensate, we were forced to let a big outlet mall come in here. We were roundly criticized for that, but our town was teetering on the verge of bankruptcy."
Castle Rock is in Douglas County, the fastest growing county in America, by percentage, over the last five years. It grew 65 percent, to a population of 100,000. The fact that it could nearly go broke in the midst of an unprecedented boom says something about how the new urban West is developing.
The biggest development in Douglas County is Highlands Ranch, an unincorporated community of more than 10,000 new homes on broad streets in the wind-swept, treeless prairie just south of Denver. Some of the homes look as if they were just dropped from the sky, on streets named for endangered species like the spotted owl.
The school district in the area is building nine new schools, but it still cannot keep up. Many children are taught in modular classrooms. Because Colorado's tax structure limits the percentage of money a district can get from property taxes, a booming county like Douglas sees hardly any new money from a huge surge in population.
As a result, Douglas County is not only the fastest-growing school district in the state, but it also has nearly the lowest per-student spending ratio, said Jill Fox, a spokeswoman for the Douglas County schools.
New but malnourished schools, subsidized sprawl, tax structures that ultimately bankrupt growing communities -- these problems were never part of the master plan.
 
The Coming Crises
New Roads Lead To More Trouble
 Major floods used to be quarter-century events in the Puget Sound region. Now, almost every winter, the river valleys east of Seattle swell with coffee-colored water and overwhelm roads and farms.
The fastest-growing suburbs like Issaquah and Redmond used to be sponges that soaked up winter rains. But now the horror of winter storms in Southern California is a Seattle occurrence: water runs down fresh-paved cul-de-sacs and crushes everything below.
"The sponge is full," said Tom Koney, a policy analyst with King County, which governs the Seattle metropolitan area.
In effect, nature is forcing a crisis. In the arid West, the absence of water is forcing the cities to confront the consequences of their new popularity; in Seattle, the presence of water is doing the same.
"It was only when the latest rating came out, showing that our air is the second worst in the country, that the business community here in Phoenix finally freaked out," said Mr. Melnick, of the Arizona think tank.
The new proposals by the Environmental Protection Agency to tighten the standards for unhealthy levels of soot and smog have raised alarms throughout the West. The cities that fail to comply could face a loss of Federal road money or other sanctions that could stifle their ambitions.
Denver, following the lead of Seattle and Portland, is likely to vote on a mass transit proposal next year. Salt Lake City is planning a small light rail system.
But in the next 5 to 10 years, there will be a severe crunch, city officials throughout the West say. Utah is $3 billion short of the money it needs just to keep up with basic road repair and improvements in the new suburban areas. Colorado is $8 billion short.
Still, pouring more pavement is the option of choice. "We're going to build roads, and lots of them," Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, Republican of Utah, said after playing host to a statewide growth conference last year.
But if past patterns are an indication, every mile of new road brings with it an increase in some of the worst urban ills these cities say they are trying to avoid.
California's population grew by 50 percent from 1970 to 1990, but the number of miles traveled by cars and trucks in the state increased 100 percent. In the decade from 1980 to 1990, the population around Seattle rose 22 percent while the number of miles driven by cars in the region quadrupled.
Similarly, traffic in Denver has increased at twice the rate of local population growth. So, even though the city has made big strides in getting rid of its brown cloud, with cleaner cars burning cleaner fuels, the huge increase in traffic brought by sprawl threatens to undermine all the gains, city officials say.
"What are we doing here?" Governor Romer said. "Nothing brings this whole issue home more clearly than when you fly over the Front Range and look down and see this gigantic city taking shape, sprawling more than a hundred miles. Is this what we want?"
Trying to cope, edges of the new cities are taking somewhat panicky, small measures. Redmond, where Microsoft is based, is planning to impose a head tax -- charging businesses $65 annually for every employee who works in the city.
Gilbert, a Phoenix suburb that is adding 10,000 people a year, just enacted a moratorium on the building of new homes. The city grew by 412 percent in the 1980's, and it may surpass that in the 1990's. It charges developers up to $1,800 per home for services, but that does not begin to pay for all the other problems that come with building a sudden city out of nowhere, town officials say.
"We say we don't want to be like Los Angeles, and yet we are," said Phyliss Alberty, the Gilbert town clerk.
The first occupants of Phoenix, the Hohokam people, built more than 200 miles of irrigation channels and then vanished 500 years ago. The current residents like to point out that they have more canals than Venice; but they, too, wonder whether they are building a city that might end up as an archeological curiosity.

HEADLINE: Steep Drop in Random Killings Signals Shift in New York Crime

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Murder by strangers has declined more than twice as much as murder by acquaintances over four years in New York City, part of a pronounced shift in both the nature and scope of homicide in the city.
The city is almost certain to end the year with fewer than 1,000 murders, the lowest level since 1968, newly released police records show. 
 The figures offer a measure of relief from one particularly jarring brand of urban terror: random violence. The percentage of victims killed by strangers dropped to 19 percent this year, from 37 percent in 1993. There were fewer murders in public places, fewer murders stemming from spontaneous disputes and robberies, fewer drug-related murders and fewer murders committed by teen-agers. Four out of every five murder victims knew their killers.
While the overall number of murder victims has fallen, the drop in the number killed by strangers is particularly striking. That figure is down by 74 percent over four years, while the number of those killed by acquaintances is down by 36 percent.
"The city is now safer in that, one, you are less likely to be murdered, and two, you are less likely to be attacked by a stranger," Police Commissioner Howard Safir said. "It's the kind of thing that people always talk about, that if you go to New York somebody's going to come out of an alley and shoot you."
And since success has many fathers, criminologists, sociologists, law-enforcement officials and politicians continue to debate where the credit belongs. Their theories about the declining number of murders, particularly random murders, range from the waning of the crack epidemic, the improving economy and the doubling of the prison population to new policing strategies, tougher gun control laws and the dismantling of major drug gangs.
While the homicide rate is falling across the nation, particularly in the biggest and most violent cities, New York's decline exceeds that of the country as a whole. With only three days left in the year, the tally of murder victims was 972, less than half what it was in 1990, when the city set a record for homicides with 2,245.
"When New York goes from 2,000 murders to 1,000, that's substantial," said Dr. Andrew Karmen, a professor of sociology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who studies the city's murder rate. "There is something very real happening. It is not a blip or a passing phenomenon."
The steepest decline in murders has been among black New Yorkers. According to data from the State Department of Health that Dr. Karmen analyzed, black New Yorkers were killed at the rate of about 31 per 100,000 in 1995, the latest statistics available, down from 53 per 100,000 in 1993. "It's still far above the national norm, and it's still much too high, but historically speaking it is the best it has been in 25 years," Dr. Karmen said.
The murder rate for Hispanic New Yorkers dropped to 18 per 100,000 in 1995 from 34 per 100,000 in 1993, while the murder rate for white New Yorkers remained constant, at around 7 per 100,000.
A critical factor, law-enforcement officials said, is that there seem to be fewer guns on the streets. Arrests for gun possession dropped by 20 percent this year, to 4,200, and there were 21 percent fewer shootings and 22 percent fewer shooting victims, according to police statistics. The proportion of murders committed with guns dropped to 67 percent this year from 75 percent in 1993.
Commissioner Safir credits the Police Department's crackdown on quality-of-life offenses -- like drinking beer in public, fare-beating in the subways and public urination -- with discouraging many people from carrying their guns.
"It is my belief that people who carry weapons in the city are less likely to carry them because there is a higher risk of being arrested for weapons possession by a police officer based on our quality-of-life enforcement, our roadblocks or drug initiatives," he said. "From the intelligence we get, people are stashing their weapons rather than carrying them."
Tougher gun control laws around the nation have made it harder for smugglers to buy guns in states with more permissive laws and then resell them illegally on the streets of New York. The Brady law, for example, requires a five-day waiting period to buy a handgun. And Virginia, once a main supplier of illegal guns in New York, has enacted a law limiting buyers to one gun a month.
But gun traffickers have moved on, the authorities said, particularly to the Carolinas and Florida.
The Police Department has teamed up with the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to break up gunrunning rings that have brought hundreds of guns into the city. In a recent case, bureau agents traced more than 150 guns that turned up in New York to a Federally licensed gun shop in Orlando, Fla.
An investigation led to three arrests, and all pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. Now the agency is trying to discourage small-time gunrunners who bring guns back to the city in dribs and drabs. "We continue to target the organized firearms trafficking rings, but we are also focusing on casual firearms traffickers," said Henry J. Ballas, the special agent in charge of the bureau's New York office.
Commissioner Safir said the country needed even more stringent gun control laws. "I believe what we need is a national one-gun-a-month law," he said. "I'm too much of a realist to believe we could get guns banned, but at least something that approaches sanity -- but is still not sane -- like a one-gun-a-month law would be incredibly helpful."
The murder rate fell the most in neighborhoods that were the city's most violent. For years, the city's deadliest precinct was the 75th in East New York, Brooklyn, where 110 people were murdered in 1993. This year, the toll was 35. Murders dropped by more than half in the 44th Precinct, in the Highbridge and East Tremont sections of the Bronx, to 17 this year from 43 last year.
The dismantling of several violent drug gangs appears to have stemmed the tide of murders in some neighborhoods. In northern Queens, for example, three gangs that officials said operated as murder and collection squads for the Cali drug cartel of Colombia were broken up after investigations by the police and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The police said they believed the gangs were responsible for up to 30 murders in Jackson Heights, Corona, Elmhurst and Long Island City in 1995. This year, the number of murders in northern Queens dropped to 60 from 113 the year before.
A similar trend can be seen in Manhattan Valley, where more than 100 members of rival drug gangs have been arrested in sweeps conducted by the Manhattan District Attorney's Homicide Investigation Unit and the Police Department. Murders in the 24th Precinct, which includes Manhattan Valley, have fallen to 7 this year from 21 in 1993.
Commissioner Safir said he expected crime to fall further because of two drug-fighting initiatives in northern Manhattan and northern Brooklyn. Both neighborhoods, major drug sites, have seen added officers patrolling the streets, more undercover officers buying drugs and guns and collecting intelligence on gangs and greater cooperation among city, state and Federal law-enforcement agencies, Mr. Safir said.
With arrests way up for low-level "quality of life" crimes, more people are being brought through the criminal justice system, fingerprinted and questioned about what they may know about more serious crimes. Some suspects tell the police the location of illegal weapons.
Others give information about bigger crimes. Last week, the police arrested a 19-year-old on a charge of selling marijuana, and the police said he confessed to being the lookout for the Dec. 21 robbery of a Queens check-cashing store that resulted in the murders of Charles A. Davis, an off-duty police officer moonlighting as a security guard, and Ira Epstein, the store's owner.
"We routinely ask, 'What do you know, what can you tell us?' " said one police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Ninety-nine out of a hundred times we get nothing, but once in while something breaks. The drop is not the result of any one thing, it's the payoff for a lot of little things like this."
But murders are not down everywhere. In the East Village, they climbed to 13 this year from 3 in 1995.
And for the friends and relatives of the 972 people who were killed, the figures offer cold comfort.
"The crime rate went down, but it didn't go down enough; I lost my sister," said Ethel Davis, 31, whose sister, Evelyn, was killed on Dec. 7 as she saved two friends at a social club in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, from robbers who tried to shoot them execution style. "That was the only sister I had. I'm glad they caught the guys, but it's not going to bring her back. I don't feel safe around here. She died right around the corner from the house."

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED: Sir Frank Whittle & Sir Arthur McDonald;
BRITAIN'S BRAIN DRAIN

BYLINE: By Nicholas Wade; Nicholas Wade is the science editor of The Times

 BODY:
1907-1996 Whittle got the first patents for a jet engine in 1930, at 23, but not the profits - his company was naitonalized in 1939.
1903-1996 McDonald led in the military application of radar. He later designed boats and became an Olympic sailor.
 
 THE SECOND WORLD War generated a burst of extraordinary inventiveness among Britain's scientists and engineers, spurring the creation of radar, the jet engine and forerunners of the computer. Two pioneers of that era died this year, having lived to see the world transformed by devices meant only to save their country.
 One was Sir Frank Whittle, whose concept of the jet engine was long ignored by his employer, the British Air Ministry. The first British fighter jets came into service in 1941, too late to have influenced the critical air battles with the Luftwaffe the previous year.
 The close-drawn victory was made possible by another innovation, one that the Air Ministry fortunately did embrace. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur McDonald, who died in July, was a career Royal Air Force officer who led the effort to put into military use the radio-detection finding technique, later known as radar. A network of radar stations that was already in place by 1939 proved invaluable in making themost of Britain's small number of interceptors.
 Many of the outstanding inventions of the war derived from ideas that were widespread among British, German and American scientists. But the British, perhaps because of their greater desperation, made particularly good use of the common pool.
 After the war, the efflorescence of British science and technology faded. The land of Newton and Darwin continued to produce outstanding scientists, but Britain's economy had long been hostile to innovation and failed to make use of this flowering of scientific talent. A second industrial revolution was not to be.
 Whittle's experiences were anything but encouraging to would-be inventors. His proposal for a jet-powered fighter was rejected by the Air Ministry in 1934, whereupon he raised a small sum and started a company, Power Jets Ltd., to prove the concept. In 1939 he at last received a contract from the Air Ministry but was then ordered to hand over all Power Jets production work to Rolls-Royce and other manufacturers.
 Whittle resigned from the Royal Air Force in 1948. In a long record of L100,000 by the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors. He also received a knighthood.
 Whittle immigrated to the United States after the war. So did his German rival, Dr. Hans J. P. von Ohain, who was better supported and got his jet engine to fly first, in 1939. Curiously, the two engineers formed a close friendship. Reconciled under American aegis, the two Europeans may have wryly reflected on the impact of their invention, so revoluntionary, so different from what each had intended.

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED: Irving Lewis;
THE NOBLE BUREAUCRAT

BYLINE: By Jason DeParle; Jason DeParle is a staff writer for the Magazine.

 BODY:
1918-1996 Those who came of age after Watergate cannot fathom an earlier generation's passion for Government service. Lewis went from the bottom of the budget Bureau to chief of its health and welfare divison, making him the most senior health expert as Medicare and Medicaid flew off L.B.J.'s drawing boards.
 
 HE WASN'T GIVEN TO GRIEVANCES, BUT one word bugged him: "bureaucrat." He would hear it bandied about in the decades after his retirement, when Government itself fell from favor and bureaucrat-bashing helped win votes. In speech, Irving J. Lewis avoided the word. In life, he ennobled it.
 A former counterintelligence agent who helped chase Nazis across Europe, Lewis gladly took a pay cut in 1947 to land a job at the elite Bureau of the Budget. To the outside world, the name conjured an image of soulless bookkeepers. But inside the White House, the agency's men felt a higher calling. (And they were all men, until Lewis hired the first permanent female budget examiner.) They considered themselves the President's "eyesand ears," his first source of intelligence on the ballooning Government beneath him. Joining the bureau as its power peaked, Lewis came to personify its twin traditions of long hours and high standards.
 Then as now, money was policy: where you spent it defined what you believed. Lewis's job was to insure that the President's spending reflected the President's beliefs, whoever the President happened to be. Lewis started as one of the 160 budget examiners who reviewed the Government's spending decisions, program by program; by the time he left the Budget Bureau, Lewis was overseeing and shaping health care expenditures that totaled billions. He helped Harry Truman build civilian airports, Dwight Eisenhower create the interstate highway system and Lyndon Johnson flesh out the Great Society.
 Government needs visionaries, but it needs master caftsmen too. Lewis was a craftsman. He could get things done. And did, even if it would have been easier to just say no. In 1964, the organization that would become the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had an unusual request that caused others to bristle. It wanted money from the Agency for International Development for a small West African experiement in smallpox control. But there were factions at A.I.D. who had no interest in ceding their money to a rival agency and argued that foreign aid should not be diverted to a domestic agency's research agenda. Convinced that the idea had merit, Lewis pushed it to fruition, having no idea that years later the experiment would lead to global eradication of the disease.
 Lewis believed in Government but no in free lunches. In 1968, he was already warning that health care expenditures could someday hold the Fedeal budget hostage. As spending spun out of control, he warned, the Government would lose its credibility as the arbiter of national disputes and seem like just another special interest. After starting a second career in 1970 as a professor of public policy, Lewis lived to see his forecast come true.

HEADLINE: COVER STORY;
Clothes That Make the Star, the Cast and the Show They're On

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
AS he maneuvers his 1971 yellow Barracuda through the hilly streets of San Francisco, Don Johnson exudes a kind of don't-mess-with-me cool that has been as carefully conceived as the color of his car, which he admits had to be repainted several times until just the right shade was achieved. In the CBS police detective drama "Nash Bridges," he said he felt it was important to come up with the right look, as he did for "Miami Vice" in the 1980's. So Mr. Johnson, who is also the show's executive producer, and Richard van Ernst, a San Francisco costume designer, created a uniform for Nash: he wears a T-shirt under a vest (one of them always brightly colored), khaki pants or bluejeans, a blazer (often with an unusual detail like plaid shoulders) and, of course, his signature wire-rimmed sunglasses.
"I noticed in San Francisco everyone wears layers because the weather's so unpredictable," Mr. Johnson said recently. "It's a functional look. But more importantly, I wanted the actors to wear a certain amount of color so they popped against the gray-and-beige background of the city." 
 Executive producers like Mr. Johnson as well as costume designers on many of today's television series have begun to sound like architects when explaining the wardrobes they choose for a show: like the silhouette of a new building, clothes, they say, must be sensitive to the place. Series that are set on the West Coast tend to have far more colorful wardrobes, reflecting the way people dress in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Those on the East Coast tend to echo fashion trends in places like New York, where black is everyone's favorite color and women these days are seen wearing skinny-legged pants and men are in Gap-style casual classics.
Mr. von Ernst said his choice of clothes reflected the show's overall design concept: deconstructivism, or a departure from original classic forms and shapes. He prefers asymmetry, clothes that are just a bit offbeat, like jackets with slanted pockets and unusual, often strong colors. "I take elements from different periods of American 20th-century fashions from the late 20's through the 50's and then mix them with elements that are common in clothes today," he said.
All of Mr. Johnson's jackets are custom-made by a tailor in Los Angeles. Many of the vests are specially made too, others are from vintage clothing stores and some are bought off-the-rack. "I do something with color in every episode," he said.
The cast of "Clueless," another series set on the West Coast, never wears black, brown or gray. Mona May, the costume designer who created the clothes for the movie as well as for the ABC series, said she had tried to bring back sweet dressing for teen-agers. "Away with grunge!" Ms. May proclaimed. "This show is not about fashion but about style, about taking what's out there and making the girls young and pretty." Because the story line calls for teen-age schoolgirls who, by definition, are preoccupied with clothes, the parade of outfits is as important as the characters themselves. But since Ms. May has about 60 changes to worry about each week, she does not have time to have everything specially designed. Instead, she studies European fashion magazines and constantly shops showrooms, researching what's hip and new. This results in a mix of clothes from everywhere. There are outfits from high-end designers like Donna Karan, Gianni Versace and Dolce & Gabbana, and ones from little-known manufacturers in the United States and abroad.
 "Everything is custom fit, even a $12.99 shirt," she said. "and I like to show things before they hit the stores." But she is careful to stay away from making the girls to obvious. "No cleaverage, no high heels, nothing too tight," she added.
 Accessories are as important as the clothes themselves, with matching hats, handbags and coats. And in scenes where there are many teen-agers, everyone is coordinated with one another. "I rarely repeat an outfit," Ms. May said. "And most fo the clothes are in vibrant shades: pinks, yellows and lime greens." On the question of whether the show is making an effort to set fashion trends, Ms. May said definitely not. "If you see the show five years from now I think it will still look pretty and stylish, not dated."
 The costume designers who have created the hip look for the cast of "Moesha" like the idea of setting tends. "That's No. 1 for us," said Yolanda Braddy, the costume designer for this UPN series about a girl growing up in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles. "We want to be the first out there with fashion, style and color."
 Susan Moses, who does the singer and actress Brandy Norwood's dressing for her part as Moesha Mitchell as well as for her personal appearances, describes herself as a constant shopper. "I get clothes everywhere, from designers like Moda, Gaultier, Moschino and Todd Oldham to Esprit and Gues, and then I mix it all up." Chocolate brown and black are Moesha's favorite colors, and Ms. Moses says she likes to pair them with hot colors like a brigth orange velour sweater or hot green boots. "We try to keep it bright; the look is everything from Afro-eccentric to urban wear," she said. The character of Q. Moesha's boyfriend, played by Fredro Starr, is the show's one East Coast character; Ms. Braddy has dressed him in camouflage, but not your typical green camouflage. Q ears a gray and blue combination with a matching bandana tied in different ways. "Whenever I go to New York I'm always watching the kids on the streets," said Ms. Braddy. "I take a Polaroid so I can remember what I've seen."
 Ms. Braddy said viewers notice how everyon e on the show dresses. Every week there are calls and mail asking where to get some of the clothes, she added.
 Debra McGuire, the costume designer for "Friends," says that NBC show is also besieged by viewers. "They want to know where to get the socks and V-neck T-shirts; often they ask for the oddest things," said Ms. McGuire. Since the show is set in New York but filmed in Los Angeles, Ms. McGuire always has to tone things down. "I design about 30 percent of the girls' wardrobes myself. The rest comes from all over, thrift shops and some designers. Each character has her own style and personality. Phoebe, because of her eccentric nature, tends to wear more color and jewelry. Color is played down because the sets are so vibrant. Monica's apartment has so many things in it. I want the characters to look soft."
Ms. McGuire said she also tried to make sure the characters' clothes reflected what is happening in their lives. "When they were unemployed they dressed one way; but now, for instance, Monica and Rachel are getting proper jobs," she said. "With Jennifer working in a department store, I wanted to create a look that's not out there. She's a working girl, but with a sense of humor, to show off her body without being obnoxious."
 "I've seen these characters evolve and change and that's been a big factor in the way they dress," she said. "I'm more motivated by the script than by fashion. And by the fact that the show is very much about New York. Fortunately, I'm from New York, so I know what the look is."

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED: Ron Brown;
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT

BYLINE: By David E. Sanger; David E. Sanger covers economic issues for the Times.

 BODY:
1941-1996 Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was the first Cabinet member in 150 years to die on the job. An adviser to Jesse Jackson during his 1988 Presidential bid and a former head of the Democratic National Committee, he had a talent for making deals.
 
 HE CLOSED HIS FIRST big deals in the cacophony of the Hotel Theresa in Harlem, where his father was manager. It was the early 50's and the Theresa, just across from the Apolo Theater, buzzed with the constant arrival of black celebrities. Decades later, sitting in the baronial Washington office of the Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown remembered racing in and out of the ballrooms, shaking down Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson for autographs - and quickly turning access into profit, selling them to neighborhood kids.
 By the time he died in a fiery crash on a hillside in Dubrovnik, Croatia - along with 34 others, including Nathaniel C. Nash, a foreign correspondent for The Times - Brown had changed the definition of deal making in Washington. He had perfected the art of leveraging the access of the United States Government to do the deal for American companies - whether it was selling McDonnell Douglas aircraft to China or power plants to India. Not bad for a guy who, a few hours after he was offered the job of Commerce Secretary, had sat down with a friend and asked, "Hey, what the hell does the Commerce Department do anyway?"
 But one could just never tell where the public serve ended and the private deal making began. When he left for Croatia, he was fighting off an investigation into questionable financial transactions.
 What most amazed people about Brown was his ability to walk into a room, survey his prey and pick the most efective pressure point to win his argument. It was a talent he used across cultural lines.
 In the summer of 1994, Brown was in China to persuade its leaders to buymore jet aircraft and to allow American car makers to produce vehicles in China. But at the same time he could not avoid raising the issue of human rights - which he knew would outrage his hosts and could kill his business deals.
 In fact, just before Brown went to see President Jiang Zemin, other Chinese officials warned him that if he brought up human rights, the meeting would be a disaster. So brown started by talking business. "There was a long pause," one of his aides recalled, "and Ron started by saying that human rights has a special meaning to anyone who worked in the civil rights movement and that America has a long, lon way to go as well.
 "But he made it clear that China could never achieve its major goal in the world, to become a major player on the world stage, if it was constantly being criticized around the world."
 Jiang listened impassively. Then he said, "If you put it that way, we have something to talk about."

HEADLINE: High Costs Are Blamed For the Loss Of a Mill

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
IN October, workers at the American Velvet Company in Stonington felt the tension building as the mill buzzed with rumors that the 104-year-old company might close its doors for good. Between 175 and 200 workers would lose their jobs.
The president of the company, Jacques Wimpfheimer, had called a meeting with union members and management. As workers and supervisors filed into Mr. Wimpfheimer's office, the solemn look on his face confirmed their worst fears. 
 Mr. Wimpfheimer announced that the company planned to move its manufacturing operations to Virginia within two years.
Thomas Rezendes, a purchasing agent at American Velvet and president of Local 110-T of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, described the mood at the meeting in a letter to state legislators and a local newspaper: "Mr. Wimpfheimer said that he was very sorry he had to do this, but if the company was to survive, he could no longer do business in Connecticut. At that time, you could hear a pin drop, and as I gazed at Jacques, I saw that he was a bit uptight, and he was not even looking at us as he talked and explained how the transition would take place."
As Mr. Wimpfheimer explained a month later during a conversation in his office: "In a sense, it's a great defeat. I would like to have remained successful here."
American Velvet, which in the 1950's employed about 450 people in Connecticut, is one of only two velvet mills remaining in the United States. Its lightweight velvet is sold to retail stores and manufacturers of clothing, jewelry boxes, displays and coffins. Faced with high business costs and competition from overseas as well as in Southern states, the company has shifted its operations over the past few years to its lower-cost plant in Virginia.
The squeeze in Connecticut involves high taxes and energy costs. Financial World magazine recently ranked the state 43d out of the 50 states based on its business climate, reflecting data on the cost of doing business (labor, energy and taxes), recent economic history, economic prospects and supply of educated labor. According to Financial World, Connecticut's energy costs are more than 35 percent above the national average.
"Outrageous costs will force businesses to continue abandoning the Northeast for the Southeast and Southwest," the article predicted.
American Velvet said its personnel costs -- wages, worker's compensation and unemployment insurance -- are 20 times higher in Connecticut than in Virginia. Property taxes are nearly five times higher than they are in Virginia.
As Mr. Wimpfheimer gradually transferred mill operations to Virginia and laid off employees, he and Mr. Rezendes said they pleaded with local legislators and state officials to promote ways of cost-cutting in Connecticut. Mr. Wimpfheimer said he was concerned, in particular, about corporate and property taxes as well as the cost of water and the water treatment plant American Velvet was required to build on the mill property. He said that state officials listened but failed to offer the permanent relief the company needed.
Mr. Wimpfheimer asked Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Bozrah, for help in reducing the amount of lightweight velvet imported by the United States from Korea. But the outcome of his talks was a Federal limit that equaled roughly half the lightweight velvet sold in the United States. The limit can be raised by 2.5 percent yearly, Mr. Wimpfheimer said.
State Senator Catherine Cook and State Representative Robert Simmons, Republicans whose districts include Stonington, worked with Mr. Wimpfheimer and the State Department of Economic and Community Development on a plan that would enable American Velvet to stay in Connecticut -- tax credits, a low-interest loan, partial property tax abatement, an offer to negotiate discount utility rates and lower sewage treatment costs.
But Mr. Wimpfheimer said the offer was too little too late. Some of the remedies proposed were temporary. Others would take several years to result in a cost savings. "It's our overall costs that are difficult, and they're not going to change until legislation changes, and that will take a long time," Mr. Wimpfheimer explained.
Stonington's First Selectman, Donald Maranell, also participated in talks with Mr. Wimpfheimer. "How many more American Velvets can the town and state afford?" he asked. "What we need is not revision or tinkering but a major overhaul of the way we treat business in general, so we can all keep our jobs. We haven't learned the lesson we should have learned when the defense industry went away. We have the casino and tourism. But what if tourism took a downturn, and it's all we have?"
More than a hundred companies have moved into Connecticut over the last two years and brought with them 8,000 jobs, according to the spokesman for the Economic and Community Development Department, Chris Cooper. Mr. Cooper said the state has taken steps to improve the business environment. For example, the legislature has approved gradually cutting the corporate income tax rate, which at 10.75 percent is the second-highest in the nation, to 7.5 percent by 2000. But he added, "We may not be able to move fast enough for some businesses."
As far as legislation supporting manufacturers is concerned, the current Republican administration is facing a liberal Democratic majority in the legislature and groups who are expected to lobby vigorously for more spending on a variety of programs, Ms. Cook said. "We better keep going forward with our plan to cut spending and taxes," she said. "That's what will make it better for business."
American Velvet is one of a dying breed of manufacturers, Mr. Maranell said.
A. Wimpfheimer and Brothers Inc., owner and operator of the mill, was founded in 1845, when Abram Wimpfheimer and his brother, Max, opened a carpet store in New Hampshire.
The company is still controlled and operated by descendants of the Wimpfheimers. The present management, including Jacques Wimpfheimer's sons, Donald and James, represents the fourth and fifth generations of the family. A. Wimpfheimer and Brothers has two subsidiaries, Specialty Weavers in Orange, Va., and Denholme Velvets Ltd. in Britain.
The Stonington plant was built by the town in 1888. Since Jacques Wimpfheimer's father, Clarence, established profit sharing in 1940 after a 16-month strike, there hasn't been another work stoppage. The profit sharing was part of a philosophy of employee participation that continues at the mill today.
Seventy-five-year-old Jacques Wimpfheimer tours the plant every morning, stopping to talk with workers. Then he meets with supervisors and other employees, who are free to ask questions, air problems and examine the company's books. The meeting ends with a conference call to the company's sales office. Several employee committees participate in company decisions.
"What more could the state ask for in a company?" asked a recent newspaper editorial. "The velvet plant, the last of its kind in New England, is not a dingy sweatshop that by accident survived from the 19th century. It is a modern factory. Its management always has been ahead of its time in serving its customers and its workers."
The editorial continues, "American Velvet offered well-paying, rewarding work to generations of immigrants who have settled in Stonington since the factory opened as a town economic development project 104 years ago. The Wimpfheimers are not absentee managers, either. They live here, love the community and care for their workers."
Lucy Sylvia, 58, has worked at the mill for 40 years. One of 16 children, she left high school and went to work to help support her family. Ms. Sylvia, who lives alone in Stonington, is one of the many workers from Portuguese families who settled in town and worked either at American Velvet or on fishing boats. Her father, two sisters and a niece also worked at the mill at different times over the years.
Ms. Sylvia will be one of the last to leave, she said, since she has seniority. Her plans are uncertain. She is too young to retire and will not be eligible to receive Social Security payments for at least four years. She worries about losing her health insurance. "I'm nervous and scared, especially with expenses facing me," she said.
One by one, Ms. Sylvia's co-workers are leaving to take jobs wherever they can find them. "It's very sad. A good part of my life is at the mill," she said. "It's hard to see these people leave. They became part of my family."
Machinery being prepared for the move stands silently in one corner of the mill. "It breaks your heart," Ms. Sylvia said. "Then you face reality. It's not easy."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 12, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 29 about the closing of the American Velvet Company in Stonington referred incorrectly to the difference in labor costs at its mills in Connecticut and Virginia. Unemployment compensation alone is 20 times as high in Connecticut as in Virginia; it is not all personnel costs that are 20 times as high.
A picture caption with the article also misidentified a worker inspecting sheets of velvet. She was Carla Leandro, not Maria Amaral.

HEADLINE: The Hidden Meanings of 'Black English'

BYLINE: By Patricia J. Williams; Patricia J. Williams is a professor at Columbia Law School.

 BODY:
The melting pot is boiling over again, this time with a decision by the school board in Oakland, Calif., to reclassify "ebonics," or black vernacular, as a distinct language. The battle is a familiar one that has raged at least since the 1960's. The issues it raises are too often polarized in a simplistic debate about whether black American speech is "good" West African traditionalism or just "bad" English.
There are more complex questions to consider. Can the notion of a singular black vernacular (if that is what ebonics purports to be) account for the enormous variations in black American speech, which range from true dialects, like Gullah, to a panoply of distinctly regional accents? Is so-called Received Standard American English what most Americans speak anyway? And, as a prickly Oxfordeducated acquaintance of mine wonders, when could any part of the American vernacular be called English? 
 The consensus in the media seems to be that, since black vernacular is indeed not a language in the strict linguistic sense, the Oakland board is just wrong. That leads to more wrangling about whether the board is full of Afrocentric neo-nationalists or whether it's just another example of Teachers Refusing to Teach.
It is true that most black speech is clearly comprehensible as a variant of American English, albeit with grammatical and syntax patterns that are strongly influenced by West African language structures. The contorted battles over rap lyrics as political speech -- however densely vernacular the language is -- have not been about the failure of the larger society to understand the words as English.
At the same time, part of the battle over ebonics is premised on the assertion that black vernacular cannot be understood: that its continued use accounts for the high numbers of blacks in remedial education, and high black unemployment rates. So maybe the Oakland school board was right.
If it's Greek to nonspeakers, then go ahead and treat it like Greek. And if funds are available for bilingual education to help recent immigrants assimilate into the mainstream, then maybe this isn't strictly about linguistic history, but more about an investment in the future. So by all means hitch the aspirations of the Middle Passage right onto the forward-lurching wagons of the progressive immigrant myth.
Perhaps the real argument is not about whether ebonics is a language or not. Rather, the tension is revealed in the contradiction of black speech being simultaneously understood yet not understood. Why is it so overwhelmingly, even colorfully comprehensible in some contexts, particularly in sports and entertainment, yet deemed so utterly incapable of effective communication when it comes to finding a job as a construction worker?
Causing further confusion in this debate is the apparent treatment of illiteracy as if it were black speech. Black children are crowded into remedial education classes and are disadvantaged in finding jobs because too many of them have never been taught any variation of the printed word, whether phonics, ebonics or Esperanto. Some young children learn more of the alphabet on "Sesame Street" than they can in overtaxed and overcrowded inner city schools.
Moreover, the very conflation of illiteracy and the reasoned, rich and expressive complexity of most forms of black speech is based on a peculiarly freighted symbolism in the American lexicon. While accent prompts many levels of discrimination in the United States, there is no greater talisman of lower or underclass status than the black accent (or any, really), no greater license to mock than with some imitation of black speech. Whether in The Dartmouth Review or "The Lion King," black English is the perpetual symbolic code for ignorance, evil and jest, the lingo of hep cats and hyenas.
Even solidly middle-class blacks with strings of higher degrees and perfect command of standard grammatical structure can face discrimination if their accents are deemed in any way identifiably "black."
Is it really any wonder that there is such an ambivalent response to mainstream standardized speech patterns among black children when the "standard" is so often imparted with such missionary conviction about eliminating "bad" linguistic acts? It's as if the very spontaneity of their speaking were an extension of the general lawlessness of black existence.
Is there not a way to teach the rules of what is called Received Standard American English without such generous side dishes of humiliation?
Would the recognition that there really are rules and structures in black English help us get past those smug assertions of nobler, higher linguistic conventions? Can we resist the evocative echo of Henry James's fear of random, chaotic utterances spewed from the dark recesses of the vulgate (read Irish) mouth? Can we resist the nostalgia for an unalloyed classicism that never was?
I understand the effort of the Oakland school board to legitimize ebonics as one of translation, which is a generally respected enterprise, rather than cultural uplift, which is inherently condescending. That said, one thing that troubles me about the Oakland proposal is the reported plan to teach the city's teachers not only the structure and history of ebonics but also how to speak it.
It's hard enough to sort out the values embedded in the aversion to black speech as a "bad" version of what is rather too exclusively called "white" English. Imagine having teachers who speak standard classroom English flailing about in some really bad version of a standardized black English. If they end up speaking ebonics as badly as teachers who learn a little "professional Spanish," I cringe to think of the consequences: pidgin versions of Talking to Tonto. Ugh. And I do mean ugh in the most classical sense.
There are enough standard-English speakers who just love to "talk black," who at the drop of a hat break out in "basketball" -- now there's an official language -- and who, encountering any black person, start "dude"-ing and "I be"-ing up a storm, high- and low-fiving to beat the band. This phenomenon is part minstrelry, part presumptuousness and, most complicated of all, part of the mainstream's assimilation of black speech patterns that, once incorporated, are promptly forgotten as such.
I worry a bit that this natural and overlapping fluidity of American vernacular and its regionalisms will be rendered all the more invisible by falsely turning teachers into linguistic anthropologists, adventurers in the "foreign" terrain of alien verbiage.
Finally, a great concern about the Oakland school board's action has been the rather transparent strategy of categorizing ebonics as a distinct language in order to gain access to extra financing for the education of bilingual students. It's a strategy lawyers know well: Consider, as law students must, the question of whether a lame horse dipped in tar and beaten with pillows qualifies as a bird -- technically defined as a two-legged creature with feathers. Ah, literalism.
So it's predictable that at a time of badly dwindling resources, if there is a pot of money earmarked for teaching in any way that substantively communicates with students -- well, call it communication, call it language, call it a rose if need be. Just go for it.
Cynical, some say; to others, it's a creative manifestation of the instinct for survival. I think the whole thing is sad. While the Oakland proposal is quite understandably the practical result of a bureaucracy trying to maneuver the limits and roadblocks of category imperfections in a categorically imperfect world, maybe part of what we are sidestepping in the fight about standardized speech practices is the ongoing abandonment of public schools, a de facto flight begun with the resistance to the promise of Brown v. Board of Education.
After all, if this controversy boils down to the old familiar ingredients of struggle for respect, resources, opportunity and jobs, then we are really faced with just one more clarion call for commitment to public education as standard. This in turn, depends on a more generous evaluation of the standards by which we judge each other's humanity.

HEADLINE: Radio Station Consolidation: Good News for Owners, but What About Listeners?

BYLINE: By STEVE KNOLL 

 BODY:
Jerry Bell is the longtime news director of Jacor Communications' radio station KOA in Denver. He is also the news director of KTLK in that city, which Jacor acquired two years ago. And in September, when Jacor completed its purchase of two more Denver talk stations, KHOW and KBCO-AM, Mr. Bell's purview expanded even further.
"I call it the Jacor of Colorado news department," Mr. Bell said of the single entity serving the Denver stations. 
 The combination of the Denver radio stations' news departments is hardly unique. In a number of large to medium-sized markets around the country, a single owner may control from three to five stations.
As a result, many radio listeners are finding themselves with fewer sources of local news as news staffs are combined. "It makes everything a bit more cookie-cutter and corporate," said Ron Breeding, a newscaster with KARN News Radio in Little Rock, Ark.
The consolidation of radio station ownership was cemented last week when the Federal Communications Commission gave the final approval needed for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's $4.23 billion merger with the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation.
The wave of radio mergers is increasing the demand for more syndicated programming among local stations, as owners of multiple outlets in a single market seek to differentiate their formats while cutting programming staffs. The cutbacks often extend to business employees as well, with one staff selling commercial time for several stations.
On the other hand, owners of multiple stations in a single market are not only able to cut costs by eliminating duplicative operations, but they can gain leverage in negotiating programming and advertising contracts through their control of a larger segment of the audience.
These changes come against the backdrop of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allows a single owner for up to eight radio stations. In Denver, for example, Jacor meets that ceiling, since it also owns another four FM stations with music formats.
The pace of consolidation has slowed recently, after the Justice Department forced Jacor and American Radio Systems to scale back two large acquisitions. In addition, the department approved the Westinghouse acquisition of Infinity with the requirement that Westinghouse sell two stations.
Still, more industry consolidation appears likely. With the rise of giant radio groups, there remains considerable economic pressure on smaller companies and independent stations to merge or be acquired to remain competitive. Even big companies like Walt Disney, which owns ABC, may need to consolidate their positions in radio.
The changes at many local news operations are illustrative of the potential benefits and problems stemming from one company's owning several stations in a single market.
In New York, for example, Westinghouse decided there would be no benefit in combining the news staff of its all-news station WINS with that of WCBS, its principal competitor, which it acquired late last year as part of its purchase of CBS Inc.
But the situation in New York appears to be the exception, with Denver a more likely model for consolidated operations. The advertising billings of both WINS and WCBS are among the highest for radio stations in the country; it would have made little business sense to change things.
David Bartlett, the president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association, said that radio consolidation means less diversity and fewer voices. But, he said, "it's also irrelevant because if you look at the overall media marketplace, there have never been so many voices."
Moreover, Mr. Bartlett hopes consolidation will reverse the decline in radio news during the last 10 years. "Too many radio stations have found it impossible to maintain news departments simply because of the cost," he said. By creating a healthier business, he said, consolidation may foster "a healthier radio news programming marketplace."
Others are less sanguine, fearing that in the end a new elite of a dozen or fewer supergroups will dominate the business, with far fewer stations reflecting the special character of their communities. "When you have one of the major sources of local news and information restructured so that one company controls a substantial proportion of the editorial voices in a community in that medium, that's not good for democracy," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a Washington-based public interest group.
Mr. Bell of Jacor's Denver news operations agrees that radio consolidation is "a double-edged sword." But he sees clear benefits to consolidation, chiefly the opportunity to offer narrowly aimed programming "that complements rather than directly competes."
For example, Jacor's Denver station KTLK has begun a new morning drive-time program, "Business for Breakfast," featuring national coverage from Bloomberg News Radio, augmented by local business news. "It's probably something we wouldn't have done before," Mr. Bell said.
Eric Braun, a vice president with the broadcasting consulting firm of Frank N. Magid Associates, agrees that "given the almost microscopic specificity that radio programmers today strive to achieve with their formats," devising separate niches within a single category "makes a great deal of sense."
Consolidation does increase the power of station owners in negotiating for rights to broadcast sports events and other coveted programming. For example, the Chicago Bears, after 12 years on Tribune Broadcasting's WGN, recently moved to WMAQ-AM, one of five Chicago stations owned by CBS-Westinghouse. A principal catalyst for the switch: the cross-promotional possibilities afforded by those five stations and a television station owned by the same company.
For station employees, consolidation can have a definite downside. At KHOW in Denver, four members of the news department lost their jobs when the reporting staff was combined with that of KOA and KTLK.
Meanwhile, many advertisers have expressed concern that consolidation will reduce their leverage and lead to monopoly pricing. But Mr. Braun, the consultant, contends advertisers will benefit from "breadth and depth of reach inside a format in the market."
Robert E. Igiel, executive vice president and director of broadcasting at the Young & Rubicam advertising agency, said: "Consolidation is a fact of life. I know a lot of my colleagues are concerned with prices going up, but I think that buyers still have enough business acumen to prevent that."

HEADLINE: Ringing in Recycling

 BODY:
The onset of every new year always brings a surge of self-improvement projects for cities as well as individuals. New York will begin 1997 with a new initiative that combines mundane grit with long-term impact. The Giuliani administration will start a five-year program to close down the environmentally hazardous Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island and switch over to a combination of garbage export and recycling.
The city's plan, which was unveiled recently, is actually only the first step toward a solution to New York's 13,000-ton-a-day garbage disposal problem. But it is a good one. People who were worried that the city would push off the difficulties and expenses of closing the landfill until the final deadline in 2001 should be reassured. The Giuliani administration intends to begin reducing the trash trucked into Fresh Kills in 1997 by 15 to 20 percent, and will ship garbage generated in the Bronx to other disposal sites starting next summer. 
 The other positive development is that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani seems to be backing away from his longstanding coolness toward the city recycling program. Instead, the city is embracing the concept of recycling as a potential jobs-creator. A paper mill in Staten Island could be one of many new businesses dedicated to making use of the city's unlimited supply of trash. "Exporting waste is exporting jobs," noted one member of the joint city-state task force that developed the plan for phasing out Fresh Kills.
The administration's new interest in recycling has a great deal to do with the city's unending budget worries. Shipping the garbage out of town will inevitably be more expensive than burying it in Staten Island -- particularly because the lack of a railroad freight line across the Hudson will mean that most of the trash will have to be trucked out of town. Recycling could be significantly cheaper than exporting garbage if the city found ways to make its collection system more efficient. During the first year of the Fresh Kills phase-out, the Sanitation Department will test two-bin collection trucks that would allow recycling workers to pick up both metal and paper products at the same time.
The lethargic pace of the city's waste-reduction and recycling programs so far means there are still plenty of opportunities for savings. For instance, the Sanitation Department picks up and dumps 70,000 tons of grass clippings a year from city yards at a time when many other municipalities insist that homeowners either leave the clippings where they fall or compost them. The city's own agencies produce about 321,000 tons of waste a year, but until very recently there was little attempt to recycle it or reduce the amount of paper generated. The city will begin collecting metal products and mixed paper for the first time in most parts of New York next year, and it is still picking up only a fraction of the recyclable glass, plastic and newspapers it could collect with total household participation.
During 1997, the city is supposed to tackle all these issues, do more research on the relative costs of various methods of disposal and conduct a series of pilot projects on everything from sanitation pickup routes to backyard composting. In the meantime, the fact that the Giuliani administration is ready to begin work and commit money to a long-term solution to its garbage problems is a good beginning for the new year.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Former Social Service Worker Finds Help and Hope

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
As a caseworker for a social service agency, William D. often appeared in New York City Family Court on behalf of his clients, most of whom werethe parents and guardians of children in foster care. But when William found himself in Housing Court this year fighting eviction, he had no one to stand beside him.
Instead, he found himself in the bewildering and frustrating circumstances that social service workers hear about all the time but rarely experience firsthand. "I worked all my life," he said. "I paid my taxes. I'm a good citizen. But when I needed help, none of the government agencies would help me." 
 After losing his job to downsizing in 1995, William, 62, could not find any place willing to hire someone his age. He collected unemployment benefits and, when that ran out, applied for Social Security. He received $456 a month, but that did not cover even the $490 a month rent for the apartment on the Upper West Side where he has lived for 19 years.
He had no friends or family to turn to for help. He never married, and his only daughter lives in Mississippi. "You think you have friends," he said. "Until you're down, you don't see how many you really have. You don't have many."
As the rent started backing up, William began to sell off the modest acquisitions of his middle-class life -- first his car, then his exercise equipment, his videocassette recorder and finally the television.
When his landlord sued to evict him, William begged the court to give him time. He would be able to come up with the money, he said. He had been a working man all his life.
William was born in Charleston, S.C. His parents died when he was young. At 14, his Uncle Rosco and Aunt Marie brought him to live with them in Harlem. Both social workers, they sent him to Harlem Prep, a private school.
He started working in grocery stores when he was 17 and worked for several years for community groups before getting a degree from Lehman College. After college, he worked for the Urban League and later taught remedial reading and math at Hostos and La Guardia community colleges.
Later he took a job at the Yonkers office of Leake & Watts, an agency that provides foster-care services and family counseling. He carried a caseload of about 30 families, many including children born to mothers addicted to crack cocaine. He visited them in their homes, evaluated how the children were doing and made referrals to social service agencies. He thought he would have the job until he retired.
"I was told if I go to college and keep myself clean, I could have a good job, a good future," he said, over tea at McDonald's the other day. Now, he faces a struggle in his last working years and the prospect of a penniless retirement.
He applied for food stamps and receives $51 a month. He sought a Federal housing subsidy but was told he does not qualify. "I went to all the agencies that are supposed to help people and they denied me," he said. "That's a hurting thing."
In Housing Court, he was given a list of private agencies that might help. He started calling the numbers one by one. After 15 rejections, he reached Karen Norden of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, an affiliate of UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The Jewish Board gave him a month's rent and put him in contact with an anonymous donor who gave him the rest of what he needed to catch up. "They were very kind," he said. He took a letter from the Jewish Board to court and the judge spared him from eviction. But he is still worried about how he will afford rent each month. He spends his days searching for jobs and reading. He planned to enroll in a computer course for senior citizens run by the city but it was full, so he is taking a restaurant training course instead. He hopes to find a job before his 63d birthday, in March.
He is hopeful, although a little more jaded now. "You really see now why people you worked with before were angry, were bitter, you realize that the system . . .," his voice trailed off. "You don't know until it happens to you."

HEADLINE: Drawing a Hard Line Against Urban Sprawl

SERIES: BECOMING LOS ANGELES -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
One of the great challenges of the West, the writer Wallace Stegner said, was to build a civilization to match the setting.
But as 6 of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the nation come of age in the West, spilling into forests, deserts and mountain valleys, the only urban area that appears to be most consciously trying to shape itself as a new kind of American city is Portland. 
 While other 1990's boom cities like Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake and Las Vegas were following a predictable pattern of unchecked growth, taking on the bloat and sprawl of Los Angeles, Portland went the other way.
Ignoring lawsuits and pressure from commercial and development interests, Portland -- acting on a much-fought-over new state law -- simply drew a line around the metropolitan area, beginning in the late 1970's. On one side would be forests, farms and open space; on the other would be the city. The aim was to force jobs, homes and stores into a relatively compact area, served by light rail, buses and cars.
Skeptics said it would be impossible to contain a fast-growing city like Portland within a political boundary, without sending jobs away or killing property values. It seemed even more unlikely that a big city in the West could force people out of their cars, as Portland, with a current population of about 450,000 tried to do, tearing up a downtown freeway and putting a limit on parking spaces.
But instead of lost jobs, a silicon forest of high-tech campuses and factories grew inside the new urban boundaries. Instead of falling property values, home prices have soared. And instead of losing population, Oregon added 500,000 people, mostly in Portland and the Willamette Valley to the south, in the last 15 years.
It did so with the strictest laws against urban sprawl in the nation. Many of the newer companies in Oregon -- among them Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Hyundai -- say they moved here because there are forests, fruit orchards and meandering creeks just across the street from the contained urban areas.
The employers said they wanted to locate in an area that could attract educated workers who were as interested in quality of life as a paycheck.
"This is where we are headed worldwide," said Bill Calder, a spokesman for Intel, the computer chip manufacturer that has nearly 9,000 employees in Oregon. "Companies that can locate anywhere they want will go where they can attract good people in good places."
A number of critics say Oregon is unique, and that its political culture -- it is known as New England on the Pacific Rim -- and relatively small population of 3.2 million allow it to experiment and tinker. But supporters of the Oregon city-shaping plan note that it was hatched by a Republican governor, and that business as well as Birkenstock environmentalists have rallied around it.
Seattle has followed Oregon's lead, creating its own line against sprawl in the Cascade Mountain foothills, and trying to force homebuilders back into the core of the city.
Denver and Salt Lake City, and officials in those states, are studying it. Phoenix is in a political quagmire over development. Even Las Vegas, the fastest-growing city in America, is experiencing the first calls for growth control in the face of severe traffic congestion, overcrowded schools and a looming water shortage.
And this year several cities in California -- a state often cited as a caricature of ill-considered urban development -- took a page from Oregon. San Jose and four smaller Bay Area communities all voted to keep new subdivisions and commercial clutter within a contained area.
If anything has defined the quest to create something different in the emerging mega-cities of the West, it is the idea of blending urban life with the outdoors -- be it the desert, the Rocky Mountains or the wet woods of the Pacific Northwest.
As such, one of the big questions for the urban West, said Richard Lamm, the former Governor of Colorado, is: "How many people can lead satisfied lives here?"
To residents of cities that are losing people and jobs and are fighting just to hold the line on basic municipal services, such a question may seem self-indulgent. But it is the issue that many people in the West say most troubles them as they watch cities they fell in love with morph into something unrecognizable.

Boulder, Colo.
The Best Laid Plans Are Undermined
Nearly 40 years ago, Boulder, Colo., tried to control its future on its own, setting itself up as an ideal mix of wild and urban -- a midsized city pressed against the vertical flank of the Rockies, 30 miles from Denver.
Starting in 1959, Boulder drew a line in the mountains just above the city, above which no water or sewer services could be extended.
Then, in 1967, Boulder started to take a portion of the sales tax and buy up open space, mostly ranch land that was being sold to commercial developers. It has since purchased 25,000 acres. In 1976, Boulder went a step further, setting a limit on residential growth, at 2 percent a year.
For a time, it seemed to work. From 1976 to 1993, the population remained relatively stable but the economy grew at a vigorous rate with the creation of new jobs. This year, Boulder has been trying to limit new commercial growth -- the most contested step it has yet taken.
At night, it is clear what Boulder has done. Above the city, there are no urban lights massed along the mountains. A sign just blocks from the edge of the city says, "This is a mountain lion's home," and indeed, there are fresh cougar tracks in the snow.
The line has held Boulder at bay. But if Boulder thought it could keep the sprawl of greater Denver from coming its way, it was wrong.
A series of communities sprang up along Highway 36, between Denver and Boulder. On the prairie where the Arapaho and Cheyenne people once roamed, there are tens of thousands of new three-bedroom, two-story, cedar-decked homes massed in developments with Indian names, and beautifully landscaped headquarters of high-tech companies.
An occasional ranch or two stands out incongruously. The Rockies are close enough to feel their breath. But on some days, the mountains are obscured by Denver's brown cloud, drifting north. At rush hour, Highway 36 is a parking lot all the way back to Denver.
In essence, the megalopolis has come to Boulder. It is an island no more.
"The lesson is: we can't do this alone, in isolation," said John Carpenter, the community development director of Westminster, a fast-growing Denver suburb. Like Boulder, Westminster had tried to control its fate by limiting development and buying open space. But greater Denver has engulfed it.
"They are things we have no control over, no matter how many laws we pass in Westminster," he said.
In both Phoenix and Denver, officials have made a strong effort to purchase open space before it is lost to development. Phoenix boasts of having the largest municipal park in the world, the 25,000 acres of South Mountain Park. But as one branch of government, the city, has been trying to buy vacant land for parks and wildlife, another branch, the State of Arizona, has been selling it to housing developers because it needs to make money for the state.
"It's like funding cancer research and giving subsidies to tobacco growers at the same time," said Scott Phelps, a spokesman for Mayor Skip Rimsza of Phoenix.
Colorado has faced the same predicament. The state, which first showed its political mentality when it voted down a chance to host the Olympic Games in 1976, has used a portion of lottery money to buy land. Still, in the last 10 years alone, more than 500,000 acres of open space has been lost to development.
But this year, voters passed a constitutional amendment that will allow the state to designate as protected open space some of the land that had been set aside as revenue-generating property. In short, instead of buying open land, they are just not selling or developing open land owned by the state.
"This was a huge change -- a very big deal around here," said Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado.
Governor Romer favors an Oregon-style growth management plan for his state. But he says property rights advocates, and Colorado's more conservative political tradition, would keep anything like the Oregon plan from passing the Legislature.
"I'm a former developer," Mr. Romer said. "I know how the free market works. It's very difficult to convince people of growth management when you have a political ethic that says, 'Stay away from my private property.' "
When asked about Wallace Stegner's hope that cities would match the setting, Mr. Romer was a bit pessimistic. "We're likely to have that one big sprawling city from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, with bits of open space in between," he said. "But I haven't given up hope. This is the fight to fight."
Prof. Ray Studer, sitting in a University of Colorado office in Boulder on a day when winds had blown the smog away and the mountains seemed newly polished, believes that the urban West may yet live up to its promise, though it faces ingrained political opposition.
"There is a spirit of innovation and newness here, still a sense of the possible," said Professor Studer, who is director of the Urban and Regional Planning Program at the University.
"Nobody in Colorado is willingly trying to screw up the land or dirty the air," he said. "This kind of stuff happens because we Westerners are not, by nature, a planning culture."

Salt Lake City
A Vision of Place Fades Over Time
Westerners have, in fact, tried to plan for orderly growth, starting in 1847 in the Salt Lake Valley, where Mormon pioneers set out the region's first planned urban development, acting on Brigham Young's directive, "This is the place."
By careful design, the streets of Salt Lake were to be 88 feet wide, the sidewalks 20 feet, with houses set 20 feet back from the street. A large part of the city was set aside as the common area.
The problem has been maintaining a central vision over time. This is evident in the Salt Lake of today, where the fastest-growing areas around the city are a hodgepodge of new suburbs and developments creeping up the sides of the Wasatch Range.
"Is this still the right place?" said Robert Liberty, of 1000 Friends of Oregon, in a recent speech before civic leaders in Utah. His group studies urban growth issues. "Or will you become just another place to be abandoned? Will the bronze pioneers stare sadly out in the smog into a murky future where the dream of community has been lost?"
Seattle at the turn of the century had a master plan for boulevards, parks and waterways. In the 1960's, it cleaned up Lake Washington before there was a Federal mandate to do so. But it turned down mass transit, opting for more highways instead.
As a result, traffic grew four times as fast as the population. Last month, people in the Seattle metro area finally approved a plan to build a $4 billion rail and bus system, costing residents four times what it would have cost, in inflation-adjusted dollars, to do the same thing 20 years earlier.
In the early years after World War II, Phoenix thought it had a plan for orderly growth; it decided to annex neighboring suburbs before they could even take shape. The city grew tenfold, in physical size and population, in 50 years.
But its annexation policy led to publicly financed sprawl of the worst kind, many Phoenix officials now say. The Phoenix of 1996 has terrible air, gridlocked traffic, and spreads out in so many directions that it seems to lack any sense of order.
In the face of these problems, Phoenix has done a near-complete reversal; as of this year, it is using the leverage of lower development fees to try and lure homebuilders back to the city center.
Phoenix has set a goal of trying to keep development within about a 500-square-mile area. But there is no leverage to enforce the goal -- only the carrot of lower building permit fees within the central city. So, massive new developments, 10,000 homes apiece, are under way well north of the area that the city would to see remain wild.
"Developers will go wherever they can make a buck," said Rob Melnick, head of the Morrison Institute for Public Policy at Arizona State University. "If you charge them more to build on the far suburban edge, they'll pay it and just pass that on the homebuyer."

Portland, Ore.
The Next Challenge: A Population Tide
Oregonians delight at being contrarian. The force behind their plan was Tom McCall, the Republican Governor in the early 1970's, who once said he loved Oregon more than life itself. Governor McCall told Oregonians that they faced a choice between "sagebrush subdivisions and coastal condominiums," or towns that blended gently into the state's stunning natural environment.
In 1973, Mr. McCall signed a law that required every one of Oregon's cities and counties to write land-use plans that limited sprawl and protected farms, forests and open space. They were to draw boundaries around the cities or face legal sanctions.
Three times, in 1976, 1978 and 1982, developers and other commercial interests brought ballot measures before the voters to repeal the act, and three times, Oregonians voted to keep the tough anti-sprawl measures.
Today, a clear line -- with cities on one side, and open space on the other -- can be seen from the air. The difference is particularly graphic along the Washington-Oregon border. Just across the Columbia River, in Washington State, much of suburban Clark County spills out in myriad directions over what used to be farm land.
Oregon, which had been losing 30,000 acres of agricultural land a year, is now losing only 2,000 acres a year. Colorado, by contrast, is losing nearly 50,000 acres a year.
Portland today has a tight, dense downtown area that caters to pedestrians; where once there was a freeway along the river, there is now the most-used city park, named for Mr. McCall. The city's light-rail system, MAX, has exceeded expectations for use and popularity.
This year, the Metro government of Portland adopted an even stricter plan for its three-county metro area. It envisions adding 500,000 people within the existing urban boundaries.
Officials in the Metro governing body, which controls development of the three-county area that contains 24 individual cities, are constantly reminding Portland residents of a population tide that will engulf them if they don't act, saying, "We'll be having 75 more people here by dinner time than we had at breakfast."
In an attempt to control the size of stores springing up in industrial areas, the plan limits retail outlets to 60,000 square feet.
And while Portland has long limited parking spaces downtown, the new plan restricts the number of parking spaces at new stores. Angry retailers say the restriction will hurt them; Portland officials counter that it will merely encourage people to take public transit.
When Seattle followed Portland's lead in its 1994 urban growth plan, it actually downzoned 50 square miles of what used to be an area designated for new homes into a rural and forest category. This set off howls of outrage. But so far, the boundary has survived court and political challenges.
There is something of a self-congratulatory -- critics call it smug -- tone about what Portland has done.
"We have been careful stewards of the land and have fought to protect our natural resources against the urban sprawl that has plagued almost every other metropolitan area in this country," said Mike Burton, Metro's executive officer, in a message sent to Portland residents. "We have worked hard to maintain our enviable quality of life."
The real test for Portland will come after another million or so people have moved there. Then the cities will face a question of allowing more apartments and town houses into their cherished single-family neighborhoods or spilling into the rural areas they have just fought so hard to preserve.
"At some point with those cities you get into a question of density: will people still move there if they can't live in a big home with a yard?" said Phil Burgess, president of the Center for the New West, a Denver research organization.
Mr. Burgess said sprawl could still be controlled by relying less on state government and more on market forces, but taking into account the true costs of building instant cities on open land. If developers were forced to pay fully for roads, sewers, schools and other necessities, they would be more likely to rebuild within the existing urban area, he said.
"You make them pay the full costs and all of a sudden that $130,000 home in the far suburbs is $230,000," Mr. Burgess said.
And Oregon's plan has not been entirely successful in containing sprawl. In the town of Bend, east of the Cascades, officials merely drew a broad urban boundary. While this complied with the letter of the law, it allowed strip development to spill out in two directions from the city.
The other major complaint against Oregon is that civic planners, by drastically restricting urban sprawl, would cause home prices to shoot up. And indeed, median home prices for existing homes in Washington and Oregon, the two states with urban growth restrictions, rose to $153,190 this year -- the third highest among 10 regions of the country.
Mr. Liberty of 1000 Friends of Oregon said home prices rose, in Seattle and Portland, primarily because so many new jobs have been created.
More important, Mr. Liberty says Oregon has shown that American cities do not have to follow the predictable pattern from boom to sprawl to abandonment.
"At least we have shown that you can do something," Mr. Liberty said. "There is a fundamental civic assumption that we can make the city work, and shape it the way we want it to be shaped. It's taken 20 years of political blood, sweat and tears to come to that realization."

HEADLINE: A MARRIAGE OF POWER: BROOKLYN UNION;
On Firm Turf, But Taking A Bold Step

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
When Robert B. Catell, the chairman and chief executive of Brooklyn Union Gas, looks out from his office on the 23d floor of the company's downtown Brooklyn headquarters, his vista is the borough where the utility has prospered for more than 100 years. But these days, Mr. Catell is looking far beyond Brooklyn's borders as he seeks to assure the long-term vitality of his company.
With impending deregulation posing the biggest challenge to Brooklyn Union, one of the nation's best-regarded utilities, Mr. Catell and his managers took their boldest and riskiest step yesterday by agreeing to take over the long troubled Long Island Lighting Company. The move will give Brooklyn Union a major stake in the electric utility business and a huge new customer base, but also merges the company with a debt-saddled behemoth whose customers are angry at having to pay the highest electric rates in the continental United States. 
 Mr. Catell, 59, who will take over as head of the newly merged company in a year, is no stranger to Long Island, as he lives in Garden City.
By giving Brooklyn Union Lilco's base of 1.1 million electricity users and 453,000 gas customers, the merger essentially gives the gas company a huge laboratory where it will be able to hone its marketing efforts to prepare for when states deregulate electrical utilities. New York State hopes to do so by 1998, a move that would allow rate payers to buy electricity much as they buy phone services now, by selecting from a host of alternatives.
One concern arising from the merger is whether Brooklyn Union will remain committed to its home base. All over the borough, there are signs of the company's deep commitment: It was a driving force behind the Metrotech development that revitalized downtown; its Cinderella housing program has redeveloped abandoned housing, and it is a major contributor to local arts programs and museums.
But for Brooklyn Union, the question is whether the company can prevail in a new era in which it cannot depend on its old monopoly. Mr. Catell took the first big steps to confront the radically altered marketplace last fall, when he proposed changing the utility's structure to transform it into a holding company, the Keyspan Energy Corporation, which would be able to expand overseas and guide the gas company's entry into the marketplace for electricity. The proposal is to be voted on by stockholders in February.
In addition to giving Brooklyn Union experience in the electricity business, the merger will help a new subsidiary persuade customers to buy their gas and induce others to switch over from oil. Acquiring the hundreds of thousands of gas customers served by Lilco will strengthen Brooklyn Union's traditional gas business, in which it serves 1.1 million customers.
But Mr. Catell has a much broader vision. In a recent interview, he said that the ultimate winner in the new competitive era will be the utility company that can transform itself into an full-energy management company.
Such a company will no longer just supply gas and electricity but will install small monitoring systems in customer's homes and buildings to enable them to control energy use.
To accomplish that vision, Brooklyn Union has formed another subsidiary, Keyspan Energy Management, which is trying to market complete energy packages for large consumers.
"Your will get a fuel-neutral solution," said William K. Feraudo, the senior vice president of marketing at Brooklyn Union. "No matter if its gas, or electric, whatever is best."
Analysts predict that the transition to a deregulated environment will not be an easy one, with many false starts and dead ends.
But should the company's strategy of aggressively seeking new markets succeed, the payoff could be huge.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Bid Defies Convention And Fellow Democrats, Too;
Ferrer Enters Primary From Center and From Bronx

SERIES: OPENING STEPS -- The mayoral race.

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer supports the death penalty. He would force applicants for welfare to submit to fingerprint checks. He considers late-term abortions "barbaric." He does not come from Manhattan or Brooklyn. And he has issued an appeal, notable for its directness, for Hispanic voters to rally behind his mayoral campaign in a display of ethnic force.
Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, is preparing to run for mayor as a moderate Puerto Rican from the Bronx: not exactly the kind of candidate, he observed over breakfast the other day, who tends to win New York Democratic primaries, which have historically been dominated by Manhattanites and, to a lesser extent, liberals. 
 But in speeches to Democrats, breakfast appearances before small audiences of business leaders and interviews with any reporter who will listen, Mr. Ferrer contends that the very things that may complicate his bid for the Democratic nomination are the very things that would make him the strongest Democratic challenger to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Ferrer is fashioning a campaign appeal intended, in effect, to leapfrog the Democratic primary -- making it less a debate on his own political views and more a referendum on who can best defeat the Republican incumbent.
"What I'm going to depend on in a primary is people saying they want the Democratic nominee to be -- No. 1 -- someone who can win," Mr. Ferrer said at a coffee shop across from Lincoln Center. "Demonstrably, I have a better opportunity to beat Giuliani."
It is an unusual if slightly risky approach, built in part on the reality -- and in part on the myth -- about the dynamics of a New York Democratic primary. Mr. Ferrer is correct in noting that there has never been a Hispanic mayor of New York, nor any mayor from the Borough of the Bronx. His assertion that liberals invariably dominate New York primaries is more debatable, as evidenced by the primary electoral success of Abraham D. Beame.
But Mr. Ferrer's rationale for his candidacy has shown a few early signs of success. He is likely to win the support of as many as four of the five county Democratic leaders. They are responding to his argument that his political philosophy, ability to compete for the one in seven voters who is Hispanic, and association with growing prosperity in the Bronx make him a potentially formidable challenger to Mr. Giuliani.
And his emphasis on moderate positions has, by design, stoked concerns among some Democratic leaders that one of his principal rivals, Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, may be too liberal to win a citywide race. "I don't know whether she can win a general election against Giuliani," Representative Thomas J. Manton, the Queens Democratic leader, said as he compared Ms. Messinger with Mr. Ferrer. (The two other likely candidates for the Democratic nomination are the Rev. Al Sharpton and Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn.)
But for all that, Mr. Ferrer's initial support appears tepid and tentative, and Democrats who in public describe him as a strong and viable candidate express private doubts about his political fortitude. There remains persistent concern that he has neither the political experience (Mr. Ferrer says this is the toughest race he has faced since he won a district leader post in 1982) or campaign graces (he likes to use words like "crummy" to describe municipal shortcomings) to match the politically resourceful Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Ferrer himself identified -- with little prompting -- what is the most often-heard reservation about his abilities as both a campaigner and potential mayor.
"Not heavy enough.," Mr. Ferrer, a slight, balding and mustachioed 46-year-old, said over a banana muffin and fresh-squeezed orange juice. "Not enough stature." At that, Mr. Ferrer shifted in his chair, tensed his face and raised his eyebrows.
"Huh?" he continued, sarcastically. "Look, I don't project the classic Roman quality of gravitas because I think it's silly. But I am probably one of the more effective government executives in the city. I don't have wordsmiths writing what I say. I will sometimes come out with a wisecrack one-liner, because that's my nature. Do not confuse that with a lack of gravity. I get real serious about things."
Some of the concerns about Mr. Ferrer have been stirred as much by what he has said as by how he has said it. His endorsement of the death penalty came in the midst of a furor over the murder of a police officer, Kevin Gillespie, in March. It was a change for Mr. Ferrer, who had made a career out of holding the opposite position. Mr. Ferrer says the switch, which came as he was preparing his mayoral bid, was genuine, but many Democrats, including some of Mr. Ferrer's supporters, worry that it undercut his credibility with voters.
Similarly, his effort to woo Hispanic voters has been criticized as lacking subtlety. "Este es nuestro momento," Mr. Ferrer wrote in the nation's largest Spanish-language daily, El Diario-La Prensa. The phrase means, "This is our moment." Such an appeal is a subject of some political debate, since the city's Hispanic voters are politically diverse, as Mr. Giuliani demonstrated in winning 34 percent of their votes in 1993.
And after writing that, Mr. Ferrer found himself under attack in some quarters for what was seen as a heavy-handed ethnic appeal. "Oh my gosh," he said with exasperation when asked about that. "Please don't tell me that all of a sudden we're getting naive about ethnicity. There were a couple of people who seized upon 'This is our moment' to say this is a raw ethnic appeal. That's stupid. Does anybody mind if I talk to my constituents? In fact, nobody would take me so seriously if I did not have the support of my own community."
"And, by the way," Mr. Ferrer continued, "let's talk about ethnic politics -- shall we? I'd like to take a little credit for every Hispanic appointment that Giuliani has made. Why do you think he's made them, in the numbers that he has?"
Mr. Ferrer these days is in the early stage of a campaign where candidates, before generally small audiences, test themes that might work in the contest ahead. Thus, on one day Mr. Ferrer will talk about what he sees as his successes in the Bronx; on another, about his fight with the principal owner of the Yankees, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, over his threat to move the team out of the Bronx; on another, about what he sees as Mayor Giuliani's failures.
But most of all, Mr. Ferrer is making a distinct effort to identify himself with moderate and conservative positions. For example, Mr. Ferrer said he was in favor of abortion rights, but added: "I have problems with unlimited abortions. You know? Every time a mother hiccups, that's no reason to abort a child."
Similarly, he has made a point of distancing himself from other issues identified with liberal thought over the last four years. He supports phasing out the unincorporated business tax and cutting the sales tax. And he raised and dismissed the debate over the "Rainbow Curriculum" proposed by the former schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, which, among other things, taught tolerance of homosexuality.
"I don't go crazy over some of the boutique issues that tear this city apart," Mr. Ferrer said of that fight.
Mr. Ferrer likes to say that he is not discouraged by early reviews of the campaign that portray his chances -- or any Democrat's -- as slight. He has raised $1.7 million, according to his latest campaign filings, or $400,000 more than Ms. Messinger. And he compares Mayor Giuliani's political standing with that of President Bush in 1991, after the quick American victory in the Persian Gulf war, when Mr. Bush seemed entrenched.
Drawing the analogy from Iraq and Mr. Bush and back to New York and Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Ferrer said: "Everybody likes the fact that we bombed those squeegee guys into oblivion. And those aggressive panhandlers. We feel safer. Homicides are down by 50 percent. And we thought that that was the fundamental problem of the city."
"Well, once the blush came off that rose, we found out it's jobs and education, stupid," Mr. Ferrer said.
But has the blush come off the rose? Have concerns about crime and quality of life been replaced by concerns about education and jobs, as Mr. Ferrer suggested?
At that, Mr. Ferrer paused to consider his position. "It's coming off," he said. "It's coming off because people are not stupid."
This is the first in a series of occasional articles examining the early campaign strategies of individual candidates in the New York City mayoral race.

Chart: "Ferrer as a Candidate"
 
The Pluses
 1. He is a Hispanic candidate for mayor in a city where 13 percent of voters in the 1993 Mayoral election identified themselves as Hispanic.
 2. He has been Borough President of the Bronx since April 1987, leading the borough during its economic renaissance.
 3. A political moderate, he should be able to resist efforts by Mr. Giuliani to paint him as a liberal.
 4. He seems likely to win the support of four of the city's five Democratic county leaders. The party organization does not mean what it once did in New York, but it can make a difference in turning out the vote.
 
The Minuses
 1. For all his years in politics, Mr. Ferrer has never engaged in a truly competitive political race. More than a few of his supporters worry that he does not have the gumption or the expertise for such a race.
 2. Mr. Ferrer is barely known outside the Bronx, which means a good part of his early campaign effort, and spending, will have to go to simply introducing him to voters in the four other boroughs.
 3. He may be placing too much hope on Hispanic voting patterns. There is no evidence that Hispanic New York voters vote as a bloc. In fact, the opposite appears to be true.
 4. Mr. Ferrer's recent support of the death penalty might help him with moderate voters in a general election, but only if he gets that far. His switch, coming at the start of his mayoral campaign, makes him vulnerable to charges of opportunism.

HEADLINE: For Interest Groups, Battle Lines Form in Debate Over Social Security

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
With Congress and the nation gearing up for a huge debate on the future of Social Security, labor, Wall Street, corporate America and organizations of the old and the young are quietly marshaling their forces for one of the biggest lobbying battles in decades.
There is a broad consensus that the Social Security system needs reform, but little agreement on what should be done, and many of the important organizations in the debate are formulating their strategies. Nevertheless, the battle has been joined in public relations campaigns and in jockeying for position in Congress. 
 The central point in the debate is how to shift Social Security toward the private markets. A Federal panel studying this issue is divided between wanting to privatize Social Security, at least in part, or allowing the Government to invest Social Security money in the stock market.
Wall Street's big brokerage firms are, inescapably, at the center of the debate. They view changes in Social Security as an opportunity to sell billions of dollars in financial products directly to the Government or to individuals. Wall Street is eager, however, to avoid playing too prominent a role in the debate, out of fear of setting off a backlash that would weaken its position in Congress.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has focused on Wall Street as an adversary in the campaign ahead, believes the Government should maintain its central role in assuring retirement benefits and providing a financial safety net for low-income workers.
Even the A.F.L.-C.I.O., however, favors investing Social Security money in the stock and bond markets, although it wants the money controlled entirely by the Government, and not put in the hands of private investors.
Businesses, large and small, hope that putting more Social Security money into the private markets will limit the growth in payroll taxes and provide fresh capital for them to expand.
Older workers want to maintain existing Social Security benefits. Younger workers fear that they will have none.
"Social Security is the most successful program that the Government has run," said Marc E. Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association, a Wall Street trade group. "Reforming it is a hard issue, and it's an emotional one. We want to make sure that we improve Social Security and get it right. Is the current system satisfactory? Not if we look ahead. No one supports the status quo."
Left alone, the Social Security trust fund would begin to lose money in 2018, according to experts, and would go broke in 2030, the year when people born in 1963 will turn 67 and become eligible for retirement benefits.
For that reason, the groups say, something needs to be done, although a Federal advisory panel that has been studying Social Security has been unable to agree on how to solve the problem.

Privatization's Backers Say It Will Aid Business
The panel has split between advocating a privatization plan and simply allowing the fund, which is now invested in nonmarketable Government securities, to broaden its investment mix.
"There's a very broad tent coming together of people who want substantive reform," said Richard Thau, executive director of Third Millennium in Manhattan, a lobbying group that works on issues affecting people younger than 35. "What's going on now is akin to the skirmishes that are undertaken before a Presidential campaign. And it's nothing compared to what will be necessary to enact true reform."
In the vanguard of privatization is the Cato Institute, a libertarian research organization in Washington, that is drawing on business contributions to finance a $2 million three-year campaign that includes studies and conferences.
"The battle for change is already over," said the director of health and welfare studies at the institute, Michael Tanner. "The question now is what kind of change. And it needs to go beyond just raising taxes and cutting benefits."
Cato strongly supports full privatization -- putting the entire 12.4 percent Social Security payroll tax in individual 401(k)-style accounts that would be invested and managed by workers.
Under the Cato plan, the $400 billion that comes into the Social Security trust fund each year from payroll taxes would be redirected through the new investment accounts to the stock and bond markets.
As a result, Cato says, that money would be available for businesses to draw on to expand, and the nation's economic health would improve.
Moreover, the institute, which promotes having less Government, recoils at proposals to have the Government buy stocks, because it fears Government ownership of private corporations.
Given the vast sums involved, financial experts say, that alternative could result in the Government's taking major stakes in many companies, even owning up to 10 percent of some.
"We oppose giving Government that much control," Mr. Tanner said.
Cato's lobbying efforts are being headed by Jose Pinera, a former Chilean Labor Minister who privatized Social Security there, and by William Shipman, an executive at State Street Global Advisors, a money manager in Boston.
The effort is being financed by the American International Group Inc., an insurance company; the American Express Corporation; Alex. Brown & Company and Quick & Reilly, two brokerage houses; the Digital Equipment Corporation, and I.B.M.

Unions Want Protection For Workers' Benefits
At the opposite end of the spectrum, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., says it will join other unions to oppose any privatization plan.
The federation, with 13 million members, says Social Security is one of its top lobbying priorities.
Instead, it wants Social Security to stay just as it is, but with a major difference -- allowing the Government to put up to 40 percent of the money in publicly traded stocks and bonds.
That position is advocated by Robert J. Ball, a former Social Security Commissioner and a member of the Federal panel.
Gerald M. Shea, head of governmental affairs for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a member of the panel, said the labor organization had not set a budget for its lobbying, which it expects to last for three to five years.
"But it will be quite substantial," Mr. Shea said. "It will be in the millions of dollars. It's a first-tier issue for us."
The lobbying will include education programs as well as lobbying in Congress.
The federation fears individual investment accounts would lead to a "total unraveling of the Social Security program," Mr. Shea said, because it would undermine what the unions see as the strength of Social Security -- that the Government, and not the individual, bears the risks.
"This is a battle between those who see that Government has a role in Social Security and those who believe it should have none," he said.
On a practical level, Mr. Shea pointed to studies that showed that low-wage workers tended to be overly conservative when investing. He is worried, he said, that union workers will be too cautious with their investment accounts, while wealthier and more financially savvy workers, will invest more aggressively.
As a result, union workers could end up with far less than more sophisticated investors, widening income differences between high- and low-wage retirees.
At the same time, the union's proposal that 40 percent of the trust fund be invested in stocks but be controlled directly by the Government is raising concerns among free-market proponents.
The market value of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange is now $6.8 trillion. Over time, experts estimate, $2 trillion in new money could flow to the stock market if all the Social Security fund is invested. That means that the Government could end up as one of the biggest holders of stock in the world, as well as the biggest single shareholder in many companies.
Active stock management by the Government is welcomed by Mr. Shea, who said, "We think it would have a good effect on how corporate America operates."
But, recognizing the firestorm it might cause, the union would go along with a recommendation from Mr. Ball that the Government invest only in passive stock-index funds and have no say in management issues.
Wall Street and corporate America appear to support "partial privatization" plans, diverting a yet-to-be-determined part of the payroll tax to self-managed retirement accounts and keeping the rest in the Social Security system as a safety net.

Wall Street Is Eager, But Wary of Criticism
"We don't want to take away the safety net," said Heather Ruth, president of PSA, a trade association for the bond market, which has yet to endorse a specific plan. Wall Street brokerage companies and many American businessmen also believe that payroll taxes have become so high that they threaten to become an economic drag and oppose any plan that would raise them further. They also welcome the influx of fresh money, whether from the Government or individual accounts, into the stock and bond markets, creating new capital for businesses to draw on.
The Investment Company Institute, which represents the mutual-fund industry, will take a leading role, along with big companies like Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch & Company. Merrill Lynch, the largest brokerage company, has begun advertising in influential Washington publications.
The National Association of Manufacturers, which represents business, will finance academic studies and grass-roots efforts for change.
Wall Street is sensitive to charges about self-interest, and attacks on the financial-services industry have begun. The secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard Trumka, said recently that Social Security changes were being driven by "Wall Street firms like State Street Bank, Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe Price for their own greedy purposes" and castigated the "wizards of Wall Street."
"They have heavy pocketbooks," Mr. Trumka said, "and they are big and ugly and loud."
Fearing such attacks, Merrill is working quietly on the topic. Executives will not talk on the record about its efforts, which are intended to privatize part of Social Security while keeping a safety net in place. Merrill has sent a paper, "Danger Over the Horizon," about the savings rate to members of Congress, and the firm has written about Social Security in a newsletter to its millions of clients.
It is preparing a "white paper" for Congress and academic experts. And it has taken full-page advertisements in Roll Call and The Hill, two newspapers that circulate on Capitol Hill. One shows a bomb called a "ticking demographic time bomb," and the other, a threatening storm to illustrate the baby boomers' retirement future.
The Investment Company Institute, which represents 5,000 mutual funds with $2.3 trillion in assets, also supports partial privatization, but the group cautions that the amount of money flowing into those accounts may be less than anticipated. As an example, if 2 points of the 12.4 percent payroll were diverted, a proposal that has been discussed by many, that would add only $60 billion to these individual accounts, hardly a bonanza by the standards of the mutual-fund industry.
Still, the trade association sees Social Security as an important, but difficult long-term issue. "The notion of injecting risk into Social Security is tough," a senior vice president of the group, Julie Domenick, said. It's the bridge people have to cross."

HEADLINE: A MARRIAGE OF POWER: THE OVERVIEW;
BOARDS AUTHORIZE A MERGER OF LILCO AND BROOKLYN GAS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
In a deal with far-reaching political and financial implications, Brooklyn Union Gas and the Long Island Lighting Company agreed yesterday to a merger that would create a new utility and perhaps lead eventually to deep cuts in electric rates -- now the highest in the continental United States -- for 1.1 million customers on Long Island.
The merger, approved at board meetings at the companies' headquarters in Brooklyn and Hicksville, L.I., would involve a tax-free exchange of stock for securities in a new holding company, and would take effect in 12 to 18 months if endorsed by the stockholders of both companies and by state and Federal regulatory agencies. 
 Concluded in months of negotiations by Dr. William J. Catacosinos and Robert B. Catell, the chairmen and chief executives of Lilco and Brooklyn Union, with Gov. George E. Pataki and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in behind-the-scenes roles, the merger would create a utility with revenues of $4.5 billion, 8,400 employees and 2.2 million gas and electric customers on Long Island and in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.
"We have created a powerhouse here," Joseph W. McDonnell, Lilco's senior vice president for marketing and external affairs, said at a late afternoon news conference in Hicksville. He said the combined company would save $1 billion over the next decade by trimming its workforce through attrition, not layoffs, and through streamlined operations and other economies.
Governor Pataki, who encouraged the merger talks, said, "It's an important initial step toward our goal of double-digit rate reduction and taxpayer protection."
Consolidation of the neighboring utilities would open vast new territory on Long Island for Brooklyn Union's gas business, which now has 1.1 million customers in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Brooklyn Union, whose business in the city has nearly reached the saturation point, has long been eager to expand into Long Island, where many homes and businesses are not served by gas.
For Lilco, which has 1.1 million electric customers and 453,000 gas users, the deal could lead to modest electric rate reductions at first and deeper cuts later, if debts can be refinanced, and partnership with a financially solid New York City utility. Both companies envision savings from the fit, and a merger could lay the foundation for restructuring debts and resolving other problems.
For a transitional year after the merger, Dr. Catacosinos would be chairman and chief executive officer of the new holding company, and Mr. Catell would be president and chief operating officer, officials said. After that year, Mr. Catell would succeed Dr. Catacosinos as chief executive officer, with Dr. Catacosinos continuing as chairman. The board would be composed of 15 members -- 6 from Brooklyn Union, 6 from Lilco and 3 people previously unaffiliated with either company and jointly selected by the other 12.
Under the proposed transaction, Lilco's shareholders would receive .803 shares of the new company's stock for each of their shares, while Brooklyn Union stockholders would make a one-for-one exchange for shares in the new company. Brooklyn Union stock closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $31.13 on Friday, and Lilco's at $19.37.
Given those figures, Lilco shares would be worth $25 if the merger deal were to go through immediately. But no shares will be exchanged until the merger is official, and the values will depend on the relative stock prices at that time. Lilco has 121 million shares outstanding and Brooklyn Union about 50 million. In the new utility, Lilco shareholders will initially hold about 66 percent of the stock and Brooklyn Union shareholders will have 33 percent.
No name for the new company has been chosen, though the present names of Lilco and Brooklyn Union would be scrapped, and officials acknowledged that many questions remained about how to extricate Lilco from a crushing $4.5 billion debt associated with its never-opened nuclear plant at Shoreham, L.I., and how to sharply cut electric rates that have discouraged business and turned homeowners into enemies.
The planned merger would not directly address those problems, company officials acknowledged. Nor would it affect a $1.1 billion debt owed to Lilco by Suffolk County, the Town of Brookhaven and the Shoreham-Wading River School District. A State Supreme Court judge last month said Lilco was owed the money for excess taxes paid for the defunct Shoreham plant.
But the rewards of a merger could be significant for Brooklyn Union and Lilco and their stockholders, employees and customers, and could pave the way for refinancing deals to enable Lilco and Suffolk County taxpayers to ease their debts.
It could also help Governor Pataki, Senator D'Amato and other public officials with Long Island constituents avoid the political quagmire that Lilco's debt and high rates have come to represent. The Governor has pledged to eliminate Lilco as now constituted and to see to it that electric rates on Long Island are cut by at least 10 percent. He and Senator D'Amato face re-election campaigns in 1998.
Initial reaction to the planned merger was enthusiastic among politicians and residents of Long Island, who spoke of Brooklyn Union -- a profitable, highly rated utility that has been eager to expand -- as a comely partner for debt-ridden Lilco, which has been pilloried for years for residential electric rates averaging nearly $100 a month.
The Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, said: "If the merger results in a minimal rate cut and better management, it's a step in the right direction. But we cannot lose sight of the overall goals, which are double-digit rate cuts."
While no immediate rate cuts were in the offing, and projected efficiencies resulting from a merger raised the prospect of only small reductions, fiscal experts called the merger a crucial first step in laying the groundwork for a state refinancing of Lilco's debt for its Shoreham nuclear plant, abandoned in 1989 before it produced any commercial power.
High energy costs on Long Island -- exceeded in the United States only by those in Hawaii -- stem in part from the company's obligation to pay for the Shoreham nuclear plant, which cost $5.5 billion.
Dr. Catacosinos and Mr. Catell said they would both begin negotiations with the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency created to deal with the Lilco problem. The power authority has been in discussions with Lilco on a plan to refinance the debt through a sale of tax-exempt bonds, a deal in which the authority might take over some or all of Lilco's electricity operations.
Only by refinancing Lilco's debt -- spreading it out over many years -- can officials hope to achieve a double-digit reduction in the utility's electric rates, officials have said.
Dr. Catacosinos said yesterday that the power authority was "divided on the direction it wants to take," with some members favoring a full takeover and others a partial takeover. "We need to negotiate this," he said. Mr. Catell, for his part, said he believed an agreement with the authority could be reached in weeks.
Frank Zarb, chairman of the power authority, applauded the proposed merger yesterday and said that he, too, believed that an agreement could be reached quickly. "I think it's exactly what the doctor ordered," he said. "It's a very important and useful first step in getting rates down on Long Island." As for an agreement, he added: "We hope to make a determination within the next four weeks."
The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, said he was open to supporting a plan under which the power authority would take over Lilco's power generating and transmission system and refinance the Shoreham debt, provided that the actions would cut electric rates significantly. "I don't oppose a takeover," he said. "I just don't write a blank check. I just want to make sure this is a viable thing. If the numbers work for the ratepayers of Long Island, that's the bottom line."
In addition to the approval of two-thirds of the stockholders of the two companies -- votes expected in May -- the merger would require the approval of the State Public Service Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Chronology: "CHRONOLOGY: Lilco's Troubled History"
 The proposed merger of the Long Island Lighting Company and Brooklyn Union Gas would end the history of a company that was best known in recent years for its abondoned Shoreham nuclear power plant, and a series of lawsuits and public relations mistakes that soured its relationship with it customers.
 
APRIL 1965 -- Lilco annouces plans to build the Shoreham plant at a cost of $65 million to $75 million, estimating that it will become operational in 1973.
 
SEPT. 1976 -- Lilco files a grievance in Brookhaven township saying that the tax assessment on the Shoreham plant is too high. The township rejects the appeal. Each year, until 1992, Lilco files similar appeals, which are all rejected.
 
MARCH 1979 -- An accident at Three Mile Island stirs national concerns about the safety of nuclear power. In June, thousands demonstrate against the Shoreham plant. The company estimates the plant will be running by May 1981 at a cost of as much as $1.58 billion.
 
JAN. 1984 -- Lilco withholds tax payments to Suffolk County in protest of the Shoreham assessments. Dr. William J. Catacosinos is named chairman.
 
JULY 1985 -- Low-power testing at Shoreham begins.
 
SEPT. 1985 -- Hurricane Gloria leaves three-quarters of Lilco's customers without power for 11 days. Despite the crisis, Dr. Catacosinos does not return early from a vacation in Italy.
 
DEC. 1985 -- The Public Service Commission concludes that $1.4 billion of the $4.2 billion it took to build Shoreham is due to mismanagement and cannot be passed on to customers.
 
JAN. 1987 -- New York State creates the Long Island Power Authority and charges it to take steps to buy Lilco.
 
FEB. 1989 -- Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Lilco work out an agreement to close Shoreham.
 
DEC. 1995 -- Gov. George E. Pataki calls for the dissolution of Lilco and the public refinancing of its debt to reduce rates.
 
NOV. 1996 -- Brookhaven, Suffolk County and Shoreham-Wading River school district are ordered to pay as much as $1.1 billion in tax over-assessments to Lilco. (pg. B6)
 
Chart: "MERGING TWO UTILITIES: Highlights"
 Here is a look at plans for the Lilco-Brooklyn Union Gas merger:
 
A new holding company, as yet unnamed, will be formed to run all operations of the two utilities.
 
Brooklyn Union stockholders will receive one share in the new company for each share of Brooklyn Union. Lilco stockholders will receive .803 shares in the new company for each share of Lilco stock.
 
Dr. William J. Catacosinos, chairman of Lilco, will be chairman and chief executive of the new company. Robert B. Catell, chairman of Brooklyn Union, will be president and will succeed Dr. Catacosinos as chief executive one year after the merger.
 
The new company's 15-member board will include 6 Lilco directors, 6 Brooklyn Union directors and 3 directors not affiliated with either, to be chosen by the rest of the board. (pg. B6)
