Irish Hospitality With a Splash of Show Business

BYLINE: By HAROLD GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
IT'S just after 11 P.M. at Scratcher, an Irish bar that one month ago insinuated itself onto a quiet, tree-lined strip in the East Village. On this Wednesday night, the 1,000-square-foot space, at 209 East Fifth Street, is packed with assorted downtown denizens, many of whom were passionate patrons of Sin-e, the Irish cafe on St. Marks Place that changed ownership a few months ago. In one corner, a dozen Irish regulars, all musicians, play fiddles and flutes while a woman sings a plangent folk dirge about love and death.
Scratcher's success is due in large part to Karl Geary, its long-tressed and fashionably tattooed 23-year-old co-owner. Mr. Geary, Sin-e's former manager, has become a minor star of sorts. Two summers ago, he was featured in Madonna's "Sex" video. "It was like being in bed with the whole Coca-Cola corporation," he says. And he will appear as Renfield in "Nadja," the David Lynch-produced vampire movie to be released in August, starring Elina Lowensohn. But his current passion is Scratcher. "Scratcher's what they called us people on the dole in Dublin, kind of my roots," Mr. Geary says. 
 The place itself is simple, with walls glazed in soothing umber and burnt sienna. For sale behind the bar are Tatos -- odiferous Irish cheddar-and-onion potato chips -- cans of Batchelor's baked beans and bags of Irish coffee. As he stands behind the bar pouring Guinness the careful Irish way, two women at the bar talk about Mr. Geary.
"O.K.," one says. "Karl. Scale of one to ten."
"Nine. Umm. No. Eight. Too naive for nine."
This conversation makes Mr. Geary uncomfortable. "The place isn't about me," he says. "It's about the people who come here."
At a table near the bar, Carolyn Adelman, a production assistant for Michael Moore's "TV Nation," seems to agree. "I'm in my element here," she says. She and some editors from HarperCollins are playing a word game. They stare into their beers as if such concentration will reveal the definition of "adipose."
At the bar, Adam Roth, the leader singer with Psychic Penguin, amuses two women with an Elvis Presley imitation. "This is Ireland," Mr. Roth says later. "It's more like a Galway bar, wide open, than a Dublin bar, which is nook filled and pub-y. And Karl is this enigma, an old soul trapped in a young body."
Whatever the bar's attraction, Mr. Geary has enjoyed the fabled luck of the Irish. He sits down, eats a Milky Way bar, pops two Advil, lights a Marlboro and says: "Spike Lee and his crew liked the place so much, they switched the wrap party for 'Girl 6' from the Bowery Bar. What a party it was. Beautiful women dancing. I had to hold back one of the bartenders from joining in." HAROLD GOLDBERG

HEADLINE: After Assurances on California Jobs, Clinton Is Expected to Approve Base-Closing List

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
After agonizing for more than a week, President Clinton is expected to approve the recommendations of an independent commission on military bases, now that the Pentagon has been assured that it has the authority to keep thousands of jobs at a California Air Force base, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Clinton had been considering rejecting the commission's recommendation to close McClellan Air Force Base near Sacramento because the loss of the installation's 11,000 military and civilian jobs would hurt the economy of a large state crucial to his 1996 campaign hopes. 
 That prompted complaints from Republicans and some commission members that the White House was meddling in a process set up to insulate decisions about base closings from political influence.
A final decision has not been made but could come as early as Monday. In an exchange of letters late Saturday, the commission's chairman, Alan J. Dixon, a former Democratic Senator from Illinois, assured Deputy Defense Secretary John P. White that the panel's recommendations could allow the Pentagon to turn over all but about 800 jobs at McClellan to local private contractors. Pentagon lawyers had demanded written assurances that this was what the panel intended.
That may assuage the White House and let Mr. Clinton claim victory for California, but it carries a political price. Some commission members said that the Administration had hurt the integrity of the base-closing process by having Mr. White, the secretaries of the Air Force and Navy, and other Pentagon political appointees call panel members in the previous 48 hours to express concerns over the specific intent of the commission's recommendation on McClellan.
"That's why we're getting a little angry," said Joe Robles Jr., a retired Army general and member of the commission who received calls from Mr. White and a senior Army official. "It looks like they're just trying to score Brownie points with California."
Senior Administration aides denied playing politics with a process that had remained largely apolitical through three earlier rounds of base closings. They said they were just trying to clarify what the eight-member commission really meant to say on McClellan, since this is the last scheduled round of closings.
"I wanted to understand what each was thinking, and we have an obligation to talk to them," Mr. White said in a telephone interview.
But in none of the earlier rounds has an Administration hemmed and hawed so openly, for political reasons, over a panel's findings. In 1988 and 1991 President George Bush quickly endorsed the commission's work and sent it to Congress, which speedily approved the findings. The same was true in 1993, under President Clinton.
"This dithering has hurt the President more than anything," said a commission member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. California politicians are also upset, because they say that the assurances do not guarantee that the jobs will stay in the area.
By law Mr. Clinton has until July 15 to approve the commission's list or send it back with specific objections. If the President were to send it back, the panel would have until Aug. 15 to make any changes. At that point, Mr. Clinton would have to accept or reject the list in its entirety.
Mr. Clinton met for 90 minutes on Saturday with Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Mr. White, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, and Anthony Lake, the national security adviser.
Much of the meeting focused on how to keep McClellan's jobs in private hands after the base closed, a concept called "privatization in place." Mr. Clinton asked Pentagon officials to provide in the next few days more details on how this would work.
Also at issue was whether the commission's recommendation on McClellan allowed the Pentagon to award local contractors those jobs. Lawyers for the commission said it did. Pentagon lawyers wanted more specific language.
This disagreement prompted the phone calls from Pentagon officials to individual commissioners.
"As far as I'm concerned this was drafted as an open process and should be an open process," said Wendi Louise Steele, a commissioner. "If I were in their position, I wouldn't make those calls."
But other commission members said they saw no harm. Benjamin F. Montoya, a retired rear admiral who said he received calls from Mr. White and Secretary of the Navy John Dalton, said: "Secretary Dalton called and wanted to know what procedure I'd find acceptable. I don't think it was lobbying. He just wanted my views on the language."
J. B. Davis, a retired Air Force general who said he spoke to Mr. White and Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall, said: "It doesn't upset me at all. They're just trying to measure something before they put it on the table."
But General Davis said that the White House had overreacted to the concerns of California's two Democratic Senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, before receiving the commission's recommendations on July 1. "Almost anything they do now appears political," he said.
In response to a letter from Mr. White, Mr. Dixon repeated in writing on Saturday what he had said publicly for weeks: that the commission's recommendation authorizes the Pentagon to transfer all work at McClellan, except about 800 communications jobs, to any other Defense Department depot "or to any private sector commercial activity, local or otherwise, including privatization in place."
The panel directed that the communications jobs go to the Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania.
Mr. White said Mr. Dixon's letter and his conversations with other commission members satisfied the Pentagon's legal questions.

TELEVISION: Smelling blood, Fox is taking quick aim at NBC's beleaguered 'Saturday Night Live.'

BYLINE: By Bill Carter 

 BODY:
NBC's "Saturday Night Live" has been written off as dead numerous times in its 20-year run, but only this year has the speculation been taken seriously enough for its competitors to consider trying to rub out the show permanently.
While ABC and CBS have both been developing late-night shows for Saturdays, Fox has already announced its plans: starting in October the network will offer its own Saturday night sketch-comedy show, "Mad TV." 
 The program will be Fox's return to late-night TV after three failures, most recently with the "Chevy Chase Show" in 1993. Executives of Fox told their affiliated station managers recently that its ambition to grow into a full-fledged network required expansion into the late-night arena.
But the stations have resisted another late-night Fox show on weeknights because that is when the stations make big profits with syndicated programs. For Fox to get a new chance in that area, it may have to first prove that it can make late-night programming work on Saturdays.
"Mad TV" will be produced in association with Mad magazine, which is owned by Time Warner Inc. The show will be a mix of dark humor, social commentary and movie satire. (The pilot features a long sketch called "Gump Fiction" that transforms Forrest Gump into a "Pulp Fiction"-style hired gun.)
Like its rival on NBC, "Mad TV" will feature young, mostly unknown actors. Unlike "Saturday Night Live," it won't be live and won't be broadcast from New York. Rather, it will taped earlier in the week in Los Angeles.
"Mad TV" also won't be on at 11:30 P.M.; instead, the network will try to get a jump on NBC by starting the show at 11. This reflects a continuing strategy in Fox's guerrilla war against the more established networks: find every possible advantage to go after the big network properties. If Fox could succeed in wresting coverage of the National Football League from CBS, the thinking goes, then why not take a run at "Saturday Night Live"?
And Fox has another advantage: Unlike the other networks' trying to grab some of the estimated $20 million to $30 million a year that "Saturday Night Live" brings in for NBC, Fox already has access to an hour of late-night time on Saturdays. ABC and CBS must recapture time from affiliated stations, which now fill that period with their own programs.
Fox's affiliates, however, have been broadcasting repeats of a Fox show, "Tales from the Crypt," at 11 on Saturday nights.
That show has done "reasonably well for us," said John Matoian, president of the Fox Entertainment Group, which oversees the network's programming. "We just decided it was time to be more aggressive on Saturdays."
One reason, he said, is the perceived vulnerability of "Saturday Night Live," which has been assailed by critics in the last two years as creatively bankrupt and in bad taste. But, Mr. Matoian added: "I'm not one of the people ready to write 'Saturday Night Live' off. It's still a formidable franchise. Lorne Michaels has fixed that show before."
Mr. Michaels, the creator and executive producer of "Saturday Night Live," has been all over the country recently auditioning new comedians to revive the show. A nearly all-new cast is expected in the fall.
But that cast will now face a similar program. The only concession that Mr. Matoian will make to NBC's incumbent status is, "We won't premiere the same week in October that they do."
Despite the obvious appeal of "Mad TV" to the younger viewers that Fox has always attracted, Mr. Matoian, who is in his mid-40's, is the first Fox programmer whose style seems more suited to putting shows on CBS than Fox.
In fact, Mr. Matoian did put shows on CBS, mostly movies, as head of the network's movie division for three years until joining Fox in 1994. Those movies generally appealed to viewers older than 40, while the Fox audience often needs to have three viewers in the same room for their combined age to reach 40.
Mr. Matoian acknowledged that "I certainly wasn't a watcher of this network." He was put off, he said, by Fox's penchant for shows that featured "sex for sex's sake."
Of course, those shows helped put Fox on the network map. But Rupert Murdoch, chairman of Fox and its parent, the News Corporation, has now set the network on a course to compete across the board, which means fewer raucous shows strictly for teen-agers.
To make the job easier, Mr. Murdoch has backed Mr. Matoian with the biggest financial commitment Fox has ever made to programming.
In the past, Fox put almost every pilot it made onto the air and never held any shows in reserve as backup series. Last spring, Mr. Matoian was able to commission 26 pilots, by far the most Fox has ever made, to find the eight new series that he will put on the air this fall. He was even able to put seven other shows into production as backups.
"Rupert went out and spent billions of dollars on football and improving our station lineup," Mr. Matoian said. "He also understands that to add value to that, the entertainment schedule has to also be upgraded."
Although Mr. Matoian declined to cite the amount, he said: "I have a much bigger budget to work with. We're upping the ante all over. I didn't set a figure. I just said, 'I need more original movies; I need more original series.' "
But before "Mad TV" or any other new Fox program can get on the air, the network must suffer through what so far has been a disastrous summer of plunging ratings. A week ago, Fox had a minuscule prime-time rating of 4.4, its lowest since January 1989. (Each rating point represents 954,000 homes.)
"The economics of saving on paying for extra original shows in the summer start to make no sense if you lose all your audience," Mr. Matoian said.

HEADLINE: Stolen Cars Find a World Of Welcome

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
The glittering green Toyota 4-Runner sat in a lot at a port terminal here, surrounded by a sea of cars waiting to be shipped overseas. But something looked wrong.
The trunk lock was sealed crudely with a jagged piece of metal and four screws, suggesting a break-in. Jose Valentin, a Newark police detective, and his partner, Douglass Farrell, a United States Customs Service agent, sniffed around the car for more clues, prying open its hood, crouching to look up at its belly, pointing to spots where identification stickers had been peeled off. 
 After deciphering a manufacturer's coded engraving to learn the Toyota's true identification number, they made a call to headquarters. Reported stolen in Coney Island, Brooklyn, the $31,000 Toyota, mixed in with legitimate exports, had been on its way to Tallin, Estonia.
The nations that have emerged from the Soviet Union are a common destination for the flourishing traffic in stolen luxury cars and sport utility vehicles. A growing number of stolen Lexuses, Mercedes-Benzes, Jeep Grand Cherokees and Nissan Pathfinders are being shipped overseas, to nations where they can be impossible to buy legally.
Demand from China, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has pushed the number of stolen cars shipped overseas to as many as 375,000 a year -- of 1.5 million cars stolen annually in the United States, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an organization financed by insurance companies to fight vehicle theft and fraud. The number sent overseas in 1990 was 200,000, said Ernest R. Zwicke, an agent with the bureau. The demand then was fueled chiefly by the drug trade in Latin America, which remains a major destination for stolen cars, he said. Less than a decade ago, there was barely a market.
The cars have a familiar snob appeal for the entrepreneurial class that has flourished under the political and economic liberalization in formerly Communist countries. "Foreign cars are prestigious -- certainly more so than a Lada," said one Moscow driver, Yevgeny V. Yurchenko, comparing them with the typical Russian car.
The flow of cars has also been hastened by the breakup of police states where borders were rigidly controlled, said Dennis J. Benjamin, manager for outbound enforcement in the Customs Service's Washington headquarters.
The unusual thing about the Toyota in the Port of Newark was how easily it was spotted. Detective Valentin recognized the car as a 1995 model, not a 1990, as the paperwork said, and knew that smugglers often age cars on paper to deflect attention. But only a small fraction of stolen cars are recovered by the Customs Service, which has a limited force of inspectors. The number of cars recovered has climbed modestly since 1992, but their value has skyrocketed. In 1992, agents intercepted 1,700 cars worth $6.8 million, or $4,000 each; in 1994, they stopped 2,300 cars worth $30.1 million, or $13,100 each.
Rings of immigrants are operating in many port cities: The Hong Kong gangs known as triads steal cars in Los Angeles for the market in China; a Polish gang in Chicago specializes in Eastern Europe; Latin American rings work out of Miami, Federal officials say.
But nowhere is the trend more pronounced than in the New York region, even though overall car theft is down in New York City. The region is "the national leader in sheer number of cars stolen," said Lieut. Robert Martin of the New York Police Department's Auto Crime Squad. "It has access to ports in New York City and New Jersey and it has a concentration of immigrants," he said.
In the last three years, enforcement agencies have cracked down on rings smuggling cars to points including Latin America, China, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Nigeria and Ghana, Lieutenant Martin said.
In February, with the arrests of two charismatic Bronx auto-shop owners, Fernando Pena and Juan Ovalles, the authorities got an unusually good look into the worldwide black market for cars. The two headed an organization that stole more than 100 cars a month and resold them in the Dominican Republic, according to court documents, the F.B.I. and New York police officials.
The police trailed ring members for 15 months and arrested 29 of them. Mr. Pena, 52, had been arrested and convicted several times since 1971 on charges related to car theft, but he resurrected his business each time, becoming something of a legend in the industry and earning the nickname the Godfather. Mr. Ovalles, 44, was less experienced, but his reputation was equally secure among associates who called him Juan Chapa -- "chapa" being Spanish slang for a counterfeit vehicle identification plate. Their trial is set for the fall.
Together, the two had 30 years in auto theft, said Arthur Grubert, assistant special agent in charge of the criminal division at the F.B.I.'s New York office. But it was not until around 1990 that they dipped into the new and highly lucrative export business. F.B.I. officials said the ringleaders bribed Dominican customs officials for the certificates of origin of cars that had been imported legally into the Dominican Republic. With the certificates in their hands, the ringleaders dispatched thieves to steal vehicles of matching make and model, usually Mitsubishi Monteros, Toyota Land Cruisers and other four-wheel-drive vehicles popular in Latin America. The cars were retagged with fake identification plates. Some were sold through dishonest dealerships in New Jersey, but most were stuffed into oceangoing containers and shipped out of Newark or Miami.
"Sometimes this happened as quick as two days," one F.B.I. agent said. "The car was on its way to the D.R. even before the owner realized it was stolen."
The cars found their way to the showrooms of two Santo Domingo dealerships, whose owners -- relatives or friends of the Bronx men -- have also been charged. Sometimes, however, the demand for Monteros or Land Cruisers was so heavy that the vehicles were shipped to Santo Domingo without any final destination. Word of a shipment spread quickly, and dealers gathered at the port to bid on the cars.
The economics of smuggling luxury cars are clear to anyone who wants to import -- legally -- a Lexus LS400 to China. Toyota does not sell Lexuses in China, a nation with tariffs that would put a price of between $120,000 and $125,000 on an LS400 that costs $52,000 here, said Carnie Colliver of Auto Pacific Group, a consulting firm in Santa Ana, Calif.
By contrast, a Lexus can be bought cheaply and quickly on the black market. A smuggler could pay several hundred dollars to the street-level thief, a few thousand to ship the Lexus to Hong Kong and maybe more to bribe customs officials to clear it into China. Even if the ring sold the car in China for as little as $60,000, it would pocket a profit of as much as $50,000. The popularity of the Lexus in China has kept gangs in the United States and Hong Kong busy and given rise to a booming black market in spare parts.
While China and Russia may not yet have an American-style middle-class of consumers, the emergence of a sizable monied class has produced strange car-buying habits: The Lexus and Mercedes have leapfrogged the Ford Taurus and Honda Accord.
The cars stolen in the United States increasingly reflect the demand overseas, said Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute. Of the top 10 cars with the highest risk of being stolen in 1994, four were sport utility vehicles and four were luxury cars. Just three years ago, the most popular were still sports cars taken on joy rides or older models stolen for parts.
The problem begins at the nation's ports, where enforcement lies primarily in the hands of the U.S. Customs Service, which has 6,500 inspectors nationwide but only about 230 assigned specifically to monitor exports.
Smugglers typically contact a shipping company that supplies steel containers, usually 40 feet long, 10 feet wide and 10 feet high. As many as three cars are stuffed inside, sometimes hidden behind trapdoors and surrounded by furniture and garbage. The smugglers report thecontents to the shipping company, omitting, of course, the cars. The company simply hands customs officials a manifest of the cargo.
"You'll go to East New York, Brooklyn," Mr. Farrell, the customs agent in Newark, said, "and on a deserted block, you'll see four ocean-going containers. Why?"
At the port, customs inspectors open a container only if they have received a tip, or if the destination and paperwork look suspicious, said James A. Sullivan, a customs officials who supervises the two-year-old Vehicle Enforcement Team in Newark. Random checks are seldom made of the 1.5 million containers a year leaving the nation's second-busiest port. "To search thoroughly one 40-foot container will take four or five guys eight hours," he said.
To detect smuggled cars, the Customs Service is testing a giant X-ray machine in a port near San Diego. For their part, auto makers, concerned that rising insurance rates will dissuade drivers from buying certain models, are making it harder to alter their identification markers. But law enforcement officials agree that to curb illegal exports, they must address the problem overseas. Agents from the National Insurance Crime Bureau are in Europe -- especially in Poland and the Baltics, which are transfer points -- to train local customs officials to identify stolen cars from the United States. Robert M. Perito, the director of the Office of International Criminal Justice in the State Department, said the United States and the Central American nations are close to signing treaties that will make it easier to return stolen cars.
Joe Pierron, the international director for the insurance crime bureau, said that even with the treaties, recovering a stolen car will be laborious and costly. But in the long run, enough recoveries might dampen the demand overseas.
"The buyers over there must face the risk of losing their stolen cars," he said. "Now they don't."

HEADLINE: TV News Crossing Old Lines On Jobs

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
It was Friday night, the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend, when Jerry Nachman, vice president of news at WCBS-TV (Channel 2) in New York, got a phone call at home telling him three things: that Elizabeth Holtzman, the former New York City Comptroller, had been mugged at an automatic teller machine in Manhattan, that two city firefighters had helped to catch the culprit and that Channel 2 had no reporter available to cover the story.
Mr. Nachman, a newsman for 25 years, dashed downstairs to a news van at his front door, got to the scene, interviewed Ms. Holzman and the firefighters, and reported it all live on the 11 o'clock Channel 2 news. 
 Inadvertently, Mr. Nachman thus added his own peculiar hybrid to the growing ranks of what is known in the television business as "hyphenates." Mr. Nachman's hyphenated position that night was "vice president-reporter," which may be a first.
But further down in the ranks, more and more categories are being melded into new combinations in television newsrooms, creating such hyphenates as director-technical director or writer-producer, or even triple titles like cameraman-reporter-editor. And union lines are being crossed as never before.
"What's happening now would have been unthinkable some years ago," Mr. Nachman said, "because unions were so jurisdictional and companies were so stratified. But for reasons ranging from downsizing by companies to enlightened self-interest by unions, we're getting some new combinations."
In the last half-dozen years, television news organizations' desires to cut costs and their unions' desires to remain relevant have combined with the increasing sophistication of video technology to accelerate the trend toward combining jobs.
In the early days of television, not only were cameras hefty and awkward, but separate equipment was required for lighting and sound, the responsibility of separate technicians. Now, separate sound and lighting technicians are rarely used on spot-news assignments. And less technical expertise is needed to use equipment in the studio.
"Cameras alone cost $50,000 or $60,000 as recently as 5 or 10 years ago," said David Bartlett, president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association. "Now, you can buy these 8-millimeter cameras for $10,000 or less, and you or I can't tell the difference in picture quality. If they can put five cameras on the street intead of one, they can multiply the number of stories they can cover. And you don't need highly trained technicians to ride herd on that $50,000 camera, either."
Reporters have carried cameras and directors have doubled as writers and producers for a long time in smaller cities, and in nonunion organizations like New York 1 News, the all-news cable channel owned by Time Warner Inc., in New York City.
But at the networks and the big-city stations, such crossovers have been slower to occur, largely because of union rules. At ABC and NBC, most technicians are represented by the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, known as NABET. At CBS, most belong to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, or I.B.E.W., which, several people in the industry say, has been the most flexible union in pioneering the boundary-crossing job categories.
The electrical workers began negotiating with CBS in the mid-1980's on how to reconcile management's desire for more flexibility with unions' desire to protect jobs. The compromise they eventually worked out -- its details have often been amended in recent contracts -- permits an individual to work across union lines so long as the individual is a dues-paying member of all the unions involved.
For example, one person can now do a job that used to need two people: a director (or associate director), which is a category from the Director's Guild of America union, and a technical director, a category from the I.B.E.W. or NABET.
"Instead of the director calling out 'take three' to the T.D., and the T.D. pushing the button for camera No. 3, one guy just pushes button 3 himself," said Tom Bradford, executive producer of "CBS Up To the Minute," the network's overnight news program.
Now three years old, the program has served as a laboratory for some of these cross-union experiments. "Our show had to be compact, in terms of manpower and budget, and the unions have been very cooperative," Mr. Bradford said. "Our producers write copy and physically cut and edit videotape. We can have late tape come in from a news agency, and we can assemble a news report fast, using a writer-producer-editor if need be."
He said some of the staff members had come from local stations elsewhere in the country and were accustomed to doing several jobs.
Conversely, Mr. Nachman said, "a lot of people from big stations in places like New York got so specialized they only knew the work that spanned their own two arms, and when they wanted to change their lives and move to some place like Portland or Albuquerque, they found they were unemployable."
The networks have generally been slower than local stations at melding job categories, with the exception of their foreign staffing.
"In Europe, if a five-person crew covers a story for five days, the cost for hotel rooms, air fare and baggage for all their equipment can add up to $25,000 or $30,000 for that assignment," said John Stack, foreign news editor for NBC News. "If you can send three people, it's that much less costly.
"And safety is a concern in war zones. In Bosnia, for example, we'll send a cameraman-editor, a correspondent and a producer. They can get around more quickly; they can split up if need be."
Mr. Stack said the "multi-skilled technician and editorial person is certainly the electronic journalist of the future."

Honoring Repression

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At a convocation this fall, Williams College in Massachusetts will confer full academic honors on its alumnus Goh Chok Tong, Prime Minister of Singapore.
In that dictatorship (where chewing gum gets you a $1,000 fine and sharing a marijuana cigarette invites the death penalty) students are prohibited from waving political banners. 
 "If you allow students to do so," Mr. Goh has said, "then workers will begin to do so over the slightest grievance, and if you have several such demonstrations, right away the impression is created the government is not in control of the situation -- that the place may become unstable, and that will have an impact on foreign investors."
Some Williams faculty, sensitive to what philosophy professor Sam Fleischacker calls "the irony of offering the leader of the world's foremost opponent of academic freedom an academic honor," protested to the college's president, Harry C. Payne.
Mr. Payne replied that Mr. Goh -- who seized a three-year-old invitation -- "embodies the mission and hope" of Singapore, adding lamely "the tendering of a degree is not intended to honor every aspect of a person, a government, or a set of ideas."
"The event will be used as a powerful symbolic tool in Singapore," responded Mr. Fleischacker, "to show that no matter how flagrantly Singapore's government violates basic political rights, its 'success' will still win it acceptance and indeed honor with the Western nations. Williams' action will help vindicate the International Herald Tribune's regular caving-in to Singapore's judicial blackmail. . . ."
Now there's a comment that tromps on journalism's tenderest corns. When an American academic, Christopher Lingle, dared to suggest in an I.H.T. article that "dynastic politics" played a part in governing some Asian nations, Singapore's dictator, Lee Kuan Yew, assumed that the shoe fit him. He brought a libel suit before his hand-picked judges to humiliate the American newspaper.
On the advice of local counsel all too cozy with the ruling party, The Trib apologized. This only whetted the appetite of the dictator and his front man, Mr. Goh, who is warming the prime minister's seat until Lee's son, the dauphin, can take over.
In a Singapore courtroom two weeks ago, Goh denied being "a stooge for Prime Minister Lee" but then let the cat out of the dynastic bag: Such press criticism, said Goh, "simply destroys what we have set out to do, and that is to have a smooth transfer of power to the next generation."
Dictator Lee's testimony, though sometimes Queeg-like in his fear of criticism, was shrewder than his front man's. The dictator tried to drive a wedge between The Trib's owners: "There are two parties in The I.H.T.; one is The Washington Post and the other is The New York Times. My relations with The Washington Post have always been more equable. They are less of aggressive crusaders against me . . . so there are two parts to this and one is The New York Times [that] William Safire is on."
Thanks, but The Post is not the pushover the dictator suggests. Nor did Dow Jones, when its Far East Economic Review was "bleeding" because of Lee's advertising and circulation restrictions, fire an editor to placate the regime, as Lee intimated. (The dictator concluded by praising The Trib's counsel, "who knows me very well," and who did not presume to cross-examine.)
Despite oleaginous pretensions about a new Asian culture that transcends human rights, Lee, Goh and the dauphin represent old-fashioned European totalitarianism.
Should Williams College rescind its invitation, as "No Goh" faculty urge? Quite the contrary; let's hear his anti-freedom pitch. But a Williams political scientist (George.T.Crane@williams.edu) is organizing a serious, educational counter-award ceremony.
Christopher Lingle, out of reach of corrupt judges' crippling fines and canes, has agreed to come; so has Francis Seow, former Solicitor General who was imprisoned for his dissent, "softly tortured" by Lee's thugs and exiled to Harvard.
The college president is resisting the simultaneous appearance of the opposition; perhaps Williams alumni and trustees will reason with him.
If Goh has guts, he'll agree to a panel debate. And if The Singapore Straits wants to run today's essay under "Safire Snipes Again," as the lap-dog sheet has done before -- it's free.

HEADLINE: ON HOCKEY;
A Long Day's Journey Into the Off Season

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe 

DATELINE: EDMONTON, Alberta

 BODY:
Here in the National Hockey League's northernmost outpost, the summer sky disorients a visitor's body clock. The sun doesn't set until after 10 P.M., the dusk lingers long after that and the dawn breaks a few hours later.
This surreal setting was appropriate for the symbolic conclusion of the winter game's longest season. This was the site of the Entry Draft, Trade Fair and Gossip Flea Market on Saturday at Northlands Coliseum. 
 During the 15-week lockout of autumn and winter, it seemed as if the games would never begin. During the playoffs of spring and summer, it seemed as if they would never end.
Finally, it's all over except for the wheeling and dealing, and the sun never sets on that sort of thing. Much of it will involve unrestricted free agents who haven't already been scooped up by Mike Keenan's St. Louis Blues.
He has lured Dale Hawerchuk from Buffalo, is close to obtaining Geoff Courtnall from Vancouver and he's not finished.
"We are pretty assertive in our approach," said Keenan, the general manager and coach. "It's an avenue provided by the new collective bargaining agreement. We'll try to utilize it to our advantage."
Keenan alone could save the league from collusion allegations, but it won't please Neil Smith, the president and general manager of the Rangers. Smith, Keenan's boss until their bitter parting of last summer, complained about Keenan's free spending for free agents.
"If you show up five minutes after the store opens, they're in a Blues' uniform," Smith said.
No doubt this gripe will amuse rival general managers who grumbled that Smith and the Rangers bought themselves a 1994 Stanley Cup with their liberal spending policies of the early 1990's.
But much has changed at Madison Square Garden, where David Checketts has risen from the basketball side to supervise the whole operation. How will his monetary policies affect Neil the Deal as he tries to pry Teemu Selanne and Keith Tkachuk from the Winnipeg Jets?
Both are Group 2 free agents, meaning the Jets retain the right to either match salary offers or accept draft choices in compensation. Both are among the elite forwards in the business.
Selanne, 25, is a right wing from Finland; Tkachuk, 23, is a left wing from Massachusetts. To avoid compensation, Smith has been trying to trade for their rights. He said a team has to inquire about "10 or 15" Group 2 free agents "to have a chance at even one of them."
Others in this category include Shayne Corson of Edmonton and Pat Verbeek of the Rangers. A big bid for Verbeek by Keenan would certainly affect Smith's payroll, wouldn't it? Relax; both are more likely to compete for unrestricted free agents like Brian Noonan from the Rangers, Joel Otto from Calgary and Bob Bassen from Denver.
In the meantime, Smith has another important contract to consider: his own. With two seasons left on the current pact, he remains disillusioned that it wasn't rewritten after the cup championship.
Those who know him also note the absence of the "Ranger for Life" testimonials that Smith was known for in the early 1990's, when hockey buff Stanley Jaffe was his boss. One can only wonder how far President of the Rangers ranks below Coach of the Knicks at Eighth Avenue and 33d Street.
Smith isn't the only local executive needing a real vote of confidence. Don Maloney, going into the last season of his contract as general manager of the Islanders, said his status "is something we'll have to address."
"I don't want it to become a distraction," said Maloney.
Rest assured it will be, as long as Mike Milbury, the new coach with front-office ambitions, has a longer contract. Despite the signing of Todd Bertuzzi, the forward originally drafted in the first round in 1993, and the drafting of defenseman Wade Redden, Maloney has numerous holes to fill on his roster.
His franchise, a dynasty a little more than a decade ago, is the only one of the three in the New York area that hasn't won the cup recently. Both he and Milbury are strong-willed former players of the same generation. A new deal for Maloney might insure that the positive creative tension between them isn't replaced by destructive political maneuvering.
As for the Devils, the current champs, their visit here was a victory tour. Coach Jacques Lemaire might have a sore hand and back from all the shaking and patting. In repose, his round face sometimes looks like that of the man in the moon. The smile that stayed on in all weekend was as big and bright as the Alberta sky.
His boss, Lou Lamoriello, said there has been "progress" in the "positive" negotiations to remain at Byrne Arena and avoid a move to Nashville. That's as close to a leak as Lamoriello will ever get.
Speaking of leaks, politics and chief executives, Lamoriello's Devils will visit President Clinton today at the White House. Unlike the Rangers, who showed up late for their Rose Garden fete, the Devils will probably arrive on time for their day in the sun. With the season so out of sync, it's about time for these hockey guys to get back on schedule.

HEADLINE: After Strong Rise, Japan Stocks Level Off

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, July 10

 BODY:
Japanese stocks closed today only slightly higher after initially extending last week's strong advance in the morning session.
At the close, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 29.58 points, or about two-tenths of 1 percent, to stand at 16,242.66. At the morning break, the Nikkei had risen 332.09 points, or more than 2 percent, on optimism that lower interest rates and a weaker dollar would revitalize Japan's economy. 
 That followed Friday's performance, when the market dazzled analysts, with stocks surging 956.19 points, or nearly 6.3 percent, after interest-rate cuts on successive days by the United States' Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.
"The new dynamic is the fact that it looks like the discount rate may go lower and finally the yen is softening," Louis Tseng, managing director of equity derivative products at Lehman Brothers Japan, said early in the day.
The dollar was trading around 87 yen in Asian markets, little changed from New York levels late on Friday, but about one yen above where it had traded over the last month.
"We expect the momentum to carry forward," Dhia Amir, an equity trader at Nomura Securities here, said early in the day. But the trader warned that concerns about the economy and approaching elections for the upper house of the Japanese Parliament could cut short the rally.

HEADLINE: Health Care Report Cards

 BODY:
Health care reform received a potential boost earlier this month at a meeting in Wyoming of large private and public employers. They created a foundation to spur health plans to provide consumers with information that can help determine which plans provide the best treatment.
Participants in the Wyoming meeting vowed to use their collective influence -- together, they employ 80 million workers -- to force health plans to report data that would show which programs provide the most effective care. Based on the information, the foundation would produce periodic report cards on quality of care, matters like the recovery rates from colon cancer treatment or heart attacks. 
 The Wyoming meeting, run by the Jackson Hole Group -- private health care experts who developed the market-based reform known as managed competition -- was attended by executives from big employers like American Express. It also included officials from the health plan that covers Federal employees and the Federal agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid, raising the prospect of public-private partnership.
The employers expressed confidence that they have, finally, brought medical costs under control. Last year employee medical costs fell by about 1 percent, after steadily rising at double-digit rates. Though costs could turn up again, the officials nevertheless agreed to move on to the elusive task of measuring quality so employees could learn which plans offer inferior care.
The explosive growth of managed care has helped bring health care inflation down. Studies show that the average managed care plan provides care that is as good as traditional fee-for-service coverage. But there is potential for abuse. Managed care plans charge a fixed premium regardless of how much treatment a patient requires. That gives these plans a short-run incentive to save money by providing fewer tests and other treatment. In theory, short-run cost-cutting ought to be tempered by a desire to keep small health problems from growing into expensive problems.
The other key to keeping health plans, including fee-for-service plans, in line is to hold their quality up to public scrutiny. Report cards measuring recovery, morbidity and mortality rates would be a good first step. The foundation will develop quality measures for several diseases each year and promises a useful report card in only three or four years.
Report cards, acting as a guide for consumer choices, can help drive health costs down and quality up. Large purchasers now seem committed to carry the process forward.

HEADLINE: Man's Museum of Memories Relives the Terror for Blacks

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, July 7

 BODY:
A survivor of history and horror, James Cameron is the founder and tour guide of "America's Black Holocaust Museum" here.
He is also its star exhibit. 
 On an oven-hot August night 65 years ago, as a 16-year-old youth, Mr. Cameron watched a laughing and chanting white mob of thousands lynch two of his teen-age buddies from a tree on the courthouse lawn in his hometown, Marion, Ind. As he told the story the other day to a group touring the museum, it sounded as though the "time of terror" had happened yesterday.
Mr. Cameron was supposed to be the third black teen-ager to be hanged that night, without a trial or a prayer, for the robbery and slaying the day before of Claude Deeter, a white man. But after being dragged from jail and beaten, a rope thrown around his neck, Mr. Cameron's life was spared by the mob, apparently satisfied that enough had been done.
"I can forgive," he said. "But I can never forget. That's why I started this museum."
A retired building engineer and self-taught historian, Mr. Cameron opened the museum in 1988, several years after being moved to tears by a visit to the holocaust museum in Israel with his wife of 57 years.
"When I came out and composed myself," he said, "I told my wife, 'Honey, we need a museum like this in America to show what has happened to us black people and the freedom-loving white people who have been trying to help us.' "
The museum, in a former boxing gym on the edge of a weary Milwaukee neighborhood, is a collection of gruesome photographs of lynchings, including one as recently as 1981 in Alabama, plus Ku Klux Klan robes and hoods and two black wax figures dangling from a tree in the museum's "chamber of horrors."
"A lot of grown folks have to sit down after they see this," said Mr. Cameron, who moved here in the 1950's. "But it's important to remember. The Klan is still here. They send me their literature all the time."
A dozen visitors to the museum listened to Mr. Cameron's journey through "America's racist nightmare," some with their eyes closed, others sitting forward in their chairs, their heads down.
Then Mr. Cameron held up a poster-size photograph of his two friends, dangling dead in the tree, an image he called "one of the most famous lynching pictures in the world."
In the photograph, a white man with a Hitler-style mustache is looking into the camera and pointing up at the teen-agers.
"I was supposed to be hanging right there between my buddies," Mr. Cameron said. "There were thousands of people out there, acting like they were at a picnic."
Later, the photographer sold copies of the picture to sightseers for 50 cents each.
Mr. Cameron, now 81, spent four years in prison for Mr. Deeter's death. He was convicted as an accessory before the fact to voluntary manslaughter.
No one has ever been tried for lynching Mr. Cameron's buddies, Tommy Shipp and Abe Smith.
In 1993, the Governor of Indiana officially pardoned Mr. Cameron.
"The Government owed you a lot more than a pardon," said Anthony Johnson, 28, a visitor to the museum from Brooklyn. "You're like a man who's been through what all black men have been through, but you survived."
"He survived physically," said Andre X, 26. "But we're being lynched mentally and economically."
Andre X said he brought his family, visiting from out of state, to the museum instead of taking them to an amusement park because Mr. Cameron "is the only man I know who has been through something like that."
"It's breathtaking what our people have gone through," he said. "It makes me sad, but it also makes me proud. Look at him, he's still here. We're still here."
The museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. and charges $5 admission. Usually, Mr. Cameron and his grandson are the only staff members to guide visitors, who they said represented a cross section of Americans.
Most of the chairs and other furniture were donated by local colleges, and a black police officer's organization helped pay for the lynching display.
Last year, a man Mr. Cameron described only as "a young Jewish fellow" walked through the museum and promised to donate $50,000 "with no strings attached."
"I sat down and cried like a baby," Mr. Cameron said. "I quit begging after that. I put in air-conditioning, a new heating system, carpeting, fixed the roof. All my life, I've been helped by freedom-loving white people."
Had there been some freedom-loving whites in that Marion, Ind., mob 65 years ago, Mr. Cameron said, he and Tommy Shipp and Abe Smith might now be exchanging pictures of their grandchildren.
These days Mr. Cameron says he is concentrating on strengthening the museum to insure that it will outlive him, but he is also active on other fronts. At every opportunity, he goes to Klan rallies to heckle hate, and he said he was encouraged by the fact that the anti-Klan demonstrators almost always outnumber the Klansmen.
"And we always drown them out," Mr. Cameron said.

HEADLINE: Japanese Admit Recovery at Halt

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, July 11

 BODY:
The Japanese Government painted a grimmer picture of the nation's economy today, saying in a report that the hesitant recovery appears to have stalled.
"The recent gradual recovery trend appears to be at a standstill," the Economic Planning Agency said. 
 Hit by the surge of the yen and sluggish exports, Japan's economy had been recovering slowly from recession.
This was the first time the Government has admitted that Japan's recovery had stopped since the economy hit bottom in October 1993.
The agency said the strong yen and the recent economic slowdown in the United States were stalling growth in exports and industrial output.

HEADLINE: Politics Aside, Many in China Are Expanding Business With Taiwan

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, July 10

 BODY:
As relations between the United States and China worsen, barely a day goes by without a Chinese leader spewing invective about Taiwan and how Washington treats it.
But away from China's diplomatic huffing and puffing, senior and mid-level officials who grapple with how to modernize China's economy are steadily expanding business ties with Taiwan, the island nation that is increasingly seen by mainlanders as a model for how to do business more efficiently and profitably. 
 Shao Chun, president of one of China's largest securities firms, China Securities Company, is a good example of the business-minded officials in their 40's and 50's who now make up the bulk of China's power structure.
Although Mr. Shao does not object to China's formal view that Taiwan is an "inalienable part of the motherland," he is more interested in imitating its economic success.
"I'm going there next month," Mr. Shao said the other day. "We have a lot to learn from them."
As he discussed similarities between the securities markets in China today and in Taiwan a decade ago, Mr. Shao said that China's current problems, like insufficent regulation and uncontrolled speculation, are exactly what Taiwan experienced.
For decades, China's Communist Party has warned about how the evils of capitalist Taiwan could corrupt the mainland. Until the mid-1980's, visitors who crossed the Taiwan Strait from either direction were regarded as spies to be interrogated and jailed. The only exception was defectors. Taiwan, for example, rewarded each defecting Chinese Air Force pilot with instant celebrity and $1 million.
But now that the business of China, more and more, is business, Taiwan's combination of identical language, cultural backround and fast-growing economy offers a special role as teacher to the mainland.
"This has nothing to do with ideology," said Mr. Shao. "This is about making money."
Although Taiwan investment in mainland China is difficult to measure accurately -- direct investment is still officially banned -- David O'Rear of the Economist Intelligence Unit in Hong Kong estimates that it reached about $6 billion in 1994, compared with $2.5 billion from the United States.
Taiwan business people started coming to China in the mid-1980's as economic and political policy relaxed on each side, and Taiwan estimates that its residents conducted seven million visits to the mainland last year. Taiwan business people can now be found in every major mainland city, both as private investors and as resident representatives for multinational companies.
"It makes a lot of sense if you think about it," said a Taiwan businessman who is general manager for an American company in Shanghai. His insistence on not being identified reflects a lingering sensitivity to the issue. "We have a much greater intuitive ability to work with people here than other outsiders do."
Growing ties are not limited to individuals. Last fall, even the People's Construction Bank of Shanghai formalized ties to a venture capital company owned partly by Taiwan and partly by the United States. The company, the China Development Corporation, formed a $250 million fund aimed at a variety of Asian investment projects.
There is another side to Taiwan business activity in the mainland, too. Chinese officials complain that a large percentage of sour deals and business fraud is conducted by Taiwan business people, and point to the pirating of American and Chinese music copyrights as an area dominated by business people from Taiwan. For years, Taiwan has been a leading violator of publishing and recording copyrights.
On the other hand, Taiwan business people have cooled their enthusiasm for direct investment in the mainland during the last year because of frustration caused by China's lack of adequate legal protection when a dispute arises with a Chinese partner.
Ever sensitive to the issue of sovereignty, China's concern centers on the question of whether the United States views the mainland and the island off its southeastern coast as "one China" or as "one China and one Taiwan."
The current troubles were touched off by something as seemingly innocuous as the United States decision to allow President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to attend a reunion at Cornell University last month.
American officials have been at pains to point out that Mr. Lee's visit to Cornell did not alter their position recognizing only one China. Indeed, to American diplomats, the idea of one China seems to be sacrosant, at least in part because any change would make their own work more difficult.

HEADLINE: Chrysler to Take Big Charge For Cutting Shift at Plant

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: HIGHLAND PARK, Mich., July 10

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation said today that it would take a $143 million after-tax charge against its second-quarter earnings to cut one shift at a car plant in Newark, Del.
The unexpected 36-cents-a-share charge will take Chrysler's earnings 32 percent below analysts' estimates. Wall Street had expected Chrysler to earn $1.10 a share in the second quarter, based on the mean estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. 
 Discontinuing the shift would affect up to 2,200 of the plant's 3,200 employees, Chrysler said.
Chrysler said it was negotiating with the United Automobile Workers to move up to 2,200 workers at the plant to a two-weeks-on, two-weeks-off, rotational shift. Workers would collect wages and unemployment that would provide about 95 percent of their current pay, a company spokeswoman, Nicole Solomon, said.
The company had warned two months ago that severe job cuts were likely, but there had been no hint of the 36-cent charge.
The company said the charge would cover unemployment benefits, other employee costs and the write-down of equipment and tooling. The plant, which employs 3,500, makes the Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler Concorde.
"I think they are taking the kitchen-sink approach," said David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities & Company, "They are going to have such a lousy second quarter, it doesn't matter what they do." Mr. Healy had been projecting earnings of about 75 cents a share.
Chrysler's second-quarter results, which will be announced July 18, will be lower because of the cost of converting factories to make new mini-vans and rebates on old models to clean out inventories, Mr. Healy said.
The charge, totaling $232 million on a pretax basis, was announced after the stock market closed. Earlier, Chrysler's shares closed at $50, up 50 cents.
Chrysler's Delaware plant is being hit harder than other factories because it made models that are being discontinued. Production of LeBaron convertibles ends this month, and the plant stopped making other LeBaron models and the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim earlier this year.
An as-yet-unnamed 1998 model will be built at the plant beginning in the fall 1997.
The company said in May that it would cut the shift at the Delaware plant because of declining sales. The plant was idled twice in May because inventories were piling up. Chrysler also makes Intrepids and Concordes at a plant in Bramlea, Ontario.
Chrysler cut its projection for total United States 1995 vehicle sales to 14.9 million from 15.2 million after a 30 percent sales drop in April.
The nation's No. 3 auto maker set an all-time monthly record in June as sales of cars and trucks surged 12 percent, to 236,404 from 209,150.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Visits Crusader in Chinese Jail

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
Three weeks after he was seized by Chinese authorities, Harry Wu, the American human rights advocate charged with espionage, was permitted a jailhouse interview with the American consul general today. But his jailers ordered him not to discuss the charges against him, State Department officials said.
Mr. Wu spoke with the American consul, Arturo Macias, for about 30 minutes from behind a thick glass partition, over a telephone monitored by the authorities. He said he was not suffering at the hands of his jailers, but Mr. Macias learned little about the precise nature of the charges or about Mr. Wu's immediate prospects, the officials said. 
 In Washington, the Clinton Administration pondered diplomatic ways to express displeasure at Mr. Wu's arrest and the deteriorating human rights situation in China, while trying to prevent further strains in its relationship with Beijing. Those strains are likely to deepen with the expected announcement on Tuesday that the United States will restore relations with the Vietnamese, a people the Chinese have fought, off and on, for millenniums.
"We are obviously in a period of some difficulty in U.S.-China relations," said the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns. "It's imperative that both the United States and China take steps to repair those difficulties." He said Mr. Wu was in no way an American spy, and he called again for his release.
"We're going to make sure that we do everything we can to protect Mr. Wu's rights," Mr. Burns said.
Human rights groups and some members of Congress urged the Administration to put pressure on China by canceling a trade mission to Beijing by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and a tentatively planned trip by Hillary Rodham Clinton to the United Nations World Conference on Women in September.
The international group Human Rights Watch said the United States should ask the World Bank to postpone two large loans, totaling $660 million, for highway and hydroelectric projects in China. The group also said the White House should seek support for Mr. Wu's release from American companies doing business in China.
"If 'commercial diplomacy' means anything, responsible members of the corporate community should be doing everything they can to convince the Chinese that respect for human rights is fundamental to doing business in China," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Watch/Asia..
Mr. Wu spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps, charged as a "counterrevolutionary" for questioning the conduct of Soviet and Chinese communism. Freed in 1979, he became an American citizen in 1994. He has returned several times to China, often under assumed names, to try to document human rights abuses.
Though he was carrying a valid visa and a United States passport, he was seized three weeks ago while crossing into China from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. He is being held in Wuhan, a city in the central province of Hubei, his last legal residence before he emigrated to the United States.
"Mr. Wu has been accused of committing three crimes," said Mr. Burns, the State Department spokesman. "First, repeatedly sneaking into China under false names; second, stealing Chinese state secrets; and third, disseminating those secrets to institutions and organizations outside of China." But he said it was unclear whether those charges would be brought against Mr. Wu if his case comes to trial.
If Mr. Wu is tried on espionage charges, he could be denied a public hearing and a proper defense, his trial could be conducted in secret and conviction could be punishable by death. The lesser charge of disseminating secrets falls under state security laws that give the authorities the power to impose long prison terms.
As the human rights situation has worsened, so have Chinese-American relations during the last year. Wei Jingsheng, the nation's best-known dissident, was arrested in April 1994 and remains incommunicado. Chen Ziming, a prominent advocate in the 1989 pro-democracy uprising in Beijing, was reimprisoned two weeks ago after the authorities rescinded his parole.
Last month, China protested furiously after the United States granted a temporary visitor's visa to the president of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, so that he could attend a college reunion. The United States had, as a matter of policy, refused such visits. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province led by the vestiges of the old Government destroyed by the 1949 Communist revolution in China.
The United States has been pressing China on a variety of human rights, trade and security issues, including Beijing's sales of military equipment to Iran, Myanmar and Pakistan.
The arrest of Mr. Wu is fast becoming a lightning rod for those in Congress who want to increase the pressure on Beijing. "China's relations with the United States hang in the balance," said Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.

HEADLINE: Defying U.S. Threat, Bolivians Plant More Coca

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: ETERAZAMA, Bolivia

 BODY:
At the coca market in this remote jungle village, where farmers lug 50-pound bags of coca leaves for miles on their backs and bicycles, the talk is of little else but the demands by the United States that Bolivia cut its coca production.
"I don't care how much pressure they put on us to stop growing coca, we will never give this up because we have no other means to survive," said Delfin Olivera, a 24-year-old farmer. "Coca is natural, it's part of our culture, and it has been here since the beginning of the world." 
 Maria Patricia Robino, 42, whose children helped her carry five bags of coca four miles to the market, said she too had no other livelihood except coca. "I tried growing other crops, like pineapples and oranges, but there was no one to buy them," she said. "We are just trying to eat and live like everyone else, and nothing pays more than coca."
Such sentiments underscore the political and economic obstacles in Bolivia to wiping out coca, the raw material for cocaine. The country produces about a third of the world's coca leaves, ranking second to Peru, which produces most of the rest.
Bolivia is also the second largest exporter, after Colombia, of refined cocaine. In 1993, according to the most recent figures available from the United States Embassy, Bolivia produced about 7 percent of the refined cocaine in the world.
In the last decade, the United States has tried a variety of programs to stem the flow of drugs from the Andes. Now, in a renewed effort to attack the source, it is turning up the pressure on foreign governments to wipe out coca crops and enforce laws against replanting.
Frustrated at seeing no reduction in coca production despite spending more than $130 million in the last decade to get Bolivian farmers to switch to other crops, the United States Government recently gave the country an ultimatum. It told Bolivia that it had better destroy 4,300 acres of coca plants by June 30 or face the end of economic aid worth $87 million this year and a boycott of international loans that it receives. There are more than 120,000 acres of coca under cultivation in Bolivia.
While the Bolivian Government persuaded farmers to destroy enough of their coca crop to meet the June deadline -- it paid them $1,000 for each acre eradicated -- drug policy experts are skeptical that it will have the same success in meeting a second United States deadline requiring the eradication of 8,125 additional acres by year's end.
"We are not optimistic that the Bolivians will meet targets this year because the Government has not been willing to crack down on the farmers who continue to plant new coca," said a senior United States drug official here.
"Not that we think we can get 100 percent reduction, or 50 percent, or even 25 percent," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But if we can raise the risk to people that can lose their money, their goods and liberty for growing coca then we can make progress in convincing them to switch to alternative crops."
The United States is facing an uphill battle, the experts said, mainly because the Bolivian Government has been unwilling to enforce laws that prohibit the planting of new coca crops and because coca is such an entrenched part of Bolivia's culture and economy.
The use of the coca leaf is an Andean tradition dating back thousands of years. The Aymara and Quechua Indians of Bolivia and Peru use coca leaves for cultural, religious and medical purposes. Peasants chew the leaves to combat hunger, thirst and fatigue, and many natural medicine doctors prescribe coca teas and coca-based concoctions as remedies for aches, ailments and digestive problems.
While there is a legal market in Bolivia for coca leaves that are chewed and are used to make tea and other remedies, most coca grown in this region goes to make cocaine. In recent years, as drug agents began infiltrating laboratories in Colombia, the cartels have been increasingly refining cocaine in Bolivia and paying peasants to make cocaine paste in crude jungle labs. The paste is further refined elsewhere in Bolivia and in Colombia.
Last year, cocaine trafficking brought an estimated $356 million into the Bolivian economy, or 6.2 percent of gross domestic product, according to estimates by drug policy experts here. About 10 percent of Bolivia's work force receive their income from drug-related activities.
The Government has been reluctant to prosecute coca growers for planting new crops because of the broad public support for the growers, who have staged large demonstrations, billing themselves as scapegoats for a drug-abusive United States.
"Our big problem is that the Bolivian people are against narco-trafficking but they are for these farmers," said President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. He said his Government was planning new enforcement measures but needed more financial support from the United States and other countries to carry them out.
Serafin Ramos, manager of the local coca farmers association here, estimated that about half the farmers in Eterazama had planted new coca crops even though it is illegal to do so.
"I've done it and almost everyone else that I know has replanted coca," he said, "because until we are provided with the necessary markets, infrastructure and processing plants to make the other crops worthwhile, we will stay with coca."
Andres Hinojosa Orellana, 62, said that he planted new coca on his land just a few months ago because he needed the money to provide for his family. "Come on over here and take a look at my new coca," Mr. Hinojosa said. "I have no fear of what I'm doing. I have my machete. I'm obligated to plant this new coca to take care of my five children."
United States officials here calculate that an acre of coca yields about $1,000 a year while crop substitutes like bananas, grapefruit, pineapples and oranges pay $600 to $800 an acre, if farmers find buyers.
Also, coca requires very little care and is harvested three times a year. Many alternative crops require years of hard labor before they yield any fruit and are much heavier to transport through the jungle, which lacks adequate roads.
As a result, and without sufficient Government subsidies to make new crops worthwhile, many farmers who agreed to destroy coca crops have started replanting coca. Since 1987, nearly 67,500 acres of coca have been eradicated in Bolivia, but new cultivation has more than offset the reduction. Last year, a record 89,800 metric tons of coca leaf was produced in Bolivia, 6.4 percent more than in 1993, United States drug officials say.
Sandro Calvani, country director for the United Nations International Drug Control Program in Bolivia, said that more than $200 million had been spent by the United States and the United Nations on a variety of programs that had provided people here in the Chapare jungle with new roads, electricity, potable water and help in developing alternative crops.
"This effort has been successful in terms of providing coca growers with options," Mr. Calvani said. "But it has been a failure in that they are not taking full advantage of it because of a lack of enforcement."

HEADLINE: Managua Journal;
For the Pride of Nicaragua, a Home Run in Politics?

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, July 10

 BODY:
In the United States, Dennis Martinez is regarded by baseball fans as a crafty veteran pitcher, an All-Star, the ace of the Cleveland Indians' staff. Here in his baseball-mad homeland, such achievements are enough to have vaulted him to the status of national hero and possible future President.
"Dennis Martinez is a factor of national unity and pride who is perhaps the most popular man in Nicaragua," said Edgard Castillo, a former sports and foreign news editor at the newspaper La Prensa here. "Everyone likes and admires him, whether they are Communists or conservatives." 
 Though Americans may be disillusioned about baseball, because of the strike that wrecked the 1994 season, that is definitely not the case here. Spurred on by the achievements of Mr. Martinez and of a national team that is enjoying a hot streak in international competition, Nicaraguans seem more passionate than ever about their national pastime, introduced by American diplomats at the turn of the century and then popularized by the American marines who occupied the country until the Somoza family dictatorship took power in the 1930's.
The only Nicaraguan currently playing in the major leagues, Mr. Martinez has been the focus of his nation's hopes since he broke in with the Baltimore Orioles in 1976. But now at 40, an age when most baseball players have retired, he is having his finest season ever, with an 8-0 record and an e.r.a. of 2.37. When the right-hander was named to the American League All-Star team last week, all of Nicaragua rejoiced.
Since then, the airwaves here have been filled with impassioned discussions of why Mr. Martinez, and not Kevin Appier of the Kansas City Royals or Randy Johnson of the Seattle Mariners, deserves to start for the American Leaguers in Tuesday night's game, to be played in Arlington, Tex.
"All three have their merits, but Dennis is undefeated and has the second lowest e.r.a in the league, so he should get the chance," said Federico Gadea, a 23-year-old medical student. But it was Mr. Johnson who was named the starter today.
Given Nicaragua's unsettled political situation, pride in Mr. Martinez's achievements, including 227 career victories and recovery from arm trouble and a battle with alcoholism, has also led to calls for him to run for President in elections scheduled for next year. Supporters formed a draft committee some time ago, and though Mr. Martinez has said he prefers to focus on bringing a pennant to Cleveland for the first time in 41 years, he has also left the door open to a career in politics once he retires from baseball.
"He's a smart guy, and as a pitcher he knows the importance of timing," said Carlos Garcia, president of the Nicaraguan Amateur Baseball Federation. "He has said this is not the time yet, but that doesn't mean he can't do it later, when he thinks the time is right."
Some of those who admire Mr. Martinez, who comes from humble beginnings and as a teen-ager cut short his studies to play professional baseball, argue, however, that the country cannot afford to wait. "The professional politicians haven't been worth a dime and haven't kept any of their promises," said Erick Miranda, a 36-year-old truck driver. "Dennis is a man of the people and a real leader, so certainly he can do better."
Other fans think that assuming the presidency would actually constitute a step down for Mr. Martinez. They want him to continue in the major leagues at least until he has won 17 more games, which would allow him to surpass Juan Marichal, the Hall of Famer from the Dominican Republic, as the Latin American pitcher with the most career victories in major league history.
"Anybody can run for President, and if Dennis wants to, that's all right by me," said Luden Espinoza, 22, a computer technician who was wearing a Cleveland Indians cap at a game played here Sunday. "But Dennis is a national treasure, one of the few Nicaraguans who has achieved renown in the outside world, so I would rather see him go for the record."
Fans here, and that includes almost all of Nicaragua's 4.5 million people, have also been buoyed by the exploits of Nicaragua's national baseball team, which is enjoying a run of success that contrasts sharply with the fortunes of the nation as a whole in recent years. A constitutional crisis paralyzed the Government for five months, unemployment and corruption are rampant, and political parties are at each other's throats, as usual.
Everyday speech here is full of slang terms borrowed from baseball, like "caught off base" and "hitting a home run," and Nicaraguans have long been accustomed to drawing parallels between baseball and politics. For that reason, the national team's current string of victories is seen as a boost for a fragile transition to democracy that began in 1990 after nearly 50 years of the Somoza family dictatorship and more than a decade of rule by the Sandinista National Liberation Front
"Baseball is our only means of reconciliation, the only place where we can erase our differences and begin to understand each other," Mr. Garcia said. "This team sends a message to the whole country, that yes, you can get things done if you respect each other's principles and help each other on and off the field."
At the Managua stadium on Sunday, there was plenty for the fans to cheer as they munched fried plantains and chicken and sipped cold La Victoria beer and sodas under a blazing tropical sun. After the national team pummeled Taiwan 14 to 6 in the second game of a five-game series, youngsters wearing baseball caps of American and Nicaraguan teams rushed to the winners dugout to beg players for autographs, using Mexican-made baseballs.
Nicaragua won the silver medal at the Pan-American Games in Argentina in February, and the gold last week at the Pacific Games in Cali, Colombia.
Later last week the Nicaraguans also beat the American Olympic team in a game played in Homestead, Fla., raising hopes that the country will qualify for the Olympic Games in Atlanta next year.
"We know that we are defending the cause of an entire people, and we want to bring home a medal for them," said Julio Vallejos, the team's catcher. "We think we have the dedication, the passion, the discipline and the love to do it."

HEADLINE: In Blow to Mayor, Credit Agency Lowers New York's Bond Rating

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
A major credit agency yesterday lowered its rating of New York City's long-term credit worthiness, citing both the sluggish economy and fiscal gimmicks it said were used by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to balance the city's budget.
The decision by Standard & Poor's lowers the city's rating from A-, where it has been since 1987, to BBB+, among the lowest ratings of any major city in the country. Of major cities, only Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington have lower ratings. 
 It is unclear whether the downgrade will have any practical implications for the city, because Moody's, the other major credit agency, had already downgraded the city's rating several years ago, and the city's bonds have been trading at the lower level. Normally, a downgrade would force the city to pay millions in higher interest costs, because investors would be more reluctant to lend their money to the city and would demand more interest in return.
But the decision is clearly a symbolic blow to the Mayor's claim to be a financial housecleaner, single-handedly beginning to turn around decades of unsound financial practices by previous mayors -- which explains why mayoral aides had worked feverishly in recent days to change the agency's mind. Though Standard & Poor's praised Mr. Giuliani's "strong track record" in restraining the growth of spending, its announcement said he "continues to rely on budget practices that are inconsistent with a single A- rating."
The Mayor dismissed the action, saying no one would remember it by next week. He said the agency was simply correcting a mistaken decision not to downgrade in the middle of the 1993 mayoral campaign, and had created criticisms of his budget to justify the action. Even some of Mr. Giuliani's critics acknowledged that he was to some extent the victim of bad timing, paying the price for the failures of earlier administrations.
Standard & Poor's cited specifically Mr. Giuliani's use of one-time measures, also known as one-shots or gimmicks, to balance the budget for a single year without rectifying the underlying problem. The agency said the city's estimates of $600 million in labor savings had not been met, and said it continues to rely too heavily on overly optimistic projections of state and Federal aid that might not come through.
It also cited the possibility that the city could use the proceeds from the proposed sale of its water system for current expenses, and said the city's debt level was too high.
Mostly, however, it blamed the feeble local economy, noting that employment had declined by 9,000 jobs in the first quarter of the year and projected a weak prospect of continued job growth. The city's economy, it said, remains too reliant on the financial-services sector, which has historically been volatile.
Mr. Giuliani, who said he has known since his inauguration that the downgrade was coming, angrily accused Standard & Poor's of covering up the real reason for downgrading by citing a series of "disingenuous" criticisms of his budget. In every possible way, he said, the city is in better shape than it was two years ago, when the agency decided to retain its A- rating.
"The things they're picking on are small points to try to justify a decision that they can't really justify," he said at a news conference yesterday. "In 1993, they wanted to downgrade the city, and they didn't do it because they felt it might interfere with the incumbent mayor's chances of re-election. There isn't a person in this city that doesn't know that. So that release had to cover a lot of mistakes they made in the past."
Vladimir Stadnyk, Standard & Poor's executive managing director for public finance, said the 1993 decision had nothing to do with yesterday's downgrade, and denied that there was any political consideration involved. Rather, he said, the city's credit risk is simply greater now than it was in 1993.
"We're not saying the city was better run in 1993, or that it's better run today," he said. "We're just saying, in our opinion, the combination of credit factors today makes the city a heightened credit risk. We have no hidden agenda here." An agency spokesman said the ratings of Standard & Poor's and Moody's are often different by one increment, as they were in New York until yesterday.
The city's new BBB+ rating is still considered an investment-grade rating, though it is considered by Standard & Poor's to be in the mid to low range of investment quality. The lowest possible investment-grade level is BBB-, which is Philadelphia's rating. Washington's B-rated bonds are considered junk bonds. There are, however, some institutional investors who will not buy bonds below the A- level, which may have the effect of further raising interest costs in New York because the pool of potential buyers is smaller.
Municipal bond traders said the bond market agreed with Standard & Poor's decision, and most said that its stated reasons for doing so were legitimate.
"Giuliani has done an excellent job in trying to create more long-term structural balance, but everyone in the industry sees what the city has to do each year to keep from running a deficit," said Alexandra Lebenthal, president of the Lebenthal & Company, which deals heavily in the city's bonds. "Everyone has a less-than-positive feeling about all those one-shots in the budget."
The city and state comptrollers both issued statements calling the decision disappointing. But both also said it should be seen as a warning that the city must take additional steps toward a long-term balance of the city's financial situation.
"This downgrade does not create a crisis," said City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, "but it is another serious indicator that the city's fiscal situation needs additional strong corrective action."
Standard & Poor's has urged the city for months to stop using one-shot measures to balance its budget. In January, the agency placed the city on "negative credit watch," one step short of a downgrade, after the city decided to borrow money to close its budget gap instead of asking the Board of Education to find an additional $120 million in midyear savings. At the time, the agency said it would downgrade to the BBB level if the gimmicks continued.
But the 1996 budget, passed last month, still included some possible one-shot measures, including the sale of the water system. Though the city has said it would use $800 million of the proceeds from that sale for long-term capital projects, it has not promised to avoid using such proceeds for daily operating expenses, a fact that the agency criticized. And the agreement with the unions includes $150 million in savings by deferring the city's pension costs over several years, although the total amount would eventually have to be paid.
Mr. Stadnyk said Standard & Poor's executives have met with city officials repeatedly over the last four months to discuss these issues. A planned downgrade in May was postponed after the Mayor and City Council leaders persuaded the agency to wait until after the city and state budgets had been passed. Finally, he said, the agency's City Rating Committee, a group of six or seven senior officials, including three managing directors, agreed by consensus to lower the rating.

NEW YORK'S BOND RATING IS LOWERED
A major credit agency lowered its rating of New York City's long-term credit worthiness, citing both the sluggish economy and fiscal gimmicks it said were used by Mayor to balance the city's budget. The decision by Standard & Poor's cut the city's rating from A-, where it has been since 1987, to BBB+. [Page A1.]
For months, the Giuliani administration watched as the downgrading of New York City's credit rating approached like a slow-moving but inexorable train. After the train had struck and moved on, the question around City Hall was whether the Mayor might have done anything to move out of the way. News analysis. [B4.]
MOBSTER PORTRAYAL STIRS DISBELIEF
A Federal indictment last month depicted Paul H. K. Lai, a well-known Chinatown businessman, as a top leader of an organized crime group that law-enforcement officials believe has begun to rival the Mafia in influence and brutality -- a man who cold-bloodedly ordered murders to protect his gambling and extortion rackets. But many in Chinatown, and Mr. Lai himself in an unusual two-hour interview, describe him as a classic immigrant success story, an honorable businessman and benevolent civic leader who even served on an advisory panel for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. [A1.]
CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES UPHELD
Upholding New Jersey's child-support guidelines, the state Supreme Court rejected a divorced father's arguments that his support payments should be reduced so he can spend the money as he sees fit when he is caring for his children. The decision, in a case involving James Pascale, a divorced father of three who pays $1,150 a month in child support, overturns a ruling by a state Appellate Court. More broadly, it runs counter to a trend in other jurisdictions to develop equations for child support. [A1.]
 
$100 MILLION IN AID FOR THE HOMELESS
In what Federal officials suggested could be the last big infusion of homeless-assistance money for years to come, the Government awarded New York City $100 million for emergency shelter, permanent housing, drug treatment and day care. [B3.]
ORTHODOX JUDGES OVERTURN BETROTHAL
First, Sarah Leah Goldstein was ambushed by a biblical passage that had been ignored for centuries. Then she was saved by a voice from beyond the grave. A special assembly of Orthodox Jewish religious judges declared that Miss Goldstein, whose father betrothed her at age 11 to a man whose identity he would not reveal, was free to marry anyone she pleased. [B3.]
 
ROUGH START FOR NEW D.M.V.
The administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman switched the 23 motor vehicle offices in New Jersey from state to private operation in the name of efficiency and economy. But the campaign's start was hectic and bumpy across the state, with new clerks working after only a weekend of training on recognizing and processing the multitude of forms and documents for titles, licenses and registration plates. [B5.]
JORDANIAN GETS 15 YEARS FOR MURDER
A man who strangled his wife in New Jersey was sentenced in his native Jordan to 15 years of prison and "hard labor." [B5.]

HEADLINE: A Battle on the Waterfront;
Conflicting Visions for the Renewal of the Passaic River

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
It is unusual for a skipper to advise his passengers to remove their bright red life jackets in midstream to be safe, but the stretch of the Passaic River flowing through downtown Newark is no ordinary waterway.
"I tell people to take their life jackets off because they make an easy target," said Paul J. Lerin, a self-appointed guide who hopes to turn his love of the river into an environmental cleanup business. "We are in a sniper zone here." 
 As he gunned his small green launch past the shattered windows of a housing project onshore, he also kept an eye peeled for debris that can make the boat veer sharply or choke the propeller. "Crack heads with guns sometimes like to shoot at the little boats," he said. "If you see anything pinging in the water, let me know."
It would not be the only sniping along the river.
Newark is embarking on an ambitious transformation of its waterfront, hoping to turn the clock back 100 years to a time when people swam in the river, or at least to a time before the now-defunct factories burped up wastes that blighted the shoreline.
By August, the Army Corps of Engineers will publicly unveil plans for a $25 million pedestrian promenade curving along two miles of the downtown riverbank. It is designed both to block erosion and to braid together key pieces of urban renewal, including a redesigned train station and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which is just beginning to carve a place in the skyline.
City planners envision the now barren downtown bubbling with all sorts of life -- more jobs, outdoor concerts, Rollerbladers -- and say the proposed strip of pathways and trees will prove the magnet. With public hearings scheduled for the fall and final sketches not due until January, Glenn A. Grant, the Newark business administrator coordinating the project, called any criticism premature.
But a committed band of environmental groups and river lovers are already taking potshots at the drawings that have been leaked thus far. They fear that instead of sparking a love affair with the river, the stolid concrete corniche will turn into more of a barrier to the water than a draw.
"It is mediocre and I think the Passaic River deserves more than that," said Ella F. Filippone, executive director of the Passaic River Coalition and doyenne of the 25-year battle to clean the waterway. "To design a park for a river you have to give it some kind of personality. It has to relate the city to the river."
It is almost impossible to get close to the river now. In the few places where parking lots might allow a glimpse, the banks are so weak that attendants avoid riverside spaces for fear the cars will sink. Elsewhere its like playing dial-a-contaminant, depending on what unused factory ground you tried to cross.
Only by jumping aboard one of the few available boats like Mr. Lerin's, cobbled together from an old fiberglass hull and bits scavenged from other craft, can you get a sense of the waterway.
At age 28, Mr. Lerin is a rare man: He has swum in the Passaic River. Soon after his family arrived as immigrants from Portugal in 1971, hot August days were spent leaping off a gargantuan Conrail bridge, now unused. "Kids still tell me I have got the record for the highest jump," he said. "That was in my heyday."
Look at the trash-infested, dun-colored water, smell the faint odor of formaldehyde coming from an onshore factory and the question arises: Who would possibly seek such a title?
It's a man who greets the flotsam like old, if not quite welcome, acquaintances. Piloting his boat, Mr. Lerin spots an empty propane tank. "This is a familiar piece of debris," he said. "I have been watching this thing float around forever."
The river is a tidal estuary. The water never quite makes it into Newark Bay. The trash bobs downriver as the tide ebbs and then bobs right back in again. Mr. Lerin points out a half canoe that he said has been floating around for years. He sees a Pepsi bottle with a design that is no longer sold.
He thinks the rats are great. Writing in the monthly newsletter that he produces to track environmental problems and try to drum up business for his fledgling cleanup company, Mr. Lerin said the rodent dinners are attracting birds like the red-tailed hawk to the riverbank. He hails by name the drawbridge keepers. The Army Corps says barges hauling petroleum or gravel make about 3,600 trips annually, a trickle of the former traffic.
It is no easy river to love. In 1970, the Passaic could easily have been an understudy for the river Styx. It was listed among the 10 worst polluted rivers in the country. Researchers burned their hands taking samples of the acidic black gunk oozing from drainpipes along the banks.
Traces of those days are easy to find. A chunk of the shore and the entire six-mile riverbed in the city are a Superfund Site, the tag used by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency for areas holding the kind of pollutants that can cause cancer or birth defects if ingested. This spring the E.P.A. began investigating the river basin to gauge the suspected high level of pesticides, dioxins, PCB's, metals and other hazardous substances in the sediments. Signs are posted in English, Spanish and Chinese warning against eating any fish, shellfish or crustaceans from the river.
Thinking about all that possible toxicity makes Mr. Lerin's heart sink. When asked about the worst thing that he has ever encountered on the river, he said: "It has to be the blue drums, aside from the human corpses, of course. You never know what substance is in the barrels. It is probably someone trying to get rid of something really bad, and they put it in the container and threw it into the river."
Both environmentalists and city officials are relieved that the worst polluters were shut down in the days when the New Jersey had an environmental prosecutor, a post eliminated in 1994 by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. They worry that Republican attempts in Congress to alter the Federal Clean Water Act of 1970 will undermine all the advances made since then.
Swimming crabs bump up against empty gin bottles, and the cormorants, egrets and blue heron nesting in mired tires are a sure sign that the fish are back. The next big step is eliminating all the debris. So many plastic foam cups skitter across the water that they could be mistaken for some kind of indigenous surface species. Flies swarm over the carcasses of dogs. The crew teams from the Nereid Boat Club, back after a nearly 30-year hiatus, sometimes get beached midstream on chunks of debris and occasionally cannot even launch their sculls.
Everyone hopes that construction of the waterfront park will prove the catalyst to get rid of the trash. The park was originally financed as an adjunct to a multibillion-dollar flood tunnel, but has since been separated and thus far saved from budget cuts.
"The whole idea is to attract people back to the river," said Frank Sudol, chief of program development in the city's engineering department. Construction is to begin in two years.
Besides people like Mr. Lerin, there is little evidence that public attitudes are prone to change soon.
A public defender in Sacramento, Calif., called the Passaic River Coalition this month, saying that he had a client who faced the death penalty in a murder trial. The lawyer said the man went swimming in Newark in the 1960's and wondered if something in the water could have caused neurological damage.
"What do you suppose his defense is going to be?" Mrs. Filippone, the head of the coalition, wondered. "The river made me do it."

HEADLINE: City's Bond Rating: Did Giuliani Do Enough to Help It?

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
For months, the Giuliani administration watched as the downgrading of New York City's credit rating approached like a slow-moving but inexorable train. Yesterday, after the train had struck and moved on, the question around City Hall was whether Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani might have done anything to move out of the way.
Even his critics agreed with the Mayor that there was an element of unfairness in the decision by the Standard & Poor's Corporation to lower its rating on the city's long-term bonds, which the agency said was based mostly on the sluggishness of the city's economy. 
 Having cut billions of dollars from city spending, Mr. Giuliani has by virtually all accounts put the city's finances in better shape than they were in July 1993, when Standard & Poor's last considered -- but then decided against -- cutting the rating.
At the time, the rating agency yielded to the pleas of Mayor David N. Dinkins, who said it would embarrass his administration in the middle of a political campaign with Mr. Giuliani.
But in the subsequent two years, the agency has had to sit back and watch while the bond market sided with its competitor, Moody's Investors Service, which had cut its bond rating in 1991. The city's bonds have since traded at the lower level, and Standard & Poor's has been under increasing pressure from the market to bring its rating in line.
Felix Rohatyn, the former chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, said that yesterday's cut was not so much a slap in the face to the Mayor's budgeting as it was a way of rectifying the agency's 1993 mistake. The business community considers the city's credit to be better now than it was two years ago, he said.
"This was a rating that for some time now was probably not justified," said Mr. Rohatyn, who has often urged Mr. Giuliani to look harder for new sources of revenue. "The Mayor has shown an obvious willingness to take on the city's budgetary problems in a hard way, but in this case he is a victim of bad timing. He just happens to be the right man in the wrong place at the wrong time."
Nonetheless, Standard & Poor's, as well as many fiscal experts, said much of the responsibility for the downgrading falls on the administration's shoulders. One Standard & Poor's official said yesterday that the previous rating of A- could not be justified for any city that must struggle each year to balance the budget with a patched-together medley of spending cuts and one-time fiscal gimmicks that have the effect of pushing the real problem off to future years.
Other experts said that although Mr. Giuliani reduced city spending, particularly on services and benefits for the poor, he had made little progress toward eliminating the structural imbalance.
"The measures the Mayor has taken to reduce the deficit are typical of the measures taken in the past to close city budget gaps," said Ester R. Fuchs, director of the Barnard-Columbia Center for Urban Policy. "Every mayor since the fiscal crisis has used a combination of reducing the work force and cutting back spending at the agencies to close budget gaps, and Giuliani has done the same thing. It has nothing to do with reducing the structural deficit over time."
Ms. Fuchs, author of "Mayors and Money: Fiscal Policy in New York and Chicago," agrees with leaders of the business-financed Citizens Budget Committee who say that two enormous shadows continue to hover over the city's long-term financial picture, all but untouched by Mr. Giuliani in his initial 18 months.
The first is the inability of the city to persuade the state to pay a bigger share of social-service and criminal-justice spending, which virtually every other state picks up entirely. A study by Ms. Fuchs shows that New York City spends far more per person than any other city in the country, three times more than Philadelphia and five times more than Houston.
The state forces the city to pay about a quarter of its budget on social services, compared with 6 percent in Chicago, 3 percent in Houston and 15 percent in Philadelphia.
Mr. Giuliani had hoped to reduce these costs by asking the state to cut its own social service spending, which, because of a system of matching formulas, would have allowed the city to do the same. He was largely unsuccessful in that effort, and many state legislators say he is unlikely to achieve any significant change in the foreseeable future.
The second and most controversial shadow is the intractable size of the city's union-dominated payroll, which now constitutes 51 percent of the city budget, up from 50 percent in 1993.
Administration officials announced last month that they had reached agreement with the municipal labor unions on the details of $440 million in savings, as well as a commitment to another $160 million in savings to be negotiated by October. Mayoral aides say they have gotten more from labor than any previous administration. But none of the concessions yet announced include reductions in wage levels, holidays or benefits.
The Mayor argued that no one expected him to achieve such results in citywide labor negotiations, as opposed to talks yet to come with individual unions. The weakness in his labor strategy, however, was one of the prime factors cited by Standard & Poor's in yesterday's decision.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
From the Yearbook Incident to the 'Boot Camp' Parade

BYLINE: By Raymond Hernandez 

 BODY:
THE five Greenwich High School seniors went into deep seclusion last month after news broke that they had slipped a coded message of racial hate into the school yearbook. Reporters searched all over Greenwich for them, camping outside their homes, knocking on the doors of their neighbors and phoning their relatives. But the teen-agers were nowhere to be found.
Then, as part of their punishment, they were put in Roy Innis's hands. 
 Mr. Innis -- a controversial conservative civil rights leader whose claims to fame in recent years include getting into a televised scuffle with the Rev. Al Sharpton on the Morton Downey Jr. program -- volunteered to help the seniors redeem themselves with his own brand of community service.
Not since Hester Prynne in "The Scarlet Letter" have sinners been thrust so suddenly into the glare of public scrutiny. To kick off their penance, Mr. Innis invited the teen-agers and their parents to join him at the Manhattan office of his civil rights organization yesterday for a frank discussion on race and diversity.
He also invited television crews, newspaper reporters and photographers.
Dozens of them came.

 SUDDENLY it dawned on the "Greenwich Five," as they've come to be known, exactly what they had agreed to. As the camera crews waited for their big photo opportunity, the five teen-agers and their parents would not come out of a room in the Congress of Racial Equality's ninth-floor office.
"The mothers are upset about all the pictures and stuff," Cyril Boynes, a CORE board member, said.
"Parents are parents," he added. "They're sensitive about this."
No kidding.
Part of the meeting -- announced on press releases that proclaimed " 'Greenwich 5' to Start CORE's Civil Rights Boot Camp" -- was apparently spent trying to coax the students and their parents to be good sports and pose for just one photograph so that the reporters would be on their way once and for all.
"The idea is we get one pool shot," Mr. Innis suggested to CORE's national spokesman, Niger Roy Innis, who also happens to be Roy Innis's son.
"The people are very nervous about the cameras," the national spokesman protested, as the reporters clogged the halls and rooms of CORE's SoHo office.
So how did it come to this? Well, the elder Mr. Innis -- who was a passionate defender of Bernhard H. Goetz, the subway gunman, and is a National Rifle Association member -- phoned and then visited the Greenwich Schools Superintendent, John A. Whritner, last month and offered to give the students a summer course in racial relations and civil rights. Because of the coded message the students had planted in the yearbook -- "Kill all niggers" -- school officials had barred them from the graduation ceremony and were casting about for some way out of the sensitive situation.
Greenwich school officials jumped at the chance to turn the students over to Mr. Innis, calling it an opportunity for "redemption." It seemed like a keen idea at the time.
In fact, school officials even agreed to allow the seniors to take their final exams and receive their diplomas once they have completed the course, which began with yesterday's meeting at CORE's office.
Mr. Innis's assistants explained yesterday that as part of the Roy Innis Boot Camp students will visit New York City neighborhoods like Chinatown and Harlem. Not to suggest that the focus will be entirely on minority communities. "We're going to take them to rural New York State so they can see poor white farmers," said George Holmes, CORE's executive director. They'll also have to read books about black history and write essays on them.
Mr. Innis is so confident about his Boot Camp that he suggested it should be extended beyond the Greenwich Five as a "preemptive" measure. "One need not be a sinner to seek salvation," he said.
Yesterday's meeting got off to a decent start after a private meeting between Mr. Innis and his guests. Angelique Wimbush, another CORE member, eventually led the families through the office, stopping to introduce them to the staff at various departments.
"This is our immigration department," Ms. Wimbush said, pointing to a woman sitting in a cramped cubicle with a couple from Bosnia.
"Serb or Muslim?" Mr. Innis interrupted after learning where the couple came from.
Muslim, they replied.
"I hope we can help you," he said before heading off with the discombobulated teen-agers, who were dressed in baseball caps, T-shirts and jeans.
Things rapidly began to fall apart as the families became unnerved at the sight of "journalists" fumbling with cameras, cables, tape recorders, beepers and cellular phones. To the dismay and frustration of reporters, Mr. Innis eventually had to hold his press conference without the families.
"I thought we were invited here to meet with the families," one reporter protested.

 AFTER extensive back-room negotiations, the Greenwich Five -- Keith Dianis, Patrick Fox, Ed Oberbeck, Robert Texiere and Aaron Valenti -- and their parents marched into Mr. Innis's office and stood behind him for a photo op, not uttering a word. Then the defenders of the First Amendment were asked to leave.
Even people at the office on other business were stunned by the spectacle. Gloria Bell arrived to see about a job but wound up being distracted by what was going on around her.
"I'm sure those boys didn't expect things to get this serious when they did what they did," said Ms. Bell, an unemployed television actress. "This is really big."

HEADLINE: PNC Buying Midlantic for $3 Billion

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
In one more sign that independent banking in New Jersey is fast becoming a thing of the past, the PNC Bank Corporation, based in Pittsburgh, announced yesterday that it would acquire the Midlantic Corporation, based in Edison, N.J., for $3 billion in stock.
Just last month, the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., announced that it would buy the First Fidelity Bancorp of Newark for $5.4 billion and create a banking empire stretching along the East Coast from Connecticut to Florida. 
 That purchase was regarded as setting off a wave of consolidation in New Jersey in particular and the Northeast in general -- areas that had largely escaped the series of mergers that created the superregional banks like Nationsbank and First Union, both in North Carolina, and Banc One in Ohio.
"New Jersey is a very affluent and very urbanized market with a tremendous amount of opportunities for a banking company, both in the commercial area with strong local businesses and in the consumer area," said Charles M. Nathan, a lawyer at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson and a former investment banker who specializes in advising financial institutions. "If you look at New Jersey, and in fact, the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, they haven't been consolidated to the extent others have by the superregionals."
Midlantic's share price jumped $6.25 yesterday, to $47.625; PNC closed at $25.125, down $1.75.
Many analysts say that the UJB Financial Corporation of Princeton will be the next home-grown New Jersey bank to be swallowed by a superregional bank. Its share price jumped $2.625 yesterday, to $35, after the announcement by PNC.
The Summit Bancorporation, a smaller New Jersey banking company, and the Corestates Financial Corporation, which operates in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania, are also considered prime candidates for consolidation.
"Certainly, the last two transactions indicate the major incursion by big regional banks into New Jersey," said Elizabeth Randall, the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking. "But I think that's got some potentially good ramifications for us."
She said the consolidations would bring banks with larger capital bases into the state and that might increase lending to businesses. And bigger banks, with operations spread over more regions, can better afford the investment in the latest technology for consumer banking services, Ms. Randall said.
The acquisition of Midlantic will bump PNC's ranking up one step, making it the 11th-largest United States bank, with $79 billion in assets.
It will also extend PNC's reach into the Philadelphia area and northern New Jersey, giving it the second-largest slice of those two markets. PNC, which was formed in 1982 from the merger of the Pittsburgh National Corporation and the Provident National Corporation, also has a deal pending to buy the Chemical Banking Corporation's New Jersey branches, which are concentrated in southern New Jersey.
As much as the Midlantic acquisition will strengthen PNC's power in the region, it is also a quick fix for PNC's balance sheet, bankers said yesterday. PNC has been more reliant than most banks on borrowing in the capital markets, a more expensive source of funds than deposits.
Midlantic, on the other hand, has an unusually high level of core deposits, like checking, savings and money market accounts, on which it pays a much lower interest rates than it would have to pay on money borrowed in the financial markets. Merging the two balance sheets will bring the proportion of PNC's funds that are borrowed down to 30 percent from 41 percent, Mr. O'Brien said.
"With this merger, PNC will have higher profit margins going forward and a more stable base of funds," said Joseph C. Duwan, an analyst who follows regional banks for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Thomas H. O'Brien, chairman and chief executive of PNC, who will keep his titles, said: "This merger creates a unique opportunity for PNC Bank to achieve several strategic objectives. It greatly expands our market share in Philadelphia and New Jersey, and it represents a major step forward in our balance sheet realignment."
The opportunity did not come at a bargain for PNC. Midlantic's shareholders will get PNC stock worth about $55.09 for each of their Midlantic shares, or more than two times Midlantic's book value of $25.93 at the end of the first quarter.
By comparison, the First Union Corporation paid 1.92 times book value last month in its bid for First Fidelity.
Investment bankers familiar with the deal said that other banks looking at Midlantic had considered making offers of about $50 a share, but PNC wanted to close a deal quickly, so it made an offer few would try to top.
Mr. O'Brien did not directly answer a question about other offers, but he did say that PNC and Midlantic had been discussing a merger "off and on" for 18 months. He also said that while the First Union-First Fidelity deal had some impact on negotiations, "that happened after we had intensified discussions."
"Because of the adjacent-market nature of this transaction and similarity of cultures at the two companies, we're going to create a tremendous amount of value," Mr. O'Brien said.
PNC plans to close as many as 70 branch banks, eliminate overlapping jobs and consolidate back-office, marketing and other functions to reduce costs by $80 million to $85 million. Job cuts "will run into the hundreds of people in a 35,000-people company, but beyond that we don't know," Mr. O'Brien said.
PNC may not, however, be able to reduce costs by as much as it expects. Midlantic, which was floundering a few years ago from troubles brought on by recession and a decline in the real estate market, has become something of a textbook turnaround for the banking industry largely because Garry J. Scheuring, its chairman, president and chief executive, took an axe to the company's costs and successfully sold off problem assets. Mr. Scheuring will become vice chairman of PNC and oversee all its consumer banking operations.
"This kind of merger represents the fundamental dilemma of the banking industry today," said Gerard L. Smith, an investment banker at UBS Securities. "They've all been pared pretty much to the bone, so it's hard to find expenses to cut. So to increase revenues, they have to start new businesses, add new products, but that increases expenses."
But Mr. O'Brien said that even though PNC would issue 113 million new shares as part of the transaction and would take a pretax charge of $190 million for merger-related expenses, the Midlantic acquisition was expected to add to earnings the first year after the deal was completed, which should occur by the end of this year. He said the acquisition was expected to add 7 cents to per-share earnings in 1996 and 20 cents in 1997.
"If we're correct, the combined company in 1996 will make a billion dollars after tax, so it's a powerful engine we have here," Mr. O'Brien said.
The acquisition of Midlantic, which has 338 branches, vastly increases PNC's network of branch banks, which it, like many other banks, has been working to reduce. In addition, PNC's deal with Chemical involves acquiring 84 branches.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Treasury Prices Finish Mostly Flat

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed in quiet trading yesterday.
Prices were supported by a strong dollar and by lingering momentum from Thursday's powerful rally. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve reduced its target for the Federal funds rate to 5.75 percent from 6 percent. The move matched the market's expectations given recent reports showing a sharp slowing of the economy. 
 But the rally was cut short on Friday and yesterday by profit taking. Traders said they needed more evidence of slowing economic growth and mild inflation before driving bond yields lower.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32, to 114 15/32, leaving its yield unchanged at 6.52 percent. The yield on the two-year note was also unchanged at 5.54 percent.
"There's fair value right here; this is it," said Jack Ablin, who manages $8 billion of bonds at Bank of Boston. "What could give that yields could really get much lower than this? Inflation is pretty much in check where it is."
The Fed's willingness to cut rates will support higher Treasury prices in the weeks ahead, said Michael McGlone, a trader at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York. "I'm still bullish," he said. "The trend remains completely intact. The Fed doesn't stop with just one."
Bond prices were also helped by a stronger dollar, which prompted speculation that international investors would not exit American markets to stem foreign exchange losses, analysts said. Dollar-buying by the Fed and the Bank of Japan on Friday has bolstered the value of the dollar.
Some analysts, however, say bonds could soon fall. "The market has gotten a bit ahead of itself, anticipating more economic weakness than we've gotten," said Fred Leiner, a trading analyst at Prudential Securities in Chicago.
Bonds are not expected to move much "until we get further data that shows the economy going one way or the other," said Terrence Pigott, head trader at Daiwa Securities (America).
Reports later this week could give traders and investors more clues on whether the economy's growth is moderating enough to restrain inflation.
The Government is scheduled to report on producer prices on Thursday and on consumer prices on Friday. Producer prices probably will show a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in June, when consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent, according to a survey of economists.
At the Treasury's regular weekly auction yesterday, rates on three-month and six-month bills declined. The Treasury sold $13.6 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.40 percent, down from 5.53 percent last week and the lowest since the bills sold for 5.35 percent on June 26.
The Treasury also $13.6 billion in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.30 percent, down from 5.46 percent, and the lowest since they averaged 5.22 percent on Sept. 26.
Following are the results of the Treasury auction:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: The First Day Is a Long One at the Privatized D.M.V.

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: WAYNE, N.J., July 10

 BODY:
David Green arrived bright and early this morning at the newly privatized motor vehicle office to take the test for a truck-driver's license. His promptness did not help.
Mr. Green, of New Milford, spent an hour in line before a newly hired clerk took his application and other paperwork about 9 A.M. Then he waited for another new clerk to call his name for the start of the test. And he waited. One hour. Two hours. Three hours. Noon passed, and still no mention of his name. 
 "The paperwork is all in there," he said with a shrug and a sigh. "All you hope is it doesn't get shuffled off to the floor."
The administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman switched the Wayne agency and 22 other motor vehicle offices in New Jersey from state to private operation today in the name of efficiency and economy. But the campaign's start was hectic and bumpy across the state, with new clerks working after only a weekend of training on recognizing and processing the multitude of forms and documents for titles, licenses and registration plates.
"There's some glitches," said Bob Thompson, a Division of Motor Vehicles spokesman. "There's a learning curve. It'll keep improving."
To help ease the transition, the state had given a month's extension to all licenses and registration expiring in July and August. Despite the grace period, customers poured into the agencies as clerks struggled to learn new jobs today.
The Wayne agency and branches in North Bergen and Eatontown stopped accepting new customers at 3 P.M., 90 minutes before the regular 4:30 closing. At 3:30, backlogs forced three other agencies -- Oakland, Freehold and Jersey City -- to bar new customers.
For the Wayne agency, the first morning of privatization meant long lines, long waits and hundreds of glum and listless faces at the service counter, at the office's bank of pay phones, along its walls, and in its chairs.
It also meant traffic jams outside the building. In late morning, all parking spaces were filled and perhaps 75 cars circled the building, bumper to bumper, hunting for an open slot. Tempers frayed, shouts erupted, and Wayne police officers on Monday-moonlight duty as security guards worked to keep the peace.
At one point, the officers parked a police car across the mouth of the agency's entrance for 45 minutes. The blockade was removed about noon. But an hour later, the lot was filled again and about 25 cars spilled back onto Route 23.
Motorists lucky enough to find a parking spot after lunch entered the agency to a police lieutenant's admonition of a four-hour wait. Most Mondays, he said, the longest wait was perhaps two or two and a half hours.
"This is horrible," said Michelle Wagman of Fair Lawn, who came to get a boat registration. She wheeled her baby into the agency, took one look at the crowd, turned around and walked out. She had come to the Wayne office after refusing to wait in a crowded D.M.V office in Lodi about 15 miles away.
"It was just as bad there," she said.
Maryann Szczesny, a doctor's receptionist, took the morning off to replace the lost title for her car and was getting jittery about getting back to work after waiting nearly three hours.
"This is a nightmare," she said. "It's all very frustrating."
Robert Gillis, a service worker for a car dealer, came to get his drivers' license restored after a six-month suspension. He wound up in a long wait with a new acquaintance, Mr. Green, the applicant for the truckers' license.
"I think I got the short shaft," Mr. Gillis said. "The day I'm eligible to get the license back, they go private."
But he endorsed Governor Whitman's privatization campaign, which she says will save $4 million, and praised the new clerk who waited on him.
"If it saves money and if it's just a matter of getting through a few bugs, I'm all for it," Mr. Gillis said.
A Nutley resident, Robert Beleskie, weary from a three-and-a-half-hour wait for a boat registration, had little sympathy for privatization.
"They think they're saving tax dollars, but 300 workers with families to support are out of work, and that's no joke," he said. "I'd rather see those people working."
The state will finance the 23 newly privatized agencies the same way it does 23 other D.M.V. offices that have always been run by private agents. State money pays for each office's lease, utilities, custodial services, staff wages, health benefits and the salary of the agent who runs the office. Agents earn $42,000 a year and can receive bonuses up to $23,000 based on the number of their office's transactions.
The savings envisioned by Governor Whitman would come from lower staffing levels, lower clerks' wages, less extensive health benefits, and elimination of pension costs, state officials say.
The new private offices will have 238 clerks, 54 fewer than the 292 who staffed the agencies during state operation, officials said. The new salaries range from $14,800 to $24,200. Clerks had earned from $18,400 to $38,200 during state operation. The position of agency supervisor, which carried a maximum salary of $53,600, has been eliminated.
Of the 334 clerks laid off under privatization, 74 have been hired to the lower-paying jobs by the new private agents, Mr. Thompson said.
After privatization's bumpy start today, Mr. Thompson said officials started thinking about keeping the private agencies open longer each day and possibly on Saturdays. Asked if longer hours wouldn't consume the projected $4 million in savings, Mr. Thompson said the state "will be offering more services at reduced costs."
As privatization started, two former clerks abandoned a hunger strike they started late last week in a camper outside the State House in Trenton. "It is clear the Governor will not be moved," one of them, Andrea McGann, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Trucks, rails and airlines of the Dow transports surge on the Fed cut.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE stock market has seen the Federal Reserve cut rates, and it thinks that a recession will be avoided.
In the last three sessions after the Fed's move on Thursday to reduce the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, stocks that are sensitive to the economy have performed much better than others. The Dow Jones transportation average, which is very economically sensitive, has surged 7.3 percent over the last three sessions, the best move over such a period since late 1991. 
 Similarly, Morgan Stanley's broadly based index of cyclical stocks has risen 4.3 percent over the period, while its index of consumer stocks, which is much less sensitive to the economy, has slipped half a percent.
The surge in the transports, which include truckers, railroads and airlines, sent that index to a new high for the first time in more than 17 months. Its gain of 51.47, or 2.8 percent, to 1,890.98 yesterday put it above the old record of 1,862.29, set Feb. 2, 1994.
As virtually every American stock index climbed to new highs this year, the Dow transports had been the most prominent laggard. But the index has leaped by more than 100 points in two sessions, with the move continuing yesterday even as the Dow industrials fell back by a fraction of a point.
Every one of the 20 stocks in the Dow transports was up yesterday.
The Fed's move on Thursday is being seen as a sign that the central bank is determined to avoid letting the economy fall into a recession, notwithstanding concerns that lower rates could damage an already weak dollar.
With the transports finally in record territory, one of the oldest of stock market indicators therefore turned bullish, albeit a bit belatedly. The Dow Theory, which traces back to Charles Dow, a founder of Dow Jones, holds that the economy and the stock market are in gear if both the industrials, which make the goods, and the transports, which move them, are both setting highs.
Until yesterday, it was possible to cite the transports as having failed to confirm the peaks being regularly set by industrials. While yesterday was the first record of the year for the transport index, the Dow industrials have set new highs 43 times, the last being on Friday.
It is the airline stocks that have led the transport index up 37.8 percent from its low last Dec. 13. Six of the 20 transport stocks are up more than 50 percent over that stretch, and five are airlines: USAir, Delta Air Lines, UAL, AMR and Southwest Airlines. The only interloper is Santa Fe Pacific, the railroad that is being acquired by Burlington Northern.
For the airlines, the good news has been evidence that they can avoid the price wars that have ravaged profits. This summer's discounts appear to have been milder than those in the past.
Some of the other transports, which depend for their profits on moving goods rather than people, have lagged. Until yesterday, Roadway Services, the trucking company, was the only one of the Dow transports to be trading below its level of last Dec. 13, when the index hit its lowest level since late 1992. But it leaped $4.375, to $52.875, making it the biggest contributor to the transport index's move yesterday.
Roadway last week reported a loss for the second quarter, through June 17, blaming "stiff pricing competition in the industry and a lackluster economy" for its problems and promising it would continue cutting costs. There was no obvious reason for yesterday's price surge, and it may represent little more than investors searching for laggards.
Most rail stocks remain below where they were in early 1994, when the index hit its most recent high, as do most truckers, but all have been rising recently, with the rails having an especially good day yesterday. Clearly, confidence in the strength of the economy is not as great as it was early last year. But equally clearly, it has been improving recently, even before the Fed move. Over the last month, the transports are up 13.7 percent, while the industrials are up 5.8 percent.
While the transports have taken longer than most other indexes to get to a new high, that reflected in large part the fact that they were hammered worst than most last year, falling 26.3 percent from their early 1994 peak to their December low. By contrast, the Dow industrials suffered a maximum loss of just 9.7 percent.
There is, of course, almost always something to cite if you want to take a negative view of the stock market's progress. Now the Dow utilities are available. That index, whose performance is quite sensitive to interest rates, peaked on Sept. 13, 1993, at 256.46, and is down 21.2 percent since then. Yesterday it fell 0.07 point, to 202.08. Early last month, it hit a 1994 peak of 209.86, but has fallen back since in what could be a sign that interest rates are not likely to fall much further. And that, too, could be seen as a sign of a strengthening economy.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Error

BYLINE: By James K. Galbraith; James K. Galbraith teaches economics at the University of Texas at Austin.

DATELINE: TOWNSHEND, Vt.

 BODY:
The Fed's reduction of one set of interest rates on Friday marked the beginning of the end of Alan Greenspan's war on inflation. The war began in February 1994 with the Fed's quarter point increase in the rates that banks charge one another for overnight loans and led to a doubling of those rates, to 6 percent from 3 percent. The financial markets expect further cuts.
The war was phony. So was the enemy. Despite nonstop fretting by Mr. Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, no serious evidence of accelerating inflation ever emerged. For the first five months of 1995, consumer prices rose at a very modest 3.6 percent annual rate. 
 The economy is more fragile than the Fed had been willing to admit. For 18 months, we have been reassured that stable growth lay ahead. But now major indicators of growth like industrial production and the sales of cars and appliances -- all battered by needlessly high interest rates -- are down.
Yes, the economy may rebound from its multiple slowdowns. Sales of new homes -- not a generally reliable indicator -- looked good in May, but most other signs are bad. On balance, the risk of recession is rising. The Fed's action showed that even its chairman had lost confidence in his earlier optimism.
The war against inflation was fought against an enemy that existed only in the imaginations and perhaps in the economic models of Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues. Yet there were casualties, as in all wars.
The middle class was hit hardest by rising adjustable-rate mortgages and the falling values of stock portfolios and pension funds most of last year, because when interest rates soar stock prices tend to fall.
The five-year Federal deficit rose by some $200 billion in prospective interest costs, reversing much of the 1993 reduction. President Clinton's credibility has been damaged, for he had promised falling deficits and lower interest rates.
The Fed should have done nothing last year. Stable and low short-term rates would have generated stronger growth, lower long-term rates, higher investment and lower deficits -- without bringing on inflation.
If the Fed's campaign was based on a potpourri of prejudices, hunches and assumptions, an excessive fear of rising inflation and an insufficient fear of rising unemployment, then the operating methods and the biases of the decision-makers must be questioned.
The Fed's analytic methods are dubious. It has underrated fundamental changes in the economy, and it still places too much weight on the hoary assumption that inflation will rise if unemployment falls below 6 percent. (It is currently 5.6 percent.)
The Fed's economists apparently failed to predict that wages would stand still. Since wages are always the largest element of costs, stagnating wages mean fairly stable, not inflating, prices.
There has been no increase in average wages despite falling unemployment, which reflects an increased demand for labor. Why this stagnation? One big reason is the decline of unions. Another is intense competition from imports from low-wage countries.
When Mr. Greenspan next appears before Congress, he should be pressed for a full accounting of the forecasts and the theories underlying the needless war.
Congress should request the full records of Fed meetings and supporting analyses so that it and outside experts can try to understand what went wrong. And when President Clinton nominates his next candidate for the Fed's board, he and Congress should insist on a new spirit of openness in Fed deliberations.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Climbs, Still Benefiting From U.S.-Japan Intervention

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar climbed against other leading currencies yesterday, continuing to benefit from Friday's intervention by the United States and Japan.
The Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan surprised traders on Friday, buying dollars for yen as the dollar was rising. Generally over the last few years the world's central banks have bought dollars only when the currency was falling. 
 "They're catching the market at surprising times," said Steve Flanagan, currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York. "There's no doubt they're looking to push this dollar higher."
The surprise intervention "puts the market on alert that there is some risk to selling the dollar," Mr. Flanagan said. The fear of selling dollars also supported the value of the dollar against other currencies.
Against the German mark, the dollar was also bolstered by mounting speculation that the Bundesbank would follow the Fed and the Bank of Japan by cutting interest rates when its policy-setting council meets on Thursday.
Although the dollar's gains were pared late in the day, many traders said they remained optimistic about the currency's prospects over the next several days. "Over all, the market still has bullish sentiment toward the dollar," said Jeffrey Yu, senior currency dealer at the Sanwa Bank in New York.
The dollar rose as high as 87.59 yen, its highest level against the Japanese currency since May 22. In late New York trading, it was quoted at 86.88 yen, up from 86.76 yen on Friday. The dollar rose to 1.3949 German marks from 1.3925 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5939 from $1.5951.
The dollar-buying spree by the Fed and the Bank of Japan followed the Fed's cut in short-term interest rates on Thursday by a quarter of a percentage point. Typically, lower interest rates weaken a country's currency by reducing the return on investments.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
In a Season of Discontent, Japan Hails a Conquering Hero

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 10

 BODY:
When Hideo Nomo, a star pitcher for Japan's Kintetsu Buffaloes, decided some months back to leave his team and try to make it in the American major leagues, he was regarded by some people here as almost a traitor to Japanese baseball.
But when Hideo Nomo, Los Angeles Dodger and National League strikeout king, takes the mound as his league's starting pitcher in Tuesday's All-Star Game, his countrymen back home will be rooting for him as a new hero. For by leaving Japan and showing that a Japanese player can succeed in America, Nomo has given a bigger boost to the reputation of Japanese baseball than he ever could have done by staying. 
 In the process, Nomo has provided Japan a needed lift in a year that has brought nothing but bad news -- a killer earthquake, poison gas in the subways, a religious cult, a soaring yen, a slumping economy and more nasty trade disputes with the United States. His success has inspired a rabid following among Japanese citizens, while also raising concern that other top Japanese players will follow him to the United States, a clear sign of the respect he has earned for baseball in this country.
"Until now it's been said that Japanese baseball is inferior," said Hajimu Tamaki, a writer for Nikkan Sports, a Japanese sports newspaper. "For a Japanese player to play equally among the Americans is an honor."
Major league scouts are now searching here for the next Nomo. "All of a sudden, they don't consider it little-league baseball any longer," said Marty Kuehnert, a sports broadcaster here who is part owner of the Birmingham Barons, an American minor league team.
The result has been Nomo fever in Japan. People have been gathering on street corners in Tokyo and other cities to watch the 26-year-old and his trademark tornado-like delivery on giant television screens. The screens were set up in public places by NHK, the public broadcasting corporation, which has been broadcasting Nomo's games live on one of its satellite channels. Both NHK's satellite channel and a commercial television station will broadcast the All-Star Game live, at 9 A.M. Wednesday Japan time.
To those for whom the television is not enough, Japan Travel Bureau, a large travel agency, has begun offering "Dodgers Watching" tours to Los Angeles. The tours include a round-trip flight, three nights in a hotel, a game at Dodger Stadium (hot dog included), and side trips to Disneyland and other attractions. Prices range from $1,250 to $2,700.
At the Major League Baseball Japan Shop in Tokyo, customers have been snapping up Nomo caps, shirts and other merchandise. About 40 people waited outside the store before it opened last Saturday, when a new shipment of Nomo goods arrived, said a store official, Hisao Kanayama.
If this were international trade, it would be a rare area in which the United States would be running a surplus with Japan. There have been dozens of exports of American players to Japan. But until Nomo there was only one other Japanese import into the major leagues -- Masanori Murakami, who pitched for the San Francisco Giants in 1964 and 1965.
Japan has responded to this trade imbalance in just the way it had said it would never do in the recent automobile trade talks -- by setting quotas. There can be no more than three foreigners on a Japanese team and no more than three on each all-star team.
Nomo, whose first name actually means "hero," is not the first Japanese player to achieve fame by beating the Americans at their own game. In the first baseball games ever between Japanese and Americans -- in 1898 -- a ragtag American team made up of merchants, traders and missionaries living in Yokohama was repeatedly trounced by a Japanese preparatory school team that trained so intensively that its players were said to urinate blood at the end of a practice.
According to "You Gotta Have Wa," a book by Robert Whiting about Japanese baseball, the school's pitcher, Kotaro Moriyama, became such a celebrity that he spawned a popular saying: "To be hit by Moriyama's fastball is an honor exceeded only by being crushed under the wheels of the imperial carriage."
In 1934, 18-year-old Eiji Sawamura, facing a team of American stars touring Japan, struck out Charlie Gehringer, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx in succession.
Nomo had been a stellar pitcher in Japan's Pacific League since his debut in 1990, when he was named most valuable player and best pitcher as well as rookie of the year. But last year he had a poor season in which he won only eight games and was plagued by arm trouble. That seemed to bode ill for his chances in the United States.
"Frankly speaking, no one imagined such a great achievement," said Masaru Ikei, a professor of political science at Keio University and a self-described "crazy" baseball fan.
One Japanese manager predicted Nomo would fail because he threw too many "foa boru" or "four balls," the Japanese term for walks. Control has indeed been a problem for Nomo, but not a fatal one, as testified to by his 1.99 earned run average and 6-1 record.
Now there is some worry that other players, prompted by Nomo's success, will seek fame and fortune in the United States.
Pitchers are considered the best candidates. "The top 20 pitchers here are all major league standard or above," said Bobby Valentine, the former Texas Ranger manager, who now manages Japan's Chiba Lotte Marines. Players at other positions are not as strong, he and others said, in part because they lack the power for bigger American ball parks.
Some Japanese players have said they would like to play in the United States. But it might be difficult for Japanese players to cross the Pacific Ocean because Japanese contracts are very strict. Free agency is a new concept in Japan and applies only to veterans of 10 years.
The commissioners of baseball in Japan and the United States have an agreement that controls trans-Pacific raiding. Even if a player were to retire from Japanese baseball and move to the United States, an American team could not hire him without first getting permission from the player's old Japanese team, said Masaru Madate, assistant director of baseball operations in the Japanese commissioner's office.
In Nomo's case, the Buffaloes let him go after his bad season and after arguments over his demands for a multiyear contract, something that is extremely rare in Japan. Many other teams and commentators criticized Kintetsu for setting a bad precedent by letting its prime property go without even demanding a payment from the Dodgers.

HEADLINE: Prairie Dog Colonies Bolster Life in the Plains

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: BADLANDS NATIONAL PARK, S.D.

 BODY:
A RISING sun was just beginning to illuminate the harsh beauty of the Badlands when an early-rising prairie dog emerged from one of thousands of small dirt mounds decorating a swale of the Great Plains. By midmorning the ground was alive with the golden-tan, foot-long rodents, which are only now becoming recognized as an ecologically crucial species with uncommon power to affect the lives and surroundings of other creatures.
"Look at that landscape out there," said Dr. Glenn E. Plumb, the wildlife biologist for Badlands National Park, as he gazed out across the prairie-dog town. "That's a real concentration of biological activity, a lot of complex nature." 
 Its verdant carpet produces more new growth in a given year than is produced in similarly sized patches of the surrounding plains, attracting a crowd of plant and seed eaters from insects to mice to birds to bison. Predators like hawks, coyotes and bug-eating birds follow.
The prairie dogs, as architects and custodians of their immediate environment, are largely responsible for this concentration of life. Their constant cropping of vegetation stimulates faster and more nutritious growth, while their burrows provide homes and hunting grounds for many organisms, large and small. The resulting patches of habitat make the Plains ecosystem more complex, diverse and biologically active than it would otherwise be.
Dozens of vertebrate species may depend on prairie-dog colonies to one degree or another, some scientists believe. At least one species, the black-footed ferret, cannot survive without them. As the prairie dog goes, conservation biologists say, so may go a raft of other creatures; save prairie dogs and you may also save a sizable and particularly valuable slice of the Plains ecosystem. This late-blooming realization -- that prairie dogs may be what ecologists call a "keystone" species -- is pushing the prairie dog into the forefront of conservation concern for the first time.
Prairie dogs have long been viewed, particularly by urban dwellers, as the epitome of cute. The scene here a few days ago was typical. When the animals emerged from their dens, some touched teeth in "kisses" of recognition. They romped, rolled, wrestled and chased each other around. They assiduously tended their burrows, dirt flying from their busy paws, bundles of grass for lining underground nests drooping from their mouths.
Many stood watch, erect and alert, scanning the countryside for unwelcome guests like coyotes, hawks or people. A few executed a comically winsome maneuver called the jump-yip display: standing upright, the animal throws its head back and its forefeet high in the air. The movement is accompanied by a sharp half-whistle, half-squeak that rises in pitch and then falls off again. Some experts think it is a territorial gesture, but it looks like nothing so much as an expression of joy.
Despite such charming and popular behavior, prairie dogs have for more than a century been generally regarded by humans who share their home range as noxious pests that ruin grazing land and must be exterminated. Billions have been poisoned over the decades, and the poisoning continues today with aid from both state and Federal governments.
When the Sioux ruled these parts, as many as 100 million acres, or 20 percent of the land area of the Plains, may have been covered by prairie-dog colonies. Today, although two of five North American species are imperiled, hundreds of thousands of the rodents remain, which may help explain the previous lack of conservation concern. The black-tailed variety that lives hereabouts is the most widespread. Formerly endangered, it made a comeback after the most devastating forms of poison were banned in the 1970's and is no longer in jeopardy.
But conservation biologists say that the land area covered by prairie-dog colonies has been reduced by 98 percent since pre-settlement times. As the prairie dog's ecological role becomes clearer, this continuing loss of habitat is raising alarms about the future of less abundant species whose existence is tied to its colonies. These include the burrowing owl, which lives in prairie-dog burrows; the mountain plover, which prefers the close-cropped surface growth of prairie-dog towns, and, most notably, the black-footed ferret. The ferret, which dines almost exclusively on prairie dogs and also inhabits their burrows, is so endangered that it has had to be bred in captivity and is now being reintroduced in several places, including the Badlands.
"The trends are pretty clear, and if those trends continue, we're going to lose a lot of these species if something isn't done," said Dr. Tim W. Clark, a Yale University conservation biologist based in Jackson, Wyo. Dr. Clark was one of several scientists who explored the subject at a meeting of the Society for Conservation Biology last month in Fort Collins, Colo.
For all their air of fun, frolic and industry, prairie dogs -- not dogs at all but a variety of ground squirrel -- live in a violent and unforgiving world. They are continually beset by predators of one kind or another. The defense strategy they have evolved lies at the heart of their ecological role.
By organizing themselves in colonies and living underground, they have set up a cooperative detection-and-escape network against attack by surface and aerial predators. Any human visitor can easily see it in action, although tourists who stop at roadside pullouts on the edges of prairie-dog towns might well miss it. Prairie dogs living near the pullouts have become so habituated to humans that one can approach to within two or three feet. Biologists call these animals "Twinkie dogs," after the pastry confection to which they have sometimes presumably been treated.
But move just a little farther into the colony, and things change. Soon one prairie dog issues a warning call, a high-pitched "chirk" that it repeats incessantly, head and little black-tipped tail jerking in what looks like indignation. Others take up the call, starting a chain reaction of noise that rises in pitch, volume and speed of repetition if the intruder walks faster. Soon there is bedlam. One by one, all the animals dive into their burrows as the intruder approaches. When the danger has passed, it is high time for the jump-yip display.
The defense system is extremely efficient. "In 22 years, I have seen a mere 22" successful above-ground predations, said Dr. John L. Hoogland, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Maryland, who has studied prairie dogs extensively at Wind Cave National Park near here. He is the author of a new book, "The Black-Tailed Prairie Dog: Social Life of a Burrowing Mammal" (University of Chicago Press).
But the system has its drawbacks. Predators like snakes and badgers find the burrows little or no hindrance, and lethal black-widow spiders often take up residence in burrow entrances. The black-footed ferret, a nocturnal predator about half the size of a prairie dog, slips easily into burrows and exacts an especially grisly toll: it locks its teeth on the throat of its prey, strangles the victim, and then eats it bones and all -- except for the feet.
In some densely packed colonies, prairie dogs express a dark side of their own. In the spring, after babies are born, many mothers go on an orgy of infanticide, killing and often eating the offspring of others. They do it to reduce competition for food, and possibly also to get an extra shot of protein at nursing time, Dr. Hoogland said, adding, "It is a real slaughterhouse for four to six weeks."
Whatever the trade-offs for the prairie dogs, the big byproduct of the colony-based defense system is its impact on the Plains ecosystem, which in this region is dominated by grasses of short and medium length, as distinguished from the tallgrass prairies farther east. (Prairie dogs do not live in these eastern prairies, presumably because they cannot function well in the taller grass.)
The most obvious ecological effect arises from the burrows themselves, which attract a concentration of predators, underground-living invertebrates and other tenants like the burrowing owl. A shy bird about the size of a pigeon, it can sometimes be observed here at a distance, posted near a prairie dog on its burrow mound. (The owls do not eat prairie dogs, but batten instead on smaller prey.)
More subtle is the impact of the prairie dogs' "mowing" of the land. In foraging, as well as in creating a better view of approaching predators, the rodents clip all vegetation to within three or four inches of the surface. This changes the temperature and moisture content of the soil, encouraging some plant varieties to replace others; broad-leafed, nonwoody plants like wildflowers and legumes take over from grasses, for instance. The constant cropping also makes plants more nutritious and digestible by eliminating the decline in nutrition and roughness that come with aging. And the more rapid plant growth and recycling of energy inherent in a regime of constant grazing simply increases the amount of vegetation over time.
"Things happen quicker in a prairie-dog colony," explained Dr. April D. Whicker, a wildlife biologist with the National Biological Service in Fort Collins, who has long studied the ecological role of prairie dogs. "Although at any one time there is less biomass, overall productivity is higher."
Naturally enough, this accelerated energy machine attracts more plant-eaters, from herbivorous insects to pronghorn antelope and bison, both of which tend to hang around prairie-dog colonies in summer. The antelope are drawn by the succulent forage, while bison come both for the eating and for a place to rest and take dust baths to shed parasites.
Some studies have suggested that yearling bison that feed randomly and intermittently in a prairie-dog town gain 14 percent more weight than if they feed elswhere. The gain is 46 percent higher, the studies suggest, if the yearlings feed regularly in colonies.
Other studies have found that the total density of animal life, apart from prairie dogs, is higher where colonies exist. Some species are especially abundant: deer mice, grasshopper mice, horned larks and some species of grasshoppers, for instance. Badgers, coyotes, swift foxes, golden eagles, bobcats and hawks are drawn to the colonies by the abundance of prey, including the prairie dogs.
While as many as 170 vertebrate species are said to appear in prairie-dog towns, it is not yet clear how many are significantly dependent on the colonies. Clarifying this picture is one purpose of a four-year study on which Dr. Whicker and two other National Biological Service scientists, Dr. Bruce Baker and Dr. Tasha Kotliar, are working.
Conservation biologists are especially concerned that although prairie dogs still exist throughout their historic range, the colonies are smaller, fewer and more fragmented. One fear is that because colonies are so widely separated and so hemmed in by farms and ranches, the overall colony system will slowly disintegrate.
Each colony has a life cycle; eventually, the vegetation plays out under intense grazing. Historically, prairie dogs simply moved to new ground, leaving the abandoned territory to recover its vegetation. Now, it is feared, they may not be able to do so as easily. And given the wide separation between colonies, it may not be possible for relatively immobile animals like the tiger salamander, which has adapted to the colony habitat, to move to a new colony.
Another concern is the threat posed by plague, which is believed to have been introduced from Asia early in this century. Once established in a colony, the plague organism, which is passed from one rodent to another by fleas, kills almost all the prairie dogs living there. A number of colonies have been ravaged in recent years, mostly in the Southwest. Since 1970, according to a laboratory of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort Collins, 16 cases of plague in humans have been associated with prairie-dog contact. The disease responds to antibiotics.
The biggest difficulty, from the standpoint of conservationists, may be human attitudes. Though not all ranchers are unsympathetic to prairie dogs and ecological concerns, the view of the prairie dog as a pest to be exterminated is by all accounts still dominant in the West.
Cattle ranching operates on a thin economic margin, and any grazing land that is not fully productive is a liability. Ranchers commonly insist that productivity is reduced when prairie dogs compete with cattle for forage. Some conservationists argue that if the forage is sufficient for bison, it ought to be sufficient for cattle. But the jury is out on this. Dr. Whicker says that what applies in the wild, where wildlife populations are below the carrying capacity of the ecosystem, may not apply in the case of higher-density cattle herds.
National parks like this one may provide the best sanctuary for prairie-dog habitat, with other public lands second. But national forests, national grasslands and lands owned by the Bureau of Land Management are open to grazing, and much contention surrounds their use. In one area comparatively rich in prairie-dog colonies, on bureau lands in Montana, the Government and local ranchers have agreed to maintain overall prairie-dog occupation at 1988 levels.
Many conservation biologists see the struggle to reach some accommodation between the interests of the Plains economy and its natural ecology as critical. Some Federal land managers committed to ecosystem protection worry that Congressional pressure to weaken or gut the Endangered Species Act may remove their main tool for forging such compromises. Protecting the endangered ferret, in this view, has been the key to protecting prairie-dog colonies.
"To be frank," said one land manager, "if there wasn't public land and the Endangered Species Act, we wouldn't be in the prairie dog or ferret business. They'd be gone."

Clinton on Recognition: A Move 'to Common Ground'

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Following are excerpts of President Clinton's announcement today establishing full diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam:
Today, I am announcing the normalization of diplomatic relationships with Vietnam. 
 From the beginning of this Administration, any improvement in relationships between America and Vietnam has depended upon making progress on the issue of Americans who were missing in action or held as prisoners of war. Last year, I lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam in response to their cooperation and to enhance our efforts to secure the remains of lost Americans and to determine the fate of those whose remains had not been found.
It has worked. In 17 months Hanoi has taken important steps to help us resolve many cases. Twenty-nine families have received the remains of their loved ones, and at last have been able to give them the proper burial. Hanoi has delivered to us hundreds of pages of documents shedding light on what happened to Americans in Vietnam, and Hanoi has stepped up its cooperation with Laos, where many Americans were lost. We have reduced the number of so-called "discrepancy cases," in which we have had reason to believe that Americans were still alive after they were lost, to 55, and we will continue to work to resolve more cases. . . .
Our strategy is working. Normalization of relations is the next appropriate step. With this new relationship, we will be able to make more progress. To that end, I will send another delegation to Vietnam this year. Vietnam has pledged it will continue to help us find answers. We will hold them to that pledge.
By helping to bring Vietnam into the community of nations, normalization also serves our interest in working for a free and peaceful Vietnam in a stable and peaceful Asia . . .
Our policy will be to implement the appropriate United States government programs to develop trade with Vietnam, consistent with United States law. As you know, many of these programs require certifications regarding human rights and labor rights before they can proceed. . . . The Secretary of State will go to Vietnam in August where he will discuss all of these issues, beginning with our P.O.W. and M.I.A. concerns.
I believe normalization and increased contact between Americans and Vietnamese will advance the cause of freedom in Vietnam just as it did Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. I strongly believe that engaging the Vietnamese on the broad economic front of economic reform, and the broad front of democratic reform, will help to honor the sacrifice of those who fought for freedom's sake in Vietnam. . . .
This step will also help our own country to move forward on an issue that has separated Americans from one another for too long now. Let the future be our destination. We have so much work ahead of us. This moment offers us the opportunity to bind up our own wounds. They have resisted time for too long. We can now move on to common ground. Whatever divided us before, let us consign to the past. Let this moment in the words of Scripture, "Be a time to heal, and a time to build." Thank you all. And God bless America.

For Many of Those Who Fled Vietnam, a Day of Sadness, Anger and Hope

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: WESTMINSTER, Calif., July 11

 BODY:
For Yen Do, editor of the largest Vietnamese-language daily in America, the establishment today of diplomatic relations between Hanoi and Washington marks the end of a half century of war that has tortured his nation and scattered two million of its people around the world.
It welcomes Vietnam into the community of nations, opens new possibilities for its economic development and may help efforts to foster democracy and human rights after 20 years of Communist rule, said Mr. Yen, who edits Nguoi Viet Daily News here in the community known as Little Saigon, 30 miles south of Los Angeles. 
 But for Mr. Yen and many of his fellow refugees, the day was nevertheless colored by sadness, symbolically laying to rest the homeland they fought for, whose yellow-and-red flag is still flown by overseas Vietnamese groups.
"It is something like a pair of lovers who know it is time to leave each other," he said. "Reasonably, rationally, they know the time has come, but emotionally it is hard to accept."
Among many overseas Vietnamese, the sadness found expression in angry words.
"I feel very angry and bitter, but then, it's very clear that business interests have been put in front of human rights," said Diem Do, who has been a leading opponent of normalized relations in the highly fragmented emigre community.
Tran Van Ngoc, past president of the Vietnamese Air Force Veterans Association, said he saw the move as a cynical attempt to use Vietnam once again as a geopolitical pawn against Chinese expansion.
Mai Cong, who heads the Vietnamese Community of Orange County, a private social and cultural agency here, issued a statement saying, "It is as if a decisive step has been taken to sever us from the past, or from any lingering attachment with the past, even though the past only means war and misery for many of us."
She added: "There may be joy in Hanoi, but there certainly will be no celebrations in Little Saigon."
And on Little Saigon Radio, which interrupted its Vietnamese-language broadcasts to carry President Clinton's announcement live this morning, the news was immediately followed by interviews with non-Vietnamese opponents of normalization, who said things like, "I truly believe that this is one of the blackest days in the history of America."
In the three hours following the announcement, 32 callers to an open line at the radio station opposed the reestablishment of relations, while just 13 supported it, said Trang Nguyen, president of Little Saigon TV and Radio.
Since the fall of Saigon in April 1975, some 800,000 refugees have fled to the United States, many clustering in Vietnamese communities like this one where the question of whether to open business and diplomatic contacts with Hanoi created sometimes violent divisions but also helped to define emigre politics and discourse.
For years, right-wing groups collected donations for a fantasy guerrilla war that would succeed where the Americans had failed. Journalists and others who advocated improved relations with Vietnam were attacked and, on a handful of occasions, were killed.
Opposition to improved relations with Hanoi has been kept alive by the recent arrival of about 10,000 former labor camp prisoners, mostly elderly men whose lives have been consumed by the war and its harsh aftermath and who could be counted on to join anti-Communist demonstrations here.
But in recent years, particularly after President Clinton lifted a trade embargo in February 1994, an increasing flood of emigre Vietnamese tourists and entrepreneurs has visited Vietnam, crossing paths with the final trickle of postwar refugees.
Twenty years after Saigon's fall -- and 50 years after the start of the war against the colonial French government that preceded Washington's involvement -- many Vietnamese here say the passage of history has made the debate over normalization as anachronistic as the continuing departure of refugees.
"I think it is good that we finally can put everything behind us and move ahead, and for the community to concentrate on the problems at hand," said Le Kim Dinh, a journalist and writer.
There are signs that that might be happening. On Monday, on the eve of Mr. Clinton's announcement, 10 groups from among the many feuding emigre factions signed a resolution urging Washington to press Hanoi on two substantive issues that overseas Vietnamese agree on: democratization and human rights.
And in a signal that they might leave their political isolation and join mainstream politics, the groups also called for strong action on an issue of greater interest to non-Vietnamese Americans: the search for missing American servicemen.
"In the past, it was all divisiveness," said Mrs. Nguyen. "People were all calling each other Communists. Now they can unite on real issues, and from now on they will have some real doors to knock on. They can protest directly at the Vietnamese Embassy and consular offices."
Mr. Yen said he foresaw other benefits from normalized diplomatic relations. Many former South Vietnamese officials and high-ranking military men who feared revisiting Vietnam may now feel safe in doing so, given the protection of an American Embassy.
In addition, he said, today's announcement could result in the freeing of some political prisoners who have been held because of Hanoi's fears of outside threats.
Some other Vietnamese-Americans were aggressively eager to move ahead both with their integration into American society and their business ventures in Vietnam.
Frank Jao, a leading developer who owns much of the property in Little Saigon and is exploring business opportunities in Vietnam, rejected any talk of the past.
"Speaking in the context of being an American businessman -- nothing to do with Vietnamese-American, because I am no longer a Vietnamese -- it's good for the United States," he said of today's developments. "It is good for business in the United States of America."
And T. T. Nhu, a Vietnamese-American who is a columnist for The San Jose Mercury News, said she was glad to be able to move on to other issues.
"I've almost run out of things to say," she said. "Thank God we are at the end of the road. This should have happened in 1945. It's all been so unnecessary. What a waste of life. What a tragedy it has all been."

HEADLINE: OPENING TO VIETNAM: IMPLICATIONS;
Finally, Opening the Door All the Way

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
The wonder is not that the United States is establishing normal diplomatic relations with Hanoi, two full decades after the fall of Saigon; the wonder is that it took so long.
Presidents have come and gone since those final apocalyptic scenes of a long, wretched war -- the American Ambassador fleeing from Saigon with the embassy's flag folded under his arm, the fevered scramble for the last seats on the last helicopter out. Neither Gerald R. Ford nor Jimmy Carter nor Ronald Reagan nor George Bush could bring himself to recognize the government that Washington had demonized for so long, though Bush started down the path. 
 Instead, fate chose an unlikely pair of men: Bill Clinton, liberal Democrat, who like many thousands of his contemporaries managed to avoid fighting in a war that never won the full-hearted support of the American people, and John McCain, conservative Republican, son and grandson of admirals, who not only fought as a Navy pilot, but, shot down, spent more than five years in an enemy prison camp.
President Clinton provided the political impetus, Senator McCain of Arizona the political cover without which Mr. Clinton might have feared to act.
There were other key players as well, notably American business, eager for its share of the riches that Vietnam, its talented people and its offshore waters seem to promise, and American diplomats, who see friendship with Vietnam as an important asset for the United States as it seeks to counter Chinese influence in Asia.
The conventional explanation for the delay was the difficulty in accounting for the Americans still carried on military rolls as missing in action. According to the Pentagon, there are 2,202 of them if you count all of Southeast Asia, 1,618 if you count only Vietnam. Of that total, only 55, by official tally, are known to have been seen alive in captivity at some stage.
But the real reason lay much deeper within the national consciousness.
Far, far more Americans are listed as missing in the Korean War (8,170) and in World War II (78,750). Yet no one ever suggested it would be possible to account for more than a handful of them -- not to mention the hundreds of thousands of north and south Vietnamese whose fate remains unknown.
A few years after World War II, the United States was engaged in huge rebuilding efforts in Germany and Japan, even though Germans had killed millions of Jews and Japanese had tortured prisoners on a vast scale.
The difference, of course, is that the United States lost in Vietnam. It is never easy for the big guy to shake hands after losing the fight to the little guy, especially when he has never lost before, and so it was after the Vietnam War. The open wound of defeat was salved, for some Americans, by continuing to regard the Hanoi Government as an evil, outlaw, untouchable regime.
The resentment over the loss of so many American lives and the stunting of so many others, combined with the unresolved confusion and controversy over the purpose of the war itself, made it possible for the relatives and friends of some of the missing Americans to delay, but not ultimately to prevent, this last acknowledgment that the war is truly over, that it is time, as President Clinton suggested today, to move beyond "the haunting and painful past."
Not everyone will agree, of course. A group called "The Last Firebase," composed of veterans and relatives of the missing, said that "today will forever be known by America's veterans as Black Tuesday." The American Legion opposed the decision, and so did Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination next year.
It was "a strategic, diplomatic and moral mistake to grant Vietnam the stamp of approval from the U.S. Government," Senator Dole asserted.
But the most recent survey of American opinion suggests strongly that he and other critics of the President are in a distinct minority. A new CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll shows 61 percent of the public backing recognition and only 27 percent opposing it.
Mr. McCain's support is invaluable to Mr. Clinton, because he is by far the best known of the survivors of the infamous "Hanoi Hilton." He not only endorsed the President's action but said "it required some courage."
So is the backing of Jan Scruggs, who was wounded in Vietnam and later sparked the creation of the black granite Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall here. His comment was laconic: "The war is over, so let's be friends." And so is the backing of some veterans' groups, like the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
It may be that many Republican primary voters, a more conservative subset of the more conservative party, are more opposed to Mr. Clinton's action than are Americans as a whole. Mr. Dole's stance may play well with them.
But the steps along this road that Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton took earlier, including the lifting last year of a 19-year embargo on trade with Vietnam, failed to produce the groundswell of protest that the die-hards predicted. And Vietnam is now clearly a land of opportunities, which will inevitably draw much more American investment and many more visits by American tourists.
As a web of everyday political and economic links grows between the United States and Vietnam, as more and more Americans come to know Vietnam at peace, the old passions, already nearly spent for most Americans, will seem increasingly irrelevant. Normality is the enemy of grudges and hatreds.
At any rate, the deed is done. Congressional threats to withhold money for an American embassy in Hanoi are likely to come to nothing. Mr. Clinton acted just as the question of full diplomatic ties was beginning to be sucked into the vortex of the 1996 campaign. He could not have waited much longer, and by moving now, he may benefit from looking resolute on a tough issue.
Reminiscing this morning with a reporter he has known since the days of air raids over Hanoi and ground combat in the Central Highlands, Senator McCain commented that he was determined that his generation not leave a legacy of anger and vindictiveness.
"I got over the war about 45 minutes after the plane bringing me home took off from Hanoi," he said. "But not everyone feels that way. Some people hate me for backing this, call me the Manchurian Candidate, say I'm a collaborator, the most awful stuff. There will always be people like that, but fewer and fewer. Not many people talk about the dirty Japs anymore."

HEADLINE: Black Caucus Tells the President of Its Fears for Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
President Clinton met with the Congressional Black Caucus today to hear its concerns on affirmative action, voting rights and the Federal budget and said that next week he would announce the results of his long-awaited review of Federal preference programs that are based on race and sex.
The 80-minute meeting in the State Dining Room of the White House, the President's first with the group this year, was a sensitive one because many black officials adamantly oppose any effort to scale back job and contracting programs intended to redress past discrimination, or basing them on financial need instead of race. 
 But a recent Supreme Court ruling has sharply limited the Administration's flexibility and prompted the Justice Department to issue new guidelines for evaluating Federal affirmative action programs, ones that may make many harder to justify legally. So caucus members leaving the meeting exhibited a certain air of resignation.
While taking pains to note that Mr. Clinton had not elaborated on the Administration's plans in any detail, the caucus chairman, Representative Donald M. Payne, Democrat of New Jersey, said, "I'd be surprised and disappointed if it was something we couldn't live with."
Mr. Payne said that the group had voiced its concerns to Mr. Clinton but that "one of the problems is we don't have as much contact with him as we should." Members of the group have met with Mr. Clinton and senior White House officials in recent months, but the group as an entity has not met with the President since last year.
Even such an occasionally sharp critic of the President as Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Harlem, was low-key.
Mr. Rangel said the President had offered "some vague words" about his coming proposal "that allowed us to believe it would not cause us undue ill feelings toward him, but obviously it's not going to be everything we want to hear."
Caucus members and White House aides said Mr. Clinton had said little about his own views, preferring to listen. The White House is still trying to decide where Mr. Clinton should deliver his long-promised speech on the issue. Aides said he would give the speech on July 19 somewhere in the Washington area.
Mr. Clinton ordered the review last winter, after Congressional Republicans vowed to scale back preference programs. Several times, the President or top aides suggested that he would prefer to see programs broadly based on redressing economic inequities where possible, and they have described the intent of the review as preserving programs that are necessary and effective while curbing those that are not.
For weeks, the White House suggested that the review might be completed at any time, but delays persisted, and the Administration's position was ultimately both simplified and complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling on June 12 in Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena. In that case, the Court held that any Federal program classifying people by race could be considered constitutional only if it was "narrowly tailored" to serve a compelling governmental interest. The Court had long applied that standard to state affirmative action programs but had given the Federal Government far more leeway.
Under new Justice Department guidelines, the Administration considers programs whose sole rationale is promoting diversity to be legally suspect, and officials have said a number of programs, especially business set-asides that reserve a specific percentage of contracts for minorities, would have trouble passing that test.
Mr. Rangel said it would be politically unwise for the President to back away from a commitment to redressing discrimination. That, he said, would be "a very dangerous thing to do" when Mr. Clinton needs the active support of traditional Democratic constituencies like blacks. "He didn't disagree with that," Mr. Rangel said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Pull Back, With Dow Falling 21.79 Points

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market pulled back yesterday, with many traders taking profits in issues that have had strong run-ups this year.
"It was a drifting market," said Robert N. Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corporation. "Selling was predominant all day, but it wasn't anything major. A real correction would have been a lot more." 
 After the market closed, the Federal Reserve announced that consumer borrowing in May rose at a faster pace than economists had expected. Consumer installment credit gained $11.5 billion for the month, led by heavy credit card use and marking the 24th straight monthly increase. Some analysts believe that this continuing spree might be a sign of economic distress if consumers are borrowing to meet their routine expenses.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.79 points, to 4,680.60.
Most other major indexes also fell, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropping 2.41 points, to 554.78, and the Nasdaq composite index declining 6.41 points, to 970.22. But the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.88 points, to a record high of 509.05.
Declines on the New York Stock Exchange topped advances by 1,332 to 1,045. Big Board turnover fell to 376.8 million shares, from 409.7 million shares on Monday.
Paper stocks, which have jumped almost 33 percent since the end of January, tumbled yesterday. Morgan Stanley downgraded four companies in this industry from a strong buy to outperform. The companies were Mead, off 3 1/8, to 60 1/2; Champion International, off 2 3/4, to 56 1/4; Consolidated Papers, off 1/8, to 59 1/8, and Bowater, off 2 3/8, to 51 1/8. International Paper, which said its second-quarter earnings more than tripled, still came under selling pressure, with its shares dropping 4 1/8, to 86 5/8.
Auto issues also fell, partly attributable to an announcement by Chrysler late Monday that it will take a $143 million after-tax charge against its second-quarter earnings. Chrysler was down 1 1/8, to 48 7/8; Ford was off 5/8, to 32 1/4, and General Motors was off 1 1/4, to 50 1/2.
Many technology stocks, part of a group that has led the stock market for many months, were off yesterday. Advanced Micro Devices reported unexpectedly weak second-quarter profits late Monday and eased 1/4 yesterday, to 34 3/8. Microsoft declined 2 3/8, to 96 1/2; Compaq fell 1 1/8, to 45 7/8, and VMark Software dropped 5 1/8, to 15 5/8. The semiconductor industry's new orders report is scheduled to be released tomorrow.
Brokerage and other financial-services stocks sunk amid losses in the bond market, which pushed the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond to 6.58 percent, from 6.52 percent Monday. A standout was Salomon, which dropped 3 5/8, to 37 1/4, after saying that it anticipates a second-quarter loss of around $65 million.
Some issues bucked the downward trend, however. United Technologies picked up 7/8, to 81 3/8, after Prudential Securities raised its 12-month target price for the stock to $100 from $84. Sensormatic gained 1 1/4, to 25 7/8, following a report by Raymond James that upgraded the issue to a buy from neutral. And Greenbrier, which reported a sharp increase in third-quarter earnings, jumped 2 1/8, to 15.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Net Up 31% At Motorola In 2d Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SCHAUMBURG, Ill., July 11

 BODY:
Motorola Inc. reported today that its net income rose 31 percent in the second quarter, exceeding Wall Street's expectations, and that it had resolved a nagging problem of bulging cellular telephone inventories.
The inventories had constrained earnings earlier in the year, but Motorola said they came into line toward the end of the second quarter. 
 The electronics company said its earnings climbed to $481 million, or 79 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $367 million, or 63 cents a share, a year ago.
Wall Street was looking for 73 cents a share, and the company's stock rose in after-hours trading.
Motorola's shares had closed down $1.875, at $68.375. on the New York Stock Exchange. But after the company released its second-quarter results late this afternoon, the stock jumped as high as $70.50 in after-hours electronic trading.
Sales in the second quarter rose 26 percent, to $6.9 billion, from $5.4 billion in the corresponding period last year.
In its general systems sector, which includes cellular phones, sales jumped 39 percent, to $2.9 billion, and operating profits increased.
"Cellular continued to boom," said John Lazlo, an analyst with Paine Webber. "Shipments were strong, but orders were muted because of the inventory situation. Now that the inventory situation has been corrected, I think you'll see an acceleration in the third and fourth quarters."
Aside from resolving the inventory problem, orders grew rapidly in Asia and Latin America.
Semiconductor segment sales, which have lagged behind in the last few quarters, rebounded, rising 22 percent, to $2.1 billion. Both orders and operating profits increased. Motorola said all major regions showed double-digit growth, led by Europe and Asia-Pacific.
"While robust growth continued in Asia, Europe and Latin America, we began to experience some effects of slower economic expansion in the United States in several of our businesses," Gary Tooker, vice chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
Sales in the messaging, information and media sector rose 24 percent, to $895 million, and orders rose 42 percent. It said order growth for pagers was especially strong in Asia.
"Motorola did well almost across the board, meeting or exceeding expectations," Rakesh Sood, a Hambrecht & Quist analyst, said. "The one area that had less than spectacular results was the land mobile sector, and that should turn around in the second half."
Analysts said they expected to see improved sales in the land mobile unit now that Nextel Communications Inc. had obtained financing and shareholder approval to build its digital wireless network. Motorola's equipment sales to Nextel for the network, they said, could be realized as soon as the second half of the year.

U.S. Treasury Prices Drop On New Data

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices slipped yesterday after new economic data gave traders little incentive to advance an eight-month rally.
The data, the Johnson Redbook weekly report on retail sales, failed to provide evidence that the economy was slowing enough to drive the rate of inflation lower. Traders are waiting for more clues in the Government's report on June producer prices, due out tomorrow, and the report on June consumer prices, scheduled for Friday. 
 Traders were also cautious ahead of a large supply of new corporate securities that was expected this week. The corporate debt could lure a number of buyers away from the Treasury market.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 30/32 of a percentage point, to 11319/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.58 percent from 6.52 percent. The price of the two-year note also fell, driving its yield up to 5.61 percent from 5.54 percent.
"In order to sustain this rally, you need some more weak economic data," said Eric Cheung, who oversees $2.8 billion in fixed-income investments at the Wilmington Trust Corporation.
The Johnson Redbook Service reported yesterday that retail sales in the first week of July were up 7.3 percent, compared with the comparable period a year earlier, and four-tenths of 1 percent compared with last month.
Still, the increase was less than what many analysts had expected. That buttressed some investors' optimism that the bond market rally will soon resume.
"It's clear for the economy to pick up steam the consumer's going to have to get back in, buying not just houses, but other things as well," said Bruce Holmquist, a director at Riggs Investment Management, a Washington firm with $2 billion of bonds. "We don't expect that to happen."
In the corporate market, Nabisco Holdings and the Ford Motor Company sold $1.5 billion of bonds and related securities yesterday amid strong investor demand.
Nabisco sold $400 million of 12-year bonds at a yield of 7.061 percent, or 95 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The sale was the second since an exchange offer that allowed Nabisco to sell its own debt separate from its parent, RJR Nabisco Holdings.
Ford raised $1.1 billion by selling repackaged auto loans with an average maturity of 1.44 years at a yield of 6.018 percent, or 42 basis points more than the comparable Treasury security.
Other companies that sold debt yesterday included American General, Household Bank FSB, Aristar Inc. and the Central Power and Light Company.
Other big offerings are expected this week. The World Bank and the Canadian Government are planning to raise at least $2.5 billion by selling global bonds in the days ahead. The World Bank is expected soon to sell $1.5 billion of 10-year global notes, while Canada is selling at least $1 billion of 10-year global notes as early as today.
Municipal bonds were little changed.
Among yesterday's offerings, the Florida Department of Transportation's sale of $347 million of revenue bonds drew interest from investors seeking discount securities, or bonds priced below their maturity value, because they offer the best chance for gains if rates fall. Bonds maturing in 17 years and more from the Florida sale were priced at an original issue discount.
"They appear to be doing well," said Michele Poirier, who manages about $5 billion in tax-exempt bonds for Nationsbank Investment Management. "Florida paper always trades in a world of its own."

HEADLINE: Taking On the Management;
Irate Guests? No, the Hotel Owners Are Up in Arms

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
The verdict amounted to a loud wake-up call for the hotel industry.
In February, a Federal jury ordered the Stouffer Corporation to pay $7.85 million to the one-time owners of a failed hotel in the Philadelphia suburbs that had been run by Stouffer's hotel management arm from 1987 to 1992. 
 Stouffer attributed the failure to the 1991 recession and the falloff in business travel after the Persian Gulf war. But the owners said it was mostly caused by Stouffer's refusal to lower room rates in the face of stiff new local competition, a refusal tied to a decision to position all 40 properties in the Stouffer chain as luxury hotels. (Stouffer has not yet decided whether to appeal.)
In awarding the big verdict, the jury was putting legal teeth into a trend that has been reshaping the hotel business for several years: shifting power back toward the owners and away from the management companies that have long called the shots. Another lawsuit against a management company, this one involving Ritz-Carlton hotels, could go to trial as early as this fall.
The shift in the hotel industry is producing lessons for many business alliances, particularly national franchise operations, in which the power of the parties is often unequal and the interests and agendas are typically at odds. On a legal level, some industry consultants say, it is a reminder that one party cannot ride roughshod over the other without risking a jury's judgment that such behavior is unfair. On a practical level, they add, it underscores the need for compromise in the face of changing market conditions.
For the last 25 years or so, many owners of hotels have used outside companies to manage their properties, turning to such big-name management chains as Marriott, Hyatt and Sheraton and such relative unknowns as Richfield Hospitality Services and Interstate Hotels. Under such arrangements, the owners not only get to bear the financial risk but typically get virtually no say about staff, marketing strategy -- or room rates. They also get to turn over as much as 5 percent of the gross revenues.
"Management companies told owners, 'You have no right to approve our budgets, our general manager or anything other than to give us more money when we need it,' " said Laurence Geller, a hotel consultant in Chicago.
In return, the owners get a well-trained and experienced staff -- everyone from maids to managers. And for those who use a management chain, they get clout, from a marquee name to a nationwide marketing program and advertising campaign.
The arrangement worked well enough in good times, when the owners were taking in more than enough money to pay the managers' generous fees.
But when the 1991 recession turned on the owners, the owners turned on the management companies, particularly those that seemed to put their own national image ahead of the local needs of the properties they were tending.
The owners started demanding concessions. For one thing, they wanted shorter-term contracts, and they have succeeded in cutting the typical chain management pact in half, to about 10 years.
And they began to whittle down fees, which are now at their lowest rate ever -- as little as 1 percent of revenues, according to Michael Mahoney, a hotel consultant with Coopers & Lybrand in Houston. Some management companies, including Hyatt, have agreed in some cases to tie their fees to a hotel's profits.
"Owners have finally taken smart pills," said Anthony G. Marshall, dean of the School of Hospitality Management at Florida International University in Miami. "Now they're saying, 'If you're so good, why not make your fees based on results.' "
Indeed, many contracts now contain performance provisions "so that an operator can be removed if he doesn't reach certain income levels," said James J. Eyster, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.
To align their interests even further with those of the owners, management companies are increasingly taking equity stakes in properties they manage and even providing loans. In those cases, the contracts typically are longer term.
While much of this turnabout can be attributed to the 1991 recession, the change has been hastened by lawsuits.
In January, for example, in another move that caught the industry's attention, the owners of Ritz-Carlton hotels in New York, Washington, Houston and Aspen, Colo., filed suit against the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, seeking at least $200 million.
The accusations in the suit include mismanaging the hotels, charging excessive fees and misappropriating millions of dollars of the owners' money. Ritz-Carlton, which is owned by W. B. Johnson Property Inc. of Atlanta, has denied the accusations and said the suit was filed by the plaintiffs as a way to hold on to the Ritz-Carlton name, which would otherwise be forfeited if the management agreement was terminated.
Though the suit has not even gone to trial yet -- it is expected to be ready to start in Federal court in Manhattan this fall -- the fact that a company as prominent as Ritz-Carlton was sued has sent shivers through the operators' ranks, industry experts say. In 1992, Ritz-Carlton won a coveted Baldrige award for quality; it remains the only hotel company to win that honor.
But what riveted attention was the February verdict involving the Stouffer Hotel Management Corporation of Solon, Ohio. The plaintiff, U.S. Penn Associates, owner of the Stouffer Valley Forge Hotel in King of Prussia, Pa., had sued for breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and gross negligence.
Under Stouffer's management, the hotel's performance plummeted from a $653,000 profit in 1987 to a $1.4 million loss in 1992 -- the year Citicorp foreclosed on the 289-room hotel because its cash flow was inadequate to pay the mortgage. During that period, Stouffer collected more than $3.5 million in fees and assessments.
The Stouffer Valley Forge, which opened in 1973, was not a luxury hotel, yet Stouffer management steadfastly refused to lower its rates -- even as its occupancy fell after the opening of six hotels in the area in 1987 and 1988, followed by the arrival of Sheraton and Marriott hotels between 1989 and 1991. For much of that period, the rates at Stouffer Valley Forge were consistently higher than the competition.
The hotel's general manager at the time, Varty Arakelian, repeatedly provided his superiors with detailed analyses of room rates at nearby hotels, and pleaded to be allowed to drop his rates to remain competitive, court testimony showed. But Stouffer management just as repeatedly ignored or rebuffed him, according to testimony.
"It was my obligation as a Stouffer's employee to follow orders," Mr. Arakelian said recently. "But I still believe there should have been greater flexibility for Valley Forge, which was a fine hotel but didn't fit with their management philosophy."
Owned since 1973 by Nestle S.A., the giant Swiss food manufacturer, Stouffer sold its hotel operation in April 1993 for an undisclosed sum to New World Ltd., a private Hong Kong company controlled by the Y. T. Cheng family. Hotels still bearing the Stouffer name are part of New World's Renaissance hotel group, which also owns the Ramada name on all but a few Ramada hotels outside North America.
Even before such suits, hotel owners began turning for advice and counsel to consultants and to a new breed, asset managers, who are retained to look over the shoulders of management companies.
"Our responsibility is to make sure the management companies are performing up to the level they promised and that they're keeping expenses down," said Stanley Turkel, a New York-based consultant and a charter member of the recently formed Hotel Asset Managers Association.
Many consultants say that owners are not blameless for their traditional economic impotence. "Neither side is a bunch of choirboys, but nobody held a gun to the owners' head," said David A. Berins, a Dallas consultant. Still, he added, "it's also true that the relationship between owners and operators is more fair now."
An important reason for the historical imbalance, according to Douglas G. Geoga, president of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation, one of the biggest management companies, is that owners in the 1970's and 80's tended to be institutional investors rather than individual entrepreneurs.
"So at a time when everybody was making money, they were not very interested in operating hotels and tended to defer to the judgment of hotel management companies," Mr. Geoga said. "But when times got tougher, owners rightly wanted to get more involved."
Accordingly, Hyatt has since rewritten many of its management contracts, shortening their duration and tying fees to profitability levels. (Hyatt, a private company, does not disclose financial details of its contracts.)
"After taking a chance during the recession that things would get better," Mr. Geoga said, "we're earning rewards from the recent improvement in the hotel industry."
In the first quarter of this year, hotel room revenue nationwide increased 7.5 percent over the corresponding period a year ago and occupancy increased 2.2 percent, according to PKF Consulting.
Meanwhile, the former Stouffer Valley Forge Hotel, which Citicorp is apparently on the verge of selling, received a $3.2 million renovation and reopened last July as the Park Ridge at Valley Forge.
Managed by Benchmark Hospitality of Woodlands, Tex., the property has been repositioned as a conference center during the week (it has 19 conference rooms) and as a hotel for leisure travelers on weekends (it has been slimmed down to 265 guest rooms).
According to Kelly Commerford, its sales director, "The hotel is doing incredibly well."
 
 
 
Who's in Charge Here? Owners Fight to Retain Control of Hotels
 Inside the hotel business, a battle is being waged. The people who own the property are taking on the management companies that often run their hotels. Here are some ways the system is changing to address the owners' concerns.
 
Payments
Management company fees are increasingly based on profits, rather than on revenues, so that management doesn't collect large amounts while owners suffer losses alone.
 
Contracts
Owners can terminate contracts if management companies don't perform, rather than being being tied to contracts that run as long as 40 years, including renewals.
 
Budgets
Owners have a say on staffing matters and in how the operating budget is put together. Before, the owners had little, if any, influence.
 
Equity
Management companies are becoming investors in the hotels, holding as much as 20 percent. Before, they typically held no equity stakes.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Surge as a Drop In Supply Reflects Brisk Demand

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Copper prices surged yesterday after a drop in inventories on the London Metal Exchange showed strong demand in Europe.
Copper for September delivery rose 1.85 cents, to $1.391 a pound on the Commodity Exchange of New York. 
 On other commodity markets, grain and soybean prices advanced. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 0.47 point, to 230.50.
The London Metals Exchange said yesterday that its warehouse stocks of copper fell 2,000 tons, while the Commodity Exchange said its stocks were unchanged.
The Federal Reserve Board's recent interest rate cut, along with matching moves in Japan, Canada and other countries, is renewing demand for base metals, the raw materials used in construction and manufacturing, said Fred Demler, an analyst at E.D.& F. Man International Inc. in New York.
"We've got particularly strong demand in Europe and the Far East and we still have another -- if history is any guide -- three years of worldwide expansion to go," Mr. Demler said. "That points to spot world shortages of the metal."
Short-term supplies have been unexpectedly tight this year, in part because of production problems at mines in Chile, Canada and the United States. That has driven prices up to six-year highs.
Prices also advanced after large gaps separated nearby contract prices from cash prices, a further indication of supply tightness, said Bernard Savaiko, an analyst with Paine Webber.
Grain and soybean prices advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors bet crops would be damaged by extremely hot weather and too little rain.
Wheat futures for July delivery rose 9.75 cents, to $4.24 a bushel. July corn rose 2.75 cents, to $2.80 a bushel. July oats rose 0.75 cent, to $1.5175 a bushel, and July soybeans rose 4 cents, to $6.1125 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Borrowing By Consumers Continues Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing rose for the 24th consecutive month in May, led by strong credit card use, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Consumer installment credit rose $11.51 billion for the month, exceeding analysts' expectations. In April, borrowing rose a revised $11.6 billion. A month earlier, the Fed initially estimated April consumer credit rose $11 billion. 
 Before today's report, analysts anticipated a $9 billion increase in consumer credit for May.
The Fed also said that consumer installment credit was rising at a 14.6 percent annual rate in May following a 14.9 percent gain during April.
Analysts are divided about the meaning of the prolonged surge in borrowing. Some say it could be a sign of distress if consumers borrow more to meet routine expenses. Others, though, say it may simply be signaling a shift in habits, as people find it more convenient to charge daily purchases like groceries on credit cards.
Still, analysts said the borrowing spree could not go on forever. "This credit trend should prove unsustainable," said a research report by Gary Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I.
Statistics in the latest Fed report were revised back to January 1992. Without those revisions, May's gain would have been the 30th consecutive monthly increase.
Analysts pay particular attention to the Fed's credit statistics because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of United States economic activity. In May, spending rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, according to Commerce Department figures published last week.
But the consumer credit numbers tend to be erratic on a month-to-month basis, and analysts said the statistics should be viewed cautiously over the short haul.
In today's report, the Fed said installment credit totaled $956.822 billion in May. By category, revolving, or credit card, use showed the biggest increase, rising $6.636 billion in May.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Broad-Based Gain As German Rate Cut Is Expected

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar climbed against most leading currencies yesterday, buoyed by expectations that the German central bank would soon cut interest rates.
The dollar was also bolstered by concerns about possible political turmoil in Russia after reports that President Boris N. Yeltsin had fallen ill. Mr. Yeltsin, 64, was hospitalized with what his spokesman described as "acute" heart pains. Doctors said he had had an attack of ischemia, which means that the heart is not getting all the oxygenated blood it needs. 
 While the German mark is typically the traders' choice as the safe-haven currency in times of politial turmoil, the mark was considered vulnerable because of Germany's proximity to Russia. As a result, the dollar surged against the mark.
"The Yeltsin situation has caused a flight to the quality of dollars," said Karl Halligan, vice president of strategic trading at CIC Bank New York.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was supported by lingering concern that the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan could stage another coordinated dollar-buying spree. The two central banks caught many investors by surprise Friday when they bought dollars for yen as the dollar was rising.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.4065 marks from 1.3949 marks on Monday. The dollar rose to 87.54 yen from 86.88 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5876 from $1.5939.
The recent advance by the dollar could accelerate if the Bundesbank lowers interest rates this week, traders said. The Bundesbank's policy-setting council meets tomorrow . The central bank said yesterday that it would hold a news conference after the meeting, which is its last before a four-week recess.
Both the Fed and the Bank of Japan trimmed overnight loan rates late last week, and many traders expect the German central bank will follow suit.
"It's more a question of timing than anything else," said Cynthia Johnson, vice president of foreign exchange at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in New York. "Are they going to do it now, or after their summer vacation?"
Many traders said they expected at the least that the Bundesbank would trim the 14-day securities repurchase rate. The Bundesbank last cut the rate, to 4.5 percent from 4.51 percent, on June 7. The discount rate, which acts as the floor for German money market rates, was cut to a six-year low of 4 percent on March 30.
Lower German interest rates would hurt the mark against the dollar by making mark-denominated deposits less attractive.

HEADLINE: Microbrewery With Big Plans Opens in Hong Kong

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
DAVID TOLLIDAY-WRIGHT bellied up to the wooden bar, squinted at a beetle-brown bottle with an unfamiliar label -- Crooked Island Ale, it said -- and watched as a reddish, pale liquid was caressed by a bartender into a tall glass. Mr. Tolliday-Wright moved the glass to the light, dim as it was, humphed theatrically, lifted the glass to his lips and inhaled a mouthful of foamy brew.
Silence.
"Eh," he said, the words gradually forming. "Not bad. It's not bad, not bad at all." 
 For only the third time in 154 years, Hong Kong has a new locally produced beer, a beer brewed at a microbrewery with the sort of craft brewing that has swept the United States but just taken its first steps in Asia. For as long as anyone can remember, only two beers have been made here: by San Miguel, the Philippines' largest brewer, and Carlsberg, a Danish company with a typically Danish advertising slogan -- "Perhaps the best beer in the world."
Like many of Asia's major cities, where wheeling and dealing are the life blood of daily life, Hong Kong witnesses evening stampedes of the business-suited and skirted to the local bars. Whether in Manila or Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur or here in Hong Kong, the admixture of intense work and sweltering climates drives people into bars and pubs. And an icy foaming brew, often from Australia, England, Germany or Holland, is usually the drink of choice, especially for expatriates and visitors.
"I was drinking a beer in a pub and said to a friend, 'What we really need here is a microbrewery,' " David K. Haines, a native of Colorado, recalled. "Everybody just laughed. I started drawing labels on coasters."
That was 18 months ago. Today, Mr. Haines, a clinical psychologist by training and beer lover by profession, is bottling the first Crooked Island Ale, the product of his new South China Brewing Company.
"I'd been here for about three years," Mr. Haines explained. "My wife and I came from Vail, and I was working as a psychologist. She's a China analyst at Jardine Matheson, so she makes enough money for both of us. She said, 'Go for it.' "
So Mr. Haines decided to find out about microbreweries. "I went around the United States tasting beer, visiting microbreweries, talking to people about beer," Mr. Haines said. As things happened, he found himself at a dinner with Peter Bordeaux, the president of the Sazerac Company, a major American distributor of alcoholic beverages. "We started talking," Mr. Haines recalled. "He asked lots of questions. And after a while, he agreed to help finance this idea."
With money in hand, mostly provided by Sazerac, all that remained was to surmount Hong Kong's bureaucracy, more efficient than those of most Asian countries but finely layered, like a well-made mille-feuille. "When I started calling government people, they all laughed," Mr. Haines said. "They said: 'You want to start a brewery? You can't do this.' Well, I went ahead and applied. There was all kinds of red tape. It took about a year, but we finally got approval."
Sitting behind a worn wooden desk from Indonesia, Mr. Haines waved a piece of paper with a crimson seal at the top. "Here it is," he said, "the right to brew beer."
On the second floor of the Vita Tower in the industrial Aberdeen district of Hong Kong, hundreds of white sacks filled with malt, 40,000 pounds in all; a room filled with 150,000 brown bottles; huge mirror-shiny steel vats; pumps, and filters make up the innards of South China Brewing. Up a ladder, Ed Tringali, the company's brewing consultant, was stirring malt with a huge wooden paddle as it poured into the mash tun, a massive kettle filled with hot water. From this first mix comes wort, which is pumped into the brew kettle, and the first steps of the company's brewing are under way. From speakers on the walls pumped the sound track from "Pulp Fiction."
"There are more than 500 microbreweries in the United States," said Mr. Tringali, who most recently worked in Seattle at the Big Time microbrewery, which is the source of the yeast for Crooked Island Ale. Now, he plans to travel through Asia and to help formulate brews for the burgeoning microbrewery industry here.
"There are two or three micros in Japan, but that's about it right now," Mr. Tringali said. "It'll definitely go pretty big. Next week, I'm leaving for Manila to help San Miguel open up a micro." Even before the first Hong Konger sipped the first Crooked Island Ale -- named for one of the islands that make up Hong Kong -- South China Brewing was making plans to issue $6 million in stock on the Vancouver stock exchange to finance startup microbreweries in Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan. The offering is planned for next month. "It's all being researched right now," Mr. Haines said. "We want to be the biggest international microbrewer."
But making beer in Hong Kong, a place known more for Genghis Khan-like developers and gut-wrenching property prices, yachts in sea-borne traffic jams and Cognac-soaked banquets, is odd enough to raise eyebrows. One set that perked up belongs to David Chan, who owns the Royal Castle Pub in Tuen Mun, a burgeoning town in the New Territories.
Clutching a clipboard, beeper hooked on his belt, Mr. Chan walked into the brewery even before it opened. "I own a small pub," he explained to Mr. Haines, who was eyeing the mixing of the malt. "I saw this mentioned in a magazine and wanted to come by." Mr. Haines found a glass mug, washed it out and filled it from a brew kettle. A medium-dark, slightly cloudy liquid with a head of tannish foam filled the mug. Mr. Chan scrutinized the liquid, took a sip, and then another.
"That's good," he pronounced, "but I would prefer a taste that is not so strong. I'd say that 70 percent of the people who come into my bar drink beer, but for Chinese people, they prefer a beer that is not too strong."
Crooked Ale's creator took his visitor's address, but afterward said he was not optimistic about selling to the Royal Castle. "We're looking at a higher socio-economic end, which means mostly the people who go to bars in the main business districts," Mr. Haines said.
"We're looking at connoisseurs who enjoy beer," he continued. "We're looking at expats, people who go to high-end bars. We're looking at tourists. We think the tourist market is going to be big."
On opening day last week, Mr. Haines delivered 15 cases of Crooked Island Ale to a pub called Mad Dog's, down the street from the San Lo Shu noodle shop and across from the Hang Seng Bank on D'Aguilar Street. Nervously, he and his team of brewers stood around the bar rail, waiting for the regulars.
Finally, the hefty Mr. Tolliday-Wright, a local barrister, arrived. "I'm a lawyer," he declared to one and all. "I have no interest whatsoever in the law. I'm interested in beer." ) He maneuvered toward his favorite corner, overseen by a Richard Caton Woodville print titled "Saving the Guns at the Battle of Maiwand."
"We need a new brewery," he said after his second Crooked Island Ale. "It's a really good idea. We need a different type of brew. We need an ale to compete with the usual lagers."
Steven Pinn, a Scot whose brogue was uncracked by Hong Kong's heat, was managing the pub that evening and keeping a shrewd eye on the goings-on. "I think it will be difficult to break in," he said of the new ale. "You're dealing with some very big guys -- Carlsberg, San Miguel, Foster's. It's quite difficult to get people to change their ideas about what beer is."
Part of the problem is the relatively steep price of a bottle of Crooked Ale, nearly $6, or $45 Hong Kong. "A lot of people's decision is based on price," Mr. Pinn explained, and the mass market brews, Carlsberg and San Miguel, sell for less: about $4.60, or $35 Hong Kong. "But still, the younger crowd is much easier to influence," he added. "We will see how it goes."
Mr. Haines patrolled the bar, his ears perked for the comments of patrons who were sampling the beer -- at an introductory offer of two for the price of one. "I'm happy," he exuded. "This is going to be great."

Raiders' Move Is Approved

 BODY:
After 13 years in Los Angeles, the Raiders are being welcomed back to Oakland, Calif., with near unanimity. The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted by 5-0 yesterday to approve the deal that would make the Raiders the first American team to return to its roots. The Oakland City Council gave its seal of approval last night, 9-0.
"It is an economic shot in the arm and one that is symbolic of good things to come," said Councilwoman SHEILA JORDAN, who had been a critic of a failed 1990 deal for the Raiders' return. 
 The city and county voted to approve a 16-year agreement with the Raiders' owner, AL DAVIS, and to issue up to $225 million in bonds to pay for stadium modernization, including the 175 luxury boxes Davis covets.
If the deal goes ahead as planned, it will become final on Aug. 10 -- two days before the Raiders are scheduled to play host to the St. Louis Rams in a preseason game between Los Angeles runaways. (AP)

HEADLINE: Why Are Lawyers Taking Over the Country?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Law School Cartel" (editorial, July 7): I'm neither familiar with nor particularly interested in the American Bar Association's law school pay structure cartel. There are more serious problems with a profession that has come to dominate civil discourse and institutional leadership in the United States. 
 The United States, with 5 percent of the world's population, is home to three-quarters of the planet's lawyers. One-third of this nation's legal billings take place on Manhattan Island. We now have law firms the size of major corporate headquarters.
Somewhere along the way, a law degree and admission to the bar became the management credential for industry, commerce, finance, government, academic and medical leadership. No one else need apply.
Why are master's degrees in business, public or health administration offered? How does the proliferation of lawyers impact our judicial system or assist or retard our global economic competitiveness?
Here in New York, a city given its birth by a harbor it no longer uses, and not long ago the nation's manufacturing center, we have over the past two decades added new law schools while closing engineering schools, the latter integral to our position as a center of industry.
Not a single major marine, rail, air, trucking or freight-forwarding company any longer calls New York City home. The commercial and investment banks, securities firms and insurance companies that we have based our city and region's livelihoods on are shrinking.
They are often headed by lawyers. The publicly funded voluntary medical centers and private universities and colleges, which have become our economic generators and chief employers, are too often headed by members of the legal profession to the exclusion of others.

HEADLINE: OPENING TO VIETNAM: IN CALIFORNIA;
For Many of Those Who Fled Vietnam, a Day of Sadness, Anger and Hope

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: WESTMINSTER, Calif., July 11

 BODY:
For Yen Do, editor of the largest Vietnamese-language daily in America, the establishment today of diplomatic relations between Hanoi and Washington marks the end of a half century of war that has tortured his nation and scattered two million of its people around the world.
It welcomes Vietnam into the community of nations, opens new possibilities for its economic development and may help efforts to foster democracy and human rights after 20 years of Communist rule, said Mr. Yen, who edits Nguoi Viet Daily News here in the community known as Little Saigon, 30 miles south of Los Angeles. 
 But for Mr. Yen and many of his fellow refugees, the day was nevertheless colored by sadness, symbolically laying to rest the homeland they fought for, whose yellow-and-red flag is still flown by overseas Vietnamese groups.
"It is something like a pair of lovers who know it is time to leave each other," he said. "Reasonably, rationally, they know the time has come, but emotionally it is hard to accept."
Among many overseas Vietnamese, the sadness found expression in angry words.
"I feel very angry and bitter, but then, it's very clear that business interests have been put in front of human rights," said Diem Do, who has been a leading opponent of normalized relations in the highly fragmented emigre community.
Tran Van Ngoc, past president of the Vietnamese Air Force Veterans Association, said he saw the move as a cynical attempt to use Vietnam once again as a geopolitical pawn against Chinese expansion.
Mai Cong, who heads the Vietnamese Community of Orange County, a private social and cultural agency here, issued a statement saying, "It is as if a decisive step has been taken to sever us from the past, or from any lingering attachment with the past, even though the past only means war and misery for many of us."
She added: "There may be joy in Hanoi, but there certainly will be no celebrations in Little Saigon."
And on Little Saigon Radio, which interrupted its Vietnamese-language broadcasts to carry President Clinton's announcement live this morning, the news was immediately followed by interviews with non-Vietnamese opponents of normalization, who said things like, "I truly believe that this is one of the blackest days in the history of America."
In the three hours following the announcement, 32 callers to an open line at the radio station opposed the reestablishment of relations, while just 13 supported it, said Trang Nguyen, president of Little Saigon TV and Radio.
Since the fall of Saigon in April 1975, some 800,000 refugees have fled to the United States, many clustering in Vietnamese communities like this one where the question of whether to open business and diplomatic contacts with Hanoi created sometimes violent divisions but also helped to define emigre politics and discourse.
For years, right-wing groups collected donations for a fantasy guerrilla war that would succeed where the Americans had failed. Journalists and others who advocated improved relations with Vietnam were attacked and, on a handful of occasions, were killed.
Opposition to improved relations with Hanoi has been kept alive by the recent arrival of about 10,000 former labor camp prisoners, mostly elderly men whose lives have been consumed by the war and its harsh aftermath and who could be counted on to join anti-Communist demonstrations here.
But in recent years, particularly after President Clinton lifted a trade embargo in February 1994, an increasing flood of emigre Vietnamese tourists and entrepreneurs has visited Vietnam, crossing paths with the final trickle of postwar refugees.
Twenty years after Saigon's fall -- and 50 years after the start of the war against the colonial French government that preceded Washington's involvement -- many Vietnamese here say the passage of history has made the debate over normalization as anachronistic as the continuing departure of refugees.
"I think it is good that we finally can put everything behind us and move ahead, and for the community to concentrate on the problems at hand," said Le Kim Dinh, a journalist and writer.
There are signs that that might be happening. On Monday, on the eve of Mr. Clinton's announcement, 10 groups from among the many feuding emigre factions signed a resolution urging Washington to press Hanoi on two substantive issues that overseas Vietnamese agree on: democratization and human rights.
And in a signal that they might leave their political isolation and join mainstream politics, the groups also called for strong action on an issue of greater interest to non-Vietnamese Americans: the search for missing American servicemen.
Mr. Yen said he foresaw other benefits from normalized diplomatic relations. Many former South Vietnamese officials and high-ranking military men who feared revisiting Vietnam may now feel safe in doing so.
In addition, he said, today's announcement could result in the freeing of some political prisoners who have been held because of Hanoi's fears of outside threats.
Some other Vietnamese-Americans were aggressively eager to move ahead both with their integration into American society and their business ventures in Vietnam.
Frank Jao, a leading developer who owns much of the property in Little Saigon and is exploring business opportunities in Vietnam, rejected any talk of the past.
"Speaking in the context of being an American businessman -- nothing to do with Vietnamese-American, because I am no longer a Vietnamese -- it's good for the United States," he said of today's developments.

HEADLINE: New York's Haunted Houses

BYLINE: By Patrick McGrath; Patrick McGrath, co-editor of the anthology "The New Gothic," is author of the forthcoming novel "Asylum."

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki of New York is expected to sign a bill that will please real estate agents, stifle writers of horror stories and shed light on a strange current of medieval thought that has never been purged from the American psyche.
The legislation, passed by the State Senate and Assembly, would exempt realtors from having to disclose if a property they are selling has a stigma, that is, if it is haunted or if some ghastly catastrophe -- a suicide or gruesome murder -- has ever occurred there. 
 More than half the states have such laws on the books. This is a serious matter because the property tends to be harder to sell once it is known to have a nasty history. This simple economic truth explains why the Legislature wants to let the real estate industry triumph over advocates of the buyer's right to know.
That there should be so many properties with macabre histories as to make the legislation necessary says something about violence in America. In Britain, where I grew up, a house with a stigma tends to be a rarity and, as a result, may command a higher price. The British love a juicy murder, particularly if it was committed in their own home and they can boast about it to the neighbors.
More intriguing is what all this tells us about consumer psychology in the real estate market in the United States. If a house becomes less desirable once it is known that a grisly event occurred there, the belief must be widespread among prospective buyers that such an event leaves a sort of malignant spiritual residue and that that residue will blight the lives of future occupants.
This is bizarre. In almost all areas of their lives, Americans explain the world in ways that are more or less based on scientific rationality. But rationality seems to break down when we encounter phenomena that smack of "evil." Then it's as if our post-Enlightenment habits of mind are peeled away and more primitive forms of thinking take over.
Writers of horror stories could not make a living if this were not the case. They rely on the pleasure created by stimulating the brain's superstition centers. This typically involves descriptions of horrible things happening without rational explanation in sinister buildings where equally horrible things happened in the past. Those events usually leave left behind exactly the sort of malignant energies that home buyers attribute to a house with a stigma.
The simple pleasures to be had from such tales of terror do not, of course, provoke people to commit unspeakable acts. Entering into a fantasy is a form of play, a safe and innocent discharge of suppressed emotion. Problems arise only when superstitious thinking exerts influence in the real world, as when people lose money because their house is thought to be haunted.
What the real estate lobby has asked Governor Pataki to do is defend it against a streak of irrationality that is more deeply ingrained in the American psyche than is the instinct for commerce.
Realtors will celebrate if he signs the bill allowing them to keep a house's past a secret. But the rest of America will find that one conduit to the messy, monster-ridden collective unconscious has been obscured lest it inhibit the business of selling houses to people who can't be trusted to manage their own superstitious proclivities.

HEADLINE: Two Exchanges Plan a Move Across the Hudson

 BODY:
The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange said yesterday that they intended to shift their trading operations to Jersey City, in a move that could transfer more than 5,000 jobs out of New York City.
The two commodities exchanges, which have signed a letter of intent with the state of New Jersey, said they planned to build a nine-story, 275,000-square-foot building adjacent to Jersey City's Exchange Place financial district, which they planned to occupy by the second quarter of 1998. 
 They said the incentives offered by New Jersey and Jersey City to move from New York were too attractive to turn down.
Carl Golden, a spokesman for Governor Christine Todd Whitman, said the New Jersey Economic Development Authority offered an incentive package worth $17 million to offset the cost of construction, estimated at $115 million. In addition, Jersey City offered the exchanges a sharp savings on the property taxes for the next 15 years, charging them 2 percent a year on the construction, or $2.3 million, rather than the standard rate, which currently would have run about $4.6 million.
Brian Kelly, chairman of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, said New York City could not match the New Jersey offer.
Mr. Kelly said the exchange's present trading floor at 4 World Trade Center in lower Manhattan was overcrowded and obsolete. The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange now shares a 25,000-square-foot trading floor with the Cotton Exchange and its subsidiary, the New York Futures Exchange, as well as the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange of New York.
"We have to do what we see is best for the exchange, the membership and our clearing members," Mr. Kelly said.
The New York Futures Exchange is also planning to move to the Jersey City building.
New York City officials could not be reached for comment last night. Last year, the city tried to include the two exchanges in a deal it reached with the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange to keep those exchanges from moving to New Jersey.
Those exchanges will be relocating from 4 World Trade Center to new offices in Battery Park City. They received a package of incentives from the city and state, including $125 million in capital construction money and tax abatements worth $43 million.
About 5,300 people are directly or indirectly employed by the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the Cotton Exchange.

HEADLINE: China Is Insisting Clinton Reaffirm One-China Policy

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 12

 BODY:
Delivering its first outline of "practical steps" to begin thawing its relations with the United States, the Chinese Government said today that President Clinton should reaffirm that there is only one China and that Taiwan is part of China, and declare that Taiwan's President will not be allowed to make any more visits to the United States.
A senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official, speaking on the condition that he not be identified, cited a restoration of the status quo on Taiwan before last month, when its President was allowed to visit the United States, as a minimum requirement for Washington before another high-level meeting between the two countries could be held. 
 Such a meeting could take place, Chinese officials said, as early as the end of this month, when Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, go to Brunei for a regional security forum convened by Southeast Asian countries.
American officials have reaffirmed the "one China" policy in recent days, and President Clinton could do the same without risking serious political damage. But a declaration that the Taiwan President was no longer welcome in the United States would be seen as an admission of error, and could well be unacceptable to the President and to the Republican-controlled Congress, which pressed Mr. Clinton to allow the Taiwanese visit.
The senior Foreign Ministry official did not specify any actions Beijing might take to meet American concerns, which center on China's human rights record and trade issues. But Chinese officials hinted for the first time that the American human rights campaigner Harry Wu, detained on June 19 as he entered China and charged with espionage last Saturday, could be released after the conclusion of a formal investigation.
One official urged Americans to be patient in allowing the investigation to be completed before pressing for Mr. Wu's release.
A second official, also speaking on the condition he not be identified, said today that China had followed an unwritten policy of not imprisoning Americans charged with carrying out illegal political activities inside China.
Though Chinese officials have taken pains to say Mr. Wu's case is in the hands of the authorities in central Hubei Province, these statements today indicate that the strong outcry in the United States over Mr. Wu's arrest is beginning to have an impact on the Chinese leadership.
But it also seems clear that the case of Mr. Wu has handed the Chinese leadership a high-value bargaining chip to use to force Washington to reaffirm its commitments on Taiwan's status.
The Foreign Ministry official's remarks appear to signal a Chinese willingness to find a way out of the crisis that has undermined constructive communication between Washington and Beijing and has threatened to spill over to the rapidly developing trade and economic relationship between the United States and China.
The official acknowledged that there were powerful voices within the circle of Chinese leaders that viewed American intentions toward China as increasingly hostile, and he said these voices would only grow in strength if a new diplomatic accommodation cannot be reached.
Still, he said, Beijing insists that President Clinton take the first step.
The Clinton Administration's decision to admit President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan reversed 16 years of Washington policy and infuriated Beijing, which regards itself as the sole legal government of Taiwan.
Chinese officials said Washington should reaffirm the American commitment to the three joint communiques that form the bedrock of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, beginning with the 1972 Shanghai Communique negotiated during President Nixon's first visit to China.
Each of these communiques affirms that the Beijing Government is the sole legal government of China and that Taiwan is part of China.
Communist Party leaders say Mr. Clinton's decision to reverse policy and allow President Lee's private visit to attend a reunion at Cornell University last month has undermined the communiques.
"If the American administration knew that Lee Teng-hui was seeking to create the image of two Chinas, or one China and one Taiwan, and still allowed him to visit the United States, this indicates that the United States has changed it policy toward China," an official said.
The Foreign Ministry official also said Washington should reaffirm that only one China can be seated at the United Nations.
Taiwan is seeking international support to regain the United Nations seat it lost to the People's Republic of China in 1971. But China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, can veto any proposal to seat Taiwan.
[The State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said today: "We have made abundantly clear from the President on down for the past several months that we have a one-China policy and that we recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole representative of the Chinese people."
[Regarding Taiwan, Mr. Burns said, "We've also made it very clear that on the subject of Taiwan we will retain unofficial relations only. We will not change that policy, and we have assured the Chinese Government to that effect."
[A senior State Department official said, "I doubt very much there will be many visas forthcoming for Taiwan's President or other senior Taiwanese officials. We've always said we would do this on a case-by-case basis only."]
But China appeared to be demanding a more elaborate statement, especially on the question of the future access of Taiwan's leader to America.
"Since the President made the decision for Lee Teng-hui to visit the United States," the Chinese Foreign Ministry official said, "the President should make a statement. The statement should be clear about the commitment the United States has made in the three Sino-U.S. communiques, and it should say that the United States doesn't allow Lee Teng-hui to visit the United States."

Wu's Wife Urges Protest
 WASHINGTON, July 12 (AP) -- The wife of an American human rights campaigner imprisoned in China suggested today that Hillary Rodham Clinton turn down an invitation to a women's conference in China in protest.
The White House said no decision had been made on whether Mrs. Clinton would attend the United Nations International Woman's Conference in September. Mrs. Clinton is the honorary chairwoman of the United States delegation.
Ching Lee Wu, the wife of Harry Wu, said she was generally pleased with efforts being made to win her husband's release. "They are all concerned about Harry very much," she said after meeting with the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, at the White House.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
White mortgage applicants with bad credit histories were only half as likely to be rejected for loans as black or Hispanic applicants with similar credit records, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago concluded in a study released today.
But the report, the latest effort by Government experts to measure bias in lending practices, did not find that discrimination by banks was widespread in all circumstances. Black and Hispanic applicants with good credit histories were about as likely as white applicants with comparable records to receive bank approvals for mortgages, the study found. 
 And while the study found statistical evidence that banks are reluctant to issue mortgages to unmarried people, it did not find that banks discriminate between men and women.
The new study was harshly criticized by commercial bankers and conservative economists, who have spent considerable time and money during the last few years trying to discredit an earlier research effort that found broad evidence of lending bias against minorities.
Still, the study's results are the latest evidence that the financial system's regulators -- including those working for the stolid Federal Reserve -- are moving toward greater concern about lending and other social issues affecting disadvantaged sectors of society, even as Republicans in Congress have moved in the other direction.
The study by the Chicago Fed involved a re-analysis of 1,991 mortgage applications in the Boston area in 1990. Those applications also provided much of the basis of a 1992 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which found a pattern in which banks approved fewer mortgages for black and Hispanic applicants.
Bankers have responded that the Boston study, which compared overall mortgage approval rates for white applicants with overall rates for black and Hispanic applicants, should have taken more complete account of differences in creditworthiness among the individual applicants. The Boston Fed has repeatedly denied this.
The latest study tried to compare applicants of different races who had similar credit histories. When the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago looked at mortgage applicants who were 60 or more days overdue on one or more other debts, it found that only 9 percent of the white applicants were disapproved, compared with 18 percent of the black and Hispanic applicants.
James H. Chessen, the chief economist at the American Bankers Association, a trade group based here, said that he still believed the study was flawed because of wide variations among applicants even with similar overall credit records. He also objected to the Chicago Fed's use of the 1990 data.
"It's the continuing saga of trying to beat up the banking industry," he said. "What's incredibly frustrating is that bankers are working every day to make sure there is not even inadvertent discrimination."
William C. Hunter, the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the author of today's study, said that the results pointed more to a cultural gap between white loan officers and minority applicants than to overt racism. The finding that black and Hispanic mortgage applicants with marginal credit histories were rejected more often that whites with similar problems on their records suggested that loan officers, most of whom are white, are more willing to extend themselves for white applicants, Mr. Hunter said.
"It may be unconscious; they just may make an extra call; they know where the person works or where they live," Mr. Hunter said. The same loan officer might not make this extra effort for a minority applicant, he added,possibly because a white loan officer might be less likely to know the neighbors or employers of black applicants.
The study's conclusions echoed those remarks: "These findings are consistent with the existence of a cultural affinity between white lending officers and white applicants, and a cultural gap between white loan officers and marginal minority applicants."
The Chicago Fed's findings are certain to fuel an already vigorous debate on Capitol Hill over Republican efforts to weaken Federal laws that require banks to lend money to minorities and residents of low-income neighborhoods. The House Banking Committee approved such a bill two weeks ago, but its fate on the House floor is unclear because of a dispute about unrelated provisions concerning the insurance industry.
Bankers have never forgiven Alicia Munnell, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, for her role in writing the Boston Fed study when she was there. Heavy lobbying by bankers prompted the Administration to cancel plans two weeks ago to nominate Ms. Munnell to the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates banks, and instead nominate her for the Council of Economic Advisers, which does not regulate banks and is in danger of extinction because of Republican budget cuts.
Neither the Boston study nor the one released today contained specific recommendations. But the research has been cited by the Clinton Administration to support vigorous enforcement of fair-lending laws and to oppose Republican proposals to weaken the laws.
Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, one of the chief deputy Democratic whips in charge of gathering votes for floor fights, said that today's report "is another overwhelming argument to derail this misguided legislation."

Newcomers Flood Brazil Interior: Count the Pools

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: RIBEIRAO PRETO, Brazil

 BODY:
With its swimming pools, shopping malls, freeways and suburbia sprawling to the edges of orange groves, this booming region cannot shake its press label: "California brasileira."
"It wasn't so great," said Gilberto S. Maggioni, president of the local chamber of commerce, grimacing when reminded of the first newspaper comparison a few years back to an American state that Brazilians revere as the promised land. "That 'California brasileira' talk only brought us an enormous amount of migrants." 
 With high-rise apartment buildings popping like mushrooms out of old coffee fields, this city boasts living standards on a par with Southern Europe. Virtually all households have running water and sewerage systems. Three-quarters of families have a telephone and a car. The Mayor, a member of Brazil's left-wing Workers Party, estimates that only 2 percent of the city's half a million people live in shantytowns.
Hardly a middle-class oasis in a sea of poverty, this flourishing city is part of a broader economic boom that is transforming the interior of Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest state.
Reversing a decades-old trend, the state capital has seen its share of the state economic pie slip to less than one-half today, from two-thirds 25 years ago.
The economic rise of mid-sized interior cities like Ribeirao Preto, Bauru and Campinas is dashing Sao Paulo's dream -- or nightmare -- of one day overtaking Mexico City to become the largest metropolis in the Americas. During the 1980's, as job-seekers started to shun Sao Paulo for the booming interior cities, the population of the state capital grew by only 13 percent, while the interior's population grew by 33 percent.
"People follow jobs," said Antonio Vicente Golfeto, director of the Maurilio Biagi Economic Institute, a private center here. Noting that Ribeirao Preto's population had doubled since 1975, he added, "Sao Paulo now is losing population."
The Mayor here, Antonio Palocci Filho, said: "Ten years ago, the trend was to go to Sao Paulo. Now, people are going to interior centers."
If the interior of Sao Paulo State were a nation, it would have a gross national product larger than Poland's -- and half of Poland's population.
Flourishing 200 miles down a four-lane divided highway from the state capital, Ribeirao Preto flaunts a California-style affluence as obvious as the dealerships selling 13 different makes of imported cars. Bringing an American symbol to a hot, land-locked region, local franchisers are building a $15 million Wet'n Wild amusement park here.
"Most of our clients are first-time pool buyers," said Paulo Sergio de Oliveira, manager of Centerglass, a local swimming pool store.
In August, Mr. Oliveira will open a new store with four times the floor space across from Ribeirao Shopping, a middle-class temple of commerce with 159 shops, a dozen fast-food restaurants and South America's largest bowling alley. Part of the Brunswick chain of the United States, the bowling alley echoed on a recent night with rock videos and the collisions of balls and pins.
"I prefer Ribeirao to Sao Paulo," said Aline Cristina Moreira Quintana, a blue-jeaned 15-year-old, who was bowling with a group of friends. "Here, you have more freedom. You can go out at night without worrying about being mugged."
Two lanes away, Jose Guilherme Perticarrari, a sugar chemist, was bowling with his in-laws. He said interior cities were magnets for migrants because of their high quality of life: low crime, low pollution, low traffic and a wealth of jobs. A resident of another interior city, Piracicaba, he said, "The majority out here are middle class -- two cars in the garage."
Only four hours by truck from the capital, Ribeirao Preto is the center of a region that produces 70 percent of Brazil's orange juice and 30 percent of its sugar cane alcohol fuel. This agricultural wealth has brought secondary booms in banking, construction and university education.
In 1993, Simonsen Associados, a consulting firm, surveyed business conditions in all of Brazil's cities with populations over 150,000. Of the top 10, 7 were in Sao Paulo State, according to the survey, published in Brazil's leading business magazine, Exame. Ribeirao Preto came in third, after Bauru and Campinas.
At Ribeirao Preto's airport, passenger demand has been so strong that destinations served from here tripled over the last five years to 15. With the airport now ranking as Brazil's busiest interior airport, two new airlines are starting service here this year and the authorities are planning to double the terminal's size next year.
"Any destination we have added from Ribeirao has always found passengers," said Eduardo Jose A. Tao, local manager for TAM, the principal airline serving the city. "Sao Paulo is strangled by an enormous number of flights, so people look for alternatives."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
China Gives Big Van Deal To Mercedes

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 12

 BODY:
Snubbing American car manufacturers and fueling suspicion that China would make American industry pay for the diplomatic dispute with Washington, China today gave a much-coveted $1 billion contract to Mercedes-Benz of Germany
The decision to award what is one of the biggest automotive deals in China was announced as President Jiang Zemin, on a four-day visit to Germany, toured the Mercedes plant in Sindelfingen, about 100 miles south of here. 
 Mercedes, a unit of Daimler-Benz, beat out Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company for a project to make as many as 60,000 mini-vans and 100,000 engines a year in the southern city of Nanfeng.
The Government also awarded Mercedes a $50 million joint-venture contract to make buses in China.
"The signing of the agreement is a giant leap into the Chinese market and convincing proof of faith in our company," said Helmut Werner, the chairman of Mercedes.
And on Thursday, when the Chinese President is in Bonn meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he is also likely to announce that China has awarded Siemens A.G., the electronics and industrial conglomerate, contracts to develop power stations and airports that could be worth more than $1 billion in total.
Chinese officials asserted that the decision to choose Mercedes and Siemens had nothing to do with the political tension rising between China and the United States after Washington granted permission to the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, to visit Cornell University last month and continuing criticism was heard in the United States of Chinese human rights violations.
"The failure of the two U.S. companies to win the bid in China was the result of commercial reasons rather than Chinese restrictions against U.S. business in the country," a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Shen Guofang, was quoted as saying by the official New China News Agency. "The Chinese Government has put great emphasis on developing trade and economic relations with other countries."
Analysts, though, were not readily convinced. Last week President Jiang said that "the U.S. side will have to pay a price for its wrong decision" to let Taiwan's leader into the country. Beijing regards the Chinese Nationalist Government on Taiwan as illegitimate and has many times said it intends to reunite Taiwan with the mainland.
Aggravating relations further, last weekend China announced that it had charged Harry Wu, a Chinese-American human rights campaigner, with espionage, a case that has drawn considerable attention in the United States.
The contract awards to the Germans also underline a European approach to business, in contrast with that of some Americans. European governments are less inclined to risk commercial interests in Asia over political areas like human rights, and present themselves as less bellicose, more tempered trading partners to governments that find themselves in political fights with Washington.
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters today that at Thursday's meeting in Bonn, business issues would take priority over questions of human rights.
But if American car makers felt they were hurt for political reasons, and that Mercedes got undue advantage, they were not saying so publicly.
"They've made their decision and that's their choice," a Ford spokesman said. "We have other alternatives we're pursuing. It's not as if we have nothing going on there."
And Chrysler responded, "If recent reports are true, we are disappointed that Chrysler and American companies may not be participating further in the development of the mini-van project."
Analysts did not dispute that Mercedes was technically competent to make mini-vans, even though it has so far not produced a fully appointed passenger mini-van. The Mercedes truck lineup includes utility vans without the luxury features needed for passenger vehicles. However, next year it will open a plant in Spain that will produce a luxury mini-van.
But the Chinese award decision appears at least to have been moved up, possibly in response to the growing political tension with Washington. Only last week, a Chinese auto executive said a decision on a partner would not be made for three months, and a Mercedes executive in China said in June that he expected a decision by the end of the year.
Indeed, there are hardly any auto makers that are not trying hard to get into the Chinese car and truck market. While 1.5 million vehicles were sold last year, China has vowed to double its output over the next five years, and analysts estimate that there are as many as 100 million potential car buyers in China, part of an emerging middle class.
"The Chinese vehicle market should be huge," said Stephen Reitman, auto analyst for UBS Global Research in London. "Everyone wants to be there, so the Chinese have the whip hand. A whole lot of companies can be played off each other."
The letter of intent on the mini-van deal calls for a joint venture between Mercedes-Benz and the South China Automotive Corporation. Mercedes will be a 45 percent owner, and South China Automotive, 55 percent.
Mercedes officials said 20 percent of production would eventually be exported and that they would use the chassis of their Spanish mini-van, the Viano, for the Chinese project. But it will be less luxuriously appointed to fit the price constraints of Chinese buyers.
In the bus project, Mercedes will be 50-50 owner along with Yangzhou Motor Coach, China's largest bus manufacturer, producing 7,000 vehicles a year.
In a sense, the biggest loser in the mini-van deal is Ford, which is left without a vehicle production plant in China. Chrysler is making Cherokee sport utility vehicles with a Chinese partner in Beijing.
As recently as late 1994, Ford was favored over the General Motors Corporation in a competition to produce sedans with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. Shanghai Automotive already makes passenger cars with Volkswagen.
Yet Chinese officials have hinted that General Motors now has the upper hand in the Shanghai deal, and earlier this year Ford was suddenly invited to submit a proposal on the mini-van deal.
"It's not a question of if we will assemble vehicles here," W. Wayne Booker, executive vice president of Ford Motor Company International, said in Shanghai last month. "It's a question of when and where."

HEADLINE: Secret Trials Are Reported In Nigeria

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, July 12

 BODY:
With reports from Nigeria that secret tribunals have begun sentencing and possibly executing opponents of the military Government, there have been rising calls internationally for the release of political prisoners and the respect of human rights.
In recent days, Nigerian newspapers have repeatedly hinted that at least 18 military officers and 5 civilians have been secretly convicted of plotting to overthrow the Government of Gen. Sani Abacha and given long prison terms or death sentences. According to a report in The Times of London last week, some detainees may have already been executed. 
 Helping to fuel the international furor over the trials, in which there has been no public airing of the charges or right to appeal, is the inclusion among those charged of a former President, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo. According to several Nigerian press reports, a military tribunal gave General Obasanjo and his former deputy, Gen. Shehu Musa Yaradua, 25-year sentences.
A Nigerian Army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Fred Chijuka, called such reports "dangerous speculation." But General Chijuka and other officials have refused to provide any information on the whereabouts of General Obasanjo and have declined to say whether judgments have been reached against those charged.
The trials come after nearly two years during which Government opponents have been locked up without being charged, judicial orders to produce those arrested in court have been ignored and newspapers have been closed.
International rights groups say the slide into repression, the worst the country has known since independence from Britain in 1960, results from General Abacha's bid to clear the political landscape of critics after the jailing last year of Moshood K. Abiola, the apparent winner of Nigeria's last democratic presidential election, in 1993.
General Obasanjo, who is retired from the military, is the only one of Nigeria's several military presidents to have relinquished power voluntarily. His organization of elections in 1979 and his subsequent work with President Jimmy Carter in resolving international conflicts made General Obasanjo one of his country's best respected citizens.
In one of the strongest warnings in an unusually sustained round of international condemnations, the British Overseas Development Minister, Lynda Chalker, warned last week that Britain was considering barring Nigeria from the Commonwealth.
Five rights monitors, led by a former Canadian Foreign Minister, Flora MacDonald, are visiting Nigeria to prepare a report to the Commonwealth that is to be delivered in November at the group's annual summit meeting.
Coming on top of Dame Chalker's warning, the State Department has stepped up its criticisms of the Nigerian Government, calling it "unwilling to meet a basic international standard of free and fair trials." American officials have boycotted Government functions in Nigeria.
Germany, Russia, Japan and the European Union have also warned of possible sanction or pleaded for the release of political detainees.
Nigeria's military leaders have so far shown little interest in these appeals, however, and have frequently expressed contempt for their critics.
"I wonder why this same Britain, which wreaked havoc on our national life, is now telling us what to do," a minister without portfolio, Wada Nas, told reporters in Kaduna last weekend.
Diplomats say they know of no credible evidence that either General Obasanjo or General Yaradua have plotted against General Abacha. But, they add, each man has been a thorn that the dictator has been eager to remove.
According to this view, General Obasanjo infuriated General Abacha by reportedly holding political discussions abroad and was suspected by the military ruler of presenting himself as a potential symbol of national unity.
General Yaradua, the diplomats said, may have been arrested for leading a movement within the recent Constitutional Conference to demand an early end to military rule. General Abacha convened the conference last year to determine the terms for a return to civilian rule.
Asked about the possible motive for the arrests, Bolaji Akinyemi, a former Foreign Minister whose brother, Akinloye, is among those charged with plotting, said from his exile in London: "Abacha wants to silence all of those who have a voice. His plan is to stretch out the transition for a time and then remove his military uniform and declare himself the civilian president of Nigeria."

HEADLINE: First Chicago and NBD to Merge as Banks Scurry to Grow

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The First Chicago Corporation and NBD Bancorp Inc. announced yesterday that they had agreed to merge in a deal valued at about $5.3 billion, providing yet another example of the relentless consolidation that is changing the landscape of commercial banking.
The merger will create a Midwestern banking powerhouse, the First Chicago NBD Bank Corporation, ranked No. 8 in the country with $120 billion in assets. Moreover, it will have the country's fourth-largest credit card business and the biggest market share in Illinois, Michigan and Indiana. 
 "Strategically, it's an excellent fit," said Joseph C. Duwan, a banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. "The combined bank is going to be a dominant Midwestern banking franchise going forward."
The First Chicago-NBD merger is the second coupling of major banks announced this week, as the whole industry rushes to lock up lucrative markets. On Monday, the PNC Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh announced that it would buy the Midlantic Corporation of Edison, N.J., for $3 billion in stock. And three weeks ago, the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., agreed to pay $5.4 billion for the First Fidelity Bancorporation of Newark. The First Chicago-NBD deal would be the second largest in terms of money involved after the First Union deal.
"Everyone is gathering assets and trying to create economies of scale and cost efficiencies,," said Stanton Feeley, chief investment officer of SunAmerica Asset Management, which owns shares of First Chicago and several other banks that are potential takeovers.
First Chicago and NBD complement each other on a variety of fronts. "Along comes an opportunity where the stars lined up just right where we have a compatibility of product lines, a compatibility of geographic areas and a compatibility of customer bases," said Richard L. Thomas, chairman and chief executive of First Chicago.
First Chicago has positioned itself as a "money center" bank like Chase Manhattan and Citibank, catering largely to corporate clients. NBD, formerly the National Bank of Detroit, has pursued more of a regional retail banking strategy, extending its reach into Indiana and the Chicago suburbs and building a mutual fund business.
First Chicago is strongest in its headquarters city and southern Illinois, while NBD dominates Detroit and Indianapolis.
NBD's management team, led by Verne G. Istock and Thomas H. Jeffs, is regarded on Wall Street as one of the banking industry's best, while First Chicago's team of executives has a spottier record, analysts said.
Unlike other recent bank deals in which one bank is buying another, the First Chicago-NBD deal is more of a classic merger. Wall Street viewed the proposed merger favorably for NBD, whose shares jumped $1.875 yesterday, closing at $34.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. First Chicago's shares closed up 87.5 cents at $61.50.
Under the deal, First Chicago's shareholders will receive 1.81 shares of NBD for every First Chicago share they hold, thus valuing the First Chicago shares yesterday at about $62.22 based on NBD's closing stock price.
Still, "We suspect there's disappointment on the part of some First Chicago shareholders that there wasn't a big premium," Mr. Duwan said.
Indeed, First Chicago's shares opened sharply lower yesterday after the merger was announced but recovered as NBD's shares surged, pushing up the value of the deal.
In the end, First Chicago shareholders will own 50.1 percent of the combined company, while NBD shareholders, whose stock in the Detroit-based company will remain outstanding, will own 49.9 percent. .
On an assets and earnings basis, then, NBD shareholders made out better than First Chicago shareholders, getting half the combined company while providing about 40 percent of the assets and about 44 percent of profits.
The companies said they expect the combination to add to earnings in 1996. They plan to wring about $200 million before taxes out of their expenses annually, as they eliminate overlaps in branch banking, cut about 1,700 jobs and consolidate back office and marketing functions.
The companies also plan to buy back as much of $300 million in their stock before the merger is completed. They intend to sell about $25 billion in liquid assets, which will create about $1 billion in excess capital for the combined company.
"This fulfills our mutual strategic vision to be a world-class financial services powerhouse, and we view this as a merger of equals," Mr. Thomas of First Chicago said.
Still, as outlined yesterday, the deal between First Chicago and NBD makes it fairly clear who will be in charge -- the team from NBD. Mr. Thomas will be chairman of the combined company until May 20, 1996, when he plans to resign. Mr. Istock, who will be president and chief executive of First Chicago NBD, will take over the chairmanship then.
Leo Mullin, who was scheduled to run First Chicago when Mr. Thomas retired, has resigned. He will be replaced by three vice chairman: Mr. Jeffs, now president of NBD; David J. Vitale, vice chairman of First Chicago, and Scott P. Marks Jr., executive vice president of First Chicago and head of its important credit card operations.
The merger requires shareholder and regulatory approval. The banks said they expected to complete the merger by early next year.
Investment bankers and analysts said privately that First Chicago, as the weaker of the two banks in terms of management, strategic direction and overall quality and profitability of business, might have been the bigger winner.
NBD is known for extremely conservative risk management and credit analysis. As such, it sailed serenely through the late 1980's and early 1990's, unburdened by the bad real estate loans and other faulty assets that saddled many other banks' balance sheets.
Meanwhile, First Chicago has struggled for years to increase its profitability and shareholder value to no avail. "They have pockets of excellence embedded in a sea of mediocrity, and the question has always been how to capitalize on the good stuff and minimize the bad," said an investment banker who spoke on condition of anonymity and is not involved in the deal. "Putting these two companies together was a very creative way of doing that."
While Mr. Thomas and Charles Fisher, NBD's powerful former chairman and chief executive, discussed a merger as long as two years ago, investment bankers working on the deal said the two companies did not really get serious about a deal until four or five weeks ago. Lazard Freres & Company advised First Chicago and Montgomery Securities advised NBD.
First Chicago's corporate banking operations, long the weakest link in its earnings stream, accounted for 39 percent of its expenses last year and only 19 percent of its net income. And its prized credit card business, which contributed 57 percent of core profits last year, has shown signs of weakening, with earnings declining 12 percent in the first quarter.
"First Chicago does not have firm control over its destiny," George M. Salem, a banking analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison, warned in a report two weeks ago that suggested it was a ripe candidate for acquisition at around $80 a share by a super regional bank like Nationsbank.
"There has never been any intent to put our company up for sale," Mr. Thomas said in response to an analyst's suggestion yesterday that shareholder might have realized greater value through a sale.


GRAPHIC: Less than four months ago, the list of the top 10 bank holding companies in the nation looked significantly different. Yesterday's announcement that First Chicago and NBD Bankcorp would merge constituted the second largest banking merger in the United States history -- after the merger of First Union and First Fidelity, announced just three weeks ago.

HEADLINE: A Fierce Rivalry to House Olympic Teams

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: CARROLLTON, Ga., July 7

 BODY:
Tommy knew Leah, whose husband, Love, ran track in college where his coach was Mel, whose lawyer is Bill, who is married to Laryssa, who is originally from Ukraine. That in a nutshell is how the Ukrainian Olympic team chose this small west Georgia city as its training base for the Summer Olympics next year.
It is the Southern version of networking, known here as "doin' bidness," and it has helped this city of 15,000 snatch a bit of the same spotlight that will be shining on its much larger neighbor Atlanta, 45 miles to the east. 
 The Olympics are still more than a year away, but dozens of cities within a five- to six-hour radius of Atlanta are currently vying for medals in a sort of Hospitality Games. Tugging on the loosest of connections or touting charms like a new track, a smooth lake or a bucolic setting, the towns' boosters are doing their best to persuade a country, if its whole Olympic contingent trains together, or one or two foreign teams, to train in their area.
And whether it is Hendersonville, N.C., where the New Zealand swimming team will train, or Albany, Ga., where the small Belize team will work out, or Tupelo, Miss., where the Croatian teams will limber up, the motivation seems the same: a desire to participate in the spirit of the Games and parade their communities before part of the distant world.
"This is a once in a lifetime thing, and being up close and personal with Olympic athletes would be great for us," said Kip Jolly, the executive director of the Hart County Chamber of Commerce, which is still trying to attract a team to its location along the Georgia-South Carolina border. "We have the spirit and the willingness to do whatever we need to do."
That spirit was less in evidence in May when Barrow County, northeast of Atlanta, refused to be the host for athletes from Somalia, citing the dragging of an American soldier's body through the Somali capital during the recent United States peacekeeping mission. And last year, the Olympic volleyball competition was moved out of adjacent Cobb County when county commissioners passed an anti-gay ordinance, raising the specter of intolerance that the New South has sought to escape.
So far, teams from 37 countries have signed contracts to train in communities in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.
But with 197 countries expected to participate in the Games, negotiations are just heating up, said Kimberley Goff, the director of the Georgia Olympic Training Alliance in the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism, the clearinghouse for most of the deals. Even the Somalis have landed on their feet, finding a training site in Gordon County, just north of Barrow County.
Some towns have already parlayed hospitality into opportunity. Elberton, Ga., population about 5,700, has spent state grants and $48,000 of its own money to build docks and rowing lanes on nearby Lake Russell, which borders South Carolina. Besides snaring rowing teams from three countries, the town has begun attracting teams from American colleges, like Northeastern University in Boston, which is training there for college competition, primarily because of favorable weather.
In most cases, though, the towns will end up spending more money than they make, Ms. Goff said. While a few cities may reap long-term economic benefits from the good will, many countries that will send teams have few goods to export and even less capital with which to buy Southern products. The visiting athletes will hardly be an economic stimulus in themselves, since most will be traveling on a shoestring and their lodging must be provided free or at cost.
Ms. Goff described what is involved in luring a team:
"The community usually has to agree to take care of providing lodging and food at cost, taking care of training facilities and building them where necessary and providing free transportation during the training period and paying for liability insurance. We have provided some state grants for some of this in Georgia for those communities which have signed contracts with teams or countries, but the chance for real economic gain is not that great."
Carrollton and surrounding Carroll County were among the first to sign contracts with an Olympic country, and their Olympic fever sets in on July 25, when 200 to 300 members of the Ukrainian team begin arriving for several weeks of "acclimatization" and training. The athletes will return next year for two more weeks of training before the Games, which will start on July 19 and continue for 17 days.
Tommy Vance, head of the Carroll County Chamber of Commerce Olympic Committee, said housing the Ukrainians would cost the city about $100,000. Much of that is being covered by contributions from local businesses, West Georgia College, where the athletes will stay, and proceeds from exhibitions by the Ukrainian athletes and T-shirt sales.
The Olympic experience of Carroll County bears out the theory that there are just six degrees of separation between any two people on earth. Mr. Vance is a friend of a Georgia State Supreme Court Justice, Leah Sears-Collins, and he learned from her that her husband, Love Collins, had trained under the track coach Mel Pender while a cadet at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Mr. Pender's lawyer, Billy Temple, is married to the former Laryssa Barabash, a native of Ukraine. Mrs. Temple is the representative of Valery Borzov, a 1972 gold medalist in track and the head of the Ukrainian national team.
But to clinch the deal, the city, county and West Georgia College had to bring their accommodations and such up to Olympic standards. The county applied for, and won, a state grant to put in an eight-lane Olympic-style track on a field nestled between the college's archaeology laboratory and the physics observatory. The pool in the college gymnasium was outfitted with underwater speakers to accommodate the synchronized swimming team, and the county turned to Southeast Asia to buy weights of the kind used in Olympic competition.
To bridge cultural gaps, residents are putting up 50 Ukrainian-speaking students from around the continent who are volunteering as interpreters. On Aug. 6, Carrollton is having a welcoming party that coincides with the centennial of the Ukrainian weightlifting team. The Ukraine Ambassador to the United States, Yuriy M. Shcherbak, plans to attend.
For officials in Tupelo, Miss., the entree to the Games was not someone they knew, but something their main representative, Stan Gusich, knew: Croatian. As a Croatian-American who had 15 years' experience with Southern ways, Mr. Gusich was able to persuade the Croatian team to choose Tupelo over Rome, Ga.
"The Croatians told us that everybody sent them invitations, but the key was that Tupelo sent them a Croatian-American," Mr. Gusich said.
The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games got the regional sweepstakes for hosting teams and countries going more than a year ago when it published a directory of interested communities for International Olympic Committee members. The wealthier countries scooped in, grabbing up prime sites on large university campuses in the region.
The British practically commandeered Florida State University in Tallahassee. The Australians and the Swedes quickly struck a deal with the University of Georgia, in Athens, while the Russians settled on the University of South Carolina, in Columbia.
But with the help of the committee's guide, places like Gainesville, a city of 18,000 northeast of Atlanta, ended up with a bit of Olympic glory. The new boxing gymnasium in Gainesville has been chosen as the training headquarters for the boxing teams of American Samoa, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Tanzania, Tonga and Uganda.
"A lot of these countries have small teams and don't have the money for other facilities," said Ernie Bates, co-founder of Gainesville's Gold Rush Boxing Club, which serves many of the city's poor, black and Hispanic young men. "We're going to put them up in local homes, and we've talked to a lot of restaurants where they will probably be able to eat for free.
"But we're also going to be able to pick up some role models and training tips and techniques from these other countries for my boys, and we're thrilled."

HEADLINE: Lewis Engman, 59, U.S. Official And Drug Industry Spokesman

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Lewis A. Engman, a former senior Federal official and drug industry spokesman, died yesterday at Georgetown Hospital in Washington. He was 59.
The cause was a stroke, said a spokesman for the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association, a Washington trade group that Mr. Engman had headed since 1993. 
 In the mid-1980's as president of another trade group, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, Mr. Engman promoted legislation to make it easier to market low-priced generic copies of prescription drugs that have lost patent protection.
The result was the Waxman-Hatch Act of 1984, which added years of patent protection to certain brand-name drugs and also opened the door for speedy Federal approval of generic copies after the patents expired.
"He was instrumental in reaching an agreement that benefited both the research-based pharmaceutical companies and the generic drug companies, and in the process, the public interest," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who sponsored the bill with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah.
The legislation, which was bitterly lobbied over several years by drug companies on both sides, split the big brand-name drug companies. Mr. Engman resigned as president of their trade group after it passed.
Later, after the generic drug industry was rocked by disclosures of fraud and bribery of Federal regulatory officials, Mr. Engman headed an independent investigating committee in 1990. It recommended changes in procedures of the Food and Drug Administration and industry practices.
Before becoming an industry spokesman, Mr. Engman was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission from 1973 to 1975 during President Richard M. Nixon's Administration. He encouraged competition affecting doctor's fees, prescription eyeglasses and drugs. He had been an antitrust and regulatory lawyer in Washington and his hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich.
He was a staff member in the White House before joining the commission, serving as assistant director of the President's Domestic Council, legislative counsel and general counsel to the special assistant for consumer affairs.
After graduating from the University of Michigan, he studied at University College in London and the London School of Economics. He was a 1961 graduate of the Harvard Law School.
Survivors include his wife, Patricia Hanahan Engman; three sons, Geoffrey, of McLean, Va., Jonathan, of Waterford, Mich., and Richard, of Dallas; his mother, Florence Lewis Engman of Grand Rapids, and two sisters, Ruth Engman Simmons of Williamstown, Mich., and Signe Engman of Holland, Mich.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Higher But Trading Is Lackluster

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday, bolstered by expectations that price reports today and tomorrow will show moderate inflation.
"The market is trading higher on optimism about this week's inflation reports," said Tony Crescenzi, head of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds. 
 Trading was lackluster, however, as many traders chose to wait on the sidelines for today's report on producer prices for June. The Government will report on consumer prices for June tomorrow .
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 18/32 , to 1132/32 . It yield, which moves in the opposite from its price, fell to 6.54 percent, from 6.58 percent on Tuesday. It was the long bond's first price gain in four sessions. The price of the two-year note also rose, with its yield falling to 5.57 percent from 5.61 percent.
Treasury prices also received a boost from Canada's sale of $1.5 billion in 10-year global bonds, traders said. As underwriters sold the Canadian bonds, they bought back Treasury securities sold as a hedge, lifting prices, said James Kenney, head trader at Prudential Securities in New York.
Canada sold its global bonds at a yield of 6.476 percent, or 39 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. Global bonds are sold simultaneously in Asia, the United States and Europe and trade around the clock.
"It's a case of looking at attractive yields in the U.S. government market," said David Tory, managing director at Merrill Lynch International Ltd., which joined Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in leading a group of investment banks underwriting Canada's sale.
Economists expect today's report on producer prices to show a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for June. The Consumer Price Index is expected to show a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent.
If the reports come in line with expectations, it would confirm the market's view of an economy slowing enough to contain inflation and assure traders that the Fed was right in reducing short-term interest rates last week.
"The Fed has kind of promised us good numbers" on inflation, said David Capurro, who manages $520 million of fixed-income securities at Franklin Resources in San Mateo, Calif.
"The proof better be there" in the price reports, he said, "otherwise the market is going to be powerfully disappointed."
In other trading, municipal bonds were little changed as issuers continued to sell many of today's $1.3 billion in new securities at lower-than-expected yields, traders said.
"Issuers are in the driver's seat," said Reid Smith, who manages about $3 billion in bonds at the Vanguard Group of Funds. "Supply has dried up and investors are looking around and there's nothing out there."
The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority sold $191 million in revenue bonds at yields that were considered too low.
The yield was five basis points too low, Mr. Smith of Vanguard said. Even with the lower-than-expected yields "apparently they are being purchased," he said. It shows "some appetite out there," he added. The bonds were priced to yield 5.57 percent in 15 years.
Los Angeles County's Metropolitan Transportation Authority sold $250 million of revenue bonds at yields as high as 5.84 percent for the 30-year maturity.

Better technology helps oil and gas drillers return to good times.

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas 

 BODY:
BOOM times seem to be here again for the oil and gas drillers.
Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is back at the levels of its heyday in 1990, when oil and gas prices surged because of fears that the Persian Gulf war would lead to shortages. 
 That rush to drill collapsed as oil and gas prices fell. Oil plunged to $14 a barrel in late 1993 from a 1990 high of $40. And investors who had bet on the volatile stocks of oil service companies took sizable losses.
Now, some analysts and industry executives say, the current upturn is likely to be different from the last one. The key, they said, is that the drilling boom is not being fueled by a spike in the price of oil and gas.
"What we're seeing is activity not being driven by commodity prices but by a fundamental change in the economics of drilling," said Mark S. Urness, an analyst who follows oil service companies for Salomon Brothers.
Although their stock prices are reaching peak levels, he is recommending such companies as Global Marine, which traded yesterday at $5.125, off 12.5 cents; Noble Drilling, $7.625, off 6.25 cents; Tidewater, $24.625, up 12.5 cents, and Ensco International, $15.625, unchanged.
Kurt Hallead, an oil service analyst for Rodman & Renshaw Inc., is urging investors to buy Sonat Offshore, which traded yesterday at $28.125, off 12.5 cents, and Global Marine.
"This recovery is taking place in a significantly different environment than in the past," Mr. Hallead said. "Oil companies are saying internally that they have to find projects that give them a return on investment at the current level of oil and gas prices."
The price of oil has recovered to about $18 a barrel, well off its highs but at least off the bottom, while gas prices are still in the doldrums, at about $1.50 for a million cubic feet.
Mr. Hallead said technological breakthroughs that allowed companies to squeeze more reserves from existing fields were behind the current surge in drilling.
David A. Herasimchuk, the vice president of market development for Global Marine, pointed to a graph during a recent interview at company headquarters in Houston that showed a widening gap between gas production and reserves. "This gives us the confidence that it's a long-term trend," he said.
Most companies are under growing pressure to replace declining gas reserves. The better technology and growing certainty that a well will pay off are causing companies to hire more rigs than expected.
Instead of drilling for long shots, said Jon A. Marshall, group vice president of Global Marine, oil and gas companies are taking a more conservative approach to exploration, one that involves hiring rigs to drill from existing platforms in search of smaller deposits that could not be spotted with earlier sounding and imaging technology.
"What's driving the upturn are the itty-bitty fields of one million barrels," Mr. Marshall said. "They're finding pockets that they couldn't see before."
Better seismic readings and the ability to image deposits through more advanced computers have greatly lessened the risk of coming up with a dry hole in a developed field.
With wildcat wells, finding a strike of oil or gas in one of five was considered very good indeed. In the 1980's scramble to advance the frontier of exploration, the chances were often one in 100. Now, on current new wells, the success rate is about two out of three.
Companies also need little new investment since the producing platform and the pipelines to bring the oil and gas to shore are already in place. "You're looking for apples under the apple tree," Mr. Marshall said.

HEADLINE: Tussaud's and a Movie Chain Are Negotiating on 42d St. Site

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
In the latest effort to revive the ghostly corridor of deteriorating buildings along Manhattan's famed 42d Street, city and state officials are negotiating with Madame Tussaud's, the renowned London wax museum, and AMC Entertainment, a movie theater chain, over plans to open new entertainment attractions in the city's old theater district.
Under the plan being discussed, the two companies together would take over the site of three adjacent old theaters between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, spending $150 million to create a 335,000-square-foot complex housing a high-tech wax museum and the city's largest movie theater, with a total of 25 screens. 
 City and state officials are pushing to reach agreements with Tussaud's and AMC by Saturday, a deadline imposed by the Walt Disney Company, an anchor in the 42d Street revival efforts. Disney has a tentative agreement to restore the 92-year-old New Amsterdam theater, but has the option of backing out unless public officials secure letters of intent from two additional entertainment companies willing to develop attractions on 42d Street.
Earl Voelker, senior vice president of business development for AMC Entertainment, said "it would be premature" to confirm the company's plans. "I will confirm we are in arduous and laborious negotiations and an announcement could come."
Tussaud's officials could not be reached for comment yesterday evening, but a company official earlier confirmed that negotiations are taking place. Tussaud's tried unsuccessfully earlier this year to buy One Times Square, the svelte, white-marble tower at Broadway and 42d Street.
"I know they are working like crazy on it," Abby Hamlin, vice president of Weiler Arnow, co-owner of property on the southwest corner of the block, said of the negotiations. "We're sitting tight waiting for this all to come together."
Even if deals are struck with Tussaud's and AMC, Disney has until July 30 to decide if it will go ahead with the New Amsterdam development, a huge restoration project that will cost $34 million and will be financed largely through low-interest loans provided by the city. Disney plans to use the art nouveau-style theater for productions like its Beauty and the Beast, which is currently playing to sold-out audiences on Broadway.
Disney officials, who did not return telephone calls seeking comment, can also pull out of the project if they deem final construction estimates to be prohibitive. According to people involved in the negotiations, Disney and the city and state are currently discussing those costs.
The addition of Tussaud's, which is London's top attraction with 2.6 million visitors a year, would bring another brand-name entertainer to the 42d Street project, where city and state officials have been bedeviled for 15 years in their attempts to revive the once-thriving district.
The former center of live theater in the city, 42d Street has declined over recent decades, becoming a seedy center of cut-rate retailers, pornography, prostitution and drugs. The New York State Urban Development Corporation and the New York City Economic Development Corporation have been working as partners in the urban renewal effort, which has evolved from a proposal dominated by office towers to more of a tourist and entertainment center.
In May, the city and state selected Tishman Urban Development Corporation to build a $303 million hotel and entertainment complex on the northwest end of the block, and Disney is expected to provide retail entertainment at that complex.
Public officials have also been negotiating with Viacom for several months regarding the possibility of locating its MTV music network studios and operations on the north side of the street. Those talks, however, have stalled.
Under the plan being negotiated, Tussaud's and AMC would occupy a site just west of the New Amsterdam theater, where the old Empire, Liberty and Harris theaters are situated. Forest City Ratner, a Brooklyn-based company, is expected to develop the site. A Forest City spokeswoman refused to comment on the project. The city is spending $13 million to condemn the buildings, which are currently occupied by pornography shops, peep shows and small movie theaters.
The construction is expected to generate 1,600 jobs and $6.6 million in city tax revenues over a two-year period, sources involved in the negotiations said.
AMC, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., would occupy about 130,000 square feet of the 42d Street complex, and its 25 screens would have a total of 4,900 seats. Before Tussaud's became interested in the site, AMC had proposed opening a 6,000-seat facility in the space. Officials involved in the current talks estimate that AMC and Tussaud's would attract about 2 million visitors each per year. Tussaud's would occupy about 60,000 square feet.
After the construction is completed, the AMC and Tussaud's development will pay about $3 million per year to the city in rent, and it is expected to generate about 2,800 jobs throughout the city, and as much as $15 million annually in city tax revenues.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Lower as Hope For a German Rate Cut Fades

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly lower in thin trading yesterday as expectations waned that the Bundesbank would lower German interest rates.
But the dollar was steady against the Japanese yen, helped by continuing concern that the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan could stage another dollar-buying spree to drive the currency higher. 
 Foreign exchange markets have been focusing their attention on the meeting today of the Bundesbank's policy-setting council. After the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan cut interest rates last week, speculation grew that the German central bank would follow suit. Lower German rates would help the dollar by making mark-denominated deposits less attractive to investors.
Prospects for a rate cut, however, dimmed yesterday after the German Government said western Germany's inflation rate rose an unexpected four-tenths of 1 percent in the month to mid-June. The gain was up from an earlier estimate of three-tenths of 1 percent.
Because the Bundesbank is legally bound to combat inflation, the inflation report dashed hopes for a rate cut.
"There are a lot of arguments for why the Bundesbank shouldn't cut rates now," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst with Smith Barney. For one thing, the mark has weakened in recent weeks, she said. "But the prospect of cuts later in the year will support the dollar."
The Bundesbank last cut rates on March 30, when it lowered the discount rate on loans to banks by half a percentage point, to a six-year low of 4 percent. Today's meeting is the Bundesbank's last before a four-week summer recess.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.4025 marks from 1.4065 marks on Tuesday.
The dollar slipped to 87.35 Japanese yen, from 87.54 yen on Tuesday. But in Asian trading, the dollar rose above 88 yen for the first time since March 31.
The dollar has been firmer against the yen since Friday, when the Fed and the Bank of Japan surprised traders by buying dollars for yen as the dollar was rising. In recent years, central banks have bought the dollar only when it was falling. Now traders say they must be wary of the banks striking at almost any time.
"The purchases by the Fed and the Bank of Japan have really helped the dollar," said Laurence Hayward, a trader at Nationsbank of Texas in Houston. "The tide is turning."
At yesterday's rates, the dollar is up about 3 percent against the yen and 2 percent against the mark over the last week.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A program that helps the working poor is in trouble.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IMAGINE a Government program that attacks poverty even as it coaxes single parents off welfare. Imagine a program that imposes no costs on employers and does not require an army of bureaucrats to administer.
Well, stop imagining and start admiring the earned-income tax credit, which in the words of Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, sends a "powerful message that we value work -- even the work of those with pathetically low wages." 
 Not surprisingly, the tax credit -- which is provided in the form of supplementary refund to working parents with earnings so low that they owe little or no Federal income tax -- has been the one antipoverty program that those on the right and in the center favor along with the poor's traditional liberal constituency. But that consensus behind wage subsidies for the poor is beginning to crack under pressure to balance the budget. If Senate Republicans have their way, benefits will be substantially rolled back.
The earned-income credit was championed by Ronald Reagan as long ago as 1972, when he was still governor of California. It was added to the tax code during the Administration of Gerald R. Ford. The credit was increased in 1986, 1990 and 1993 with support from both political parties.
By 1996, a family with two or more children is scheduled to receive 40 cents for every dollar earned up to $8,900. In effect, about $2 an hour would be added to the take-home pay of family heads working at the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour. Once a family's income passes $11,620, the credit diminishes sharply in value. One-child families receive a smaller supplement.
President Clinton led the charge for a sweeter tax credit in 1993, seeing it as a way to offset the eroding value of the minimum wage. Conservatives were almost as enthusiastic: the credit makes work more profitable than welfare for many single parents, and it gives Republicans a way to defuse charges that they are indifferent to the fate of the working poor. All told, according to calculations by Sandra Clark and Sheila Zedlewski of the Urban Institute, about 4.5 million Americans will be lifted above the poverty line under the 1996 benefit schedule.
But the Republican-controlled Senate has a different plan. Under the budget resolution adopted by the Senate this spring, benefits would be scaled back to a level even lower than those planned for this year. According to the Treasury Department, some eight million families with two or more children would lose an average of $305 from what they would take home if the 1996 schedule goes ahead as planned. That proposal will not become law unless Congress approves and President Clinton signs the legislation. But the portents are ominous. Indeed, two Republican Senators, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, have introduced a bill to make much deeper cuts, reducing the average benefits of some eight million families by almost $900 a year.
Why the political change? The obvious explanation is that the earned-income credit is becoming much more expensive. And meeting the Republicans' goal of balancing the budget within seven years without touching Social Security, eliminating cherished weapons programs or raising taxes would require deep cuts just about everywhere else. The Senate majority's approach would spare the Government about $21 billion over seven years, while the Roth-Nickles bill would save three times that much.
The credit has also been losing friends because of charges of rampant fraud. According to Internal Revenue Service estimates, 26 percent of the benefits paid during a two-week audit period in 1994 were paid in error.
But Robert Greenstein, executive director of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, estimates that tighter procedures already in place have cut this error rate in half. More to the point, he argues, "the answer to fraud is not to cut benefits for honest filers."
Eugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban Institute who was a senior Treasury official in the Reagan Administration, offers another criticism. As the credit has grown more generous, he notes, perverse incentives have crept into its structure. For one thing, as a family's income rises, the credit's value falls so rapidly that it may serve as a serious disincentive to work more hours for parents on the edge of breaking into the middle class. By the same token, it creates a significant financial barrier to marriage.
For example, in 1996 a single mother with two children and earnings of $8,900 would be eligible for a $3,560 credit. If she married someone with a $10,000 income, however, the credit for both would be worth just $1,529. That would mean 9 percent less for the combined household.
Does all this justify trashing the credit? It's hard to see how. If anything, unskilled workers have suffered more than any other Americans in the last two decades. Government policies limiting antipoverty transfers, Mr. Greenstein suggests, have only added to their woes. And now, he warns, "If we pull the earned-income credit, we pull the rug from under the working poor."

HEADLINE: Tilting Against the Poor

 BODY:
A House Appropriations subcommittee dominated by Republicans voted this week to chop education programs for poor students and job training programs for low-paid workers. It scaled back a program designed to cut medical costs by identifying unnecessary medical procedures. It eliminated entirely a program that helps states design new educational standards.
The vision behind the G.O.P.'s 1996 budget for education, labor and health is radically different -- and woefully misguided. 
 To their credit, the Republicans have made good on their promise to produce a menu of substantial cuts. By terminating over 180 programs, they would eliminate 13 percent in discretionary spending for the labor, education and health departments. Some of their proposals are sound. Community health programs, for example, would be protected. Others are even brave, like the proposal to end the practice of having Congress, rather than scholars, decide which scientific projects to fund.
The missteps take longer to list. The plan cuts Title I aid for schools with poor children by about 18 percent, even though the program might be partially responsible for helping minority students improve test scores. Worse, the subcommittee would direct Title I money away from very poor schools, usually in urban areas. The plan also eliminates the Administration's "Goals 2000" program, which provides money for states to develop education standards. The nation's foremost economic problem is the 20-year stagnation of wages among workers who do not have a college education. Maybe Goals 2000 is not the ideal way to remedy this, but the subcommittee proposes nothing better.
The subcommittee also takes an indiscriminate swipe at Federal job training programs, good and bad. It would cut job training by 30 percent, including successful programs that help dislocated workers find new jobs. The budget plan takes better care of Health and Human Services. Still, it proposes a 20 percent cut in the agency that studies the effectiveness of medical practices -- at a time when the country is desperately trying to help doctors identify treatments that are truly effective rather than merely expensive.
The plan would also trim Head Start, the early education program for poor children, even though recent research demonstrates its effectiveness.
The Republicans previously decided to cut entitlement programs targeted at the poor, like welfare, twice as heavily as other entitlement programs. They also decided to direct most tax cuts toward the wealthy. Now we learn that they are equally determined to cut discretionary programs in ways that tilt, once again, against needy families.

HEADLINE: A School! But First, Dinner at Charles's

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

 BODY:
IF reading "The Hot Zone" isn't your idea of fun in the sun, consider enrolling in the Prince of Wales's American Architectural Summer School, where no day will be a beach day and classicism will not refer to Classic Coke or classic rock. The school is to open next year.
Yes, the irrepressible Prince is at it again, this time on our shores. To raise money for the American outpost of his neotraditional Institute for Architecture in London, the Prince will give an intimate dinner party tomorrow night at Highgrove, his Gloucestershire estate. 
 The event will begin with a tour of the estate, then move on to a meal of organic vegetables and lamb bred there. Approximately 25 monied and influential converts to the classical cause are expected to attend, including Barbra (don't call her Nouveau) Streisand; Elton (no more Deco) John; Diana D. Brooks, the chief executive of Sotheby's; Geoffrey J. W. Kent, the chief executive of Abercrombie & Kent, and William Amherst Vanderbilt Cecil, owner of the 8,000-acre Biltmore estate in Asheville, N.C., which will likely serve as the summer school's first American headquarters.
The dinner, described as "a mixture of millionaires" by Colin Amery, director of development for the Prince of Wales's Foundation for Architecture, is expected to raise about $2.5 million for the summer school. Also is the planning stages is a full-time school, preferably one affiliated with an "old university," said Mr. Amery, who is also the architecture critic for The Financial Times.
For a $20,000 pledge made each year for five years, each patron will meet with the Prince twice a year and accompany him on architectural tours. "They might go off to India," Mr. Amery said (a sojourn sure to warm the heart of Kipling). "It will have a certain cachet."
The curriculum for the school is still being formulated, though its philosophical underpinnings will be the Prince's traditional and classicist approach to architecture and town planning, which has been called "retrophilia" by its critics.
The school will probably be modeled after the institute's European summer school, a five- to six-week course that currently accepts 30 students a year. They pay about $3,100 in tuition, though scholarships are available.
Students enrolled in this summer's course, "Civic Architecture," will roost at the 16th-century Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, Italy, before traveling to Biarritz, France, where the Prince's proteges have been invited by the Mayor to rethink the city's approach to urban renewal.
The American school is being geared to Americans. "We'll give them a good look at the American country house and the American city plan," said Rodney M. Cook Jr., an architectural designer who is a founding director of the Prince's foundation and also a scion of one of Atlanta's oldest families.
The course is expected to start at Biltmore, the nation's largest house, which Mr. Cecil has transformed into what he calls a "nicely profitable" tourist attraction, with nearly 800,000 visitors a year. In addition to its architectural merits, Biltmore was selected, Mr. Amery said, because "it is an example of community renewal, where conservation has been made profitable with no public money, which is where the future lies."
After soaking up the towers and turrets designed by Richard Morris Hunt -- and also Mr. Cecil's business acumen -- students will travel on to Washington, where they will study urban planning and Mount Vernon from their base at the National Building Museum.
Meanwhile, if all goes according to plan, tomorrow evening will find Ms. Streisand -- who said through a spokesman that she loves classical architecture -- and others discussing triglyphs and metopes and oohing and aahing over the Prince's walled kitchen garden, his aromatic Thyme Walk, topiaries clipped into the shapes of crowns and Hollyrood House, his architecturally earnest treehouse.
"I'm going to listen intently and suggest the Prince come over" to open his school, Mr. Cecil said. But he seemed chagrined when he heard that celebrities would be at the dinner. "I wouldn't cross a ditch for them," he said.
If you miss the Prince's summer school (a k a Camp Carbuncle), his architectural magazine, called Perspectives, is coming soon to a newsstand near you.

HEADLINE: No. 3 Bond-Rating Service Gives City an A-, and Giuliani Cheers

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Four years ago, Moody's Investors Service disappointed City Hall by downgrading New York City's bonds. On Monday, Standard & Poor's did the same. So yesterday, when the lesser-known Fitch Investors Service declared that it would not downgrade, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani treated the announcement as a bit of a triumph.
"This is really good news for the city," he said, after aides summoned reporters for what they were billing as a major announcement. 
 Compared with the two big credit agencies, Fitch is a distant third in terms of size and influence. It had never even rated a New York general-obligation bond until 1993. But Fitch's willingness to hold steady its A- rating on the city's bonds does mean something significant for the city: it allows some institutional investors to put their money into New York bonds.
Many such investors, including some mutual funds, are restricted from buying bonds rated less than A-. A narrowing market for the bonds could mean the city would have to pay more in interest costs.
On Monday, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating of the city's bonds from A- to BBB+, citing the sluggish local economy and fiscal gimmickry by the Mayor in balancing the city budget. Moody's has rated the bonds Baa1 since 1991.
The Mayor had earlier criticized Standard & Poor's decision, saying the agency was actually rectifying a mistake it had made in 1993 when it chose not to lower the city's bond rating in the midst of the mayoral campaign. The agency's criticisms, he said, were "disingenous," and he predicted that no one would even remember the agency's decision a week later.
At yesterday's news conference, however, Mr. Giuliani went out of his way to stress the importance of the Fitch decision in contrast to that of the much larger Standard & Poor's.
"It demonstrates that an objective outside rating service, seeing both the pluses and the minuses of the budget and the future financial progress of the city, comes to the conclusion that its credit rating should continue at A-," he said.
In its announcement, Fitch said the city's newly adopted 1996 budget "reflects significant progress toward achieving ongoing balance." Standard & Poor's, by contrast, said such balance "remains elusive."

Higher Earnings Spur Rally in Stock Market
Stocks established another round of records, spurred by higher corporate earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 46.69 points, to 4,727.29. At one point, the Dow rose more than 50 points, setting off the New York Stock Exchange's circuit breakers for the eighth time this year.
Analysts said it was a wild day of trading as institutions placed five rounds of "buy" programs in about an hour, with much of the buying concentrated in technology issues. The S.& P. 500 index also set a record, rising 6.11 points, to 560.89. [Page D8.] 

The bond market expected today's producer price report to show lower inflation, and traders pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.54 percent. [D18.]

HEADLINE: Executive's Visit May Decide Fate of New York Newsday

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
Another New York City tabloid is fighting for its life. But this time there are no eccentric millionaires, no newsroom rebellions, no angry strikers outside the newspaper doors.
The paper, New York Newsday, has always been more sedate than its rowdier tabloid rivals, The New York Post and The Daily News. So it seems fitting that, instead of the public brawl the other papers stage whenever they are in danger, this newspaper crisis is being played out in more somber settings: in executive sessions in board rooms and at quiet lunches. 
 Yesterday, amid efforts by Newsday executives to shape a business argument for keeping New York Newsday alive, the new chief executive of the corporate owner, the Times Mirror Company, visited the paper for the first time.
Although there was no word of exactly what was discussed by the new executive, Mark H. Willes, and the paper's publisher, Raymond A. Jansen, it was clear that "the New York Newsday question" was on the agenda. The newspaper is the New York City edition of Newsday, published in Melville, L.I.
Mr. Jansen, publisher of both newspapers, is arguing that New York Newsday's losses have been exaggerated and that the city edition is too entwined with the Long Island edition for the company to give up on it, his associates say.
But for Mr. Willes, a former General Mills executive who has been the company's chief executive since June 1, the issue involves more than dollars and cents, analysts said. "It is a symbol," said one investment banker with close ties to Times Mirror. "It was a sacred cow and now it's something that has to be looked at very carefully. It's one of the first things he is looking at. The decision about what to do will be symbolic."
After a 10-year effort by Times Mirror to build a New York City newspaper -- a struggle that newspaper industry analysts say has produced $100 million in losses -- Mr. Willis is expected to decide the paper's fate soon.
Mr. Willes is clearly under pressure from investors and stock analysts to improve the lagging financial performance of Times Mirror, based in Los Angeles. In addition, people who have talked with board members say that those members representing the founding Chandler family have lost patience with losses in New York City and are pressing for rapid action.
In a lunch with the paper's senior managers in Melville yesterday, Mr. Willes gave no hints about the future of New York Newsday, a Pulitzer Prize-winning paper, one Newsday staff member said. The new chief executive, a finance and economics expert with no journalism background, observed that both New York Newsday and its Long Island parent were "excellent" but said they needed to perform better financially, the staff member said.
On a tour of New York Newsday's Park Avenue newsroom during the afternoon, Mr. Willes passed the desk of a reporter, Dena Bunis, who handed him a button that the paper's union had made up after he was named chief executive. It said, "New York Newsday: Too Smart to Die."
Mr. Willes put it on his lapel. But even Ms. Bunis said she was not sure what that meant. "I can't read anything into it," she said. "He's a nice man. He took my button."
Although New York Newsday is weak in circulation, it has often been praised as an experiment aimed at reinventing the urban newspaper. It aims to appeal to a new middle class by combining the snap of tabloid journalism with the in-depth coverage of more sober newspapers.
In recent weeks, a furious effort has been under way behind the scenes at Newsday to persuade the corporate owner to keep New York Newsday alive. Mr. Jansen, who has been publisher since last November, has become a strong advocate of New York Newsday, people who work with him say.
Mr. Jansen has carefully put together a case for saying that New York Newsday's losses have been overstated both publicly and inside the company.
Two people associated with Newsday who have been briefed on Mr. Jansen's work say he is arguing that the New York edition is close to breaking even -- perhaps as soon as next year -- and that a retreat now would only harm Long Island Newsday and reduce the value of the entire paper.
Mr. Jansen's predecessor once said New York Newsday's losses were $8 to $14 million annually, but Mr. Jansen has concluded that New York Newsday lost less than $4 million last year, the people associated with the paper said. With sharp new cuts in expenses, perhaps includingstaff reductions, Mr. Jansen is arguing that he could cut this year's losses by an additional $3 million, they added.
One of those sources summarized Mr. Jansen's argument as saying that "the numbers do not support a shutdown of New York Newsday." Both of them spoke on the condition that they would not be identified.
Newsday executives have long argued that the New York edition is necessary to give advertisers a wider audience, for which they pay an added rate. In addition, the Newsday executives argue that growth will be limited if the paper is confined to Nassau and Suffolk Counties. They also say that the paper will lose the circulation gains it has made over the years in Queens and Brooklyn if it gives up full coverage of the city.
Since Mr. Jansen was appointed in November, he has moved to reverse sharp circulation losses that have made the paper vulnerable to critics inside Times Mirror. Since 1993, New York Newsday's average daily circulation has plunged, from nearly 275,000 to 216,000.
New York Newsday has experimented with cutting the newsstand cost to 25 cents in the Bronx and 35 cents in Brooklyn. In Manhattan, the paper has been experimenting with tokens that let readers buy the 50-cent paper at half-price.
A spokeswoman for Newsday said its efforts had brought the average daily circulation up to 231,000 in June, an increase of 15,000.
In preparation for the meetings yesterday, Mr. Jansen and aides reviewed the way Newsday has allocated costs between the New York City and Long Island editions. They concluded, the people who were briefed on Mr. Jansen's work said, that too many costs, like those of combined sports coverage, were assigned to the New York City edition even though both papers benefited.
Even so, some analysts who study newspaper stocks are calling for Mr. Willes to face what they say is the reality that New York Newsday has been a good journalistic idea that has not worked as a business.
But others, like John S. Reidy of Smith Barney, say they are not convinced that New York Newsday's losses, whatever they are, are significant enough to Times Mirror to make it worth the embarrassment of admitting defeat.
Mr. Reidy acknowledged, however, that Mr. Willes is a man who needs to make a mark quickly. Closing New York Newsday, he said, "would be a way to say, 'We've stanched this losing operation.' That would ring a bell with some investors."

McDonnell and Partner Win $4 Billion British Copter Deal

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 13

 BODY:
The British Government awarded an order worth 2.5 billion, or $4 billion, today to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation of the United States and GKN P.L.C. of Britain to supply 67 helicopters to the Royal Army.
The bid by GKN's Westland unit to supply the McDonnell-designed Apache helicopter, equipped with engines made by Rolls-Royce P.L.C., was selected over those of six others, including British Aerospace P.L.C. and General Electric of Britain. The latter company is not related to the American concern of the same name. 
 McDonnell Douglas landed another big award today, a $1 billion contract from the United States Air Force for additional testing and improvement of the company's C-17 cargo jet. It is the first order in an effort to identify, test and produce improvements at the prototype stage of the problem-plagued jet, which has drawn criticism in Congress. The work is expected to be completed in 2000.
The order from the British Government dealt a blow to Westland's main competitor, Eurocopter, a three-year-old joint venture led by British Aerospace that includes Daimler-Benz A.G.'s Deutsche Aerospace unit and Aerospatiale of France. It builds the Tigre attack helicopter.
"Apache has demonstrated its value in service with the U.S. Army," Michael Portillo, the British Defense Secretary, said after announcing the order in Parliament.
GKN acquired Westland more than a year ago to expand beyond its main business, making parts for the European auto industry.
"It means that they've got plenty to do until the year 2002," said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Eurocopter is Europe's largest helicopter maker, with a 50 percent share of the commercial market and about one-quarter of the military market, excluding the United States and Russia.
Military business has been steadily shrinking, with helicopter orders falling below $7 billion last year, from nearly $8 billion in 1993. Analysts see little prospect of a recovery in the next few years.
In April, the Dutch Government placed an $830 million order for 30 Apache AH-64D helicopters, the choice of the Defense Ministry, rather than the Tigre preferred by the Economics Ministry.
Officials said the dollar's decline against the guilder and the Apache's use in the Persian Gulf war had persuaded them to buy the McDonnell Douglas helicopter.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan Buys More U.S. Auto Parts

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, July 14

 BODY:
Japanese automobile manufacturers bought $19.86 billion of American-made parts and materials in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, an industry trade group said this morning.
The figure surpassed a voluntary goal of $19 billion set during President George Bush's visit to Japan in 1992, but fell substantially short of the auto industry's target for importing American parts into Japan. Imports totaled $3.23 billion, compared with a target of $4 billion, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
 The announcement of the results by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association closes the book on voluntary plans for parts purchases that include numerical targets, at least as far as the Japanese Government is concerned.
Late last month, as part of a last-minute trade agreement that averted United States sanctions on Japanese luxury cars, Japan's five leading automobile companies announced new voluntary plans for increasing their vehicle manufacturing in the United States and for purchasing more American parts.
But the new plans do not include specific goals for purchases of American parts. President Clinton estimated that the planned increases would raise annual purchases by $9 billion in three years, but the Japanese Government said that was an estimate by Washington that it did not endorse.
President Bush's 1992 visit to Tokyo was regarded at the time as a failure, but the agreement he achieved was actually far more explicit in setting numerical goals than the "results oriented" pact recently announced by President Clinton.
During President Bush's visit, the Japanese automobile industry, prodded by the trade ministry, set a target of purchasing $19 billion of American parts in the year that ended on March 31, more than doubling the $9 billion purchased in the year that ended in March 1991.
Of the total, $4 billion of parts were to be imported to Japan and $15 billion were to be used in Japanese-owned automobile factories in the United States.
The industry procured $16.63 billion of parts and materials for use in the United States in the last fiscal year, surpassing that target. But the auto makers said imports to Japan fell short because production of vehicles here declined. Car sales have fallen because of the Japanese economic slump and a shift of car manufacturing out of Japan as the yen has risen sharply against the dollar.
The total of $19.86 billion in American parts purchases was an increase of 28 percent from the previous year.
Despite the big gains in purchases of American parts, some American parts makers have complained that a substantial amount of the "American" parts purchased by the Japanese actually came from Japanese-owned parts companies that set up factories in the United States.
In that sense, they have said, the 1992 agreement did not succeed in breaking up the so-called keiretsu relationships between Japanese companies and their suppliers, but only extended the system to the United States.
Moreover, despite the doubling of Japanese purchases of American parts since 1991, the United States' trade deficit with Japan in car parts has continued to rise, reaching $12.8 billion in 1994, compared with $9.1 billion in 1991. This is because as Japanese companies have shifted car manufacturing to the United States, the export of parts for those cars from Japan has also increased.
All of Japan's top five auto makers -- Toyota, Nissan, Mazda, Honda and Mitsubishi Motors -- missed their targets for importing parts into Japan. In addition, Mazda fell short of its goal for parts used in the United States, while the four other companies exceeded their goals in this category. Combining imports and local procurement, Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi achieved their targets; Honda and Mazda fell short.
Having the Japanese companies extend and increase their 1992 plans beyond this year was a demand of Washington in the recent trade talks. But Japanese Government officials and companies this time refused to agree to numbers, saying it would constitute "managed trade."

HEADLINE: Fed's No. 2 Is Said to Be Dissatisfied

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Raising a delicate political question, Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, has been expressing dissatisfaction with his job to Administration officials, leading the White House to begin looking for a possible successor when his term ends in January, officials said today.
Mr. Blinder has long been interested in becoming chairman of the Federal Reserve. But the Administration has been strongly leaning toward reappointing Alan Greenspan -- who is popular among Republicans in the Senate whose approval is needed for the job. Mr. Greenspan's four-year term ends in March. 
 Reversing course on Mr. Greenspan's reappointment would be extremely difficult, unless the Fed's string of interest rate increases last year ends up contributing to a deep recession later this year, providing the political cover to replace him.
If Mr. Blinder is not given the chairmanship, he is expected by some associates to return to his post as an economics professor at Princeton University, where his leave of absence expires at the end of this year. Mr. Blinder, reached by telephone at home today, declined to comment.
One vacancy has already arisen on the seven-member Fed board of governors with the retirement of John P. LaWare, a New England banker, on April 30. This week, the Administration has begun assembling a list of possible nominees for that slot, but with a specific eye to finding someone who could also serve as vice chairman.
Among possible nominees for the board vacancy are Sheila L. Tschinkel, the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and Richard F. Syron, the president of the American Stock Exchange and a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Federal officials said today. If Mr. Blinder steps down, Mr. Syron -- a well-known figure on Wall Street -- may have the edge for his post on the Fed board.
Ms. Tschinkel and Mr. Syron both declined to comment today.
Mr. Blinder, a distinguished economist and early Clinton supporter, has many fans in the White House, where he won praise for agreeing at the start of the Administration to settle for an unglamorous appointment as one of three members of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. But the White House has had big troubles winning Senate confirmation of nominees for positions far less important than the Fed chairman and does not relish a fight with Republicans over the Fed, particularly in an election year.
The assessment of some Administration and Congressional officials has been that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to win Senate confirmation of Mr. Blinder, a moderate Democrat who has a reputation for being slightly more willing than some Fed colleagues to accept higher inflation to preserve job growth. Mr. Greenspan, by contrast, was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and reappointed by President George Bush and has many Republican allies, dating to his time as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Gerald R. Ford.
The possibility that the vice chairman's post might be opening may make it a bit easier for the Administration to find someone willing to brave the difficulties of the nomination process and the occupational hazards of being a Fed governor.
The Administration's first choice for Mr. LaWare's slot this spring was Alicia Munnell, the Assistant Treasury Secretary for Economic Policy and a former research director at the Boston Fed. But Ms. Munnell was one of the authors of a controversial study by the Boston Fed in 1992 that found a pattern of discrimination by Boston banks against black and Hispanic mortgage applicants.
Commercial bankers have carried a grudge against her ever since and strenuously lobbied Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee this spring to block her nomination. The Clinton Administration concluded two weeks ago that fighting to put her on the Fed board would not be worth the struggle, and nominated her instead to become a member of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Fed governors, and particularly the vice chairman, face a difficult balancing act once in office. Most feel a duty to explain their reasoning to the public, yet they risk alarming financial markets if they make an unexpected comment about interest rates or the economy's health.
Mr. Greenspan has also steadily consolidated his power within the Fed, overshadowing the other governors. When the Fed reduced short-term interest rates slightly last week, the announcement was made in Mr. Greenspan's name for the first time, rather than in the institution's name. And while vice chairmen have played a strong role on international policy in the past, Mr. Greenspan has increasingly in the last year attended international meetings of central bankers.
The vice chairmanship brings no additional pay. Governors earn $123,100 a year while the chairman earns $133,600.
Mr. Greenspan's current term as Fed chairman expires on March 2. If not renominated to the post, he would no doubt give up the rest of his 14-year term, which does not expire until Jan. 31, 2006. Mr. Blinder's terms as vice chairman and governor expire together in January.

HEADLINE: Threat, and Resolve to Spend, In Debate on Capital's Finances

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Hardly a day passes that somewhere in the nation's capital local officials are not wrangling over the city's financial crisis. But today was unusual for the number of people involved.
While the city's new financial control board discussed future budgets at its first public hearing, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. and a leading House Republican, James T. Walsh of Syracuse, argued over the current budget, with Mr. Walsh suggesting that Mr. Barry could face Federal prosecution for overspending. 
 The combination made for a rare and perhaps important day in a city where residents have grown accustomed to erratic trash removal, ineffective public schools and insufficient social services. Despite evident disagreements at the board's session and the Mayor's meeting, both ended with a sense of measured optimism.
In his latest go-round with Congress over the budget for the 1995 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, Mr. Barry discussed with Mr. Walsh, who heads the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, his plan to spend about $120 million. That amount would cover a shortfall for social services, including Medicaid and the chief welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. About half of the District's children are on welfare.
Mr. Walsh has repeatedly stressed to the mayor and other city officials that they cannot exceed the $3.254 billion budget approved by Congress for this fiscal year; Mr. Barry wants to spend $3.371 billion.
They have danced around this discrepancy for some time now. But Mr. Barry underscored his resolve two weeks ago with an executive order that transferred discretionary spending authority over Medicaid and welfare programs to him, even if it meant exceeding the budget would violate the Federal Anti-Deficiency Act, a rarely enforced law that is over 170 years old. His reasoning, he said, was that the entitlement programs should be maintained and that he, not cabinet members, should take responsibility for any budgetary impact.
Mr. Walsh responded on Wednesday with a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, asking for an interpretation of the law as it might relate to Mr. Barry's over-spending plans.
"If the law is valid and enforceable, it should be enforced," Mr. Walsh said after meeting with the Mayor. "If he's violating the law, it's the Attorney General's responsibility to pursue that."
Mr. Walsh criticized Mr. Barry and his predecessor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, for creating a climate of "indigenous, intrinsic overspending" in city government. At the same time, he said that he understands Mr. Barry "has a job to do." He also said he trusts Mr. Barry.
Mr. Barry emerged from the meeting looking as if he had not a care in the world, least of all prosecution under an obscure Federal statute that outlines fines and prison terms for over-spenders and was believed to have last been enforced in the District in 1910.
Congress, he pointed out, "has overspent billions of Federal dollars" through the years and no one has been held criminally accountable. "The law needs to be re-examined," he said.
He also said Mr. Walsh "understands the problem we have."
Unlike the Mayor's meeting, which lasted only half-an-hour, the control board's session ran all day. It began with dozens of people, each with a three-minute limit, imploring the members to act one way or another, pleading with them to save this program or that. Many praised the board, which was created this year by Congress and filled by Presidential appointments, as the last real chance to correct years of mismanagement and bad government. The board has final approval over anything in city government with an impact on the budget.
But others criticized it as an invasive layer of bureaucracy that erodes the limited autonomy Congress granted the city two decades ago. One speaker threatened to challenge the Constitutionality of the board in court.
If there was one common element to their message, it was a depth of despair with the city in its current state. One leader of a local government watchdog group warned board members of Mr. Barry's apparent strategy "to face you down in a game of chicken."
Later, the board disclosed a series of recommendations to harness the next budget, and in his first news conference, Andrew F. Brimmer, the economist chosen to head the board, expressed his belief that city leaders would pay close attention.
"I am confident," he said, "that the Mayor and the city council will be very, very responsive. If I didn't believe that, I would have to conclude that the recommendations we're making would be thrown away. I don't think that's going to happen."
Mr. Brimmer also promised that the public would have access to the board and input into its decisions.
"Our phone number is not a secret," he said, turning to a staff member. "Tell them what the phone number is."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
For U.S. Business, a Hard Road to Vietnam

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, July 13

 BODY:
Like a great triumphal gateway, two newly painted, giant Coca-Cola bottles greet visitors in bold Vietnamese on either side of the four-lane highway from the airport: "Coke welcomes you to Hanoi."
There is no Coca-Cola bottling plant in the country yet -- it is on the verge of opening -- but the message is clear: American companies are here and, like the new red paint on the Coke sign, are hurrying to catch up with other foreign companies, which have been here many years. 
 Despite the lifting of the United States embargo on trade and investment with Vietnam 18 months ago, American companies are still scrambling to meet competition from Asia and Europe -- commerce that is propelling this desperately poor country toward an age of consumerism.
Billboards for Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate, and for Sony, Toshiba, Peugeot and British Petroleum dot this city jammed with Honda motor scooters and Japanese cars. Danish, Singaporean and Japanese beer is served at little sidewalk restaurants, and an Australian telephone system handles calls.
Now, with the normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi, people in both nations expect a welter of legislation to spur development and investment. High on the list is preferred trading status for Vietnam, which they say is sorely needed to promote American business. Still, no one here is predicting a great surge in investment in a country that on paper has a per-capita gross domestic product of $250 a year.
But few are dismissing its prospects. Vietnam has more than 73 million people, fewer than Germany but more than France or Britain. Some manufacturers see a low-wage source for parts. Consumer-products companies hope for a potentially large market, and big energy companies are curious about Vietnam's offshore oil and natural gas reserves, though some recent indications about their size have been disappointing.
"More than 50 countries with more than 1,200 investment licenses worth more than $14 billion are here," said Nguyen Mai, deputy minister of the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment, which oversees foreign investment projects. "Since the lifting of the U.S. embargo on Vietnam, there have been 44 investor projects with a total investment of $700 million."
Among the biggest so far are the oil-exploration efforts of the Mobil Corporation, an equipment-leasing operation by Caterpillar, and the installation of elevators in new office buildings by United Technologies' Otis Elevator Company.
Still, "for the time being," Mr. Mai said, "we would not put so much hope on American investment."
Over the last nine years, Taiwan, followed closely by investors from Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Japan have led the investment invasion here. In the last six months, Japan has emerged as Vietnam's biggest foreign investor, with 30 projects valued at $754 million, more than a fifth of the $3.6 billion worth approved in the first half of this year. In the same period, American investors won approval for 11 projects worth $295 million.
Yet "the U.S. has come from nowhere to No. 5 in investments," said Do Duc Dinh, who heads the economic study department at the semiofficial Institute on the World Economy here. "Clearly normalization is necessary," he said. "But there are other things that are important, like most-favored-nation status. And the second, financial-risk insurance is essential for American businesses."
Most-favored-nation status, which grants countries that trade with the United States the lowest tariffs on exported goods, must be approved by Congress as well as obtaining a Presidential finding that Vietnam allows free and open emigration.
For the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Federal agency that helps Americans invest abroad, to provide insurance or financial guarantees to businesses, Vietnam must be shown to comply with international laws on workers' rights.
Export-Import Bank financing, often a crucial ingredient in big projects with American involvement, is currently unavailable to Vietnam because it is classified as a Marxist-Leninist country, and thus ineligible.
Trade and investment have a way of playing out at a personal level. Eugene A. Matthews, an entrepreneur from western Pennsylvania, bit into a chocolate covered ice-cream bar made by a Vietnamese dairy, savored the mouthful and pronounced, "Holsteins are the Jaguars of cows. All the rest are Chevys."
Not a man familiar with the intricacies of dairy farming -- he spent several years in Japan as an investment banker -- Mr. Matthews is nonetheless days away from closing a deal that will bring thousands of big Holsteins to Vietnam from the United States to form what he says will be the country's biggest dairy. And as a longtime consultant to companies here, he points to his dairy deal as a model of what works in Vietnam.
"I don't want to look at anything the Government doesn't regard as a priority," he said. "In this case dairy is a priority, so people are nice to you. They want to get this done."
Even so, Mr. Matthews went on, conducting business here is not easy. He has been working on the dairy project for more than a year -- part of the time trying to figure out if Holsteins would do well in Vietnam's tropical climate.
"It's still Vietnam," he said. "It's still a complicated place. It's still bureaucratic. But there is a system here and it does work."
By the lean measuring rod of Government statistics, Vietnam is a country where people have barely enough to get through the year, hardly an attractive market for Pepsi and Coke, Motorola or Procter & Gamble. But the $250 a year in official annual G.D.P. belies an explosion of urban consumer consciousness.
For those who can afford such goods, the shopfronts along tree-lined boulevards bulge with cartons of Japanese televison sets. Glass cabinets in shops are crammed with Nikon and Olympus cameras, Ray Ban sunglasses from Bausch & Lomb and the competing Ralph Lauren glasses from Optique du Monde.
"There is a huge unofficial economy," said Mr. Dinh, the institute official. "For most people, we can live only 5 days or 10 days a month on our salary. But people build houses. Where does the money come from? Even in Government ministries, there are two sets of books -- one for official money and one for unofficial."
And everywhere the favored currency is the American dollar; even the meters in taxicabs count up the fare in dollars.
Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, where American influence is strongest, has witnessed the greatest surge in investment and is where Vietnamese enjoy the highest standard of living. Foreign businesses, according to Richmond Mayo-Smith, president of the American Chamber of Commerce there, argued that doing business is not necessarily easy, but easier than in many other places.
"A lot of the people who've been in developing countries say easier than most, but it's still not easy," he explained. "It takes patience and time to find the right partner and follow the right procedures. It can be time-consuming. It's expensive. For housing and office supply, the demand is greater than supply.
"But, the people here are much more cooperative than in China," he added. "It's not us and them. Once you've formed a joint venture, the cooperation is relatively smooth. And American business is very welcome here. They're very open to American business. They believe Americans are sincere when they enter in, that American business has certain standards of conduct, that it's more responsible. And they know Americans treat employees quite well."
Vietnam has a considerable distance to go before it joins the ranks of the Asian tigers.
"We're just a small elephant," Mr. Dinh joked. Plans for a stock exchange in Ho Chi Minh City have been put off twice. The banking system is primitive -- checks are virtually unknown. State-owned companies, which produced about 43 percent of the gross domestic product last year, are sluggish and more than a third are money-losers. And the country's roads, rail, telecommunications, power and airports lag well behind Asian neighbors. The legal system is skeletal.
But foreign investors keep coming. Last fall, the Exxon Corporation opened an office here to market lubricants and asphalt. It had been exploring for oil and gas for 20 years until it left the country in 1975. "In the longer term, Exxon is looking at a full range of marketing in Vietnam," said Ed Burwell, a spokesman.
Amy Myers Jaffe, senior editor at Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, said that many companies explored off shore, expecting a hot spot, and many were disappointed. But of the Americans, Mobil made the biggest discovery.
Still, she added: "I don't perceive that there's going to be a steady flow of companies going into Vietnam. I wouldn't say Vietnam was a dry hole, but it wasn't as big a find as people thought it'd be."
By contrast, Marie Belsey, the country manager for British Gas, is enthusiastic about Vietnam, particularly about prospects for oil and gas in the waters off the coast.
"It could be the North Sea," she said, referring to the abundant oilfields off Britain and Norway, "but I don't think it will be a country dominated by oil.
"Vietnam," she said, "goes through phases. It's talked up and it's talked down. Nobody's walked away yet."

HEADLINE: Decrying Base-Closing Plan as an 'Outrage,' the President Gives a Grudging Go-Ahead

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
President Clinton gave a grudging go-ahead today to closing or consolidating 105 military bases. The shutdowns, a consequence of the end of the cold war, are expected to save billions of Federal dollars but put tens of thousands of people out of work.
Furiously pounding the lectern in a Rose Garden talk with reporters, the President called an independent commission's recommendations to close two large Air Force depots in California and Texas "an outrage" that ignored the economic pain it inflicted. He said his political enemies had made "a calculated, deliberate attempt" to turn his efforts to preserve jobs at those bases "into a political thing, and to obscure the real economic impact." 
 The President was caught between a consensus in Congress that the nation needs to close military bases -- as long as they are in someone else's district -- and the prospect of throwing thousands of voters off the Federal payroll in two states crucial to his re-election. But Mr. Clinton said his sole political concern was "the political economy of America, and what happens to the people in these communities, and are they being treated fairly."
But Haley Barbour, the Republican National Committee chairman, said the White House itself had politicized the process "because they were trying to curry favor, or thought they were, with voters in California." And the White House press secretary, Mike McCurry, said the President's pique was in some part due to the "political fallout" of the base closings.
Mr. Clinton's anger focused on the recommendations to close maintenance depots at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif., and Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. He had been seeking assurances from the Pentagon that thousands of jobs could be shifted to the private sector in those states.
California's Democratic Senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, expressed displeasure at the decision, and Senator Boxer said she was skeptical that the Pentagon's privatization plans would preserve jobs in Sacramento. Representative Henry B. Gonzales, a Democrat from San Antonio, called the decision "a tragedy."
McClellan and Kelly were the biggest military bases listed by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which recommended that 79 be closed and 26 others realigned, saving $19.3 billion during 20 years. Nationwide, 43,742 soldiers and civilians could lose their jobs as a direct result; thousands more could be put out of work at fast-food outlets and other businesses surrounding the bases. Congress must now vote to reject the list in 45 days or it will automatically take effect.
The commission, an independent body created to remove politics from the post cold-war process of scaling back military bases, said California stood to lose 19,372 military and civilian jobs as a result of the closings -- about 11,000 of them at McClellan.
The effect will not be immediate, Deputy Defense Secretary John White said today. About 8,700 jobs at the base will be maintained as it slowly closes during the next five years, he said, and perhaps 50 percent of those jobs, mostly maintenance work on Air Force jets, may be preserved thereafter by private employers.
That is uncertain, given that military contractors have cut more than two million jobs since Pentagon spending peaked in 1985, according to the National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament, a private nonprofit group in Washington. The group said today that 145,000 civilian military workers were laid off last year, and noted that Congress plans to cut programs for retraining and counseling laid-off employees.
Commission members said California had lost so many military jobs because it had so many to lose. Several pointed out in interviews that their assignment was to first consider the military value of a base, and only secondarily the economic effect of closing it.
"Any claim that the commission acted politically is a fairy tale," said Wendi Steele, a member of the commission who has worked in the defense and aerospace industries and as a White House and Congressional aide.
Another member of the commission, Gen. Joe Robles, the former commander of the Army's First Infantry Division, said the Pentagon's instructions were to weigh eight factors of descending importance in deciding a base's fate. "The first four are military, the fifth is whether a closure makes economic sense, and the sixth is economic impact -- and we looked at economic impact very carefully and very studiously," he said.
"This is painful now." he said. "But the gain is that we save 19 billion dollars. We were chartered to make the tough calls, save money and protect military readiness. We did."

HEADLINE: It May Be Near Wall Street, But Not Shouting Distance

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Since the days of sailing ships and mercantile princes, lower Manhattan has retained its position as the place where trade deals get done. Companies may rise and fall, but the exchanges go on and on.
That historic link may now be challenged, with the plans announced on Wednesday by two of the oldest commodities exchanges to move to Jersey City. The departure would cost New York 5,000 jobs, but for both sides of the Hudson, the implications go much further. 
 The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange, which signed a 90-day letter of intent with New Jersey on Wednesday to negotiate the final terms of the move, have been part of that rarity in New York in recent years, a growth industry. Between 1991 and mid-1994, securities and commodities trading added 19,000 jobs in New York. That constituted much of the job creation that did occur, because so many other industries were shrinking. A net total of only 8,000 jobs were created during that period, according to Federal labor figures.
There is a psychological and cultural issue as well: While individual companies have come and gone on Wall Street, the major exchanges have come to seem like part of the landscape. These are not office support workers or data processors, but traders making a physical "outcry" on the exchange floor. And for the first time in this region in modern history, they will not be doing it in Manhattan.
"This is a red flag for the city and as well for the region," said Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a private group that studies planning issues. Mr. Yaro said that his organization still supported the broad view of the New York region as a single entity, and that therefore, the coffee and cotton traders are still here even if they are in New Jersey. But he acknowledged that the financial exchanges were in a category of their own, partly because of the links of culture that have bound them for so long to a particular few square miles of real estate.
If the result of the move is to loosen the industry's ties to the region, Mr. Yaro argued, then luring the traders to New Jersey may ultimately be bad for New Jersey, even setting aside the $17 million that the state is spending to get them.
"If you don't maintain the critical mass," he said, "the potential is there to say, 'as long as we're looking in New Jersey, we might as well look in Kansas City or whatever.' " The chairman of the coffee exchange, Brian Kelly, stressed that Wall Street would still be only a four-minute train ride away. But he agreed that the move could pave the way for others.
"When you look at the tax incentives," Mr. Kelly said, "it makes a lot of sense for them to follow." He was referring to other Wall Street exchanges. "The income tax is less, the corporate taxes are less, and we're still close enough that we can throw rocks at each other."
Officials of city and state emphasized yesterday that the move was not final until a contract was actually signed, and that they would continue negotiations with the two exchanges. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also took a tough stance, indicating that the package already offered to the exchanges to help them relocate to a building on Murray Street could not be stretched much further.
"If they're asking for too much," the Mayor said, "then they're just going to have to go and we'll work on other retentions. I'm not concerned about it at all."
The Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, John S. Dyson, said that the bulk of New York commodities trading would stay in Manhattan because of a deal to help the New York Mercantile Exchange build a center in Battery Park City. That deal is the single most expensive yet struck by the Giuliani administration to retain an employer. The package includes $129 million in cash from the city and $58 million in other city and state benefits.
New York and New Jersey, in discussing the fate of the exchanges over the years, have fallen into a pattern of bluff and retreat. Three years ago, the city triumphantly announced that the five major commodities trading exchanges had agreed to stay in the city in a single new joint location. Through mergers, the five players became three, and the Mercantile Exchange decided to seek its own headquarters, leaving the cotton and coffee exchanges on their own.
Officials at those exchanges said Thursday that New Jersey had offered a better deal than the city.
One real estate broker active on Wall Street, Donald P. Eisen of Cushman & Wakefield, said it was too soon to be "writing epitaphs" about the end of an era.
But he added that if the deal did go through, one of the cores of the Manhattan economy would be threatened. "This is beyond just another tenant leaving the city of New York," he said. "There was a reason why these exchanges were located in downtown and they go back to the foundation of the city -- it just doesn't seem that it would be possible they'd move."

Archer-Daniels-Midland stock is off, but some see a buy.

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder 

 BODY:
SHARES of Archer-Daniels-Midland have been pummeled in the last week after disclosures about an unusually broad and aggressive criminal antitrust investigation of the giant grain and soybean processor. And many analysts have been warning of more trouble ahead for the stock.
"We suspect the stock could touch $11 or $12 before this is all over," said Bonnie Wittenburg in a bulletin issued on Tuesday from Dain Bosworth, the Minneapolis investment firm where she follows the company. 
 What the analysts are not talking about much is the stock's long-term outlook, which is about as good as they come in the volatile commodities sector. No other company can match Archer-Daniels-Midland's huge and highly flexible capacity to produce and distribute hundreds of products from soybeans, corn, wheat and other crops. At a time when agriculture's competitive posture is a bright spot on the nation's economic landscape, neither customers, suppliers or the Government stand to benefit from seeing the company seriously crippled.
"A.D.M. is is the finest agricultural complex ever assembled and it cannot be duplicated," said Leonard G. Teitlebaum, a Merrill Lynch analyst who put a "near-term hold" recommendation on the company's stock as the scandal broke but rates it a "strong buy" for the long term.
Archer-Daniels-Midland shares now stand at $16.50, up 50 cents from Wednesday but down from $18.75 on June 27. The decline has been fueled by the emphasis some analysts have put on the uncertainties hanging over the company. Will criminal charges be filed? How onerous could the financial penalties from the Government's case be, not to mention suits from shareholders, customers or competitors? Will senior managers be forced out? Will Congress be more prone to cut Federal price supports that benefit the company?
Analysts say the company, which has always been hard to analyze because of the reticence of its management and the breadth of its holdings, is even tougher to judge given the uncertainties of the inquiry.
Still, John McMillan, who follows agribusiness for Prudential Securities, rates the company a buy for speculative investors with horizons as short as a year. While the spotlight has been on risk, he and most others say they doubt that an investigation will derail the company.
Nothing that has come to light so far suggests such a wide-ranging antitrust problem that the Government will be inclined or be able to demand drastic punishment of the company. The drama of the investigation has included the undercover cooperation of Mark E. Whitacre, president of the company's bio-products group, and a June 27 raid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on company headquarters in Decatur, Ill. But customers and competitors say they have seen little to hint of any illegal activities.
The focus of the investigation has been the lysine and citric acid businesses, which were under Mr. Whitacre's supervision, and the far larger corn sweetener business, which was outside his domain. Archer-Daniels-Midland's major competitors in each of the businesses have received subpoenas requesting information.
Lysine is an amino acid derived from fermenting corn that is fed primarily to chicken and swine. Until Archer-Daniels-Midland entered the market in 1991 as part of its huge investment -- more than $1 billion to date -- in vitamins and other food and feed supplements, the market had been controlled by two Japanese companies, Kyowa Hakko and Ajinomoto, and a smaller South Korean rival, Sewon. Prices were generally dictated by the price and availability of soybean meal, the main lysine source in most livestock diets.
Archer-Daniels-Midland quickly climbed into the driver's seat because, unlike its more specialized foreign rivals, it extracts lysine from corn it is already grinding for other products. "The price crumbled in a hurry," said one purchaser, who declined to be named.
Once Archer-Daniels-Midland secured 50 percent of what has become a 500-million-pound worldwide market, purchasers say, the price rose back toward its historic relationship with soybean meal. It is currently between $1.20 and $1.30 a pound, which would generate about $300 million in revenues. Buyers say it is possible that some kind of collusive agreement helped the prices back up but that they have seen no evidence.
The company also entered the citric acid business in 1991 when it bought Pfizer Inc.'s operations. Analysts calculate that it splits the domestic market with Cargill Inc. and Haarmann & Reimer, a subsidiary of Bayer of Germany that is based in Springfield, N.J., Both those companies have been subpeonaed. Some citric acid, which is widely used as a food and beverage ingredient, is also imported from China and Europe. Archer-Daniels-Midland's share is probably producing revenues of around $350 million, analysts say. Industry sources say the transfer from Pfizer has had no noticeable impact on the market.
The corn sweetener industry is equally mystified by the investigation, particularly in light of the Government's courtroom defeat in 1991 after a long-running battle to undo the company's acquisition of the high-fructose corn syrup capacity of Nabisco Brands Inc. Prices for the biggest sweetener product -- high fructose syrup for the beverage industry -- are currently a third lower than their 1991 peak.
The company has a one-third share of the high fructose market, followed by Cargill and A.E. Staley, a subsidiary of Tate & Lyle of Britain, with just over 20 percent each and CPC International with about 11 percent. Some analysts believe corn sweeteners in general may account for more than half of Archer-Daniels-Midland's earnings although they are just about one-fourth of its sales, which are expected to top $12.3 billion in the year that ended June 30.
Perhaps the most unnerving aspect of the investigation for Wall Street is that it appears to have blossomed out of Mr. Whitacre's group, the part of Archer-Daniels-Midland that company executives had been calling their prime growth vehicle. In fact, the company had said that such bio-products would account for one-third of earnings by 1997. Now it is unclear who will manage the group and whether the company will have to tiptoe instead of moving at its usual full speed ahead.
Analysts also fret that the board, viewed as a docile extension of Dwayne O. Andreas, the 77-year-old chairman, lacks the influence, will or insight into the company's operations to control any negative developments at a time when transition issues could become pressing.
On top of all this, the company is coming off a record year when grain prices were low and demand for many products high. Once earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter that ended June 30 are reported on Monday, the next few quarters could prove disappointing by comparison.
"The easy thing is just to sell and get out of the way," Mr. McMillan, the analyst, said. But not necessarily the smart thing for investors with the long-term view.

HEADLINE: Facing High-Tech Issues, New Patents Chief Is Reinventing a Staid Agency

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If control of the rights to intellectual property, technological innovation and pure invention is to be a legal battleground of the 21st century, then Bruce Lehman might be called the United States' field general.
As the head of the Patent and Trademark Office, Mr. Lehman realizes that most of the nation may not regard his obscure agency as pivotal to the success of American industry in a global, increasingly high-tech economy. But he does, and he is determined to use his stewardship of that office to reshape patent laws that have prevailed since the Civil War. 
 But Mr. Lehman is meeting stiff resistance from some of the people whose work he is pledged to protect: independent researchers and inventors.
These critics contend that tampering with a system that dates to Thomas Jefferson's tenure as the first patent commissioner betrays an American tradition and imperils the kind of innovation that led to the cotton gin, the airplane, the transistor and many other hallmarks of American industry.
Mr. Lehman asserts that his detractors are mostly weekend hobbyists who do not realize that his agency is crucial to the economy because it regulates the ideas behind high-tech businesses. It regulates, for example, the software, schematics and intellectual inventions that drive the computer, telecommunications and biotechnology industries. "We're talking knowledge-based industries," he said.
For that reason, said Mr. Lehman, a 48-year-old veteran of Washington politics, his agency must plan for the 21st century. "It would be ironic if the agency responsible for innovation isn't able to change and innovate itself," he said.
But Charles Mullen, an independent inventor and president of the Houston Inventors Association, says Mr. Lehman's changes would undercut American innovation.
"In the 21st century, the country with better inventions will be the world leader," Mr. Mullen said. "Sixty percent of important patents in America in this century came from independent inventors and universities. The patent office thinks it's doing the right thing by changing regulations to help big companies compete with Japan. But wiping out the little guy is not the way to do that."
Mr. Lehman, a former general counsel to the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, is respected by Republicans and Democrats alike as someone with years of hands-on experience with patent issues. Since taking over as Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks 22 months ago, he has overseen more changes at his agency than occurred in the two decades of his predecessors.
He has held public hearings on who can claim an invention, on software and biotechnology inventions, and on terms of patents and publications rules. After the software hearings, he ordered new guidelines for examining software-related inventions. The guidelines, for the first time, make it clear that software can be patented if it is a part of computer hardware or a disk.
Mr. Lehman has also ordered his agency to reopen controversial patent files. He has reorganized key departments, including the corps of examiners who study patent applications, and he has supported technological changes to move the Patent and Trademark Office into the computer age and away from reliance on cramped cubicles and archives jammed with miles of color-coded paper files.
But most critical -- and most criticized -- are new regulations that will fundamentally alter some of the most basic patent laws. Last year, under his aegis, agency officials persuaded Congress to approve a section of a global trade agreement that for the first time in 134 years changed the length of time that a patent is valid. The new law on patent terms took effect on June 8.
Since the Civil War, inventors have been awarded patents that are good for 17 years from the issue date. In Japan and in countries covered by the European Patent Convention, inventors receive patents good for 20 years from the date that the application is filed. The new regulation makes patents issued here valid for 20 years from the filing date as well. Agency officials say that on average it takes 19 months for a patent application to be approved in the United States. But because the approval process can take much longer, opponents of the new regulations say that many patent holders will now be effectively short-changed.
But Mr. Lehman asserted: "Our changes make U.S. and world patent systems similar, to operate under the same rules everywhere. The reason for patent 'harmonization' is that the economy is becoming very globalized."
Mr. Lehman's agency is also preparing to order that all patent applications be made public after 18 months, instead of being kept secret until patents are issued. That is supposed to eliminate "submarine" patents, which pend for years while inventors deliberately amend their applications to keep up with advancing technologies. Because of the secrecy of patent applications, others in an industry or research field do not know about these inventions until the patents are issued and their owners suddenly claim the rights to a breadth of technology. Mr. Lehman also plans to issue regulations to let a third party participate in disputes between an inventor and the agency over patent rights.
The House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on both proposed regulations during the first week in June. Neither proposal has yet been scheduled for a vote.
But Mr. Lehman has gone ahead and created a one-year informal application for researchers or academics who want to publish their work but are not ready to apply for a patent. That would enable those inventors to make their work public through speeches or papers without losing exclusive rights to ownership.
This overhaul of patent regulation has provoked a firestorm of debate between independent inventors, on one side, and patent lawyers and experts in intellectual property, who largely support the agency's new policies. Many individual inventors strongly oppose Mr. Lehman's plans, but they are struggling to organize. They have support from a small, bipartisan group in Congress hoping to undo the changes made to the term of a patent.
"It's very dangerous that two men, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Bruce Lehman, can change our whole system with a stroke of the pen," said Beverly Selby, an official at the American Alliance of Innovators.
Ms. Selby's group and other coalitions of independent inventors say publishing patent applications will let unscrupulous people steal ideas before they are patented. And they worry that the new rules on patent duration will significantly shorten the life of many patents, making it difficult for inventors to attract investors or license an idea.
Mr. Lehman's opponents also say his plans constitute a dumbing down of American intellectual property policy to please foreign governments and multinational corporations who want less competition.
"The patent office has been maneuvered into the pockets of foreign interests," said Ron Riley, a Michigan inventor and member of the American Alliance of Innovators. "Each change is moderately damaging, but in combination they are very bad."
"They just facilitate technology transfer form the developing nations to the Asian states," he argued, asserting that shortened patent terms and early publication of applications would allow foreign competitors to copy American inventions.
Yet much of the impetus for the patent overhaul arises from economic competition with Japan. For decades, American corporations, businessmen and inventors seeking patent rights in Japan have complained about the Japanese Patent Office.
"American inventors were forced to file in Japanese," Mr. Lehman said, "and the Japanese Patent Office does not touch the patent application for 18 months. But at 18 months the whole thing is published."
Eager to eliminate those obstacles, Mr. Lehman agreed to reshape American patent regulations to more closely resemble those used in Japan and Europe. In return, he said, Japan agreed to accept patent applications in English and eliminate challenges to them while they are being evaluated, to speed examinations and abolish an arcane licensing regulation that allowed Japanese companies to pay a royalty for an American invention but manufacture it themselves.
"This one agreement has the capability of closing the entire U.S.-Japan balance-of-payment gap," Mr. Lehman said, theorizing that looser policies toward American inventions would open new markets in Japan.
Mr. Lehman's critics say he is being naive. They say Japan has simply repeated a decades-old promise to speed up its patenting process in return for great sacrifices in a tried-and-true American system. Mr. Lehman says that is short-sighted.
"We're well beyond the point of saying this is the heart of some future economy," he said. "It's what puts Americans to work today. The new technologies that drive the U.S. economy and help us retain our edge over other nations are protected initially by patent laws."

HEADLINE: Stock Market Drifts in Lackluster Trading

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
A day after hitting record levels, the stock market drifted yesterday in lackluster trading.
The three leading averages finished at new highs, but not by much. On the other hand, declining issues exceeded advancing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,230 to 1,044. 
 "It was a digestive day after the big run-up," said Edwin D. Walczak, chief investment officer of Vontobel U.S.A. "It seems that the market may be stabilizing."
Analysts said a Labor Department report showing a slight decline in the Producer Price Index for June indicated that inflation remained under control. The second key inflation report for June, the Consumer Price Index, will be released today.
The Dow Jones industrial average inched higher in the final minutes of trading, closing at 4,727.48, up 0.19 point. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 561, up 0.11 point and the Nasdaq composite index closed at 994.15, up 5.52 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange fell to 388.5 million shares, from 413.6 million shares on Wednesday.
The major follow-through from the previous day's surge came in computer-related stocks, which have long been leading the market. I.B.M. rose 2 1/8, to 103 3/4, its highest price since October 1991. Intel gained 1 3/8, to 73 5/8; Micron Technology 5/8, to 61 3/8, and Dell, 1 7/8, to 68 3/4.
Capital-goods stocks also performed strongly, perhaps because yesterday's Government statistics suggest that the Fed will continue to lower interest rates through the end of 1995 to spur an economic expansion. Caterpillar was up 3/4, to 72 3/8; Boeing, 1 1/4, to 65 1/2, and Micron Technology, 5/8, to 61 3/8.
Tobacco stocks, however, declined after the Food and Drug Administration submitted proposed regulations to the White House urging that nicotine be regulated as a drug. Philip Morris fell 1 5/8, to 75 1/2; RJR Nabisco, 1/2, to 27 1/2; UST Inc., 1/2, to 29, and American Brands, 1/8, to 39 1/4.
Also on the down side was J. P. Morgan, which slumped 1 1/4, to 75 3/8, after the company announced a 10 percent drop in second-quarter earnings. Tandem declined 3 1/2, to 13, after warning that its fiscal third-quarter earnings would be below analysts' projections.
Gainers included Acclaim Entertainment, up 3 1/2, to 24 7/8, on a report of higher earnings. Intuit, which analysts anticipate will announce a number of alliances with banks today, gained 4 3/4, to 83. And MEMC Electronic Materials soared 5 1/2, to 29 1/2, on its first day of public trading.
A big gain was also notched by Merck, which advanced 1 3/8, to 50 7/8. An F.D.A. advisory committee issued a favorable recommendation for the company's Fosamax treatment for osteoporosis.

Treasuries Little Changed After Producer Price Data

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday after a report on producer prices failed to provide enough evidence of the direction of the economy.
While the report on producer prices showed inflation receding, traders were hedging their bets ahead of today's report on consumer prices and retail sales. 
 "People are looking for a bit more information confirming the slowdown," said Mark Taborsky, who manages $280 million in bonds at the Abacus Financial Group in Chicago.
Treasury prices were also hurt by weakness in the dollar, which fell against the German mark and other currencies after the German central bank left interest rates unchanged.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 3/32 , to 11328/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, edged up to 6.55 percent from 6.54 percent. The price on the two-year note also fell, and its yield rose to 5.59 percent from 5.57 percent.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that its Producer Price Index fell one-tenth of 1 percent for finished goods in June after showing no change in May. While the data were somewhat better then expected, they failed to prompt much buying.
"The market is still dominated by people who think rates are going lower, but they're not so sure they want to push bond yields down to 6.25 percent," Mr. Taborsky of Abacus Financial said.
Some traders said they were waiting until today's report on consumer prices in June. Economists expect an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index. The Government will also report today on retail sales in June.
"The market wants to see evidence that the consumer continues to stay home and keep his purse strings tightly drawn," said Terry Rose, who helps manage $2 billion of bonds at Advisers Capital Management in New York.
For now, some traders are betting long-bond yields could hover just above 6.5 percent, as they have since early last month, or even rise.
To stay at those levels, the data have to continually show the economy weakening enough to warrant more interest rate cuts by the Fed, said Terrence Pigott, head trader at Daiwa Securities America.
In the corporate market, the Raytheon Company sold $1.125 billion of bonds yesterday, 50 percent more than originally planned, in its first public bond sale.
"There's still tremendous demand out there for corporate bonds," said Dan Portanova, who helps manage $3.5 billion of fixed-income securities at the General Reinsurance Corporation. "It's a good time for issuers to come to market."
Raytheon, the military electronics company, sold $750 million of 10-year notes at a yield of 6.58 percent, 50 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. It also sold $375 million of 30-year bonds at a yield of 7.511 percent, 96 basis points more than the 30-year Treasury.
The company is using the proceeds to refinance debt stemming from its $2.3 billion acquisition of E-Systems Inc. in April.
In other sales, the Comsat Corporation, a provider of communications and information services, sold $200 million of monthly income preferred stock, which combines features of debt and equity.
Municipal bonds were steady yesterday amid a dearth of new bonds scheduled for sale and investor reluctance to pay more for some bonds offered on the secondary market, traders said.
"Literally there is no product around and the only thing left is unattractive," said George Buchholz, the manager of trading at Tucker Anthony Inc. "What gets any market going is supply, and when you don't have any we just ground to a halt."

HEADLINE: Under Inquiry, Miami Bond Firm Is Closed

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 13

 BODY:
Two brothers best known as Florida sugar barons have closed the Miami securities firm that had been the target of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The brothers, Alfonso and Jose Fanjul, said they had decided on the shutdown after unsuccessful efforts to sell FAIC Securities Inc. to its 22 employees. They also cited the increasing costs of the S.E.C. investigation. 
 The S.E.C. is investigating whether the brothers illegally made political contributions while seeking state and municipal bond business.
In December, FAIC was selected by the Florida Housing and Finance Authority to serve as co-managing underwriter of the authority's single-family mortgage revenue bonds. Before that contract was awarded, various companies owned or controlled by the Fanjuls contributed $88,000 to gubernatorial and other candidates for state office, the S.E.C. said.
Additionally, Dade County in November approved FAIC to be an underwriter for aviation bonds; three Dade County commissioners received a total of about $7,250 from the Fanjuls before the contract was awarded, according to the S.E.C.
The S.E.C. went to court saying FAIC ignored repeated subpoenas to comply with the investigation. The brothers have denied wrongdoing.
The brothers own Flo-Sun Inc., a leader in the state's $2 billion sugar industry. FAIC was established in 1980. Originally, it purchased jumbo certificates of deposit from federally insured financial institutions offering the highest interest rates.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell In June

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
The nation's producers received slightly lower prices for finished goods in June, the second consecutive month with no inflation at the last stage before the goods reach consumers, Labor Department figures showed today.
Economists said this latest report of price stability, which was somewhat better than expected, reinforced the decision by the Federal Reserve last week to ease monetary policy to insure against the economic slowdown's degenerating into recession. And it suggests that there is more leeway now for the Fed to cut rates further in the months ahead. 
 Last Thursday, the Fed said "inflationary pressures have receded enough" to warrant a quarter-point cut in a benchmark short-term interest rate and the latest figures fueled hopes of at least one more cut later this summer.
"The worst of inflation is behind us," contended Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, noting that it is rare to be in the fifth year of an economic expansion without significant price acceleration.
The latest readings on goods at earlier stages of production were also largely reassuring, unlike late last year and early this year when it appeared that the production pipeline was filling with goods whose higher prices would before long show up at retail counters.
Most such increases "are continuing to dissipate by the time they reach the consumer," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.
Still, some analysts fret that consumer prices have accelerated, albeit modestly, this year and that higher costs of grain and imported goods could add to inflation pressures in coming months. They also note that services, which tend to be "stickier" than commodities and have been rising faster, account for more than half the Consumer Price Index, which is to be published Friday.
"There seems to be a little more pricing power at the consumer level, which may be why corporate profits are as good as they have been," said John Silvia, economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
The Producer Price Index, which largely excludes services, fell one-tenth of 1 percent for finished goods in June after showing no change in May, the Labor Department's report showed. Not counting food and energy, which tend to swing sharply from month to month, finished goods rose two-tenths of 1 percent after rising three-tenths of 1 percent in both April and May.
Energy prices tumbled 1 percent last month, the biggest decline since September and October, as gasoline fell 3.1 percent and heating oil dropped 5.8 percent, both reversing hefty advances in May. Food prices, down three-tenths of 1 percent, have now fallen four months in a row.
Capital equipment moved up two-tenths of 1 percent, the same as in May, bringing the annual 1995 pace to 2.7 percent, triple that of the preceding six months, the report also showed. Machinery for the paper industry surged 3.2 percent.
Among goods at the intermediate stage of production, such as a bolt of cloth, prices edged up one-tenth of 1 percent following a two-tenths of 1 percent May increase. Nondurable materials used in manufacturing, such as wood pulp, climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent, but this was partly offset by a two-tenths of 1 percent decline for such durable factor goods as flat glass and plywood. Construction materials were about unchanged for the second straight month.
Among crude goods, like a bale of cotton, prices rose seven-tenths of 1 percent but this followed a slightly larger decline in May. With food and energy excluded, the rise was six-tenths of 1 percent, to bring the pace for the first half of 1995 to 12.7 percent, about half that of the final six months of 1994.
Michael S. Rome, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, concluded, "The outlook for inflation is that it will stay well contained."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Germans Decline to Cut Rates, Sending the Dollar on a Slide

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against the German mark yesterday after the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged.
Many currency dealers had expected the German central bank to cut rates after the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan pushed short-term interest rates lower last week. And expectations mounted earlier yesterday after the Swiss central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates by half a percentage point, to 2.5 percent. The Swiss National Bank typically takes its cues from the Bundesbank. 
 The Swiss rate cut sent the dollar soaring to a four-week high against the mark and a six-week high against the Swiss franc. Lower German and Swiss rates often help the dollar by making deposits in those countries relatively less attractive.
When the Bundesbank held rates steady after a meeting of its policy-setting council, the dollar plunged.
"People bought dollars after the Swiss National Bank cut, expecting the Bundesbank to cut rates," said Jim Raphael, a currency trader at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City. "They didn't, and now you're seeing the panic."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.3877 marks from 1.4025 marks on Wednesday. Earlier, the dollar rose as high as 1.4137 marks. The dollar fell to 1.1584 Swiss francs, from 1.1674 francs on Wednesday.
Hopes for a German bank cut had been dampened somewhat on Wednesday after a Government report showed that western German inflation rose to 2.4 percent in June from 2.2 percent in May. Indeed, the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said yesterday that the central bank had left rates unchanged to uphold its credibility as an inflation fighter.
The Bundesbank left its benchmark discount rate unchanged at 4 percent, a six-year low. It held its 14-day securities repurchase rate at 4.5 percent.
The dollar, however, remained steady against the Japanese yen yesterday. Since Friday's surprise bout of dollar-buying by the Fed and the Bank of Japan, many traders are convinced that the United States and Japan are willing to act to weaken the Japanese currency.
"There's a very real sense the dollar will be supported by the Bank of Japan above 85 yen, and that 90 to 93 yen is desirable," Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 87.35 yen, unchanged from Wednesday.

Expensive in Tokyo
Ever since the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo opened four months ago, it has been trying to get as much attention as, say, the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris or the Tate Gallery of Modern Art in London, which has already had a flurry of publicity even though it is not scheduled to open until 2000.
Unfortunately, most of the attention has been critical. The city-run institution is Tokyo's first contemporary-art museum, and the cost has been astronomical. Its six-story, 330,000-square-foot building, designed by Takahito Yanagisawa, a local architect, cost $481 million. And its location, about 40 minutes by car from downtown Tokyo, is too out of the way, experts say, to attract many visitors. 
 The museum has about 3,500 works, 3,000 of them from Tokyo's Metropolitan Art Gallery. "Five hundred works are recent acquisitions, mostly paintings both by domestic and international artists," Yasuyoshi Saito, the museum's senior curator, said in a telephone interview this week. He added that the museum's priority was to establish a permanent collection of Japanese contemporary art.
The recent acquisitions have been another sore subject, Mr. Saito reluctantly admits. In the last year, officials have bought 39 works, each costing more than $600,000 but many less than $2 million, by artists like David Hockney, Tom Wesselman and Anselm Kiefer. (Approval from the city authorities is required for purchases of more than $2 million.)
By far the most criticized of its recent acquisitions is Roy Lichtenstein's "Girl With a Hair Ribbon," which the museum bought from the artist for $6 million. The price is gigantic, considering that similar cartoon images by the artist have recently sold for $1.6 million to $2.5 million.
"I was involved in the Lichtenstein purchase," Mr. Saito said. "I don't think it was too expensive. Yes, we know it's not cheap, but we decided to buy it three years ago, when prices were higher."
But it seems everything the museum does costs a bundle. To mount the current show, its second, a major retrospective of the work of Sir Anthony Caro, the English sculptor, the museum spent about $3 million, Mr. Saito said. The show has about 100 sculptures in a zenlike setting designed by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando.
"Although our inaugural show dealt only with Japanese contemporary art, we are trying to appeal to an international audience," Mr. Saito said.
After that the museum plans an international survey of art from the 1960's and an Andy Warhol show in the spring.
 
Estate Auction
 While it seems as if the important round of Impressionist and modern art auctions just ended (they were held in New York in May and in London last month), Sotheby's is already announcing the auction of paintings valued at more than $30 million from the estate of Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer and philanthropist who died last year. The collection is to be the cornerstone of Sotheby's important November sales in New York.
Mr. Hazen, who produced classic movies including "Sorry, Wrong Number," "Barefoot in the Park" and "Becket," looked to curators like James Johnson Sweeney, the Guggenheim's director from 1952 to 1960, for advice about which art to buy. Among the highlights of his collection is van Gogh's "Thicket" (1890), a lush forest scene painted a month before the artist killed himself. It is expected to sell for about $10 million. Mr. Hazen also owned Kandinsky's "Last Judgment" (1910), a highly colorful abstract work with a $5 million estimate.
Christie's competed for the estate but lost, art experts say, because Sotheby's had placed higher estimates on the paintings and promised the Hazen heirs a more generous guarantee (an undisclosed minimum price that an auction house promises the seller regardless of a sale's outcome).
"Yes, we've guaranteed the pictures," said Diana D. Brooks, who heads Sotheby's auctions worldwide. While declining to disclose the figure, she called it "a number we're very comfortable with."
 
Decline of Shows
 The growing number of art and antiques shows in the world's art capitals is beginning to take its toll. Dealers are dropping out of some shows to join others. Some dealers say it's not worth going to any because of the rising costs of shipping and insurance, not to mention booth rents. Moreover, there are only so many top dealers to go around.
The International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show, held every October at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, is a case in point. This year, 11 dealers either dropped out or were not invited back by Anna and Brian Haughton, the organizers. But the Haughtons had no trouble filling the spots. Among the new dealers are Galerie Vallois, a French dealer that specializes in Art Deco; S. Bernstein & Company, a San Francisco gallery dealing in jade and Asian art, and Carlton Hobbs, a London furniture gallery. Three important London galleries will be missing: Spink & Son, Partridge, and Pelham. "These shows are just not conducive to selling furniture," said Clifford Henderson, the director of Partridge. "They're too expensive. The last show cost about $80,000 to mount." Anthony Spink, one of the directors of Spink & Son, said: "It's hard to rustle up business in New York. We're doing the Art Fair in New York in May instead. Specialized fairs are generally better for us."
The Haughtons, pioneers in specialty fairs, run the International Ceramics Fair in London every June. They've had flops, like an international fair at Harrods, the London department store, where one season of poor attendance and grumbling dealers put a stop to that idea. They also ran the International Silver and Jewelry Fair in London, which had an eight-year run but was a casualty of the recession and folded four years ago. Undaunted, they are planning an International Asian Art Fair at the Seventh Regiment Armory from March 29 to April 3 next year.

HEADLINE: Poverty Rate Is the Highest In 16 Years, A Report Says

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN 

 BODY:
Nearly 3 out of every 10 New Yorkers live in poverty, more than at any time during the last 16 years, according to a new analysis by an advocacy group using data from the Census Bureau.
The analysis, by the Community Service Society of New York, found that 1.9 million New York City residents -- more than 27 percent -- had incomes in 1993 that fell below Federal poverty standards. The figure has fluctuated since the group began keeping statistics in 1979, but has risen steadily since the city's economic boom began tapering off during the late 1980's. 
 David R. Jones, president of the society, an antipoverty group, attributed the increase to the continuing effects of the recession that gripped the New York region in the early 1990's, and to other social shifts such as the loss of factory jobs, which pushed those at the bottom off the economic ladder.
"We see this as the result of the contraction of the New York economy," he said. "We've been caught up in a regional recession and it has had the worst impact on unskilled workers."
The report defined poor as single people with an income of less than $7,363 a year, and families of four with annual incomes of $14,763 or less. The income guidelines are based on Federal figures.
But Mr. Jones said that relying on the federal poverty rates may vastly underestimate the size of the problem in New York because the cost of living is much higher than in other parts of the country.
The group's analysis was based on a March 1994 survey by the Census Bureau in which 4,573 people were interviewed. Although the sample may have been too small to determine precisely the amount of poverty in New York at any given moment, it does accurately reflect the trend in poverty over the last 20 years, said Terry Rosenberg, director of population studies for Community Services group.
The analysis also reflected a report from the Census Bureau released this year, which placed New York City's poverty rate at 26.6 percent in 1993.
The Community Service analysis found that poverty was highest among Hispanic residents, with 46 percent of that population living below the poverty rate. And it found that although the amount of poverty among blacks has remained relatively stable since 1984, the number of poor Hispanic and white New Yorkers has increased sharply during that time.
The report also found that 44 percent of New York's children are poor, double the national rate, as are 21 percent of the city's elderly.
Mr. Jones said the increase in poverty was especially alarming given local and national efforts to move people off welfare programs by tightening eligibility requirements or imposing time limits.
"This shows that a large number of the poor are not getting enough entitlements to maintain a standard of living," he said. "If we're going to shove more people off welfare, we'll see an even larger increase."

MEXICAN ECONOMY TO HURT COLGATE-PALMOLIVE EARNINGS

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
The Colgate-Palmolive Company said late yesterday that it expects its second-quarter earnings to be below Wall Street's expectations because of economic conditions in Mexico. The consumer-products company said profits from other operations would not offset the lower profit from Mexico. Colgate-Palmolive, based in New York, said it expects earnings of 95 cents a share for the second quarter. First Call Inc. had reported a consensus earnings prediction of $1.05 a share. For the second quarter of 1994, Colgate-Palmolive reported net income of $142.5 million, or 93 cents a share, on sales of $1.89 billion. Colgate-Palmolive made its projection after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where its shares closed at $72.125, down 62.5 cents.

HEADLINE: Squatters' Rights vs. City Rights

 BODY:
A group of rundown tenements on Manhattan's Lower East Side lived in by squatters for years may well have benefited from their occupation. The squatters have fixed up the city-owned buildings with their own money and sweat, securing them from drug users and criminals. Now the buildings are a vicious battleground.
New York City is trying to clear the property and sell it to a community group committed to renovating the buildings for low-income families and returning them to the tax rolls. The squatters are resisting, on the streets and in the courts. The city has acted slowly and clumsily, but it is pursuing the right objective and deserves a chance to proceed with the renovation project. 
The confrontation has drawn citywide attention because of a police raid in May that forced the squatters from two of their buildings on East 13th Street. Over the July Fourth weekend the squatters tried to retake a building, and managed to get to the roof and throw firecrackers and debris into the street before the police could regain control. Squatters remain in two other buildings on the street, which has taken on the look of an armed camp.
The same group has also been a vociferous advocate in causes ranging from the homeless to alleged police brutality to the occupation of Tompkins Square Park a few years ago. Many are artists, handymen and waiters with families and resources to wage a bitter legal battle for the right to remain.
The squatters say that under an old legal principle known as adverse possession, their 10-year occupation has made them the effective owners of the tenements. They argue further that the city cannot simply send in the police without going through eviction proceedings in the courts. The city claims it can do whatever it wants to oust illegal trespassers on property it has seized from previous owners because of unpaid taxes. These disagreements will take months to adjudicate.
For now, the city must exercise a measure of restraint and not use police force until it has exhausted legal proceedings to get rid of the unwanted tenants. Both sides should try to negotiate their way out of their confrontation, perhaps by finding other places for the squatters to live.
With New York City's housing shortage growing more severe, squatters have taken over dozens of city-owned buildings. The city should accelerate its process of getting rid of the 2,500 buildings it still owns after seizing them for nonpayment of property taxes.
The Giuliani administration is trying to step up the sale of abandoned buildings to private or nonprofit groups that can obtain Federal subsidies and outside financing for their renovation. But many buildings in middle-class neighborhoods could become economically sustainable if sold off to the highest bidder in a simple auction. Squatters could be given a chance in some cases to see if they could get financing to get buildings into good shape.
But this is a problem best headed off before it develops. The city needs to find a way of helping landlords keep their property viable instead of abandoning it to avoid taxes. The city government should not generally take over as landlord.

HEADLINE: Heat Wave's Effects Will Linger on Farms

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 14

 BODY:
Livestock is no longer dropping dead in droves, but farmers in the Midwest expect to be suffering the effects of this week's heat wave for weeks to come.
 "The real loss to the economy comes from the millions of animals that didn't put on weight, not the few thousand that died," said Lee M. Reeve, who operates a cattle feed lot in Garden City, Kan. 
 The livestock deaths were concentrated in western Iowa, where the 100-degree days that have taxed animals across the region for much of the week were made worse by unusually high humidity and virtually no wind. But those conditions eased somewhat today.
 Most of the thousands of steers that died were in the Iowa counties just east of Omaha. Hundreds of thousands of turkeys and chickens also died in several parts of the state.
 The most vulnerable cattle were those in feed lots, where most of them spend their final weeks before being slaughtered.
 The lots are typically shadeless dirt pens. A dead steer might cost a farmer $500 to $600, but a farmer could lose just as much from 35 to 40 survivors having eaten too little to get up to their potential market weight during the blistering weather.
 Hot weather also reduces output from cows and inhibits the growth of swine and other animals bred for meat.
 Few farmers are insured for the kind of losses caused by the heat wave.
 For some in the hardest hit counties, the losses from dead animals alone run into the tens of thousands of dollars.
 "You normally lose less than 1 percent of the cattle you're feeding in a year," said Lowell Evans, manager of T&K Evans Grain Inc., a co-op in Elliot, Iowa. "We're hearing of people around here losing 6 or 7 percent in two days."
 The heat wave struck at a particularly difficult time for farmers who raise cattle.
 Since March, prices have been below the cost of raising cattle, and many farmers have already been losing $50 or more per animal in recent months.
 "I don't know that there's ever been a time we've had this combination of factors -- the temperature, the humidity, the lack of wind," Don Baker of the Iowa State University extension service told The Associated Press. "It's like a 100-year storm or a 100-year flood."
 Mr. Baker said 2,500 head of cattle, mostly feed lot steers, were dead in three counties of western Iowa. He estimated the loss to farmers at $1.75 million.
 Mark Gardner, a farmer, said, "It's always the biggest and the best ones that die first."
 Mr. Gardner said he had lost 23 cattle, The Associated Press reported.
 "When they've got their tongues hanging out 8 to 10 inches and they're panting for air, you'd better get water on them or they'll fall over dead pretty soon," Mr. Gardner said on Thursday. "It's never been this bad in my 40 years."
 More than 240,000 turkeys have died this week in Minnesota because of the 100-degree weather, according to news reports.
 At a northwestern Iowa turkey farm, the heat killed more than 100,000 birds in the 24 hours that ended on Thursday night, the A.P. said.
 "To the best of our knowledge, over the past 24 hours, we have lost an estimated 118,000 turkeys, or 2 percent of our annual slaughter," said Greg Steenblock, operations manager of Bil Mar Foods in Storm Lake.
 According to the Iowa Turkey Federation, each turkey is valued at about $12, putting Bil Mar's loss at about $1.5 million.
 The weather was less of a problem for crops in most of the Midwest. But with corn just entering the crucial pollination stage that determines how much grain is in each ear, a similar heat wave in the next two weeks could drastically reduce the potential harvest. Reserve stocks are low, so another heat wave could send prices soaring.

Treasury Bonds Fall On Solid Retail Sales
Treasury prices ended lower after a Government report showed surprising strength in consumer spending, shaking the market's view of a slowing economy. The report cast doubt on the prospects for another cut in short-term interest rates.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell, pushing its yield up to 6.60 percent, from 6.55 percent on Thursday. [40.]
 

Higher bond yields helped depress the Dow Jones industrials, which fell 18.66 points, to close at 4,708.82. The index rose 6.09 points this week. The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.18 points, to 999.33, on the strength of technology issues. Also, the S.& P. 500 index fell 1.11 points, to 559.89. [41.]
 
The dollar was slightly higher against most leading currencies, rising to 87.83 yen and 1.3903 marks. [36.]
 
New York Newsday to Close
Times Mirror has decided to close New York Newsday, which will publish its last edition tomorrow. The paper was the victim of corporate pressures for profits and a New York City newspaper market that changed sharply over the last decade. It was estimated that in its 10 years of publication, the paper lost $100 million. [1.]
 
The news came a little before 5 P.M. -- with the stock market closed -- as Don Forst, the paper's editor, famed for his snappy tabloid headlines, walked brusquely through the desks and cubicles, summoning his staff into a big main room. [26.]
 
Boeing Announces Charge
Boeing will take a pretax charge of $600 million for the second quarter because 9,500 employees have accepted early retirement packages. The charge will reduce second-quarter net income by about $500 million. [40.]
 
Quicken Gets a Boost
Intuit announced that 19 financial institutions, including many of the nation's largest banks, credit card companies and brokerage firms, would use its Quicken software for home banking services beginning this fall. The move signals the company's intent to compete aggressively with Microsoft after the collapse in May of plans for the two companies to merge. [39.]
 
Report Criticizes B-2
As Congress considers additional financing to build new B-2 stealth bomber, a draft report by the General Accounting Office says that the $44 billion bomber, which is built by Northrop Grumman, may not be as stealthy as advertised. After 14 years of work, including 6 years of test flights, "the Air Force has yet to demonstrate that the B-2 design will meet some of its most important mission requirements," the report said. [1.]
 
Chrysler Comes to Vietnam
Just days after President Clinton extended full recognition to Vietnam, Chrysler opened showrooms Ho Chi Minh City and in Hanoi this week. The moves reflect the efforts by American companies to gain a piece of a consumer market that is already being tapped by Asian and European competitors. [38.]
 
Blacks Make Labor Demands
Black labor union leaders see the struggle for the presidency of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. as a rare opportunity to demand a much greater voice for blacks in the nation's labor movement. The leaders have prepared a list of 11 demands, most of them calling for more blacks in the federation's hierarchy and the hierarchies of its individual unions. [6.]
 
Drug Company Goes It Alone
Express Scripts is the only major manager of prescription drug networks that has not been gobbled up or embraced by a pharmaceutical giant, and the company is using that fact as a big selling point. [40.]
 
Heat Hits Midwest Farmers
Livestock is no longer dropping dead in droves, but farmers in the Midwest expect to be suffering the effects of this week's heat wave for weeks to come. [29.]
 
Coffee Prices Climbing
Coffee prices steepened their climb after the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Federation endorsed a plan to limit shipments to one million bags a month. Coffee for September delivery surged 5.5 cents, to $1.447 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. [36.]

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE STRATEGY;
Frustrated Croats Are Openly Preparing a Major Assault on a Serbian Enclave

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, July 13

 BODY:
As the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Bosnia reels from fresh attacks by rebel Serbs, the Government of Croatia is planning to open a major new front in the Balkan war.
Increasingly frustrated at the failure of diplomacy to recover the large chunk of their country that has been occupied by Serbian rebels since 1991, Croatian leaders are urgently preparing a major attack on the Serbian enclave. 
 Thousands of Croatian soldiers, with scores of tanks and hundreds of artillery pieces, have been moved near the enclave in recent weeks. Jet fighters, which the Croatian Air Force has obtained despite the United Nations arms embargo on former Yugoslav republics, are being readied for action.
The Croatian Serb rebels hold more than one-fourth of Croatia. Croatian troops recaptured a sliver of land, Western Slavonia, in May; now they appear to be preparing for a much larger action against the much larger Serb-held region called Krajina.
"Their last operation showed that they have the capacity for extremely smart military maneuvering," a foreign ambassador said of the Croatian Army. "Their morale is very, very high. They know what they're supposed to do, and they're prepared to go and do it."
There is no indication that the current fighting in eastern Bosnia, where Bosnian Serbs have captured the United Nations "safe area" of Srebrenica, will affect Croatia's timing.
Military planners here do not expect large numbers of Bosnian Serbs to come to the aid of Krajina if it is attacked. The Bosnian Serb army is stretched thin, holding more territory than it can effectively defend, and in any event the Krajina Serbs and the Bosnian Serbs have separate armies whose troops are committed mostly to defense of their own home regions. Nevertheless, the two forces have cooperated in the past, most notably in coordinated attacks against the Government-held enclave at Bihac, Bosnia.
More worrisome for Croatia would be the entry of the army of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia in defense of the Krajina Serbs, but many Croatian and foreign analysts say this is unlikely.
As they plan their attack, Croatian Government officials, both civilian and military, are making no effort to disguise their intentions.
"We would very much prefer to recover the occupied territory peacefully, but we are coming to the conclusion that the international community is not going to bring us a solution," Gen. Anton Tus, the chief military adviser to President Franjo Tudjman, said in an interview this week. "We have to do it ourselves. If we do nothing, we are essentially giving away part of our country and permitting the establishment of a Serb-run state on our territory."
Foreign governments, including the United States, have warned President Tudjman that an attack risks strong international condemnation, which would set back his efforts to bring Croatia closer to NATO and the European Union. But foreign criticism of his last attack was mild, and he apparently believes that the risks of inaction are greater than those of war.
"We're all pessimistic about the possibility of avoiding another round of fighting," said a Western diplomat in Zagreb. "It's going to be a bigger and bloodier operation than the last one, which was a rout. But Tudjman seems convinced that it's worth the gamble."
Diplomats and United Nations officials here are speculating not on whether Mr. Tudjman will order a new attack, but when it will come. Most guess that it will be sometime between the end of the tourist season and the onset of winter, probably in late August or September.
After the attack in May in which Croatia recaptured Western Slavonia, Serbian gunners fired volleys of cluster bombs into Zagreb, killing 11 civilians and wounding about 200. Milan Martic, leader of the breakaway authority that calls itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina, warned recently that he would use the same tactic if there were another attack.
"We have enough missiles to hit all important targets in Croatia," Mr. Martic said on television. "Retaliation against Croatian cities remains one of the most important aspects of our military strategy."
Despite this threat, interviews with Croats in Zagreb and elsewhere in the country suggest that public support for a new attack on the Krajina Serbs would be strong.
"Serbs will retaliate by shelling Croatian cities, including the capital," said Vera Golubic, a Zagreb accountant. "We all know that. So let's pay the price. It's better than being hostage to the Serbs for years and years."
Croatia's envoy at the United Nations office in Geneva, Miomir Zuzul, took a similar position in an interview broadcast on Zagreb television this week.
"We have a cancer in our body," Mr. Zuzul said. "When you have such a disease you cannot wait forever."
Apparently in preparation for an attack, the Croatian Army has reinforced positions near potentially vulnerable areas of the Serb-held territory. One set of positions is along the northern edge of the enclave, between Sisak and Karlovac. Another is around Canak, where the crescent-shaped occupied region is narrowest.
In addition, a combination of Croatian Army units and Bosnian Croats has taken up positions in hills and mountains overlooking Knin, where the Krajina Serbs have their headquarters.
There are about 10,000 United Nations troops in the threatened area, and any attacking force would have to overrun at least some of their positions to establish control.
The rebel Serbs have also been strengthening their forces, with substantial help from President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
After Croatia's victory in May, Mr. Milosevic sent a senior officer from the Yugoslav Army, Gen. Milan Mrksic, to take command of the Krajina military. According to Western intelligence reports, Mr. Milosevic has also sent dozens of tanks and scores of field officers to Krajina.
In an effort to bolster the Krajina infantry, Mr. Milosevic's police have rounded up several thousand Serbs born in the Krajina region and sent them home, where they are being forced into the rebel army.
But Croatian and foreign analysts are convinced that Mr. Milosevic would not send the Yugoslav Army to counter an attack on Krajina. Such an action would bring Serbia itself directly into the war and expose it to serious retaliation.
Croatian officers have apparently not decided the scale of their planned assault, but it will almost certainly be considerably more ambitious than their recapture of Western Slavonia.
At the Croatian Foreign Ministry, planners have prepared maps showing key roads and rail lines in Krajina, as well as the route of the region's only oil pipeline. Officials say their aim is to recover as many of these assets as possible, as well as to take at least enough territory to cut Krajina into several pieces.
Serbs, whose families have lived in parts of Croatia for centuries, rebelled against Croatian authority in early 1991, after Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia. With considerable help from the Serb-led Yugoslav Army, they established control over their parts of newly independent Croatia and turned them into the so-called Krajina Republic.
United Nations peacekeepers moved into Krajina, but after they failed to bring it back under Croatian control, the Croatian Government threatened last year to force them to leave. The Government later extended the mandate, but it is scheduled to expire at the end of November.
"The major factors all point in a negative direction at the moment," said a senior European diplomat in Belgrade. "We have a critical situation in Sarajevo and the other Muslim enclaves.
"The Bosnian Serbs are showing no willingness to come to the negotiating table. There is no prospect of an agreement between Yugoslavia and Croatia, or of an accord under which Yugoslavia would agree to recognize Bosnia in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions.
"And we are facing the very real possibility of a major conflict in Croatia late this summer or early in the autumn. All this leads me to believe that things are going very badly on all major issues."

NEW YORK NEWSDAY TO STOP PUBLISHING
New York Newsday, a bold experiment by a suburban newspaper to break into the largest and most competitive city market with a new type of tabloid, will publish its last issue tomorrow, its publishers said. The paper, which emerged in the economic boom of the mid-1980's, was the victim of corporate pressures for profits and a market that changed sharply over the last decade. [Page 1.]
 
When its final issue rolls off the press, New York Newsday will have lasted 10 years, 3 months and 1 day. Begun with expectations that it would outlive at least one of its competitors, it will be survived by the same three newspapers that it squared off against on Day 1: The Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times. [26.]
 

In the newsroom, stunned reporters, editors and photographers tried to console one another over the brief, blunt announcement. [26.]
 
MIDWEST HEAT WAVE ROASTS NEW YORK
The scourge of heat that killed at least 15 people and thousands of cattle in the Midwest descended upon the New York area yesterday, bringing a high-misery combination of near-record temperatures in the mid-90's and the heavy wetness of a tropical rain forest. [1.]
 
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
STREET CORDON ANGERS RESIDENTS
East 13th Street between Avenue A and Avenue B in the East Village has been cordoned off by the police since late May, when the city evicted squatters living in two tenement buildings. The intention was to quiet a volatile situation and keep the squatters from returning, but the tactics have effectively shut off the flow of customers for many businesses on the block and have enraged many residents. [25.]
 
MAN ARRESTED IN UPPER EAST SIDE RAPE
A 24-year-old Manhattan man paroled less than a month ago from a Federal penitentiary was arrested at his mother's apartment on the Lower East Side and accused of raping a young woman Wednesday night in her penthouse apartment off Fifth Avenue. [25.]
 
TEACHER'S DEATH PUZZLES INVESTIGATORS
The fatal shooting of a remedial reading teacher in the Bronx on Wednesday has shaken many people, particularly at a time when officials are boasting of a safer city. At first, her death appeared to be the result of a botched robbery. But nothing seems to have been taken from her pocketbook, and the way she was shot has led some investigators to suggest it was an execution. [24.]
 
REGION
 
CASINO PLANS ARE REQUESTED
Taking an important step toward opening a casino in Bridgeport, Connecticut officials issued a formal call for proposals that required developers to guarantee the state hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. The call represents the latest round in a three-year-old campaign by the financially ailing city. [27.]
 
RAIL DISPUTE IS FAR FROM SETTLEMENT
Negotiations between the Metro-North Railroad and 17 of its unions intensified, but officials on both sides of the dispute said they were far from a contract settlement. The unions are threatening to strike as early as 12:01 tomorrow morning. [27.]

HEADLINE: Reflecting on Vietnam Ties, Many Agree That It's Time

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: JOLIET, Ill., July 14

 BODY:
A generation ago, when the Vietnam War was driving a wedge through America, Marco Scolari, a union concrete worker and World War II veteran, could scarcely bring himself to speak to any man who had avoided military service. Back then, it seemed that passions over Vietnam might never cool, on either side.
But when President Clinton extended diplomatic recognition to Vietnam on Tuesday, a move that once would surely have ignited a firestorm, the response across the nation, in interviews with dozens of Americans, was measured, and mostly favorable. 
 Even Mr. Scolari, the onetime hawk now 77 and retired here in Joliet, merely shrugged. "You know, even the draft dodgers don't bother me anymore," he said. "They were halfway right about Vietnam."
A majority of the 75 or so people interviewed this week -- from this faded factory town on the Illinois River to the pinstripe-and-starch district of downtown Houston, from immigrant neighborhoods of Boston to the espresso cafes of Portland, Ore. -- looked on the Vietnam War as a finished chapter in American history. Although there was still some disagreement about the meaning of Vietnam, it was rarely expressed in the shrill tones of the divisions a quarter-century ago.
"It's been 20 years, and you can't hold a grudge forever," Bruce Donald, a 39-year-old banker, said as he browsed through a bookstore in Boston. "Look, my father-in-law lost a limb in World War II. It doesn't mean that if he saw a German today he'd turn the other way."
Joliet is the sort of working-class place that sent more than its share of sons and brothers to Vietnam. Indeed, it seems to be the rare person here who does not have a relative who fought in the war. John Adams, a 31-year-old auto sales manager whose father and grandfather both did, said: "It's time to let it go and move on. We shouldn't be paralyzed by our past."
Florine Johnson, 50, of Pikesville, Md., said there was only one reason the Government had waited so long to restore relations: Vietnam was the war America lost. "If we had won," she said, "this wouldn't be an issue."
To be sure, some people saw Mr. Clinton's move as a betrayal of those who fought, and especially of the families of men still missing in Vietnam. Several argued that the nation's most important bargaining chip in negotiations to gain more information about missing American troops had been squandered by the President's move.
"There's nothing to dangle over the Vietnamese Government's head," said Arguetta Ruffin, a 38-year-old administrative assistant in Atlanta. Ms. Ruffin said she believed that some American soldiers were still being held in prison camps.
But that view was in the minority. Even among those who said they opposed formal recognition of Vietnam, few held out much hope that any missing Americans were still alive.
"The family members and their friends are clinging to a little bit of hope -- it's an irrational hope," said Phil Kothmayer, a 37-year-old high school teacher in Ocala, Fla. "I can empathize with them, but look at it from a realistic standpoint. It's not going to happen."
Among those opposing recognition was Mark Sayers, 34, who works at a nuclear power plant near Joliet. "We lost 58,000 people in that war," he said, "and it's still a Communist country. Recognizing Vietnam is offensive to the families who lost somebody there."
Elizabeth Jessup, whose husband, Joseph, was wounded in Vietnam, said she could never bring herself to forgive its Communist leaders. "It's the same Vietnam that took our sons and brothers," she said. "I could never forgive them for that."
But others argued that the United States was not blameless either.
"The question should be, Can Vietnam forgive us?" said Billie Stokes, 40, who works as a customer service representative for a telephone company in Joliet. "I mean, look at all that we did to that country -- all the bombs we dropped, all the kids we killed."
Among some people, Mr. Clinton came in for renewed criticism for his avoidance of the draft. "He has no credibility on military matters," said Cheri Carhill, a 47-year-old housewife. "It's a joke for this coward to be making decisions about a war he refused to serve in."
Others, though, said that Mr. Clinton had surely known that he would be subjected to some criticism over his decision of this week, and that he deserved praise for taking the political risk.
"If he would just stand up for what he believes once in a while -- just because he believes in it -- people would have more respect for him," said Rita Adelman, a 51-year-old nurse in Joliet.
Warren Carlin, a 62-year-old English teacher at the College of St. Francis here, said he hoped that Mr. Clinton would stay the course on normalization with Vietnam, even if opposition mounted in Congress.
"He did the right thing," Mr. Carlin said. "Now, if he backs away from this, I will be very disappointed. But I won't be surprised."
Besides bringing closure to a traumatic chapter in American history, recognition of Vietnam opens a potentially important market, most of those interviewed said.
"We're in a world economy now," said Tom Fewox, a 42-year-old Houstonian. "We need to get on with business. They've allowed a lot of foreign investment in the oil industry."
And Steve Brinker, 46, a technician for a waste-water treatment company in Joliet, added, "Wasn't the whole war about capitalism anyway?"
Among younger Americans, of course, the Vietnam War is a matter of the distant past. "I know nothing about Vietnam," said Cris Glenn, a Joliet disk jockey born in 1973. "It seems like a lot of people are dwelling in the past. We should learn from the past mistakes and move on."
Pat Jordan, 73, the commander of a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Portland, said he also supported Mr. Clinton's move. "You can't go on hating everyone for the rest of your life," he said. "It's going to tear you up if you do."
Charles Loveless, a 53-year-old Joliet welder who served in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968, said that the war had been "senseless" and that in any case he saw little to be gained by holding grudges against Hanoi. Withholding diplomatic recognition would only hurt ordinary Vietnamese, he said.
"The people of Vietnam are not my enemy," Mr. Loveless said. "They never were my enemy."

HEADLINE: Beliefs;
Why the liberal agenda might one day include the battle over euthanasia and assisted suicide.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
Are euthanasia and assisted suicide about to become part of the liberal agenda? That question is raised by the case of George Delury, a Manhattan man charged with second-degree manslaughter after he willingly acknowledged helping his wife, who was incapacitated mentally and physically from multiple sclerosis, kill herself.
 Until now, most big battles over euthanasia or assisted suicide have occurred on the West Coast in court cases and in referendums at the polls, or in Michigan where Dr. Jack Kevorkian has made himself a kind of composite of the Lone Ranger and the Grim Reaper. Despite national media attention, euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been plotted on the ideological grid. 
 For example, the American Civil Liberties Union, certainly a flagship of liberalism, has rallied in support of individuals being able to decide their fates. Yet many advocates of rights for the disabled, most with liberal credentials, have rallied in opposition.
 In the West Coast voting, a trickle of feminist, trade-union and Democratic groups endorsed proposals to give doctors more latitude in dealing with these matters. Yet Bill Clinton, during the 1992 Presidential campaign, came out against such measures.
 New York, however, is where public issues are generally packaged and labeled. True, no one took much notice last December when a Federal District Court in Manhattan rejected a suit challenging the state's prohibition of assisted suicide. But that is likely to change now that the question has a face and is embedded in a drama that runs from love of a spouse to defiance of the law.
 That euthanasia and assisted suicide are unlikely to become part of the conservative agenda hardly needs discussing. It is true that justification for these practices can be found as readily on the libertarian right as on the liberal left. But conservatism almost by definition is apt to oppose radical departures from a longstanding moral consensus about not taking human life. By default, then, euthanasia and assisted suicide could become liberal causes.
 In addition, there are at least three natural affinities between these causes and the principles and history of liberalism. First, liberalism generally holds that the state should remain as neutral as possible toward competing concepts of how people should best live. The liberal-inspired state should merely establish and enforce the rules so that individuals will have fair and equal chances to pursue their own ideals and goals.
 From that perspective, the more personal and basic a matter -- and what could be more personal and basic than when and how one dies? -- the more it should be left to the individual's free choice.
 Second, modern liberalism has long been wed to a humanitarianism that focuses on the relief of overt suffering and pain. That is why, for example, liberal proponents of abortion rights feel more compelled to rebut the anti-abortion movement's claims about fetal pain than the movement's philosophical arguments about fetal "personhood."
 Third, liberalism has historically been linked with a faith in human progress through the rational control that science promised over nature. A medically procured death is the last-resort exercise of such control.
 But there are counter currents in liberalism. Some philosophers, for example, question the notion that liberalism can be thoroughly neutral toward rival conceptions of the human good. Liberalism, they argue, must have at least a minimal vision of what constitutes a good life and good person, a threshold beyond which diversity can flourish. Conceivably that threshold vision might include some absolute principles about the inviolability of human life.
 Others point out that John Stuart Mill, the 19th-century champion of the freedom to do whatever does not harm others, drew the line at choices that would irreversibly preclude all further choices, notably selling oneself into slavery. This, they say, is comparable to euthanasia or suicide.
 Then, too, from the Progressive Era through the New Deal, much of American liberalism departed from its individualist heritage to stress human interdependence and social solidarity, which could possibly (although not inevitably) motivate opposition to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
 Modern liberalism has also been sensitive to the ways in which freedom-of-choice arguments can be used to defend practices that are actually coercive because of social inequities. Turn-of-the-century courts, for example, struck down laws setting minimum wages or maximum hours in the name of "freedom of contract." Liberals have also argued that theoretically neutral practices like capital punishment operate in highly biased fashion.
 Such elements in the liberal tradition are often behind the fears that legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide, at least in the absence of a vastly improved and equitable health-care system, will subject the aged, disabled or gravely ill to psychological or economic coercion or lead to outright abuses.
 So it is possible that these proposals, even after they move center stage in New York, will remain ideologically homeless. It is even possible that the guardians of an already beleaguered liberalism will be a little relieved at that.

HEADLINE: Buchanan Challenges Gramm to Debate

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 14

 BODY:
Raw Presidential politics intruded on the Republican Party's hopes for a harmonious summer meeting here today as Patrick J. Buchanan challenged Senator Phil Gramm of Texas to a televised debate over who is the true conservative seeking the party's nomination.
That prompted a third contender, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, to jump into the crossfire, presenting himself as the voice of civility and warning that such rivalries are no way to attract voters. 
 "Before long," Mr. Lugar said, "the whole platform is tilting to the right -- everybody's about to fall off, almost oblivious to the fact that we want to win a general election. You cannot win it that way."
But, for now, few Republicans are looking beyond the primaries. Mr. Buchanan, a commentator who honed his sparring skills on the CNN program "Crossfire," made plain why he was escalating his assault: "Right now, Phil Gramm is in my way, and I'm in Phil Gramm's way."
Mr. Gramm, who earlier this week snapped that Mr. Buchanan's knowledge of economics and agriculture "you could fit into a thimble," immediately rejected the challenge. "It's impossible to have a serious discussion with somebody who is so obviously distorting the facts about Phil Gramm's record and he knows it," said Gary Koops, Mr. Gramm's spokesman.
The feuding today offered a taste of what is to come as the Republicans try to keep their hold on Congress and not allow intraparty backbiting to deter their drive to win back the White House next year. But the Presidential contenders, who appear increasingly impatient with Senator Bob Dole's standing as the undisputed front-runner, cannot seem to resist turning more aggressively on one another as they compete for second place. Mr. Dole, who was not present today, is to address the three-day conference on Saturday.
Other prominent party members warned Republicans at the meeting here that such behavior -- and a preoccupation with abortion and other social issues -- might be destructive. "We're trying to pitch the tent here to have both libertarians and social conservatives," said Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts. "We should not lead with social issues -- we should be leading with economic issues."
Republicans did not turn all of their venom on each other. Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been flirting with running for President himself, urged those who are in the race to stick to issues. And he offered the highly partisan audience one of his most ferocious attacks on President Clinton.
"We have the least competent, least adult, least structured, and least disciplined and least reasonable Administration, I think, probably in our country's history," he said. Still, Mr. Gingrich reminded the gathering not to underestimate the President's political skills, saying, "If the 1996 election is about personality, there is a fair chance that Bill Clinton will get re-elected. I do not know in our lifetime of any political figure with a greater capacity to make you feel good for 30 seconds."
But the biggest sideshow for Republicans, at least recently, has been the hostility between Mr. Gramm and Mr. Buchanan, two of the most combative figures in Republican politics. Although Mr. Gramm has far outpaced Mr. Buchanan in fund-raising and organization, Mr. Buchanan has launched a full-scale drive to stop the Senator from cornering the support of conservative voters. He has come on stronger than many party leaders had expected -- to the point of running ahead of Mr. Gramm in some early polls in the crucial primary state of New Hampshire.
"Phil Gramm says he is the heir to Ronald Reagan's legacy, that he wants to complete the Reagan revolution," Mr. Buchanan said. "I think the Gramm claim is bogus."
He cited Mr. Gramm's votes on issues from taxes to his support for the confirmation of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer as Justices of the Supreme Court. Asked why he did not go after Mr. Dole for many of the same votes, Mr. Buchanan said, "Because we have to get past Phil Gramm if we're going to have a run at Bob Dole."
Mr. Gramm, who is addressing the convention on Saturday, along with Mr. Dole and most of the other candidates, has retorted that Mr. Buchanan is too extreme in his views and lacks an adequate campaign structure to win the nomination.
The usually mild-mannered Mr. Lugar, who has been overshadowed by other candidates during the early jockeying, chastised Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Gramm. "There's often a rivalry to appear to be the sternest, most mean-spirited candidate in the field -- really pounding down into the pavement almost everyone who doesn't seem to fit," he said. "Once again, that's a loser." Mr. Lugar also accused Mr. Dole and other rivals of going too far in seizing on "wedge issues" like racial quotas and immigration.
But Mr. Lugar himself engaged in some personal attacks. Responding to a reporter's question, he said because Senators Dole and Gramm and Gov. Pete Wilson of California have been divorced they are less credible when talking about family values. "I think they have a problem," he said, adding that "a President has to lead by example."
Most people attending the conference were not party to the political combat here because the candidates saved their sharpest barbs in conversations with reporters outside the convention hall.
Nevertheless, when the conference opened on Thursday, Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, dismissed the notion that there was undue tension in the party in general and between Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Gramm in particular.
"We shouldn't expect a campaign to go to its conclusion without understanding where Candidate A and Candidate B differ on issues," he said. "That's what politics is all about."

HEADLINE: Intuit Signs 19 Deals for Home-Banking Software

BYLINE: By LAURIE FLYNN 

 BODY:
Intuit Inc. announced yesterday that 19 financial institutions, including many of the nation's largest banks, credit card companies and brokerage firms, would use its popular Quicken software for home banking services beginning this fall.
 The move signals the company's intent to compete aggressively with the Microsoft Corporation after the collapse in May of plans for the two companies to merge. 
 Yet while the alliances are expected to enhance Intuit's lead over Microsoft in the fast-growing home banking market, many of the banking companies that have signed on with Intuit -- including Chemical Banking and Sanwa Bank California -- also have relationships with Microsoft. Officials of those banks say they will allow customers to choose which service to use.
 "I think we can expect a pier-six brawl between Microsoft and Intuit this fall," said Adam Schoenfeld, vice president of Jupiter Communications Inc., a market research firm in New York that specializes in on-line services.
 With a new version of Quicken, customers of American Express, Chase Manhattan Bank, Smith Barney and other institutions will be able to transfer money between accounts, pay bills and retrieve data from their accounts directly into financial files on their personal computers. All electronic transactions will be processed through the Intuit Services Corporation, a unit of the company that acts as a data clearinghouse between the customer and the bank.
 The customer will probably pay a monthly fee to the institution for the electronic banking services, though in some cases, said Scott Cook, the chairman and founder of Intuit, the service might be free. Intuit will collect fees from the institutions.
 Shares of Intuit rose $2.75 yesterday, to $85.75, in Nasdaq trading. The stock jumped $4.75, or 6 percent, on Thursday in anticipation of yesterday's announcement. Shares of Microsoft also rose yesterday, closing at $103.675, up $3.50, in Nasdaq trading.
 The new service could accelerate consumer participation in the long-nascent market for electronic banking services. Only about a quarter of home computer users regularly use a financial software program, but that number is growing quickly. And Quicken has between 60 and 70 percent of the personal finance software market, with about eight million users. Mr. Cook of Intuit called the endorsement of Quicken by the 19 financial institutions " a giant leap forward" in the way both home computer users and small-business owners manage their books.
 For banks, home banking will lead to lower costs as they cut back on labor and branch costs, much the same way automated teller machines have led to lower bank staff costs. Small and midsize banks are eager to offer home banking to give them an edge over larger institutions. "It levels the playing field for smaller banks without the branch reach," said Keith H. Karpe, vice president of Sanwa Bank California, which has 110 branches.
 Intuit's announcement comes at a time of rapid change in the electronic banking industry. Two months ago, Microsoft withdrew its $2 billion bid to acquire Intuit amid an antitrust investigation by the Justice Department.
 In addition, the No. 3 company in financial software, Meca Software of Fairfield, Conn., a unit of H & R Block, announced in May that it was being acquired by a union of the BankAmerica Corporation of San Francisco and the Nationsbank Corporation of Charlotte, N.C. The two banking companies plan to offer electronic banking services over their own private networks, with Meca's Managing Your Money software installed on customers' personal computers.
 After the merger of Intuit and Microsoft collapsed, there was some question in the software industry as to whether Intuit would have enough influence on its own to woo large financial institutions.
 Mr. Cook of Intuit said negotiations with many of the institutions announced yesterday were begun during the merger negotiations, but that the collapse of the merger had no impact on their decisions. "We lost no financial institution partners that were with us at the time of the merger," he said.
 The other institutions that will work with Intuit are Bank of Boston, Centura Bank, Compass Bank, Corestates Bank, First National Bank of Chicago, First Interstate Bank, Home Savings of America, M&T Bank, Marquette Banks, Michigan National Bank, Texas Commerce Bank, Union Bank, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo Bank.

HEADLINE: Technology Issues Move Up As Some Other Sectors Slip

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Technology stocks held up yesterday as many other widely followed issues posted losses. The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology issues, ended higher, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined.
 "The technology sector came back from early weakness," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president of Interstate/Johnson Lane, a securities firm in Charlotte, N.C. "And most of those issues have yet to report their earnings." 
 The overall market was dragged down in part by higher bond yields. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from their yields, fell after a stronger-than-expected retail sales report lowered expectations that interest rates would be cut again this summer. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.60 percent, from 6.55 percent on Thursday. "Higher yields tend to depress business activity," Mr. Harrington noted.
 The Nasdaq index rose 5.18 points, to 999.33. The Dow industrials dropped 18.66 points, to 4,708.82, and the S.& P. fell 1.11 points, to 559.89.
 Declining issues outnumbered those that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,321 to 921. Big Board volume was off, sinking to 312.9 million shares, from 388.5 million on Thursday.
 At the opening bell, technology issues slumped in reaction to a report, issued late Thursday, that showed weakness in semiconductor orders for June. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, $117 worth of new orders were received for every $100 of goods shipped, compared with $120 of new orders in May.
 But this group rebounded later in the day, based partly on strong sales during the traditionally slow months of the year. Microsoft was up 3 1/2, to 103 5/8; Intel rose 1 7/8, to 75 1/2, and Texas Instruments gained 1/2, to 154 1/8.
 Another group that moved against the general trend was the retail stocks, which benefited from the larger-than-expected June retail sales gain and indications that the trend would continue this month. Sears, Roebuck rose 1 3/4, to 34; Kmart was up 3/8 to 15; Woolworth gained 1/4, to 14 5/8, and J. C. Penney increased 3/4, to 48.
 Household-products companies declined, starting with Colgate-Palmolive, which said that its second-quarter profits would drop below analysts' projections. Colgate was down 3 7/8, to 68 1/4; Procter & Gamble lost 1/8, to 69 1/2, and Clorox slipped 1/2, to 62 1/2.
 Some tobacco stocks were off, just as they were on Thursday, as traders sold in reaction to a Food and Drug Administration proposal that would increase Federal regulation. Philip Morris fell 3/4, to 74 3/4, and UST lost 1/8, to 28 7/8.
Amid projections that oil industry earnings reached their peak in the second quarter, oil stocks also declined. Mobil was off 5/8, to 98 5/8; Exxon slipped 1/4, to 71 5/8, and Chevron fell 1/2, to 47 5/8.
 Comair sank 5 1/2, to 31 7/8, after being downgraded from a buy to a market performer by J. P. Morgan Securities. And Mapinfo plummeted 12 1/4, to 22 3/8, after announcing that its fiscal third-quarter net income would be below that of a year earlier.
 In Japan, stocks ended slightly higher. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 12.03 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, at 16,517.70.

HEADLINE: Data Suggest Turnaround For Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Fresh Government figures today lent strong support to the notion that the slow economy of recent months is heading for better times, not a recession.
 Fears of recession ebbed as the Commerce Department reported that consumers spent less warily this spring than had been thought. Retail sales were up an estimated seven-tenths of 1 percent in June on top of a gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent in May, which was originally reported as a rise of just two-tenths. 
 In addition, industrial production ended a streak of declines to post its first gain, albeit a minimal one, since January.
 "The economy is not slipping into recession as some had feared," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist for North America at Paribas Capital Markets. "We may be nearing the end of the inventory correction," he added, referring to the pileup of unsold goods during the spring that increasingly looks as if it is about to shrink. .
 And while the economy may wind up recording some modest growth in the second quarter after all, most analysts said the current evidence that a rebound was ahead did not rule out further easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
 That is because the Government also released figures today that showed inflation remaining quite subdued. The Government calculated that consumer prices edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent in June, the smallest rise since November.
 "On the surface, today's spending data will fuel skepticism about the wisdom of the Federal Reserve's latest easing move as well as the prospect of any further steps," John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, told clients. "However, the underlying pattern of moderate growth and relatively low inflation suggests a period ahead of stable to lower bond yields in which the Fed is more likely than not to find additional opportunities to pare short rates."
 Just over a week ago the central bank cut the benchmark overnight interest rate it controls by one-quarter of a percentage point, reversing policy after seven upward steps between February 1994 and February 1995. Those increases doubled the overnight rate, from 3 percent to 6 percent.
 Another factor providing leeway for further rate cuts is that the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities -- a closely watched gauge of potential inflation pressure -- continued to decline in June, according to the Fed report. At 83.5 percent, utilization is now two full percentage points below the peak set in December and January.
 But it was the sales report that captured much of the attention today, contributing to a rise in interest rates that dragged the stock market down.
 The climb of seven-tenths of 1 percent was dominated by a rebound in the automotive sector, where dealers' receipts climbed 1.9 percent with the aid of hefty incentives. Merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes posted a gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent while those selling furniture and other home equipment took in an estimated three-tenths of 1 percent more money than in May.
 But excluding the automotive sector, sales rose just three-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department's report also showed. That was primarily because sales of nondurables, which account for 60 percent of retail sales, were less robust. Indeed, food stores had a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent in sales, and restaurants and bars saw receipts fall two-tenths of 1 percent.
 Total sales of $196 billion were 5.9 percent higher than in June 1994, without any adjustment for inflation.
 Just as important as the June gain, analysts said, was the upward revision that lifted the May gain to nine-tenths of 1 percent. Some analysts said these results suggested -- contrary to expectations by many that the economy had dipped in the spring -- that there was at least some economic growth during the second quarter.
 Today's figures, said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities, "diminish the probability of a recession."
 The Fed's report on production showed a modest rise for consumer goods following months of sizable declines, with motor vehicle assembly running at the same 11.5 million annual rate as in May.
 Factory output edged up one-tenth of 1 percent after two declines averaging five-tenths of 1 percent; mines produced 1 percent more than in May, but utility production resumed a decline that has pushed output 2.5 percent below the June 1994 level.
 As for the Consumer Price Index, a second straight month of sharp declines in automobile finance charges and used-car prices helped limit the overall rise to a negligible one-tenth of 1 percent, the Labor Department report showed. The price of used cars had surged 15.8 percent in the 12 months through April.
 On the other hand, air fares jumped 8.4 percent in June, to bring the increase so far this year to 20.4 percent. Energy prices rose substantially for the third month in a row. Drugs and medical supplies posted their first monthly increase of 1995 but this did not accelerate overall medical costs, which have risen every month so far this year by three-tenths of 1 percent.
 Excluding food and energy, consumer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same as in May.
 Services, which account for nearly 57 percent of the index, rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month while commodity prices were unchanged, the report also showed.
 The index for all urban consumers now stands at 152.5, which means that a group of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-84 period now costs $15.25.

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasuries Retreat On Strong Retail Spending

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower yesterday after a Government report showed surprising strength in consumer spending. The report shook the market's view of a slowing economy and cast doubt on the prospects for another cut in short-term interest rates.
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 22/32 yesterday, to 1139/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its prices, rose to 6.60 percent, from 6.55 percent on Thursday. The price of the two-year bill also fell, pushing its yield up to 5.68 percent from 5.59 percent. 
 The Commerce Department said yesterday that retail sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in June, exceeding analysts' expectations of a gain of five-tenths of 1 percent.
 "If the consumer continues to go out on a spending spree, it's going to be much more difficult to see rates moving lower," said Barbara Kenworthy, who manages $3 billion in bonds at Prudential Investment Advisers in Newark.
 Many traders have been expecting another cut in interest rates since last week, when the Fed reduced its target for the Federal funds rate to 5.75 percent from 6 percent. The move matched the market's expectations given recent reports showing a sharp slowing of the economy, and bond prices rallied.
 But prices have slipped this week on profit taking and as traders await further clues to the direction of the economy.
Contributing to a picture of a resilient economy yesterday was the Federal Reserve's report on industrial production, which showed a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in June.
 Still, these signs of growth came amid further evidence that inflation was restrained. The Labor Department reported yesterday that consumer prices rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in June, the best performance since a similar small increase in November.
 And some traders said that the retail sales report did not necessarily indicate a resilient economy.
 "The key number was the retail sales less cars, and that was actually a little lower than expected," said Andrew Brenner, senior trader at Nomura Securities International. "If you take into account all the discounted sales, they were just kind of winnowing down inventory."
 Bond prices were also hurt by a report that indicated that Americans were more optimistic about the economy, suggesting that spending by individuals, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, could keep rising.
 The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for July rose to 94.1 from 92.7 in June and 89.8 in May, analysts familiar with the report said. The index is released only to paying subscribers. Americans are also growing more hopeful about the future, according to the university's preliminary expectations index, which rose to 85.5, from 84.1 in June.
 In the corporate market, "the environment is still very favorable" for new supply, said Michael Gray, who manages $2.5 billion of fixed-income assets at the Fidelity Management and Research Company in Boston.
 Funds that buy investment-grade bonds received $178.1 million in cash in the week ended Wednesday, bringing to almost $1.5 billion the cash that has flowed into these funds in the last two months, according to AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif., which tracks mutual fund money flows.
 On Thursday, the Raytheon Company sold $1.125 billion of bonds, 50 percent more than originally planned, in its first public bond sale.
 Two more large bond sales are on the way. The World Bank is planning to sell another $1.5 billion of 10-year global notes as early as next week, Hakan Lonaeus, the bank's chief financial operations officer, said.
 Global bonds are sold simultaneously in the United States, Europe and Asia and trade around the clock.
 The Swiss Bank Corporation is expected to sell $500 million of debt with maturities of 10 and 30 years in the days ahead, according to MCM Corporate Watch, which tracks sales of fixed-income and other securities.
 In the municipal bond market, bonds fell as investors continued to demand higher yields, amid concern that tax proposals in Congress would trim the advantage munis hold over other fixed-income investments, traders said.

HEADLINE: State Seeks Casino Offers With Hefty Guarantees

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: NEWINGTON, Conn., July 14

 BODY:
Taking an important step toward opening a casino in Bridgeport, Gov. John G. Rowland issued a formal call today for proposals from developers that required guarantees to the state of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
 The request for proposals represents the latest round in a three-year-old campaign by civic and political leaders in Bridgeport to win state approval for a gambling and entertainment complex to revive their ailing city. And again there is one central question: Will any prospective developer be able to guarantee that it can cover the money that the Mashantucket Pequot Indians would stop paying the state if they were stripped of their monopoly on casino gambling? 
 The tribe, which operates the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, has said it will cut off its monthly payments to the state the moment the Legislature passes a law that threatens to end the monopoly on slot machines that the state granted the Pequot and Mohegan tribes. That would cost the state a projected $150 million next year and $230 million in 1997, when the Mohegans are expected to open their casino.
 At a news conference at the Division of Special Revenues here today, Governor Rowland, a Republican, laid out the process for insuring that the state would not lose money by allowing a new casino. Both he and gaming company representatives at the event were cautiously optimistic that the state could find a satisfactory deal.
 "I am delighted to be spearheading a plan that should result in one of the finest casino and entertainment complexes in the country," Mr. Rowland said, calling the casino "the most realistic bridge" to bringing in more economic development to Bridgeport.
 "I remain excited by the prospect of the thousands of jobs that will be created by this dramatic initiative."
 Whether any developers can actually meet the state's requirements will be determined by the end of September, when a special commission must select a proposal or rule that none is adequate. If one is selected and Mr. Rowland accepts it, a special session of the Legislature will be convened to decide whether to authorize it and break the agreement with the Mashantucket Pequots.
 Under the process started today, developers have a deadline of Aug. 18 to submit proposals that show they would equal this lost revenue through gaming taxes on their operation and other sources. All proposals must also be accompanied by a $610 million letter of credit that the state could immediately draw upon if the developer failed to meet its monthly payment.
 The $610 million equals the $150 million expected next year from the Indians plus a projected $230 million that could be lost from them in each of the following two.
 "Most of the major casino operators have lines of credit of $1 billion that they can draw down from," said Brendan Kennedy, a consultant representing Harrah's Casinos Inc., which operates 16 casinos in the United States. "That's not a great amount of money when paid out over a period of time."
 The casino operator would also be required to make a $150 million payment the first year, followed by annual payments of $230 million until 2006. To guarantee this, the operator would have to renew its letter of credit every three years.
 In return, Mr. Rowland said, the state would not allow any other casinos to open during that time.
 All proposals are expected to provide two scenarios for providing the state the revenue it seeks. In one, the developer must consider only money from a tax on the casino's gross gaming revenues. In the other, the developer may also include revenues from placing 6,250 slot machines at dog tracks, Offtrack Betting simulcast parlors and Jai Alai frontons.
The gross gaming tax would be at least 16 percent, making it the highest such tax in the nation.
 Richard D. Bronson, a Mirage Resorts director who has been lobbying to open the Bridgeport casino since 1992, said that the company was likely to submit a proposal but that it would need time to review the 112 pages of criteria that the state released today. The amount asked for in the letter of credit did not faze him, he said, adding that the time frame was longer than he had expected.
 Still, some critics remained skeptical that any casino could make a profit under these conditions and noted that new casinos are expected to open in the next 10 years in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York, making the gaming market more competitive.
 "I have questions whether this area, New England, can support all of this gambling," said State Senator James T. Fleming, Republican of Simsbury, a leader of the anti-casino forces.
 Yet Mr. Fleming and others praised Mr. Rowland for starting the process, saying his efforts would help resolve a divisive issue.
 Charles J. Duffy, a lobbyist for the Pequot tribe, which has worked to stop the opening of a Bridgeport casino, said: "I think it's a sound and reasonable way to come up with an answer to the question that has been before the state for years: Can the state come up with a better deal than the one we've given them?"

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Mexican Bailout Defended Amid G.O.P. Criticism

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Top Treasury officials today defended the American-led bailout of Mexico last winter as a success, but Congressional Republicans criticized the Administration for lending more money to Mexico this summer.
 Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, told the Senate Banking Committee that the Treasury's $20 billion line of credit was essential in preventing a financial crisis in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America that would have threatened economic growth and national security in the United States. 
 "The objective of promoting United States exports, jobs, security of our borders, in our judgment, is being accomplished," Mr. Rubin said. "We have also avoided the spillover into other emerging markets that we think could easily have happened."
 Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, the committee's chairman, criticized the Administration for lending Mexico $2.5 billion on July 5, on top of the $10 billion lent during the first half of this year. He was particularly critical of Mr. Summers, who had told a House panel in March that the second half of the $20 billion would only be lent if "contingencies" justified it.
 The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, and Senator D'Amato called last week for the United States to stop lending money to Mexico.
 Democrats and Republicans have been maneuvering this summer to avoid any blame from the public for Mexico's sharp devaluation of the peso last winter, which drastically reduced sales of American goods there and provoked a financial panic that the United States stopped only with huge loans. Mr. D'Amato in particular, who scheduled today's hearing, has contended that the Administration should have disclosed early last year the concerns of some officials that Mexico's reliance on short-term foreign investments was not sustainable.
 Yet the potential for partisanship on the issue has been limited by the fact that Mr. Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia both supported President Clinton's efforts last winter to help Mexico. When Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, noted this at today's hearing, Mr. D'Amato, a key supporter of Senator Dole's Presidential campaign, shifted uneasily in his chair.
 Mr. Summers said today that the United States had to lend the additional $2.5 billion to reduce any uncertainty about Mexico's ability to make payments on a clump of $7 billion in bonds coming due in the next several weeks. But he insisted that the overall Mexican economy remained sound, and apologized for having indicated in the spring that the second half of the $20 billion might not be spent.
 "I think in retrospect the word 'contingencies' may have been poorly chosen," he said. Mexico's financial plight turned out to be worse than expected during the first month of the American bailout, prompting large loans, but the Mexican economy has recovered faster than expected since then, Mr. Summers added.
 Mr. Rubin noted that the first announcement of the bailout had said that once the first half of the money had been lent, "using the same terms and conditions, another $10 billion will become available -- as needed and in stages -- beginning in July."
 But Mr. Rubin added, "We regret any incorrect impression we might have left that the second $10 billion would be available only for an emergency."
 Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, also assailed the Administration for having bailed out foreign investors in Mexico, who were effectively repaid with the money from American loans to the Mexican Government. California investors in the bonds of bankrupt Orange County have no similar guarantee of getting their money back, she said.
 Mr. Rubin said that foreign bondholders were the unintentional beneficiaries of an American financial rescue aimed at helping Mexico. Mr. Summers said that while large chunks of the initial American loans might have been used to repay foreign investors, more and more of the money was being used in Mexico. About $8 billion of the $22 billion lent by the United States and international financial agencies has effectively stayed in Mexico, he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Modest Advance On Signs of Stronger Economy

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar was slightly higher against most leading currencies yesterday, helped by economic reports showing resilient strength in the United States economy.
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales were up seven-tenths of 1 percent in June, a greater rise than expected. The strength in consumer spending seen in the report suggested that the Federal Reserve would not have reason to cut short-term interest rates anytime soon. Lower rates often hurt the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits less attractive. 
 The strong retail sales figures "question the view that the consumer is shriveling," said Amy Smith, senior currency market strategist at IDEA, a consulting firm.
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the Consumer Price Index inched up one-tenth of 1 percent in June.
 The report seems "to confirm the view that price pressures are receding," said Callum Henderson, senior currency analyst at MMS International in New York. "That's positive for any currency, and very good long term for U.S. assets."
 The dollar rose even as American bond and stock markets fell.
 The gains in the dollar, however, were limited by lingering disappointment over the Bundesbank's decision not to lower interest rates. A number of currency dealers had bet that the German central bank would take its cue from recent rate cuts by the Fed, the Bank of Japan and several European central banks. When the Bundesbank held rates steady after a policy-setting meeting on Thursday, the dollar tumbled.
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.3903 German marks from 1.3877 marks on Thursday. The dollar rose to 87.83 Japanese yen from 87.35 yen.
 The dollar was also supported by worries over the health of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. Concern mounted after Russian officials said Mr. Yeltsin had canceled a trip to Norway and would remain in the hospital until Monday.
 While the German mark is typically the traders' choice as the safe-haven currency in times of politial turmoil, the mark is considered vulnerable during turmoil in Russia because of the close economic ties between the two countries.
 Questions about Mr. Yeltsin's health "prevent people from being very bearish on the U.S. dollar because of the fact that there could be a politically unstable situation in Russia if he is removed," said Belal Khan, chief customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo in New York.

HEADLINE: Tactics Used Against Squatters Anger Neighbors and Stores

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Art Guerra, a painter, supports his art with the business he runs on the Lower East Side, Guerra Paint, a supply store frequented by other artists and interior decorators. But for the last several weeks, business has been seriously down, he said -- and not because of a market slowdown, rising costs or any of the other ordinary economic hazards.
 It is Mr. Guerra's misfortune to have his store at 510 East 13th Street, between Avenue A and Avenue B, a block that has been cordoned off by the police since late May, when, in quasi-military fashion, the city evicted squatters living in two tenement buildings. Since then, officers have been stopping drivers and sometimes pedestrians, asking them their business on the block and encouraging mere passers-by to go elsewhere. 
 "A lot of my customers are from Westchester and Connecticut, and they're already scared to come down here," Mr. Guerra said. "Then they see the police barricades and forget it. We're strangled. We're down 60 or 70 percent."
 Indeed, Mr. Guerra, whose shop is near Avenue A, is not the only businessman suffering. Hermes Hernandez, who owns the City Water Meter Repair Company in midblock, said the deliveries he has had to make because customers have not been allowed through the barricades had cost him $2,000 so far.
 The barricades at both ends of the street and a 24-hour police presence on the block, often more than a dozen officers at a time, were supposed to quiet a volatile situation and keep the squatters from returning.
 But the tactics have effectively shut off the flow of customers for many businesses on the block. They have also enraged many residents, who rail against being asked for identification scant feet from their front doors. People complain of having to meet visitors at the corner, contending that the police officers are disrupting their lives far more than the squatters ever did.
 "I had to come down from my fifth-floor walk-up to wait for my babysitter in the heat on the corner because they won't let her car on the block," said Marisa Dedominicis, an 11-year resident of 544 East 13th. "I'm so outraged at the whole scenario. The cops have been abusing their authority. They're obnoxious. When are they going to leave?"
 The police said yesterday that no one knew when the captain of the Ninth Precinct would decide to open the street.
 The 500 block of East 13th Street is largely residential, with a handful of businesses. It's a bohemian environment, home to artists and blue-collar workers. It also has a drug trade, although it is no longer as prevalent as it once was. Small trees line the street, and a couple of makeshift gardens have sprung up between the tenements, none of which are taller than six stories. Five squatters buildings, three still occupied, line the north side near Avenue B.
 In yesterday's heat, people were baking but busy, battling sweat and lethargy. The police themselves were less than vigilant, as pedestrian traffic moved relatively freely through the barricades, but that failed to soothe the irate.
 "There's an uncertainty about who can enter the block and who can't," said Joan Nicholson, who has lived on East 13th for 16 years. "There's a tense atmosphere here. The squatters never threatened us, but I have felt threatened by the police."
 Most of the angry residents admitted that many neighbors were not upset by the police presence, but those people were not much in evidence yesterday. One man who expressed support for the police was Butch Johnson, a squatter in one of the still-occupied buildings.
 "You don't have hooligans running up and down the block, frightening my wife, frightening my children," Mr. Johnson said, referring to the angry demonstrations that had taken place during and after the evictions. "The police are calming things down. All I know is I'm getting a good night's sleep."
 Sgt. Peter Wang, who was in charge of the 16-officer force on the block yesterday, said he was aware of some disgruntlement among the residents.
 "But you're never going to please everybody," he said. He denied that the officers were harassing anyone and said the policy dictated that the officers go out of their way not to disrupt the life of the block.
 "If they live on the block, they're free to come and go as they please," Sgt. Wang said. "Anyone who has business on the block, we're letting them through. Or even if they just want to park on the block, we let them."
 That perspective was widely disputed, most loudly by Danny Lord, a professional clown. Mr. Lord, 45, admits that he has a smart mouth and that he regularly glares at the officers at the barricades. On Monday night, just after midnight, Mr. Lord left his apartment at 513 East 13th to go to the delicatessen and glared at a police officer.
 When he returned 15 minutes later, he said, the officer would not let him back in because he had no identification. An argument ensued, and he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.
 While many longtime residents of the block seem to feel under siege, some newcomers are feeling the heat as well. On the corner of Avenue B, where the police presence is the heaviest, Dante Wilder, a new store owner, is looking for customers for On Point, a small T-shirt boutique he opened in mid-May. Since the squatters were evicted at 541 and 547 East 13th, On Point, which is at 549, next to the now-boarded-up buildings, has been empty. Police cars parked on the corner keep passers-by on Avenue B from seeing his shop, and potential customers are being questioned by police.
 "If someone gets hassled, they're not going to come back," Mr. Wilder said. "I really want to make this work, and it feels like it's not working."

Heroes, Icons and Monuments

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
EARLIER this week, a small group of amateur athletics officials gathered in Manhattan to celebrate a monumental moment in track and field as the New York Athletic Club became the official home of the Jesse Owens International Trophy.
 Since 1981, the trophy has been awarded annually to the amateur or Olympic athlete who best personifies the qualities attributed to Owens: great athletic achievement, sportsmanship and a sincere commitment to cooperation among people of all nations. 
 Herb Douglas, the founder of the trophy, said that the New York Athletic Club is the perfect home for the Owens trophy because of its commitment to amateur athletics. The N.Y.A.C. was the country's first governing body for amateur athletics. In 1876 it sponsored the first national track and field championships and later put on the first national boxing and wrestling championships. It is the home of an exclusive collection of trophies and memorabilia, including a small American flag from the 1912 Olympics signed by, among others, Jim Thorpe.
 For some, however, the biting irony of keeping the trophy in the N.Y.A.C. is that the club at one time did not admit African-Americans or women.
 During the ceremony, Douglas, a bronze medalist in the 1948 Olympics and close friend of Owens, said that Owens was forgiving and that his response to racism was to pull together. "Jesse used to say: 'We all came here on different boats,' " Douglas said, " 'but if we all don't row together America will sink. I'm going to do all I can do to keep it afloat.' "
 So it is, the New York Athletic Club not only houses one of the most prestigious awards in track and field but also, according to Douglas, the first international sporting trophy named after an African-American.
Fifteen years after his death, Owens has extended his legacy and given us yet another reason to remember him. How many young athletes today think for even a moment about how they will be remembered next week, much less 20 years from now?
 Athletes have difficulty achieving the same level of importance after their careers. They operate in a world of action, of the here and now, of short term gain. When the action stops, the athletic life ends.
 Owens's legacy has less to do with athletic feats than with the way he symbolized profound truths about the United States and problems not yet resolved.
 What legacies will his heirs leave?
 Mike Tyson, regardless of what he does from this point on, will be remembered for serving a prison term for rape. Dwight Gooden, once regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball, will be remembered as a player whose career was cut short by drugs.
 This failing of foresight is not just a contemporary phenomenon in sports. Everyone talks about the good old days, but sports did as much to obscure an athlete's vision then as it does now. Certain types of misbehavior were tolerated, even encouraged, as an expression of the American male way.
 Mickey Mantle's news conference before the All-Star Game was a poignant testament. The Mick essentially repented moving blindly, recklessly through his career with no direction or higher goal. "God gave me the ability to play baseball and I wasted it," he said. "I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to make up. I want to start giving something back."
 Still, the young contemporary athlete who wants to use visibility as a forum to effect change faces a greater challenge than Jesse Owens.
 Causes are not defined in black and white as they were in previous generations. They are defined by green, by economic disenfranchisement, by thwarted access to quality education.
 If courage was the watchword for Owens's generation, sharing is the challenge of the 21st century. This concept is an anathema to a generation of athletes weaned on self interest, blinded by celebrity and counseled by barracudas. Contending with these forces makes it difficult to see oneself in a larger role.
 Yet, vision needs to be expanded. The fundamental issues of race, gender and equality that Owens faced 50 years ago persist today but in a different form.
 Contemplating the so called "new breed" of athletes, I wonder how many of their careers will stand for more than dunks and touchdowns.
 Who will stand the test of time?

Such Stuff as Dreams

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
The moon hanging right over the stage wasn't quite full. Not everything can be perfect. But for a vision of ecstasy in New York City, it would be hard to top the scene in Central Park last Sunday night as 1,900 people watched "The Tempest."
The tickets were free. The performance transformed an urban patch of green into an island paradise, carpeted in sand and bewitched by apparitions. And there was Patrick Stewart as Prospero: as the old magician finally gave up his powers at evening's end, the actor pointedly spoke the final verses of Shakespeare's valedictory play without a microphone. Mr. Stewart's metallic baritone, nurtured at England's Royal Shakespeare Company and known to Americans from "Star Trek: The Next Generation," carried effortlessly -- even though the house is as large as any Broadway barn, with an acoustically worthless canopy of stars for a roof. 
 Theater doesn't get more timeless; for a moment, you would think there had always been Shakespeare in the park. But in fact it dates only as far back as government arts funding. "There was art in America before 1965," goes the rallying cry of those who would kill the National Endowment for the Arts, which was founded in that year. Yes -- but not for everyone.
On Sunday night George Wolfe, who now runs the New York Shakespeare Festival and who directed this "Tempest," introduced the show with a dedication to the festival's founder, Joseph Papp. As Congress pushed the N.E.A. to the edge of oblivion this week, it was the perfect moment to remind audiences of Papp's old dream. Papp died in 1991, and at this time of crisis his pit-bull defense of public culture is conspicuously missed. Like Patrick Stewart, he always made himself heard.
When Papp began campaigning in 1957 for a free theater in Central Park, the goal was simple but revolutionary -- to find a new mass audience for the author he most loved. He likened his scheme to that of the public library: only if tickets, like library books, were free might newcomers to the classics, especially the young, be tempted to check them out.
Shakespeare had once been popular culture in America. As the historian Lawrence W. Levine reminds us, those con men in "Huckleberry Finn," the "duke" and the "king," look upon performing "Richard III" and "Romeo and Juliet" as a get-rich-quick scheme -- such plays were the rock concerts of the 19th century. In our century, though, Shakespeare has become high culture, seen and read mainly by an intellectual and economic elite. Papp rather madly thought he could reverse the tide.
He badgered city officials for financial support, but Robert Moses, the all-powerful Parks Commissioner, argued that audiences should pay instead. Papp wouldn't budge. Not only did he believe that government had a civic duty to disseminate culture, but as a practical matter he knew he needed the imprimatur of city backing to persuade foundations and arts patrons to pitch in. Like today's N.E.A. critics, Mayor Robert Wagner at first declared that culture "is not an operation of government." Then he relented, anticipating the role Washington would play in the arts (Papp's theater included) a few years hence.
This year it costs the New York Shakespeare Festival $1.7 million to put on "The Tempest" and its upcoming "Troilus and Cressida" in the park. Though public funds account for only 26 percent, or $440,000, of that amount -- and the N.E.A. only $50,000 of that -- that figure still exceeds contributions by foundations ($283,000), corporations ($66,000) and individuals ($300,000). And even with all these donors, the summer season will leave a $661,000 debt.
No, not every park production is great, and no, Papp alone could not prevent pop culture from becoming that nightmare of depravity politicians now deride. But the best publicly funded theater, like "The Tempest," towers over most of what passes for serious drama in the commercial marketplace, at $60 a ticket. (Have you seen "Indiscretions"?) And better still, every child attending the New York Shakespeare Festival or the countless others created in its image with N.E.A. support is one less child consuming Rupert Murdoch TV trash and gangsta rap.
Or such is the case this summer. Enjoy Papp's dream, like Prospero's enchanted island, while it lasts.

HEADLINE: Those Few Cents Give Us Clout in the World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
John R. Kasich, House Budget Committee chairman, argues that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation should be eliminated from the Federal budget (Op-Ed, July 9). 
 As Mr. Kasich notes, the money involved is a pittance: $58.2 million of a $1.6 trillion budget. In the budget of a typical middle-class family -- let's say $40,000 a year -- this would be about 15 cents.
We Americans have had a bad habit of trying to avoid involvement in developing nations until a crisis demands we send in troops to restore order. OPIC's purpose -- encouraging investment in developing countries through loan guarantees, insurance against political risks and providing financing for overseas investment -- is the best way to encourage stable economic growth in countries where it is most needed.
Mr. Kasich should address the real problems at the root of excessive government spending, instead of wasting his time and energy on this 15-cent issue.

HEADLINE: Federal Chill Is Felt By Those in the Arts

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
For some time now, arts groups around the country have been bracing for big cuts in Federal spending on the arts. But few were prepared for Thursday's move by Republicans in the House of Representatives to shut down the national arts and humanities endowments altogether within the next two years.
While the outcome of the House's actions remains unclear -- the proposals must first pass the entire House and then the Senate -- the mere fact that the abolition of the endowments had come to a vote jolted many arts groups into grappling with the unthinkable: life without Federal money. 
 At a three-day Arts and Business Council conference coincidentally being held in Manhattan late this week, dozens of arts representatives, grant givers and business leaders were already convening panels on how to deal with an anticipated financing shortfall. Still the news from Washington drastically changed the atmosphere.
"We're already talking about the post-N.E.A. era and the vote has not even been held yet," lamented Lindy Zesch, deputy director of the Theater Communications Group and a former endowment aide. "I think everyone agrees that the private sector cannot possibly close the gap created by the Contract With America."
In other parts of the country, reaction was also somber. Roche Schufler, the executive director of the Goodman Theater in Chicago and chairman of American Arts Alliance, blamed "people in Congress who are determined to misrepresent the picture of what the agency has accomplished over the past 30 years."
But he added: "This didn't start yesterday and it isn't going to end tomorrow. We are going to keep working and we are going to prevail in the end. We aren't going away. The arts are not going to cease to exist. And people in the arts are not going to stop speaking out."
Others also said they saw events as part of a sequence of developments that have been reconfiguring the culture world, much as economic retrenchments after Wall Street's high-flying years created sober new realities in the corporate world.
"We went through shock, denial and advocacy," said Robert N. Sellar, the northeast community relations manager for the International Business Machines Corporation. Anticipating cutbacks in arts financing, Mr. Sellar convened arts groups for a series of round-table discussions five years ago that helped lead to the business-arts seminar this week. The final stage, he said, was "recognition of reality."
The talks, he said, were therapeutic, reminding hard-pressed arts groups: "You are not alone."
Others were just plain angry. Robert T. Buck, the director of the Brooklyn Museum, pronounced himself surprised by "the the scorpionlike swiftness" of the two-year deadline. "I think this sounds like the result of total madness," he said.
"It sounds like Congress in total zoolike disarray," he said. "Jurassic Congress."
Jane Alexander, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, who was in New York yesterday to preside over an awards ceremony at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, declined to comment on the Congressional action.
The arts and humanities endowments, which distribute grants totaling about $300 million a year, were to have at least three to five years more to run under House and Senate measures. The debate in the so-called culture wars is to resume next week.
At the Arts and Business Council conference, which was held at the Smith Barney building in lower Manhattan and ended yesterday, updates on the events in Congress were distributed by Nancy Meier, the executive director of the council, which brings together people in the arts and business and has affiliates in 30 cities.
Many of the arts representatives went to the conference seeking to make contacts with businessmen seeking affiliations with cultural groups. Ms. Meier cautioned some of the hopefuls against expecting quick results.
"Building a sponsorship takes time," she said. "You've got to build a relationship."
She said there was a danger, particularly in the current climate, that arts groups might be tempted to tailor their programs to attract corporate sponsors.
Mr. Sellar, of I.B.M., said corporations were driven by self-interest in sponsoring arts groups. The relationship, he said, has to enhance the corporate image, and companies shy away from controversy: a sobering thought for anti-establishment artists.
Private giving to the arts (fostered by tax deductibility) vastly overshadows the public contributions, a fact that cuts both ways in the debate. Opponents of Government financing argue that the arts are already largely relying on private support, so the Federal endowments are dispensable. Proponents of the status quo counter that private givers are doing a big part, so the Government can do a small part.
According to figures compiled by the Trust for Philanthropy of the American Association of Fund Raising Counsel, however, private giving to the arts -- which accounts for about a third of all income to nonprofit arts groups -- is not making up for government cutbacks.
The figures, distributed at the conference, showed arts giving totaling $9.6 billion last year, a drop of nearly 2 percent from the year before when inflation was factored in. Overall, private giving to all causes stayed marginally ahead of inflation at nearly $130 billion last year.
But while private support is a much larger factor than Federal and state grants in the arts in general and helps sustain leading arts institutions, many small arts groups in particular rely on public grants for survival, which explains in part why the proposed Federal cuts are so bemoaned.
Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center, called the House action "not only short-sighted, but it ignores the fact that the arts, unlike almost everything else that's funded by the government, are an economic engine."
"The sad fact is that after all these years we still have to justify support for the arts," Mr. Leventhal said. "It's discouraging to have to make the same arguments over and over."
Martha Wilson, the director of the Franklin Furnace Archive, an avant-garde performance space in Manhattan, said events were moving faster than anyone had predicted.
"The small institutions have seen the writing on the wall for years." she said. "Since 1990 we've been aware that the avant-garde is not popular. The big ones are now seeing that the waves of conservativism are lapping at their steps, too. The climate that was once warm is now cold, and we will have to find other ways to survive."
Jonathan Katz, the chief executive officer of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, whose members get block grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, said the value of the Federal dollars was that they provide stability and predictability for arts organizations and artists.
"This is not an issue of government agencies," Mr. Katz said. "It's an issue that affects people who live in cities and suburbs and rural areas. It's about the frequency and quality of the art available to them to participate in."
"The war isn't lost," he added. "The thing that arts organizations do have is the power to get elected officials to an arts event and turn them into arts advocates."

HEADLINE: Blacks See Opening in A.F.L.-C.I.O. Leadership Fight

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Black labor leaders, who have protested for years that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has ignored their concerns, now see in the struggle for the presidency of the union federation a rare opportunity to demand a much greater voice for blacks in the nation's labor movement.
The black leaders have drawn up 11 demands, most calling for more blacks in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s hierarchy and the hierarchies of its individual unions. The two candidates vying for president of the federation have promised to bring more "diversity" to the labor movement. But so far neither has explained in any detail how he would do this. 
 "The contest for the presidency that is now taking place is really a debate over how to revive the labor movement," said William Lucy, president of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, "and as organized labor redefines itself, our needs must be clarified and addressed."
The coalition presented the 11 demands to John J. Sweeney, one of the candidates, on July 7.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., in its 40 years, has never had a struggle for the presidency. One aging white male president has passed the mantle to another, and leadership was confined to an executive council composed almost entirely of white men, as it still is. But the decline of union power and the arrival of a Republican-controlled Congress hostile to unions prompted insurgents in the federation to push for the resignation of Lane Kirkland, president since 1979.
Mr. Kirkland plans to retire this summer, and two rivals, both white, have emerged to succeed him: Thomas R. Donahue, who has been Mr. Kirkland's second in command as secretary-treasurer, and Mr. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union.
Black union leaders say they were not consulted in selecting either candidate for the October election.
"Decisions were made that Donahue and Sweeney would be the candidates," said William Burrus, executive vice president of the American Postal Workers Union, "and those decisions were made without including us. Now, after the fact, they are reaching out to hear our views.
"Well, we have demands for internal changes in the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and while we don't speak for women, Asians and Hispanics, collectively we represent a sizable force in organized labor."
While white male membership in American unions has declined to 49.7 percent of the total as of 1994 from 55.8 percent in 1986, the percentage of blacks and white women in unions has risen to 46.6 percent from 41.1 percent over the same period. Blacks alone represent 15.5 percent, up from 14 percent in 1986.
Mr. Burrus is to lead a delegation of black leaders who will meet with Mr. Donahue in the next week or so.
Responding to the coalition's petition, Robert Moore, a vice president of the service employees union, said Mr. Sweeney was "supportive of all the points."
Mr. Donahue said in an interview, "My initial effort is to get the advice of all the minority groups."
So far, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists has been the most critical of the groups representing minority workers, with some of its leaders even declining invitations to run for the No. 2 spot on the Sweeney or Donahue ticket -- describing such invitations as "tokenism."
The coalition came into existence in 1972 after the A.F.L.-C.I.O. leadership decided not to endorse either President Richard M. Nixon or George McGovern, his Democratic rival, in that year's Presidential election. Black union leaders avidly supported Mr. McGovern, and the coalition became their vehicle for backing him.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. leadership ignored the coalition for years, and only in the mid 1980's began sending representatives regularly to its annual conventions. Instead, the federation has subsidized other organizations representing women and minorities, including blacks. These have not been particularly vocal in the current leadership struggle.
Today the coalition's 20,000 members, all of them members of mainstream unions affiliated with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., turn to the coalition for support in pushing their views in their local union chapters. Since some of these affiliated unions support Mr. Donahue and others Mr. Sweeney, the coalition has decided not to favor either man.
"What we are trying to do is to provide a positive set of policies and directions that both candidates can embrace," said Mr. Lucy, who is also secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
The coalition, in its formal demands, asked that the federation's executive council be altered to include more minorities. Among the other demands were these: More minorities and women should be included in union delegations sent to A.F.L.-C.I.O. conventions; the federation should hire more blacks for staff jobs as department heads, and black leaders should be included "in the drafting of strategies for organizing industries and plants that employ a higher percentage of minorities."
If changes like these had been made earlier, Mr. Lucy said, the debate on issues like the North American Free Trade Agreement would have been different. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. opposed Nafta on the ground that Americans would lose jobs as companies shifted operations to Mexico.
What should have also been stressed in that debate, Mr. Lucy said, was a civil rights issue: The agreement diverts corporate investment away from urban communities where unemployed blacks might have gained employment.
"With a black viewpoint included, the campaign against Nafta might have been a lot deeper and broader," Mr. Lucy said.

Jaguar to Get State Aid To Build Car in Britain

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Jaguar has decided to build its new model in Britain, with help from a grant of 80 million ($128 million), which was announced yesterday by the Government. The Ford Motor Company, which owns Jaguar, had threatened to build the car in the United States unless it received substantial assistance. The Department of Trade and Industry said the Government was contributing 48 million and the rest was coming from local agencies. 
 Jaguar's X200, which is scheduled to reach the market in 1999, will be smaller than Jaguar's current cars. The Department of Trade and Industry said the X200 would create about 1,300 jobs at Jaguar's plant near Birmingham and at Ford's plant near Liverpool.

HEADLINE: Decade-Old New York Newsday To Cease Publishing Tomorrow

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
New York Newsday, a suburban newspaper's bold experiment in breaking into the largest and most competitive city market with a new type of tabloid, will publish its last issue tomorrow, its publishers said yesterday.
The paper, which emerged in the economic boom of the mid-1980's, was the victim of corporate pressures for profits and of a newspaper market that changed sharply over the last decade, as the paper struggled to build a readership from a new middle class in the city, particularly Brooklyn and Queens. 
 New York Newsday won critical praise -- and three Pulitzer Prizes -- with an approach to news that tried to mix the entertaining elements of old-style tabloid newspapers with the in-depth news coverage of more serious newspapers. It was called the "tabloid in a tutu," and among journalists the nickname stuck.
But in its 10 years of life, the paper lost an estimated $100 million. In the end, the new chief executive of the paper's corporate owner, the Times Mirror Company, decided that New York Newsday was not economically feasible.
The executive, Mark H. Willes, praised the paper in a statement announcing the closing. "We have been pleased to provide New Yorkers with a strong and vibrant newspaper, and it is a sad event to have to end that role," the statement read.
"But we have concluded," it continued, "that in spite of its superb editorial content, New York Newsday's opportunities to earn an appropriate rate of return are limited."
Newsday executives said that after a 60-day severance period, 700 to 800 of New York and Long Island Newsday's 3,200 employees would lose their jobs. The layoffs, the company said, would be based on seniority.
At the paper yesterday, the mood was one of disbelief. "It's like knowing a plane could crash but thinking it would never be yours," said Steve Gunn, the deputy metropolitan editor. Cornelia Caraballo, a news aide, was rushing to finish her first article when the news hit that there would no longer be a newspaper where she could dream about becoming a reporter. Susan Forrest, a police reporter, called in when her beeper went off. "Baby, it's over," her bureau chief told her.
Readers, journalists and public figures expressed shock yesterday at the suddenness of Times Mirror's move. Many said they were particularly saddened at the loss of yet another journalistic voice in the city.
"This is a very big blow to the city," said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, "particularly because this is a city that used to have, when I was young, a dozen newspapers, before that even more. And the diversity of opinion I think was very, very valuable to a city like New York, and each one of the newspapers is made a better newspaper by competition from the others."
According to senior officials at Times Mirror, Mr. Willes, a former executive of General Mills, was hired by a board of directors restive about the company's poor financial performance and was given a clear directive to improve profits. People who have talked to board members said Mr. Willes's primary sponsors on the board were members of the founding family of The Los Angeles Times, the Chandlers.
The Chandler family members, according to Times Mirror executives, have grown increasingly hostile to high operating costs at the company's Eastern newspapers, which include Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and The Hartford Courant.
Analysts had predicted that Mr. Willes would move abruptly, and yesterday several managers of the company's flagship newspaper, The Los Angeles Times, said privately that that newspaper was preparing to reduce its newsroom staff by 150 people next week by attrition and other voluntary measures. The paper's spokeswoman said she could not confirm or deny that report.
One senior editor at The Los Angeles Times said he had been told that the New York Newsday announcement and The Los Angeles Times cutbacks were among several other moves Mr. Willes planned to list as examples of financial progess to securities analysts next week. Times Mirror stock has long lagged behind that of other media companies, in part because many Wall Street analysts have considered the company's costs too high.
In New York, at separate meetings with stunned staff members at New York Newsday's Park Avenue newsroom and at the Melville, L.I., headquarters of Newsday, the city paper's parent, editors and executives said that beginning on Monday, Newsday would publish a scaled-down Queens edition that would no longer carry the masthead New York Newsday. It is to be called Newsday The Queens Edition.
Newspaper executives and industry analysts said that the closing of New York Newsday would strengthen the city's two remaining tabloids, The New York Post and The Daily News, and could set the scene for a fierce new competition between them. Analysts have said for some time that declining advertising revenue and newspaper readership may leave room for only two New York City newspapers, The Times and one of the tabloids.
The announcement came just a day after Mr. Willes had completed his first visit to the paper, taking a helicopter tour of the metropolitan area and greeting staff members, like New York Newsday's columnist Murray Kempton, nearly jauntily.
Associates of the paper's publisher, Raymond A. Jansen, had said he was struggling to convince Mr. Willes that there was a financial justification for keeping New York Newsday alive, but many staff members said that they simply had not believed the paper would be closed.
As the day wore on yesterday at New York Newsday's offices, and top executives remained closeted in meetings, anxiety took hold of staff members. About 4:30, senior officials at the paper called the staff together in a large space outside a conference room where staff meetings were usually held.
"It was funereal," said one senior journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You didn't even have to wait for them to speak. You knew. The word was on their faces."
Mr. Jansen looked at the assembled staff. "I can tell from the silence you know what's coming," he said, according to one of the paper's staff writers, Jonathan Mandell. "It's not good."
Mr. Mandell began taking notes. Curtis Rist, an editor, laughed.
"You're a reporter," Mr. Mandell remembers Mr. Rist saying.
"Not anymore," Mr. Mandell responded.
The executives who called the meeting were: Donald Forst, New York Newsday's editor; Anthony Marro, the editor of both Newsdays; Mr. Jansen, the publisher of both ; Steven I. Isenberg, the publisher of New York Newsday, and Richard Galant, New York Newsday's managing editor. Mr. Willes was not there.
"This was a gutsy newspaper," Mr. Forst said later. "You came in and tried to elbow and knee your way, literally, onto newsstands. We gave it a hell of a shot. We came up short. But going from zip to 231,000, folks, is a hell of a play."
New York Newsday, which battled for circulation with only limited success, had said it was selling 231,000 copies a day last month, which represented the first significant gain after a sharp slide began in 1993. At that time, the paper's average daily circulation was 275,000.
At times yesterday, some Newsday staff members both in New York and in Melville seemed desperate. Jim Dwyer, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his column in New York Newsday, asked Mr. Jansen to discuss a plan Mr. Dwyer said he had worked on to launch an employee buyout of the paper. Mr. Jansen said nothing would change the outcome.
In Melville, the newspaper's executive vice president for operations, Alberto Ibarguen, told anxious staff members that two companies had made offers to buy all of Newsday and that they had been rejected. "Newsday is not for sale," he said. Several people who talked with New York Newsday's editor, Mr. Forst, an irascible newsroom veteran of 40 years, said they were sure they saw tears in his eyes yesterday. And they said they understood.
Mr. Forst and his longtime corporate patron, David Laventhol, an influential newspaperman for decades who is now Times Mirror's editor at large, were more closely identified with New York Newsday than anyone else.
As publisher of the powerful Long Island Newsday more than a decade ago, Mr. Laventhol pioneered what was widely seen as a creative publishing strategy. At the time, both The New York Post and The Daily News appeared doomed, and Mr. Laventhol pressed the idea that Newsday could create a new type of newspaper by coming into the city through its stronghold in Queens and building a responsible tabloid.
Newsday executives called it a "creeping acquisition" and said they would build a newspaper through annual investments and gradual growth. But in time, when The News and The Post regained their footing, some analysts said it was only a matter of time before New York Newsday would be forced to conclude that the strategy, which might have worked, had been beaten by circumstance.

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 15 about the history of New York Newsday, which published its last issue on July 16, misstated the length of Long Island in some editions. From the western border of Nassau County to the eastern end of Suffolk County, it is more than 100 miles, not 50.

State to Retain Bond Rating

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A leading bond-rating agency flashed approval of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's recently passed $16 billion budget yesterday. Standard & Poor's said that New Jersey will retain its double-A plus bond rating, the second-highest grade it gives, The Associated Press reported. The agency said it believed the budget, bolstered by the $500 million state surplus, can withstand potential cuts in Federal aid, the posibility that Governor Whitman's revenue projections are too high and a dip in revenue from he income tax cut. Bond ratings help determine interest rates on state borrowing.

How 'Shrunk' Snuck In

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
TRIVIALIZE HAD ITS MOMENT in the vogue-verb sun," I wrote, "until the usage of this older verb shrunk to the very occasional."
Louis Jay Herman, noted Gotcha! Gangster, objected: "Permit me to join the Uofallpeople Club, to upbraid you for shrunk. All usage manuals consider shrank the preferred or exclusive past tense of shrink, shrunk being the past participle." Kerry Wood of Palo Alto, Calif., adds, "I never thunk you'd have done such a thing." 
 For the irregular verbs shrink and sink, the simple past tense is "He shrank the material and sank the boat." The past participle is the form of the verb used in the present perfect tense, which shows action completed at the time of speaking: "He has shrunk and has sunk." Thus, the natural progression is shrink-shrank-shrunk, sink-sank-sunk.
At an embarrassing moment for the prosecution in the O. J. Simpson trial, Christopher Darden gulped, "The gloves appear to have shrank somewhat." Incorrect; the past participle is shrunk or shrunken.
Shrink-shrank-shrunk is orderly enough; why, then, did Iofallpeople sink into using shrunk as the past tense? Because Walt Disney got to me, I guess: the 1989 movie "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" did to shrank what Winston cigarettes did to as: pushed usage in the direction of what people were casually saying rather than what they were carefully writing. Mr. Herman dutifully objected to one and all about that Disney title (adding a note of praise for the well-placed comma).
In the past-tense dodge, usage is all. The learner of English, having mastered sink-sank-sunk and begin-began-begun and drink-drank-drunk, would assume fling-flang-flung and swing-swang-swung. But there ain't no such animal as swang or flang, except in some far-out dialect; in those and other cases, the past tense hops over the expected word to the past participle.
"Shrunk is much less common as a past tense than shrank," notes Fred Mish of Merriam-Webster, "but sunk has somewhat greater frequency of occurrence in relation to sank. These occurrences can be unsettling at times. A local sportswriter here likes to say of high-school athletes that they 'shined in the contest' instead of 'shone.' "
In the face of the language's weakness of grammatical discipline, what's a poor usagist to do? Be a stiff. Make the new form work for its acceptance. Stick with shrank in the simple past, at least until the movie and its offspring -- like the Heritage Foundation's "Honey, I Shrunk the Tax Base!" -- fade from memory, even if it snuck up on us and makes us feel like something the cat dragged (not drug) in.
Snuck up? "How did snuck ever sneak in?" asks Doris Asmundsson, professor emerita of English at Queensborough Community College in New York. (So that's the feminine of emeritus.) "Words like creak, critique, eke, freak, leak and tweak do not, in the past tense, become cruck, crituck, uck, fruck, luck and twuck. Why then snuck? Eventually a sneaker might turn into a snucker."
Evidently Charles M. Schulz, the cartoonist of "Peanuts," agrees; Rerun says to Charlie Brown, "If you sneaked up behind him, you could hit him with a stick." This is formal English.
On the ABC sitcom "Step by Step," however, a teen-ager tells her parents, "I know I shouldn't have snuck out."
Here's a perfect example of a usage that has crept (informally creeped) up on us. "He grubbed ten dollars from de bums and den snuck home" is the first print use cited in the CD-ROM O.E.D., in an 1887 edition of The New Orleans Lantern. The novelist James T. Farrell used it as the past participle in the first part of his Studs Lonigan trilogy, the 1932 "Young Lonigan": "They had all snuck in and were having a good time, making trouble." Raymond Chandler, the great mystery writer, used it in the simple past tense in his 1940 "Farewell, My Lovely": "I snuck in there and grabbed it."
The Random House Webster's notes this in accepting the term as a standard variant: "Snuck occurs frequently in fiction, in journalism and on radio and television, whereas sneaked is more likely in highly formal or belletristic writing."
John Algeo of American Speech goes further: "Snuck is now educated, standard use; sneaked is rare." He notes that sneak has mysterious origins; it first appears in Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Part 1": "A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home." Professor Algeo notes that the Old English verb snican meant "to crawl," but that word would have become snike, not sneak, in Modern English; curiously, the past tense of snican would have become snuck.
Thus, we should hold off a few years before caving in to shrunk as a simple past tense; I'm sorry, it snuck up on me.

Every now and then one of my innocent pitches gets slammed out of the park by a heavy hitter in the field of linguistics. In this year's Bloopie Awards, I noted the trend among advertising copywriters against using question marks at the end of interrogative sentences. One was "Isn't It Great to Be in Luvs," which seemed to me to call for a little squiggle with a dot under it at the end.
Wrong, I'm told. "That slogan is clearly an exclamative sentence and not an interrogative," writes Prof. James D. McCawley of the University of Chicago's linguistics department, author of the seminal "Syntactic Phenomena of English."
"While two of the major exclamative patterns in English evolved through the adaptation of interrogative structures to exclamative uses," Jim notes, losing me before he even gets to his sentence's subject, "they now diverge from interrogatives both phonologically (the word with the primary stress, here, great, is pronounced with a fall in pitch, not the rise that an interrogative would normally have) and syntactically (the inverted exclamative, as in the Luvs example, allows a use of ever that doesn't mean what ever in an interrogative means: Was I ever hungry! vs. Have you ever been arrested?). . . . If the Luvs copywriter had used the question mark that you demand, he/she would have thereby pinned an unwarranted and misleading badge of interrogativity on the sentence."
I disagree; the Luvs ad asked for a response, if only "Yes!" But criticism from geniuses who could give short festschrift to Noam Chomsky doesn't faze me; I am a synstrategist, not a syntactician.
McCawley's insights are also accessible to the layman, however; after an observation about metaphoric inflation in a piece I wrote about "$40 words," he conjectures, "The obsolescence of the expression 'Dollars to doughnuts' is partly due to the narrowing of the gap between $1 and the current price of a doughnut: it no longer is a bet with long odds."

HEADLINE: The Capitalist;
Fidelities

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS 

 BODY:
JEFF VINIK WAS SOMEWHERE between the women's shoes and the men's accessories at the Salvatore Ferragamo boutique on Fifth Avenue when he mentioned Silicon Graphics. He appeared to be trapped in a pincer of several hundred investors, who had come at the behest of Worth Magazine to celebrate his success, when he mentioned, by the by, to a couple of men sipping Champagne that he expected the share price of Silicon Graphics to double. I believe only a few people heard him, though just about everyone would have liked to. The economist John Maynard Keynes once described the art of investing as "anticipating what average opinion expects average opinion to be." Vinik represents average opinion. He runs the Magellan Fund, the huge mutual fund that controls $45 billion of Fidelity Investments' $200 billion portfolio.
The crowd of hundreds trailed closely behind the human bellwether as he left the clothing store and traveled down to the University Club, where he was scheduled to deliver a lecture. On the way I thought he might drop a further nugget, but when I asked him (discreetly, of course) about the stocks in his portfolio, the only name that he mentioned was Silicon Graphics. Then he strolled to the podium and explained to a standing-room-only audience that America is in a "boom-boom era, . . . in only the third or fourth inning of the current bull market." His best guess was that the stock market would rise for another 7 to 10 years. 
 It's a wonderful thought. The Dow Jones Industrial Average essentially remained flat between 1962 and 1982. Since 1982 it has risen 450 percent. Already we have lived through the greatest bull market in our nation's history. But according to Vinik it's just the start.
The most recent official explanation for the miracle boom is that the economy is weak, and interest rates are falling. This sounds plausible, except that a couple of years back the official story was that the market was rising because the economy was strong. In any case, I don't buy the official explanation. I believe that the stock market is rising because mutual fund managers like Vinik cannot afford to stop buying stocks. At the start of the bull market, mutual funds that invest primarily in stocks held less than $75 billion in assets; they now hold $1 trillion. And every day Americans are handing fund managers more money to invest. This, in turn, drives up the share price of stocks and lifts the market, thereby encouraging more people to invest more money in mutual funds, and so on.
If that seems flaky, consider these numbers. In 1992, according to Paul Goldman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 96 percent of all new money entering the stock market came from mutual funds. (That year Fidelity accounted for 10 percent of all market transactions.) In 1993 mutual funds pumped into the market so much new money that without them the stock market would have experienced net outflows of capital. The statistics for the past 18 months are not yet available but I am pretty sure that the trend has continued. Just look around. The smart money (the hedge fund types) largely missed out on the great surge of early '95. The dumb money (the people who read Smart Money) did not. Their success has spawned a culture of personal investment in which several hundred people find nothing strange about packing into a small clothing store just to be near a fund guru. If it continues for another decade, as the guru predicted, they'll fill Neiman Marcus.
THE MORNING AFTER VINIK SPOKE I bought my first 500 shares of Silicon Graphics. I did not study its balance sheet, lunch with its C.E.O. or interview its customers and suppliers. I did not bother with any of the chores that an old-fashioned stock market investor would complete before casting his lot with a company. I still have no idea where Silicon Graphics is or what it does -- for all I know they publish dirty pictures of women with breast implants. In other words, my strategy is similar to that of the two million American households with shares in Vinik's Magellan Fund, except that I circumnavigated Magellan's fees. Of course my portfolio is not quite so diverse as Magellan's, but then I own what Vinik likes best. And of course I won't know when Vinik changes his mind about Silicon Graphics, but then I'm not sure that matters very much. The main point is that investors in Magellan, like me, own Silicon Graphics not because they understand the company and believe it will prosper but because they believe in Jeff Vinik, and Jeff Vinik believes in Silicon Graphics.
I, too, believe in Jeff Vinik, but more important, I believe the beliefs of all parties will persist for some time. If enough people give their money to Vinik, and Vinik injects enough of that money into Silicon Graphics, the share price of Silicon Graphics will soar. When this happens even more people will give Jeff Vinik their money to invest in Silicon Graphics, and another round of capital gains will accrue in my portfolio.
Of course there is always the danger that some event -- a trade war, a dollar crisis -- will put Vinik's followers on edge. No one can say what they might do if word gets around that the jig is up. Will they become disillusioned in proportion to their original illusion? Will they try as a group to get their money back? If so, one can imagine a run on mutual funds analogous to the run on the banks in the 1930's. The mere rumor of mutual fund investors fleeing the market would no doubt lead them to flee faster -- and everyone else to flee with them.
That is the fear, but also the beauty, of following Jeff Vinik into the stock market: because he can't be seen to be bearish he'll continue to be bullish, and Fidelity will continue to scour the land for new money to invest. Will Fidelity decide one day that the stock market is overpriced? Of course not. The sight of Fidelity's billions, or even Vinik's lesser billions, in panicked flight would incite riots on the stock exchange. Will Vinik sell off his $20 billion worth of small technology stocks, including Silicon Graphics? Of course not. Who would buy them, if he does not? But as long as he buys, everyone will.
And so I'm feeling pretty good these days. Within a week of my purchase of Silicon Graphics, the stock had risen nearly 10 percent, and my broker had called to congratulate me. He'd grown used to watching me lose money in the stock market. I think he suspected I'd finally resorted to inside information. In a sense, I had.

Surviving a Fame That Insists on Surviving

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
DANNY BONADUCE LIKES being recognized. By the waitress at the Four Seasons. By the man who parks his car. By random people on the street.
It is not your usual celebrity vanity, however. It is more like the twisted pleasure of the damned. 
 Twenty-five years ago, Mr. Bonaduce became Danny Partridge and so attained a fame as deathless as an old tire. It has already far outlasted his earnings from "The Partridge Family," which he smoked and snorted his way through by the time he was 18. It has endured two drug busts, an arrest for punching out a transvestite in Arizona and several gigs as a waiter. It has persisted through Mr. Bonaduce's success as a deejay on WLUP ("the Loop") in Chicago. And it will almost certainly live on after the next stage in his career: his return to television as the host of a talk show, "Danny!"
The show, which is syndicated by Buena Vista Television, a Walt Disney subsidiary, will make its debut in September. In New York, it will appear on WWOR, Channel 9.
Mr. Bonaduce, who is 35, is nothing if not philosophical about his fame. During the 1980's, he made regular appearances on the talk show circuit with other washed-up child stars: Dana Plato (Kimberly of "Diff'rent Strokes"), Butch Patrick (Eddie of "The Munsters"), Lauren Chapin (Kitten of "Father Knows Best"). While the others routinely blamed their early success for their later failures, Mr. Bonaduce (pronounced bon-ah-DU-chee) used his air time to muse on the vagaries of fortune. "Shut up!" he remembers saying to his fellow guests. "You had a great free ride. Everybody works for a living. Why don't you go bus tables?"
Now that Mr. Bonaduce is about to have his own talk show he promises to avoid the kind of humiliating spectacle in which the point is to make the guests look and feel like idiots. "I've been the object of ridicule for a long time," he says. "You know how many people called me a jerk and said, 'You had the American dream, and you threw it away?' All true things but still pretty mean to say on television."
Mr. Bonaduce is discussing his future show and his checkered past at a corner table in the cafe of the Four Seasons Hotel here. He has just finished his daily radio program, which runs from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M., and he is wearing jeans, a white long-sleeved T-shirt and very blue cowboy boots. He is joined by his wife, Gretchen, who has driven in from their home in the suburbs with their 4-month-old daughter, Isabella. Isabella's actually her middle name. Her first name is Countess.
"That's just for her credit card," Mr. Bonaduce explains.
Two decades after "The Partridge Family" was canceled, Mr. Bonaduce still has the freckles and flaming red hair of his youth, and his scratchy voice, made that much more gravelly by years of heavy smoking, is still eerily familiar. Talking to him, one can't help but think that he is very much like what Danny Partridge, the schemer of the family, would have become, had he done a lot of drugs, lived below the poverty line for a while and had a few of his teeth knocked out.
Mr. Bonaduce grew up in Los Angeles, where his father was a sitcom writer, and had made his first television commercial by the time he was 4. He was cast as Danny Partridge when he was 10 and was out of a job by 15. At that point, he took his accumulated earnings -- $72,000, a sizable amount in those days -- and moved out on his own. Three years later, he was broke.
The next few years, he got by on unemployment and an occasional guest appearance on the police drama "CHiPs." Fortunately, he could count on work around Christmas, when a television station or a new Kmart would pay him to sit in some greenery playing a Partridge in a pear tree. "I'd be poverty-stricken and then, a week or two a year, I'd be in jets and limousines with all sorts of money in my pocket, out of my mind on drugs, in a tree in some strange city," he said. "You must admit that that is hysterical."
A break, of sorts, came in 1985, when The National Enquirer described him as near starvation. As a joke a deejay in Chicago began a food drive for him. The joke took off, and soon other deejays were doing the same stunt. Radio stations would fly him in for guest appearances; everywhere he went, he would ask for work.
Being a deejay "seemed like the job for me," he said. "It seemed like anybody could do it." Finally, in 1988, a station in Philadelphia hired him, no doubt mostly for the publicity. "They said, 'Listen, we're going to give you a six-month contract, then we're going to let you go,' " he recalled. "It was a top-40 dance station. I'd say, 'And here is Paula Abdul,' and that was my entire job." When the six months was up, it turned out that he was tremendously popular, so the station renewed his contract, for a lot more money.
From Philadelphia, Mr. Bonaduce went to Phoenix. It was there that he got into the tangle with the transvestite, which made news across the country. It was also there that he met and married his wife, all in the same night.
The two crossed paths when Mrs. Bonaduce booked a psychic on Mr. Bonaduce's radio show. After their first date, they went to Mr. Bonaduce's apartment. "Just to be frank with you, I thought sex was in the bag," Mr. Bonaduce said. "So I put the moves on, and she goes -- I couldn't believe this -- she goes, 'I'm sorry, I was raised a Christian, and I won't do that until I'm married.' At first I thought she was kidding. And then I think about it and I go 'O.K.,' and I get the yellow pages out, and I find a minister who is under 'marriage.' "
Mr. Bonaduce credits his wife with turning his life around. At the point they met, he had just finished a drug-rehabilitation program but was, in his words, heading "screaming toward alcoholism." Often, Mrs. Bonaduce simply refused to let him leave the house. "I was almost like some kind of savage until I met Gretchen, not to put down savages," Mr. Bonaduce said, and his wife, who is dandling their baby, did not contradict him.
After he finally sobered up, Mr. Bonaduce found himself in demand as a radio personality, and decided to do a talk show on WLUP. "The Danny Bonaduce Show" is five hours of interviews, running gags and goofy contests. Occasionally, Mr. Bonaduce plays a song so he can retreat to his office and smoke a cigarette.
The idea for "Danny!," the television show, originated with Jon Denny, a film writer and producer who became friendly with Mr. Bonaduce while working on an as-yet-unproduced television movie about his life. For the pilot, Mr. Bonaduce served as host of a segment on short men and tall women who won't date them and competed in a diapering contest against his fellow one-time child star Donny Osmond.
For all his recent success, Mr. Bonaduce does not nurse any illusions about the great acting career that could have been his. When he watched himself playing himself last year on "Married . . . With Children," he said, he was struck by what a stiff he was. "Everybody says, 'You got stereotyped, blah, blah, blah, you couldn't find work,' " he recalled. "Apparently there's a new theory: I have no talent."
Success has, nonetheless, put some order back into his life, taking some of the strangeness out of his perdurable fame. "Now that I'm doing O.K. again and I'm in show biz for a living, it's neat again," he said. "Being poor and famous was really weird. I mean, I used to sign autographs and not know if I was going to eat that day. That was odd."

HEADLINE: They're Rebels Without a Cause, and Couldn't Care Less

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
SHOPLIFTING, TURNSTILE-JUMPING, potsmoking, pill-taking. Trespassing, assault, rape, possibly murder. Name a crime or misdemeanor, and if it doesn't involve guns, cars or syringes, teen-agers probably commit it during the day and night that are shown in Larry Clark's film "Kids," which opens on Friday.
They're not career criminals or hard-core gang members, just teen-agers hanging around in New York City, out to have some fun. When they're not breaking laws, they're having extremely unsafe sex. What makes Mr. Clark's film so controversial is that for its teen-aged characters, nothing they do registers as a transgression or an outrage. For them, it's just another day. 
 "Kids" is, for now, the most extreme of a long line of films in which teen-agers are amoral, irrational, hormone-crazed and oblivious to consequences. It's hardly the first movie about teen-agers to include drinking, drug use, sex or brutality; those have gone with the territory in movies from "West Side Story" of the 1960's to "American Graffiti" of the 1970's and beyond. Yet Mr. Clark's film is jolting -- not just because it takes place in the era of AIDS but because of its unflinching documentary style and its absence of adult authority or an adult point of view. The camera doesn't provide order or stability; it just seems to be tagging along.
"Kids" also drops the comforting conventions of most teen-trouble movies. Its main character is a skateboarding Don Juan, who lives to seduce virgins. He is not the typical character who's wavering but ultimately good-hearted and who eventually tries to do what's right. The film doesn't suggest that if only a few bad apples are controlled, the rest of the teen-agers will straighten out. Nor does it present its anti-social teen-agers as members of an organized gang that is leading them astray. In "Kids," trouble with teen-agers is no longer treated as a problem to be recognized and solved but as something chronic and inevitable.
The film has already begun to raise hackles. When it was shown at the Cannes International Film Festival in May, the Hollywood Reporter said one scene "summarizes the low-level mentality and high-level risks that characterize many kids in this dysfunctional age." Even the positive reviews expressed reservations. "Kids," said Film Comment, presents a "heartbreaking, unbearable and disturbingly erotic vision of predatory boys and naive girls." The piece went on to say that Mr. Clark's "unflinching depiction of the abandon of underage sex and drugs may make the film unreleasable."
Earlier this month, the Motion Picture Association of America gave "Kids" an NC-17 rating for "explicit sex, language, drug use and violence" all involving children. The film is being released by Excalibur Films, a new distributor set up because Miramax, which holds the international rights to "Kids," is owned by Disney and could not domestically distribute a film this raw. Though Excalibur appealed the rating last week, it has the option of releasing the film without a rating; even so, "Kids" will probably not show up in suburban malls.
On seeing the film, some moral guardians will no doubt insist that this is what happens when a pop culture of loveless sex and mindless violence takes over impressionable young minds. Less polemical viewers may end up musing about the comparative innocence of their own teen-age years; why didn't we have so much excitement at that age? They may also be left wondering whether the younger generation can survive, and whether, in fact, it's worth saving.
TEEN-AGERS, AS A DIStinct group, have provoked particular fear and bewilderment since the 1950's, when they were first recognized as a separate culture and (almost simultaneously) as a potential market for everything from hit singles to acne medication. Even before the baby boom swelled the teen-age population, post-war prosperity was keeping them in school longer, providing more leisure time and allowing more mobility -- all, as some adults saw it, encouraging children in mindless pleasure-seeking and dangerous rowdiness.
As the teen-age population swelled, worries mounted. Adolescence became an extended identity crisis, a time to test new roles and abilities; it also became a prolonged and confusing rite of passage. From an adolescent viewpoint, adults seemed intent on enforcing arbitrary rules, thwarting teen-agers' attempts at defining themselves or even enjoying themselves.
Teen-agers have taken as a badge of pride the adult notion that they are creatures of boundless appetites and nonexistent discipline; welcome to "Wayne's World." In most films the troublemakers usually look as if they're having a good time and are a lot more vivid than the goody-goody types.
Efforts to understand teen-agers and gut reactions of alarm have gone side by side for decades. Adolescents are "screaming wild animals," as one character describes them in the 1955 film "Blackboard Jungle." A gruff, disciplinarian cop explains why: They had "no home life, no church life, no place to go." "Gang leaders," the cop adds, "have taken the place of parents."
That message would be repeated down through the decades, as two-career families bred latchkey children, suburbanization brought less sense of community and more boredom, the age of puberty dropped, and youth unemployment made crime a tempting career option. While sociology could offer some explanations -- all neatly satirized by "Gee Officer Krupke" in "West Side Story" -- it couldn't reverse larger social and economic shifts.
Juvenile delinquency, the scourge of the 50's, was also blamed on the corrupting effects of the media, particularly rock-and-roll and horror comics, which were both investigated by Congressional committees. (Hearings on the payola scandal ruined the careers of the disk jockey Alan Freed and others; comic books were sanitized, though in the 1960's underground comix brought back sex and violence.)
Yet rock, comics and B movies, even when they have been crass and shoddy, address continuing teen-age concerns. Ordinary teen-age lives include a lot of frustration, uncertainty, aimlessness and floundering. The adolescent sense of time, trapped in an all-encompassing present, makes it difficult for teen-agers to weigh the effects of impulsive acts. As they grow up, teen-agers begin to reckon with adult concerns of sexuality and mortality; they also ricochet between new physical powers and continuing political powerlessness. Parents, teachers, the police: adult authority bears down on teen-agers, constantly assuring them it's for their own good.
In response, the pop media provide teen-agers with fantasies about an authority-free world. Pop songs about love and sex offer a full spectrum, from happy-ever-after romance to single-minded lust. Beach and party movies, from "Gidget" to "House Party," present teen-agers at play, with no significant obligations; television sitcoms often show teen-agers who are smarter and savvier than their parents. In hard-rock songs, rap boasts and superhero comics, powerless teen-agers can imagine themselves as invincible protagonists: riding down wide-open highways, shouting back at people who'd push them around, facing danger or (particularly in speed-metal) paradoxically identifying with the malevolent forces that are out to get them.
Horror movies, often aimed at teen-agers, take up adolescents' new-found recognition of death and their combined fear and fascination about the body as it matures. At puberty, every teen-ager may feel a little like a werewolf, with hair sprouting in new places and unfamiliar compulsions taking over. There's shame to go with the new thrills; in many horror films, the teen-agers who are most sexually active are the first victims. The symbolism is fairly obvious in "A Nightmare on Elm Street": a girl burns herself on a hot pipe, a boy is swallowed by a gaping hole that gushes blood.
But that's kid stuff; teen-trouble movies are usually pitched to adults. In movies made for adults, teen-agers are as much symbols as characters. They stand for missed chances, for all the kicks that could be had before adult obligations arrived. When teen-agers take over the country in "Wild in the Streets," indulgence reigns while adults are packed off for euthanasia.
Movie teen-agers also remind adults of all the dangers facing the unwary, from pregnancy to AIDS, from drug habits to all sorts of bad judgment. But most of all, they stand for adult guilt. Parents have spoiled their children or abandoned them, given them too much leeway or too much pressure, failed to be perfect. Generations of adolescents have recognized themselves in James Dean's tortured rebel without a cause, a good kid whose caring parents just can't cure his malaise.
Yet gradually, the concerned parent has receded from the picture. In "Over the Edge," an earnest 1980 movie about teen-agers who riot out of boredom in their planned suburban community, the father of the inevitable wavering adolescent asks, at a desperate town meeting: "Has anyone ever sat down and talked to these kids? What are they, all rotten? And we're so good?" His self-righteousness is rebuked; like the rest of the parents in town, he has never shown up for parents' week at the local high school.
By 1987, in "River's Edge," the nuclear family has just about collapsed. Mom has a demanding full-time job, her boyfriend evades anything to do with the children, and her son borrows a joint from her when he runs low on pot. In "Kids," there's only one appearance by a character's mother, just long enough for him to steal some cash. Not only can't parents discipline their children, but they can't even make contact.
AS TEEN-AGERS MOVE FURther away from adult influence, they're increasingly portrayed as a separate species, more energetic and savage than their elders. Movie teen-agers live in a world of peer-inflicted violence, from ritualized hazing to fist fights, knife fights, gun fights. Alex, the criminal in "A Clockwork Orange," is described as "enterprising, aggressive, outgoing, young, bold, vicious," and while he's a full-fledged maniac, he's hardly the only teen-aged character to fit the description.
Nice schoolboys revert to barbarism in "Lord of the Flies"; ghetto teen-agers answer verbal insults with bullets in "Menace II Society" (though its main character is a classic wavering adolescent). Unlike adult characters, they don't need much of a motive; since they're teen-agers, clearly they don't know what they're doing.
And increasingly, they don't care -- at least in the movies. Old-fashioned tormented teen-agers, the ones who were desperate for meaning and direction, are giving way to the dead-eyed kids who don't bother to report a murder in "River's Edge." Numbed by drugs and mass culture, restless but affectless, they don't feel much beyond immediate physical lusts.
The teen-agers in "Kids" are not screaming wild animals anymore, but dull, mindless ones, untouched by idealism or fear. Instead of being portrayed as alienated, they are simply aliens.
As such, they are out of reach; there's no hope for them. They are an inhuman Other, fit to join illegal immigrants, welfare mothers and other currently demonized groups. They rule their own jungle now, and there's nothing an adult can do.

The Rib Tickler's Approach to Social Provocation

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
MORE THAN RATINGS ARE at stake for Michael Moore this summer as his sometimes loopy, sometimes acidly satiric news-magazine program, "TV Nation," returns to prime time. His whole world view is on the line.
Mr. Moore, the iconoclastic film maker who is destined to have his name followed forever by the phrase "producer and director of the award-winning documentary 'Roger and Me,' " says his career is propelled by the conviction that Americans are smarter and more politically sophisticated than the television industry thinks. 
 "The proof is in the Nielsen ratings," he says. "The top 10 shows are the smartest, the most risk-taking shows, shows like 'Seinfeld,' 'E.R.,' 'N.Y.P.D. Blue.' Look, '60 Minutes,' a news show, is always in the top 10. And 'Roseanne,' whatever else you may feel about it, deals with serious social issues and controversies."
Social issues, smart-aleck interviews and general rabble-rousing are what Mr. Moore plans to offer in eight new episodes of "TV Nation." The show, which he has moved to Fox from NBC, where it ran last summer, will be seen on Fridays at 8 P.M., starting this week.
"I really think this country is ready for a good dose of political humor right now," Mr. Moore said recently over lunch at a cafe near his midtown Manhattan office.
This summer, "TV Nation" will mock everyone from Presidential candidates to "whining white men"; everything from companies that don't provide enough toilets for female employees (in a memorable segment featuring portable Johns of Justice delivered by truck) to fancy-dress brigades that re-enact Civil War battles. What Mr. Moore calls his "merry band of troublemakers" will include Janeane Garofalo, late of "Saturday Night Live" and "The Larry Sanders Show"; the comedian Steven Wright, and an investigative reporter called Crackers the Corporate Crime Chicken.
"TV Nation," which is produced by Kathleen Glynn, Mr. Moore's wife, often recycles the pester-the-powers-that-be method that brought Mr. Moore success in "Roger and Me," his 1989 film about the effect of the closing of a General Motors factory in Flint., Mich., his hometown. In a new segment called "Payback," for example, Mr. Moore goes to the home of the chief executive of a car-alarm company, lines up 10 cars and sets off the alarms at 6 A.M., to see what the executive will do (he calls the police, who make Mr. Moore move the cars).
"But my idea with the car alarms and that sort of stuff is to draw people in," he explained. "Once they're in, we'll talk about real issues."
In another new segment, Ms. Garofalo takes a multiethnic group of 24 New Yorkers by bus to the town beach in Greenwich, Conn. (Only Greenwich residents are allowed.) Turned away, they rent a boat; stopped by police boats, they swim ashore. "It's a public beach," Mr. Moore said, eyes flashing behind his glasses. "You can't say only residents of Brooklyn can go to Coney Island. This is America! You can't say only people in Venice can use Venice Beach. This is America!"
Since "Roger and Me," Mr. Moore has mellowed in age, to 40, and in appearance, with a few extra pounds on his 6-foot-3-inch frame. With a Detroit Tiger baseball cap almost always perched on his mop of brown hair, he looks just like what, on one level, he is: a white, middle-class, middle-aged husband and father (he and Ms. Glynn have a 14-year-old daughter) from a blue-collar family, with no college degree and a fondness for sports. But underneath the aw-shucks demeanor beats what one critic called "a genetically subversive heart."
Mr. Moore's subversiveness takes the form of thumbing the nose at the bosses, and he was to that manner born. "My uncle was in the sit-down strike in Flint that founded the U.A.W.," he says, referring to the United Auto Workers' 1937 strike. "I think that generation, if they could see what goes on now, would be very disappointed."
He is certainly disappointed in his generation, which took part in civil rights and Vietnam War protests but faded into armchair liberalism. "To the disenfranchised, angry, alienated, unemployed worker in Michigan, what are the Democrats, the liberals, offering?" Mr. Moore asked. "Newt Gingrich, and people like the Michigan militia, they have something to offer. It's the wrong thing, but it's something people can grab on to."
He believes that his social contribution is to goad people into taking part in a search for solutions. "If we are active and involved, we'll find our way, but if we detach, we're going to be in a lot of trouble," Mr. Moore said. "So I want this show to get people riled up, to get them juiced, to motivate people to get involved, and not just sit around. If they can see a guy like me, without a college education, from Flint, Mich., walk into the headquarters of some big corporation, or into the halls of Congress, and challenge some people, maybe people will say, 'Hey, maybe I can do something like that.' "
NOT MANY PEOPLE, HOW ever, would send Crackers the Corporate Crime Chicken to ask New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani serious questions about tax breaks and unemployment. And some television critics have complained that such sophomoric stunts undermine whatever serious purpose Mr. Moore has in mind. He disagrees.
"Humor can be more devastating than some formal white paper," he said. "There's no reason you can't be entertained and think at the same time. You can laugh, and you can think. That's my point about the top 10 shows in the Nielsen ratings: you have to do both. And people will do that. I don't have that attitude, that looking down on the American people like they're all a bunch of dopes."
He paused, and the gleam was back in his eyes. "That's not to say there aren't a good 50 or 60,000 dopes," he said, yukking gently, "because there are."

HEADLINE: Crusader for New York City Landmarks Moves On

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
ANYONE who has ever felt blessed walking through the Beaux-Arts grandeur of cavernous Grand Central Terminal -- or has felt frustrated grappling with the regulations designed to protect New York City's landmarks -- owes something to Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society.
Over two decades Mr. Barwick has become one of the leading crusaders for preserving the city's notable buildings. His work in the 70's in preventing the construction of an office tower on top of Grand Central Terminal not only preserved what is part of the city's heart, but also led to a United States Supreme Court ruling that established the right of local governments to preserve architecturally distinctive sites and structures. 
 "Certainly in terms of national implications, it was a significant accomplishment," Mr. Barwick said. "Not just because of the building -- but because preserving a building because of its architectural merit was something, like zoning earlier in the century, that some Americans, many people in the real estate business, probably thought was unconstitutional as well as undesirable."
Mr. Barwick, who is 54, announced earlier this month that he would resign as president of the Municipal Art Society effective in mid-September to become president of the New York State Historical Association in Cooperstown. He has been head of the nonprofit Municipal Art Society since 1983 and served as its executive director from 1970 to 1975. A search committee has been appointed to find a successor.
The organization, which was formed in 1893 to adorn the public buildings and parks of New York with murals, fountains and monuments, has evolved over the century into a leading citizen-activist group, battling developers to preserve parts of New York's past.
Besides Grand Central Terminal, among other accomplishments (or obstructions) for which Mr. Barwick can take at least partial credit are campaigns that blocked construction of a huge building at Columbus Circle and saving the community house and garden at St. Bartholomew's Church.
He also played a role in the creation of the Adopt-a-Monument and Adopt-a-Mural programs, which raised more than $1 million to restore some 40 monuments and murals around the city.
"He has been hugely important, especially after he came back to the M.A.S.," said Gregory F. Gilmartin, a designer with Peter Pennoyer Architects in New York and the author of "Shaping the City: New York and the Municipal Art Society" (Crown Publishing Group, 1995). "He brought a seriousness and a certain access that the M.A.S. hadn't had in a long time."
Mr. Gilmartin cited the society's role in setting up the zoning guidelines for the renovation of Times Square that retained its garish glitter.
"Without the M. A. S., Times Square might well have turned out to be another Sixth Avenue," he said, an area filled with sterile modernist office buildings. "In the 80's, people tended to dismiss all the lights and billboards as just cosmetics. They had no sense of the unique role that Times Square played in the city or the nation. But the cosmetics turned out to attract the music industry and Disney and has succeeded well."
Mr. Barwick said, "I don't like the word 'preservation.' A lot of what we have done amounts to preservation, but what we have been doing for New York is really finding ways to capitalize assets that were underappreciated. New York City has finally awakened to realize that tourism is the second biggest industry in the state, and all these things that we were saving, theoretically, for sentimental value have enormous economic value.
"WE really have never done anything by ourselves, either. We are the Tom Sawyers -- we start painting the fence and the next thing you know there are a hundred people on each side painting the fence. Everything we do is coalition-building. The Municipal Art Society isn't strong enough to really do much by itself."
Mr. Barwick said he felt that the society's largest contribution, at least locally, in recent years might have been its role in persuading the developer Donald J. Trump to remap a new Riverside South complex plan on the old Penn Central railyards on the West Side of Manhattan.
"We went to Trump and said, 'We want you to forget your world's tallest building and seven other 750-foot baby buildings and a regional shopping center and Television City and build something much more in character with the West Side and also a 24-acre park directly along the water,' " he said. "While there are people who live nearby who still resent this, we think that this is exactly the sort of thing that the city should be doing."
Though they may have differed with Mr. Barwick, developers praise his pragmatic approach. "I have found Kent Barwick to be a constructive problem solver, a valued quality in public interest groups such as the Municipal Art Society," said Mortimer B. Zuckerman, who owns The Daily News and is chairman of Boston Properties, which failed in its nine-year effort to build high-rise office and apartment buildings on the site of the New York Coliseum.
Before Mr. Barwick's tenure as president of the Municipal Art Society, he served in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch as chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. "I didn't always agree with him, and when he returned to the private sector and became president of the Municipal Art Society, occasionally, in our respective roles, we would disagree," Mr. Koch said. "Even then, I never lost my complete respect for his fairness."
Earlier, Mr. Barwick, a graduate of Syracuse University, was executive director of the New York State Council on the Arts. He lives in a renovated schoolhouse in the Little Italy section of Manhattan and has a farm of 200-plus acres upstate in Cherry Valley.
HE said he had a few regrets or disappointments in his tenure in the Municipal Art Society. Perhaps his biggest, he said, was the failure to block or reduce what he considered to be huge tax abatements -- $1.5 billion to $4.2 billion in lost revenue for the city -- granted to the developers of four office buildings in the Times Square area. The abatements were promised to a development team led by the Prudential Insurance Company of America to compensate it for the money it had agreed to put up so the state could condemn property for the office buildings as well as for theaters and retail space.
"Think of what other uses that money could be going toward," he said.
Mr. Barwick said he was also saddened by the development in the Union Square district. One loss, especially, upset him. "Luchow's," he said, referring to the original site of the midtown restaurant, at 112 East 14th Street, where Diamond Jim Brady, H. L. Mencken and Enrico Caruso dined earlier in the century.
The building was abandoned in 1982, became a home for squatters and then was damaged by a fire late last year before being demolished. "Sadly, it couldn't be saved," he said.

HEADLINE: A Gamble on Pedigreed Grapes and Fancy Labels

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
TWENTY years ago a Connecticut industrialist became involved in a venture new to the state but so old that ancient Greece and Rome each had a god for it -- Dionysus and Bacchus, respectively.
The industrialist was Sherman P. Haight Jr., who was in the textile business. The new venture was making wine. 
 Evereyone knew that making wine, on a commercial basis anyway, was not something for Connecticut. The climate in winter was too harsh for vines that produce better grapes. Making wine in the state was confined to first generation Italian immigrants who made some for family consumption from the hardy backyard vines they nurtured with skills passed on generation to generation. But wine in bottles with fancy labels, made from pedigreed grapes, competing in a very crowded market -- that was not for Connecticut.
"We took a big chance," said Mr. Haight recently as he wandered about his Tudor-style winery and his 30-acre vineyard in the northwest hills of the state only a few miles from his native Litchfield. The "we" was himself and another Connecticut industrialist, August Loos of Pomfret, who had also decided to go into the wine business in 1975 but would later get out of it because of his many other business interests.
If Mr. Haight is considered the pioneer of the Connecticut wine business today, the person who should be credited with being the inspiration, he says, was a Russian immigrant to America, Frank Konstantin.
Dr. Konstantin, an earth scientist who has since died, was working at the Cornell University Research Center in New York State in the 1970's. He was an outspoken critic of wine production in this country, Mr. Haight said, and believed, judging from his experience in the cold climates of Russia, that vineyards could be sustained in a climate like Connecticut's if certain precautions were taken. These included bringing vines to the winter season in peak condition and making sure each plant had three or four trunks, in contrast to the single trunk used in more hospitable wine regions like the Napa or Sonoma valleys of California.
Acting on Dr. Konstantin's theories, and a lot of faith, Mr. Haight planted his first vines, Chardonnay and Riesling, to make white wine when the grapes matured in three years.
If the grapes had matured earlier, selling the wine would have been illegal. Connecticut had no law authorizing production, so Mr. Haight and Mr. Loos started to lobby state legislators for a bill to authorize farm wineries. "We had to convince them that this was good for agriculture and good for the state," Mr. Haight said.
They succeeded. The Farm Winery Act in 1978 made the business legal, just in time for Mr. Haight's first grape harvest that autumn. He was ready with the first established winery in the state.
The first harvest was only fair in quantity but excellent in quality, Mr. Haight said, a condition that still applies. "It's hard to grow fine grapes this close to the boundary line where grapes will grow at all," he said. "And we might get two and a half tons of grapes per acre here while in a place like the Napa Valley four tons per acre is routine. But the compensation is the higher quality."
Buoyed by the early success, he gave up his textile business, now managed by one of his daughters in Georgia, and entered into the wine business with an enthusiasm that seems to have only increased with the years. "I'm absolutely fascinated with this business," Mr. Haight said. "It's part agriculture, part marketing, almost like a factory, and highly complex." Now in his early 70's, he says he is just getting started.
"I learn something new every day. I'll never retire," he said. "It will take me 25 more years to accomplish what I want to do here."
Today, the Haight operation produces three white wines, three red wines and a blush wine. And it has competition. Wine making is now an established business in Connecticut, a scattered bunch of economic bright spots in an area particularly hard hit by the recession of recent years.
Connecticut even has its own wine trail, marked by highway signs so visitors can stop for tastings. They include Haight in Litchfield and Olde Mystick Village in Mystic where its wine education center is situated, Hopkins in Warren, DiGrazia in Brookfield, Chamard in Clinton and Stonington in Stonington. Other vineyards in the state but not on the wine trail include Bishop in Cheshire, Heritage in Lisbon, McLaughlin in the Sandy Hook section of Newtown and Raynham in East Haven.
They are a cooperative lot, Mr. Haight said. "We're all friends," he explained. "We help each other out. We even help out people making wine at home"
Connecticut is riding the crest of an acceptance of wine today, he said, in preference to harder alcoholic beverages, partially due to medical reports that in moderation wine can be beneficial to health.
But with the new accent on wine has come a boom in production, not only in the United States and in Italy and France, traditionally famed for their wines, but also in countries never heard from before. Today, wines from Chile and Australia, among others, are marketed aggressively in the American market.
Selling Connecticut wines, with no heritage, is difficult in such a vast market. Even getting people to taste the wine is a challenge, Mr. Haight admits. But he sees progress.
"Acceptance of wines here has come a long way in the last few years," he said. "Once people would agree to taste our wines with the attitude 'I'll try anything and expect nothing.' But not any more. Now they say the wines are better than expected. We make good wines but we face the same problem that California once had. People wouldn't even try their wines once."
And today, he said, even the wines of France, long considered in a class by themselves, are being threatened by competition. "Some vineyards in France are living on their reputations and pricing themselves out of the market," Mr. Haight said. "I have a friend who has a great wine cellar and I like to go see him because he always breaks out a bottle of a great French wine. But now he says, 'Enjoy the French wines while you can because I'm not buying them anymore.' "
The dean of Connecticut's winery owners also sees signs that some of the pretension and jargon about wine is fading and he is happy about that. The criterion for wine, he believes, is not someone blathering on in stilted cliches but simply whether a person likes it or not.
"Wine is like food," Mr. Haight said. "Some people like string beans and some people can't stand string beans. In any kind of wine, you like it or you don't."
Making wine today, in a high-tech age, is still half science and half art, he said. His winemaker at Haight Vineyards, Wayne Stitzer, agrees with him.
Like all commercial winemakers today, Mr. Stitzer is skilled in the science of times and temperatures and stainless steel vats and various kinds of oak barrels. But, having he had one credential not taught in books or learned at other wineries. He had a grandfather who made wine. In Connecticut.
The grandfather's name was Salvatore Daddona, originally from Italy, and for years he had produced wine for the Daddona clan in the Oakville section of Watertown. Several years ago, Mr. Stitzer invited him to see the wine making at Haight.
"We toured the whole operation, the vineyards, the winery, and he was very quiet, but then we came to the laboratory and Grandfather just started to laugh and laugh," Mr. Stitzer said. "A laboratory! For making wine? He thought that was really funny."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Broome Street;
When It Comes to Trucks, SoHo Is All Shook Up

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
DID you know that through trucks are not allowed on Broome Street, which at peak periods seems like their native habitat? Some local activists do not like that awful, churning feeling of living in a cement mixer and claim that heavy trucking there is not only illegal but is shaking SoHo's historic buildings to bits.
They hope that special signs planned by the city's Department of Transportation will reduce traffic and save the facades. Restoration professionals, however, say that trucks are not the source of the trouble. 
 Broome Street's problems of high volume stem from its original design width of 65 feet, compared with the typical 50-foot width of most other SoHo crosstown streets.
Historic photographs show Broome as a two-way street until about 1950, when it became one way headed west toward the Holland Tunnel, at the same time that the Lower Manhattan Expressway was in the planning stages.
That crosstown highway would have destroyed a wide swath of buildings along Broome, but would have given Brooklyn manufacturers better access to the Hudson River piers and points beyond.
The expressway was defeated in 1969 as preservation advocates like Jane Jacobs and James Marston Fitch triumphed over highway proponents like Robert Moses, who saw downtown Manhattan as a hopeless warren of tangled streets.
The Landmarks Preservation Commission designated SoHo a historic district in 1973, just as it was in the early stages of change from an industrial to a retail and residential neighborhood.
That transformation is well along now, and parts of SoHo approach the Upper East Side for housing prices and fancy shops.
Nine years ago Carl Rosenstein, a photographer who lives at 435 Broome Street, near Broadway, became upset about heavy truck traffic on Broome. Although trucks are meant to use Canal and Houston Streets for east-west travel, westbound Broome Street between Lafayette and West Broadway has a wide roadbed, no curb parking and few stop lights -- a perfect but illegal shortcut to the Holland Tunnel for a few hundred trucks a day, according to Mr. Rosenstein's estimates.
With mixed success he has been trying to get the Department of Transportation to enforce the trucking restriction.
"It's in the interest of the economy of the city -- the neighborhood just sort of dies at Broome Street," he said, noting that Broome has a much higher vacancy rate than other SoHo streets.
Mr. Rosenstein said it was not just a quality of life issue. The cast-iron facade on his building is damaged, which he says is caused by the pounding vibrations and air pollution of the trucks.
CAROLYN ALEXANDER is an officer of her co-op at the northwest corner of Wooster and Broome Streets. She said that a facade restoration of the 70's, "which should have lasted for at least 30 years," was now failing. Dislodged stones and cracked terra cotta now require a $250,000 repair project, one she said her eight-unit building could barely afford. She, like Mr. Rosenstein, is sure that the damage "comes from the phenomenal vibrations -- at nighttime they really pick up speed and when they hit the brakes it's incredible," she said.
The situation has attracted the attention of preservation groups. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, the New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Historic Districts Council have all agreed that vibrations and pollution from trucks are damaging the buildings. And Mr. Rosenstein says the Department of Transportation has agreed to make signs reading "Historic District -- No Thru Trucks or Buses" pthat also warn of a maximum $1,600 fine.
But although a stream of trucks blights any street, the hard evidence does not support claims of building damage. And indeed there is only one protective sidewalk sheds on Broome Street in SoHo.
Robert Silman, New York's pre-eminent engineer for restoration projects, said, "Every time we've tried to monitor a building for damage from truck traffic, we can't prove an effect, even if we use European standards, which are much more stringent." Sophisticated equipment can monitor vibration against known damage thresholds but this has not been done on Broome Street.
Mr. Silman was a consultant on a project to predict damage from pile driving for the new SoHo Grand hotel project, at Canal Street and West Broadway, as was Robert Dinan, a seismologist with John V. Dinan Associates in Fort Lee, N.J. Mr. Dinan said that at the SoHo Grand site even the hammering of pile drivers was less than one-fifth the standard of 0.5 inches per second used by the Landmarks Preservation Commission as a threshold.
"The truck vibration is there, it's annoying, it will be in the range where people feel it," he said. But he added that he had never seen cases where truck traffic had any direct effect on a building, unless the structure was already weak.
Ray Pepi, president of Building Conservation Associates, an experienced restoration firm, agreed. And both he and Mr. Silman said that although air pollution was a threat to New York's buildings, it was an areawide condition, rarely active within an environment like a single street.
What damages New York buildings, they and Mr. Dinan said, is age and weather, not traffic.

Whitman's D.M.V. Folly A Homemade Mess

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson is the Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Most people come in direct contact with the state about twice a year -- when they pay their taxes, and when they visit a motor vehicle office to renew their license or auto registration. Writing checks for the first of these is rarely an enjoyable event, and Governor Whitman's hastily conceived and sloppily executed effort to turn 23 state-run Division of Motor Vehicles branch offices over to private management firms has made a disaster of the other.
Late in the week, lines were still snaking out of doors and down streets at several of the branch offices, and people needing new licenses or registrations were still being turned away hours before closing time, four days after the Governor told reporters, on July 7, "We'll be fully staffed and everything will be fine come Monday." 
 In the history of New Jersey and the chronicle of state affairs, this is small stuff, likely to pass before too long. But in the 18-month history of Mrs. Whitman's governorship, the D.M.V. mess stands as a kind of milestone, the first made-from-scratch, toe-stubbing embarrassment by an administration whose mastery of administrative systems was supposed to make New Jersey state government "leaner and smarter."
Instead of operating smoothly, the privatized D.M.V. offices were chaotic. Instead of being fully staffed, the division, having laid off 300 state employees to save $4 million, had to call Kelly Girls to rush in temps at $17 an hour. Instead of giving the public the kind of crisp, market-disciplined service they had been promised, New Jersey motorists got a taste of Soviet-style bureucracy at its most bizarre:
An American returning from a sojourn in Canada, waiting at the Eatontown office on Tuesday to get a New Jersey license, was sent away hours before closing time, for example. We can do license renewals, she was told by a greeter stationed at the end of the lengthening outdoor queue, but not license transfers. Come back tomorrow.
Then, on Wednesday, the Bergen Record broke the story that 330,000 taxpayer refunds have still not been mailed because the state was saving money by cutting back on the temporary workers hired to process the checks. Leaner, yes, but not smarter from an administration based on tax aversion.
Administration officials acknowledged that the decision to place the 23 field offices under private management was made in haste, back in March, when the Governor and her staff were pulling budget options together. Half the offices are already under private management, someone pointed out, they do the same work with fewer workers, let's privatize the rest of them and save the difference.
Republican legislators began warning that it might not be so simple, particularly on the administration's headlong schedule of overhauling the offices simultaneously, instead of phasing in changes over a period of months.
Some Republicans warned that the rapid changeover would create confusion and anger voters, which it has. Others worried about the impact on the men and women, but mostly women, who would be offered the Hobson's choice between no job or one that paid $10,000 less a year, with poorer benefits. The Governor brushed these warnings and worries aside, and because she brushed them aside, the disorder that resulted is hers alone to explain.
Mrs. Whitman has come far on the best qualities a political leader can possess: sharp instincts, a commanding public presence merged with a warm public personality. She has benefited, above all, from not having much of a political history, for if she ever said or did anything stupid, New Jersey voters do not know of it. Instead, the Governor came before the voters as a blank page on which she was free to compose her public self-portrait.
Now, however, the portrait has begun to show smudges. By itself, the D.M.V. imbroglio is a transitory thing, and by itself, the delay in mailing refunds is small stuff. But then, so were unplowed streets in Queens for Mayor John V. Lindsay, an earlier handsome, well-born moderate Republican comer. So were Edmund S. Muskie's tears in the snows of Concord, N.H., or George Romney's joke about brainwashing, Gary Hart's invitation to be shadowed, or George Bush's invitation to have his lips read.
What matters in politics is the way little mistakes acquire weight by accumulation, and that is why the Whitmanauts at the State House must be watching the state and national economic indicators like Dorothy watching the Kansas sky darken and the wind kick up. If the slowdown that seems to have settled over the country spreads to the state, and the Governor's revenue projections begin tilting toward the red, problems renewing a license or registration and problems getting a tax refund will be joined with problems keeping the budget balanced. At that point, the ride starts getting really bumpy.

HEADLINE: JERSEY;
A Town Draws Lines in the Shifting Sand

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
ALL the Borough Council of Monmouth Beach wanted to do Tuesday night was to mollify residents who showed up to protest strict new proposed regulations for the town's recently restored beach.
Looking relieved, Mayor Louis P. Sodano told the crowd that the ordinance, which would have outlawed using the beach after 6 P.M. and banned eating, ball-tossing, changing any article of clothing and an exhaustive list of other activities, had gone back to the legal drawing board for major revisions. A new draft will be ready in the fall. 
 Cheers rose. But not from Clemens N. Jacobsen, a retired engineer who got up to address the Council. Mr. Jacobsen, whom people call Jake, has lived there for 50 years and thinks the beach should be open to everyone.
First, he told his neighbors -- who found the draft rules too harsh even for them -- that they should have no illusions about the main purpose of restrictive beach rules. Like many affluent stretches of New Jersey's shore, Monmouth Beach actively discourages outsiders by limiting beach passes and parking. In fact, a petition passed around before the meeting warned of opening up any new parking places in town. "All kinds of people" will be "wandering around," the petition said, "if we encourage them to stop and park." And in this conservative, all-white enclave, "all kinds of people" resonates with meaning.
"What you're really worried about," Mr. Jacobsen told the Council, "is that somebody is going to drive a busload of people down here and have a party on the beach."
"Jake," said the Mayor, rolling his eyes.
Secondly, Mr. Jacobsen went on, drawing up restrictions may be beside the point. Mr. Jacobsen calculates that about about one-third of the federally restored beach -- which the Army Corps of Engineers said would last for six years or more -- has already washed away. "This beach won't even be here two years from now," he declared. Quickly, the Council moved on to other business.
The opposition that forced Monmouth Beach to rethink its beach rules was led by a well-organized group of local surfers, members of the national Surfrider Foundation. Since the 1960's, surfers have felt unwelcome on some Jersey beaches -- but now many of them are middle-aged and affluent. Some even grew up to be lawyers. Last year, when a surfer was arrested for violating beach regulations in the exclusive town of Deal a few miles down the coast, the Surf riders sued. Deal backed down.
"If we had the time and energy, we could go from town to town like dominoes down the Jersey coast fighting for beach access, and not just for surfers," said Brian Unger, a 43-year-old businessman from Long Branch who has been surfing the Jersey coast since the 1960's. Mr. Unger often surfs in California, where all of the beaches are public. "Only in New Jersey do you have all of these problems getting on the beach -- even though the taxpayers paid for it. Here, they're always talking about the beach like it was basically a profit center for local businesses. In Big Sur, they don't think of a beach as a revenue producer."
Years after its previous beach washed away in natural ocean currents, Monmouth Beach got its new one this year as part of a $19.6 million project by the Army Corps of Engineers to pump in a 180-foot-wide, three-mile stretch of sand. That restoration is part of a $400 million beach-restoration project on the Jersey Shore, much of it on behalf of exclusive towns that do their best to keep the general public out. Some coastal conservationists have denounced the whole project as an expensive subsidy for well-connected property owners who insist on living atop shifting sands.
The other day the Corps conceded that in Monmouth Beach, even without any big storms, a chunk of the new beach is indeed gone, after less than a year. "We are aware of the situation," said the Corps's chief engineer for the New Jersey project, Gilbert Nersesian. "Unsettled weather activity" at sea caused the "shoreline recession," he said.
The other night, a young couple, Joseph and Marguerite DiCroce, enjoyed a moonlit picnic on the beach, saying they would savor the experience while they could. The DiCroces, both lawyers, heartily concurred with Mr. Jacobsen's view that the new beach was receding quickly toward the boulders beside Ocean Drive.
"Before long, we'll be fishing off the rocks again," said Mr. DiCroce.
"One storm and it's gone," Mrs. DiCroce sighed.
"Easter," Mr. DiCroce decided. "We'll be back to the rocks by Easter."

HEADLINE: Coalition to Focus On Support for the Arts

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

 BODY:
MORE than 120 arts leaders from around the country are expected to gather at Doral Arrowwood in Rye Brook on July 28 for the annual conference of the National Coalition of United Arts Funds. The Westchester Arts Council will be the host of the three-day meeting, which will focus on new approaches to fund-raising at a time of government and corporate cutbacks.
John Brademus, former president of New York University and a champion of the arts, and Leon Botstein, president of Bard College and music director of the American Symphony Orchestra, will be the featured speakers. 
 Molly K. Sasse, president of the Arts Funds Coalition, said the meeting had two main objectives. "It's a good opportunity to swap war stories and keep our skills polished," she said. "It's even more beneficial for people who are new to fund-raising and especially to the United Arts approach."
Ms. Sasse, an official with United Arts of Greater Chattanooga, Tenn., defined United Arts Funds as "any fund-raising effort that raises money for three or more arts organizations in the same region."
"When financial squeezes have the arts up against the rope," she said, "United Arts Funds groups weather the financial downturns better than individuals. During the 1991-92 recession, United Arts Funds saw a 2 percent increase in fund-raising, while other groups had a decrease."
The Westchester Arts Council conducts an annual Campaign for the Arts, which last year raised $850,000 for arts programs.
Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the Arts Council, said the goal for this year's campaign is $1 million. "A majority of the money goes to artists," she said.
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke heads this year's campaign, which began in May and ends in September.
Ms. Langsam said one example of a new approach to fund-raising is "workplace giving," which uses payroll deductions or pledge cards to set aside money for the arts. She said the Arts Council would introduce the plan in the county this fall.
"We're going to go into the workplace and bring a visual arts or performance program with us," she said.
"I don't expect a big return this year -- I expect a snowball effect. Workplace giving is done all over the country."
Ms. Langsam said she was eager to show off the great wealth of Westchester's arts organizations. Participants at the conference will have dinner at the Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College and attend a performance of "High Spirits" by the Phoenix Theater Company in the Performing Arts Center, also at Purchase College.
In addition, they will tour the Katonah Museum, Kykuit and the Reader's Digest art collection and will attend a concert at Caramoor.
"We are privileged to have been selected for the conference," said Ms. Langsam, who serves on the board of the National Arts Funds coalition.
The last time the meeting was held in the county was in 1987.
The regular conference fee is $445 for coalition members and $525 for nonmembers. The Westchester Arts Council is offering a package for county residents of $225 for a limited number of events, including the two keynote addresses. Individuals may also attend the lunch at which Mr. Brademus will speak on July 29 at noon for $40.
A special fee will also be offered for events on July 31, which will focus on the government's role in arts funding and new tax regulations.
Those interested in attending the conference should call Pat Braja at the Westchester Arts Council at 428-4220.

HEADLINE: Welfare Program Helps Many Climb the Ladder

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN 

 BODY:
THIRTY-NINE-YEAR-OLD Frances S., the mother of two, was dependent on public assistance for years. In addition to battling a drug and alcohol problem, she became homeless after an abusive marriage and lived in a shelter with her children.
Now Frances, a Briarcliff Manor resident whose full name is being withheld to avoid embarrassing her family, is off welfare and working 20 hours a week with autistic children as a behavioral therapist. She credits a model program with helping her turn her life around. 
"I was despondent when I began this program," Frances said. "But I wanted to do something with my life. I was always good with kids. This program gave me the confidence to try to find a job working with kids and to get the training I'd need to do it. I feel good about myself now. I never felt so good in my life. I'm doing something important and working toward a career."
The Family Self-Sufficiency program was started by the Federal Government in 1992 for people receiving housing subsidies. It is operated by the county's Department of Planning. A participating family member signs a contract, promising to work toward individual economic and personal goals that will get them off public assistance in five years.
The program is also available to the working poor -- those earning too much to qualify for assistance. These participants sign contracts pledging to improve themselves financially. In return, each family receives job counseling and referrals to programs that will assist them.
"People in dire financial straits are forced to live day to day," said Doreen T. Capozza, employment counselor for the program. "It is unlikely that they will be able to plan ahead. I asked them what they want to be doing in five years. What they are good at. These are people who never expected to think in terms of these questions."
The program is voluntary and open to people receiving Section 8 rental assistance from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Section 8 program is operated by the Planning Department in 17 Westchester municipalities. Families are eligible for Section 8 assistance based on income levels. They must pay 30 percent of their income in rent, with the Federal program paying the rest.
When the Department of Housing and Urban Development started the Family Self-Sufficiency program in 1992, it invited counties and municipalities to apply. In Westchester, the Planning Department and the city of New Rochelle signed up.
The Planning Department had to have 90 of its 1,436 Section 8 clients enrolled by August 1994. That goal was met, and there are now 107 people in the program, with 220 expected by November 1997. New Rochelle is still setting up its program.
Westchester is one of 26 counties in the state involved in the program. Of the first 95 enrolled in the county, 49 were working poor and 46 were on public assistance. Sixteen of those are now off public assistance. Two of them went off welfare but are now back on.
Those who sign the contract set up short- and long-term goals with a counselor. The long-term goal is always a good-paying job that will lead to self-sufficiency, but short-term goals can vary and might include arranging for child care so a parent can work, taking part in a program leading to a general equivalency diploma, enrolling in college classes or obtaining literacy or vocational training. Ms. Capozza provides monthly job-search workshops.
Cynthia A. Wallquist, Family Self-Sufficiency coordinator for the county's Planning Department, said: "The final goal is independence, but we try to help them along the way and take care of their needs, such as if they need to learn English or find a support group for battered women. They receive a great deal of advice. The real purpose of the program is to give them somebody to work with."
The county contracts with three community groups to provide some case management. Such groups include the Westchester Hispanic Coalition, Hope Inc. in northern Westchester and Cluster Inc. in Yonkers.
The contract signer meets with a counselor every three months to assess progress and make adjustments. As an incentive, an escrow account is established for the participant; if the participant increases total household income while on the program, 30 percent of the participant's income still goes toward rent, but the amount the Federal Government saves as a result of the increased contribution goes into the account, as future money for the participant.
Participants can withdraw the money when they meet their final goal or if they stay off welfare for a year. The money can also be used to pay for education or transportation that helps them meet their goals.

HEADLINE: From Wall St. Guru to Mutual-Fund Empire Builder

 BODY:
WHEN Mario J. Gabelli was a freshman at Fordham University in the early 1960's, he had already developed a precocious interest in the stock market, poring over The Wall Street Journal and buying shares in companies like ITT. But what old friends really remember from those college years were Mr. Gabelli's business ventures -- the airline catering business, the student trips to Bermuda, the flashlights he sold from the trunk of his car during electrical brownouts.
Three decades later, the 53-year-old Mr. Gabelli has become one of Wall Street's most respected stock pickers, with a stellar record of managing money for big institutions and, through mutual funds, individual investors. As befits a Wall Street guru, he appears often in investment magazines and on television, with his shock of silver hair and his mastery of bons mots -- usually with exclamation points at the end. 
 But the entrepreneurial spirit of his school days has also remained strong, and as the mutual-fund business has boomed in the 1990's, Mr. Gabelli has become one of its certified stars. In the last several years, trading on his well-honed wise man's image, he has fashioned a growing empire of mutual funds that bear his name, including several new ones run by managers he employs.
Now, as he seeks to expand his $9 billion firm still further, pursuing a link with a foreign firm that will give Gabelli Funds Inc. a global presence, the fate of his ambitions is being closely watched as a test case for a changing industry. In the wake of some high-profile staff defections and performance that has trailed the stock market for several years in the 1990's, even some of his admirers are asking the same question: Can Mr. Gabelli build an enterprise that lives up to his reputation, or will his results suffer as he spreads himself too thin?
"Good stock pickers are not necessarily good empire builders," said Don Phillips, president of Morningstar Inc., the fund analysis firm, and himself an investor in Mr. Gabelli's funds. "You've got to have a tremendous ego, because you are sitting in judgment on corporate America."
Asked if it is possible to manage money and run a diversified fund company, he added: "I don't know of anyone who has done it successfully."
Mr. Gabelli, characteristically, has no doubts about his ability to do both. "We're much better at picking stocks than at running a business," he said in an interview. But, "the business itself is not complicated -- all you have to do is make money for your customers." While other people manage the company for him, he added, "all I do is figure out where the world is going."
Though he may be the most prominent investment guru to face the conflict between managing money and managing a business, Mr. Gabelli is by no means alone. Enormous sums have surged into mutual funds in the last few years, and this has transformed both the money-management industry and the roles of its leading lights.
Traditionally, "money management shops" consisted of a couple of men in a room with a stock quotation machine, perhaps with an outside person to woo clients, mostly big companies. Today, mutual fund companies must hire flocks of analysts, along with people to deal with thousands of individual customers. The major ones must also offer a product line so diverse that their customers are not tempted by their rivals.
For money managers who have prospered using a specific investment technique, trying to be all things to all investors has often proved difficult.
"Can it be done well? It's hard," said Ken Gregory, a partner at Litman/Gregory & Company, which analyzes mutual funds. "Even Fidelity Investments has not done it perfectly." At Fidelity, the chairman, Edward C. Johnson 3d, gave up running money two decades ago to concentrate on running the nation's largest fund company.
Mr. Gabelli's entrepreneurial instincts were forged, he says, while he was growing up on 174th Street in the Bronx, the son of Italian immigrants "who didn't get past sixth grade." But his investment philosophy was developed at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, where he studied with Professor Roger Murray, a leading exponent of what is known as "value investing."
This school of financial thought teaches investors to avoid focusing on companies' earnings or following stock market fads. Instead, value investors look long and hard at companies' assets and the amount of cash they can generate, and try to buy stocks when they are relatively cheap.
While he was absorbing this wisdom, Mr. Gabelli continued to play the market, sometimes racing his friend Leon G. Cooperman to the pay phone to place orders with their brokers. "We're both kind of equally sick human beings," said Mr. Cooperman, who now runs Omega Advisors, a hedge fund. "But I think he's sicker than I am."
After graduation in 1967, Mr. Gabelli got his first Wall Street job, as a farm-equipment analyst at Loeb, Rhodes & Company, where he replaced another investor destined for financial fame, Michael Steinhardt.
"Only someone from the Bronx would love to go to Moline," recalled Mr. Gabelli, referring to the Illinois headquarters of Deere & Company. But two years later, those trips had lost some of their allure, and he started traveling to Hollywood, beginning his long fascination with the movie business.
In 1975, he moved to another firm, William D. Witter, and the next year, when his employer was swallowed up by Drexel Burnham Lambert, struck out on his own. This took a lot of chutzpah: In 1973 the stock market had entered a prolonged bear phase and did not recover until 1982.
"Nobody believed in stocks," Mr. Gabelli said. But, he reasoned, rich people were still buying small businesses. So he started to focus on the stocks of smaller companies, trying to figure out what their value would be if they were taken private.
This was the approach that was to make him famous. One reason it worked so well was that it gave Mr. Gabelli flexibility, according to Peter Lynch, the financial superstar and former manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund. While many investors would simply crunch numbers to see if stocks were cheap, without necessarily figuring out why or how low they might go, Mr. Lynch said, Mr. Gabelli would see value in things many other investors ignored, like cellular phone licenses. (He is known for his expertise in telephones and television.)
It was Mr. Lynch who encouraged Mr. Gabelli to get into the mutual fund business. "I was saying to him what a wonderful business it is, and he's a great investor," Mr. Lynch said. Or as Mr. Gabelli remembers it, he figured out that though his record was even better than Mr. Lynch's, he was managing a lot less money. In 1986, he opened his first mutual fund, Gabelli Asset.

BUT Mr. Gabelli would have had a hard time signing on the general public had he not succeeded so well in building a brand-name image as an investment whiz.
His breakthrough had come early on, when he sent a research report on Chris-Craft to Alan Abelson, the influential columnist for Barron's, with a note suggesting the magazine publish it because the stock was cheap. The two men had lunch, Mr. Gabelli recalled, "and that's how I got on the cover of Barron's in 1978."
Mr. Abelson suggests that there may have been a couple of steps in between the first meal and the front page. But having interviewed droves of analysts and money managers over the years, he remains an admirer of Mr. Gabelli. "He has a good wit and is a good showman," Mr. Abelson said. "If you put together a really good company analyst and an exuberant personality, what you get is a very rich guy."
Which Mr. Gabelli clearly is, though he abhors showing up on "highest paid" lists. Unlike many of his peers, he does not sport expensive suits or hand-sewn shoes. Though he does have a vacation home in Wyoming, a mecca for money managers, he likes to point out that he bought a log cabin on three acres -- and split the cost with a friend.
Old friends like Mr. Cooperman describe him as a good and loyal friend, and he is well known for giving promising young people a chance. But Mr. Gabelli is also famous for not suffering fools gladly -- and for being quick to identify them. Certainly, he does get impatient with those who disagree with him, calling people who question his expansion plans ignorant and those who doubt his vision of the telecommunications revolution simply "in the dark."
But the aspect of Mr. Gabelli's personality that awes -- and exhausts -- those who know him is his capacity for work. He travels constantly, and ships big boxes of financial documents to his destinations so he can plow through them in free moments. He researches everything exhaustively, even going to the trouble of learning a reporter's birth date before an interview.
"Nobody in this firm can match his speed and work habits," said Caesar M. P. Bryan, a portfolio manager who joined Mr. Gabelli's company last year. "My wife asked him what books he read, and he said, 'I read annual reports in bed.' "

 HE seems to expect a similar dedication from his staff. "Mario drives you, focuses you, drives you -- and teaches you in the process how to be an analyst," said Salvatore Muoio, who worked closely with Mr. Gabelli for 10 years before moving to Lazard Freres & Company in February.
Some analysts and insiders have suggested that Mr. Gabelli has trouble delegating authority, and in the early 1980's, he did do everything at his firm except deliver the mail. ("That was my job," said Douglas R. Jamieson, who runs Gabelli's institutional money management business.) Since then, Mr. Jamieson said, the company has grown tremendously, with more analysts to give Mr. Gabelli information, and more business people to manage the company.
If anyone still thinks of him as a one-man band, Mr. Gabelli said, "that image lags reality."
Neither Mr. Gabelli's management skills nor personality quirks would matter much if he stuck with money management. But, of course, Mr. Gabelli has branched out. In late 1986, he decided that some of the stocks he invested in -- what he calls asset plays -- were becoming expensive. What would do well were growth stocks, so-called because their earnings grow quickly. This was the specialty of his old friend and Columbia classmate Elizabeth R. Bramwell. So he decided to make her a star.
"I was the first one to run personality ads," Mr. Gabelli said. "I felt it was the only way we could compete."
The timing was brilliant. Though Mr. Gabelli's own Asset fund did well in 1988 and 1989, Ms. Bramwell's fund, called Gabelli Growth, did even better, scoring returns of about 40 percent each year and handily beating the overall stock market.
More funds soon followed. At first, Mr. Gabelli managed the new offerings, leading some analysts to wonder if he was spreading himself too thin. But they were even more alarmed when he started sponsoring funds run by others, in 1994 adding a gold fund and a global convertible bond fund and teaming up with another money manager to distribute a small fund family called Westwood. Including those funds, Gabelli now has 19 offerings with $4 billion in assets.
Then, in early 1994, Mr. Gabelli and Ms. Bramwell had a falling out. Mr. Gabelli said she left because she wanted to run her own business. Ms. Bramwell said Mr. Gabelli was not giving her the staff she needed and was trying to force her to move out of the company's New York office, which was to close, and into his headquarters in Rye, N.Y., which she found inconvenient.
The brouhaha, which seemed avoidable, continues to baffle many analysts -- especially since Mr. Gabelli kept the New York City office after all (he said recently that the landlord made him a deal). In any event, his search for a replacement for Ms. Bramwell, which took until early this year, may have distracted him from investing.
"The expansionary activities of the Gabelli organization have made me wonder if it detracts from the one thing he is very good at, which is picking stocks," said Tim Medley, an investment adviser in Jackson, Miss.
Investment performance has been a bit uneven in recent years. After suffering losses in 1990, Mr. Gabelli's two big funds saw performance improve the following year, though both failed to match the overall stock market's stellar performance. That changed in 1992 and 1993, when both funds were strong. Last year, the funds kept losses to a minimum in a tough market, but were not superstars, and both are lagging in this year's soaring stock market.
"Through the 1980's, he was phenomenal," said one analyst, who asked not to be identified because he feared Mr. Gabelli would stop speaking to him. "Now his record is good, not phenomenal -- he's even looked human at times."
Of course, a lot of people would be happy to have his results. Mr. Gabelli points out that over the last three years, his more aggressive fund, Gabelli Value, has outpaced Fidelity Magellan, though that behemoth fund outscores his on a five-year basis. Besides, he said, his goal is to make for his customers 10 percent a year plus inflation, and this year the big funds have already beaten that bogey.
But what really galls Mr. Gabelli are reports of glitches and regulatory problems at his firm. In April, for example, investors in some Gabelli funds were among those who received incorrect account statements, a problem that was traced to the company that Gabelli and many fund companies contract with to prepare the reports.
Last year, Gabelli settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said its policies to prevent insider trading were lax, though the agency did not accuse Mr. Gabelli or his firm of profiting from inside information. In 1992, Mr. Gabelli ran into trouble with the Federal Communications Commission over his ownership of media companies, and in 1988, he and his firm settled S.E.C. charges related to a failed takeover attempt.
Mr. Gabelli said he did not feel that regulators were picking on him, but noted that when other mutual fund companies ran into trouble -- and there have been some big scandals in the last few years -- nobody pointed the finger at their chief executives. Though Fidelity was recently fined almost 50,000, or $80,000, by British regulators, for example, newspapers have not "written up Ned Johnson's difficulties with compliance," he wrote in a recent letter.
To some extent, Mr. Gabelli's many puzzled admirers seem to be reacting the way sports fans did when Michael Jordan abandoned basketball and took up baseball. And Mr. Gabelli himself cannot clearly explain why he is driven to develop a big fund company, though he allows that it may have something to do with building a family dynasty; his son Marc joined the firm in 1993.
It seems likely that Mr. Gabelli, like Mr. Jordan, will be unable to give up the job at which he truly excels. A new chief financial officer, Steven M. Joenk, recently joined Gabelli Funds from Paine Webber Inc., and will handle matters like financial reporting and human resources.
Meanwhile, Mr. Gabelli continues to think, talk, eat, drink and breathe stocks -- and he has no intention of stopping. "To do what?" he asks. "I want to come to the office and trade stocks in 2035."

HEADLINE: After the Fall: 2 Faces of Mexico's Economy

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
MOST Wednesdays, at precisely 2 P.M., Government officials gather here at the ornate National Palace to give the latest figures on declining inflation, surging stock prices and other positive signs of Mexico's steady climb back to economic stability.
While the good news is being related inside, unemployed Mexican workers sometimes mill outside on the huge Plaza of the Constitution, occasionally swaggering up to a microphone facing the palace windows. They are hungry, they call out, and they are angry because the Government is forcing them to pay for getting the nation's economy back on track. 
 The difference between what is said in the palace and what is shouted on the plaza underscores an inescapable conclusion about Mexico almost seven months after the peso was disastrously devalued: the economy here now has two faces. One is reflected in steadily improving macroeconomic indicators; the other reveals the deepening misery of Mexico's 91 million people.
The extent to which Mexico can draw those two economies together in the coming months will determine not only how well it recovers from this latest crisis, but also whether it will be able to overcome some of the fundamental problems that have for so long created appalling gaps between the rich and poor in Mexico.
Should it fail to draw the economies closer, many fear a period of deepening political and social unrest in a country that has already been shaken for more than a year by a peasant uprising and a string of assassinations.
The outcome is of critical importance to the United States, which is still waiting for the promised benefits from the North American Free Trade Agreement and is fearful of a new wave of illegal immigration if conditions worsen.
And while the Mexican Government trumpets the latest positive numbers, it is far from declaring victory.
"We are very careful not to claim that because we have made progress in returning to the market that the crisis is over," said Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz. "We will say the crisis is over when we get some real growth going and employment increasing."
Still, the palace version of the economy is positive indeed. With surprising speed, the Mexican stock exchange has bounced back to pre-devaluation levels. Inflation rates are still high, around 3 percent a month, but declining broadly after peaking at 8 percent in April. Although the peso is now allowed to float freely, it has remained at around the same level -- between 6 and 6.3 to the dollar -- for weeks.
What's more, Mexico had a $165 million trade surplus in the first quarter and the Government last week successfully placed $1 billion in commercial notes, a startlingly swift recovery considering that after the last financial crisis here, in 1982, it took seven years to regain access to international capital.
From the plaza, however, the Government's recovery program looks more like a virus than a cure.
Fearing hyperinflation, the Government essentially shut down the economy here, raising prices on basic items like electricity, gasoline and even tortillas. Interest rates on consumer loans reached 100 percent and, though dropping, still exceed a punishing 45 percent. Banks have repossessed houses and cars in record numbers. Inflation far outstrips wage increases. And perhaps worst of all, in a country with no unemployment insurance, as many as a million people may have lost jobs since January.
As the Government's March 9 recovery plan of budget cuts, tax increases, price hikes and a tight money supply continues to take hold, the gap between the palace and the plaza economies appears to grow wider. That is hard for President Ernesto Zedillo to accept because he campaigned on a promise of personal well-being and prosperity for Mexican families. But even he concedes that the hardships are likely to get worse before a real turnaround begins.
The Government hopes that as investor confidence slowly returns in the second half of the year, and exports remain strong, companies will begin to buy equipment and expand, providing jobs that will lead to some positive growth by the end of the year. Government spending will also increase throughout the rest of this year, while the national development banks will start to make more credit available.
But until then, as savings run out and the recession hits harder, more jobs will be lost and more pockets will go empty.
"There's a big difference between what the Government says and what we the people feel," said Maria Ortega, a 28-year-old nurse from Puebla, a colonial city about 50 miles southeast of Mexico City. Like other civil servants, she received a 13 percent wage increase this year, "but that's not enough to cover my bus fare," she complained.
It's not just having to pull their belts tighter that bothers many Mexicans like Ms. Ortega. They remember how just a little more than a year ago the Mexican economy was widely praised, with a booming stock market and the ability to attract billions of dollars in foreign investment. They believed the Government's promises that by entering the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico was entering the first world.
ALL that collapsed last December when Mexico jolted world markets with the devaluation, which caught the United States and others by surprise and set off a chain reaction that sent investors and their dollars fleeing.
Faced with a spreading disaster, the Government appealed for help from the international community and dedicated itself to a major restructuring that would eliminate the $30 billion in volatile short-term foreign capital on which it had been financing much of its expansion. Squeezing out that $30 billion meant putting the economy into a straitjacket.
It was a classic response to a recurring problem. The economies of eastern Europe and many countries elsewhere in Latin America have adopted the same rigid therapy to rehabilitate their economies, with the same painful results.
The United States brokered a rescue plan for Mexico last February that includes $20 billion in loans and loan guarantees from Washington and about $30 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund and other organizations. When they lobbied for the package last January, American officials said the help was needed to prevent the short-term crisis "from escalating into a prolonged and severe economic downturn, which would put at risk important U.S. interests," in particular 700,000 export-related jobs.
Already, what had been a positive trade balance with Mexico has turned into another deficit for the United States. Without some relief for the Mexicans who cannot now afford American imports, jobs north of the border could be lost, too.
Some members of Congress, led by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, are still opposed to assisting Mexico financially. Senator D'Amato held a hearing in Washington on Friday in which he rapped the Mexican Government for its management of the economy and for the pace with which it has been tapping the loan package. It has already made use of $12.5 billion in United States credits and another $9.8 billion from the I.M.F.
Such criticism is causing the Mexican Government to fight a battle on two fronts, trying to show American officials that the international rescue has worked while also attempting to show its own people that it is not unaware of the gap between the macroeconomic indicators and everyday life.
Mr. Ortiz said the Government knew that making a huge economic adjustment would be painful, but believed it was unavoidable. "If we hadn't got the macroeconomics right," he said, "it would be much more difficult to make progress on the real side of the economy."
The Government clearly has been getting the macroeconomics right. On almost every issue that had become a concern to international investors, Mexico has scored at least a temporary success.
The stability of the peso is one of the most surprising. Before the recovery plan was announced in March, the peso had dropped to 7.45 to the dollar, a decline of 54 percent since the devaluation.
But steps taken by the central bank have helped bring the peso back to around 6 to the dollar. Peso futures are now traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Mexico's central bank reveals the level of international reserves and the money supply every week so investors know where the country is heading. Before the devaluation, reserves were officially announced just three times a year.
The last time the reserves were announced before the crisis was in October, when they stood at about $17 billion. Within a month after the crisis began in December, the reserves stood at only slightly above $2 billion. Since then, they have bounced back to $14.35 billion, mostly with the help of the United States aid package.
AT the heart of the crisis were doubts about Mexico's ability to pay its debts. As 1994 ended, Mexico had $29 billion worth of outstanding tesobonos -- short-term Government bonds denominated in pesos yet payable in dollars. As the peso lost value, and tesobono holders demanded to be paid in dollars, Mexico faced a liquidity problem.
But Mexico was able to use the aid package to cover its obligations. Now, only $8.9 billion of tesobonos are outstanding. Of that amount, about $6.6 billion come due the rest of this month and in August. Given the current reserves of Mexico, only a few analysts are worried about its ability to make the payments.
As the peso lost value earlier in the year, so did Mexican stocks. First-quarter profits were depressed but not as badly as some had feared. As interest rates started to drop during the second quarter, the picture improved. A rate cut by the United States Federal Reserve on July 6 gave additional help to the leading index of the stock exchange here. On Friday, the index closed at 2,531.49, more than a thousand points above its post-devaluation low of 1,447.52, which was set on Feb. 27. The stock market's recovery, however, is not all that it seems because in dollar terms, the exchange is still down more than 18 percent.
In some cases, the devaluation of the peso has been both a boon and a burden for the same Mexican industry. Auto exports are soaring while domestic sales are slumping badly. For example, exports of the Ford Motor Company of Mexico have increased 50 percent since January. The company recently announced $450 million worth of direct investment, mostly in plants dedicated to producing exports.
At same time, however, few Mexicans can afford a new car and Ford's domestic sales have plummeted. In the first five months of the year, Ford sold 10,999 cars and trucks, a drop of 20,579 from the same period in 1994.
Chrysler's domestic sales are down 75 percent; General Motors 40 percent. Volkswagen, which still produces the Beetle in Mexico, has also been hit hard. It sold 503 Beetles in May, compared with 6,283 in May 1994.
THOSE harsh domestic realities have many investors nervous, notwithstanding the bullish macroeconomic indicators.
"They've really got a recession going on," said Scott Kalb, manager of the Smith Barney International Asset Management Fund. "They are going to have some very poor earnings results come out for the second quarter. They've got a tough political situation and plenty of potential for political problems, labor problems and social unrest."
Mexico's plaza economy is better reflected in the eyes of the weary than in Government figures, but statistics give a sense of the difficulty facing most families.
Of all the bad signs, unemployment is the worst. Mexico's national statistics institute estimates that more than two million people are unemployed, double the number of last December. That comes to an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent, the highest since figures started to be collected 12 years ago.
But those official figures are unreliable because virtually anyone who earns anything is counted as employed, even someone who sells gum at a traffic light. President Zedillo's own Labor Secretary, Santiago Onate Laborde, doubts the figures, saying at a news conference recently that the number of unemployed workers was closer to six million.
The only thing that seems certain is that unemployment will get worse as the recession continues. Few new jobs are being created, but this year nearly two million Mexicans will enter the work force.
Government officials expect the numbers for the second quarter of this year to show the economy contracting by as much as 5 percent, and they forecast no growth at all until the end of the year at best. The leaders of several of Mexico's most important business groups told President Zedillo last week that if the economy did not start to improve soon, there would be more unemployment, more business closings and more social unrest.
Life is hard even for those who have jobs. The minimum wage has gone up twice since December, 7 percent the first time and 12 percent the second, but still stands at no more than $3 a day. Contract wage settlements have averaged around 12 percent, with 8 percent more in fringe benefits. But inflation for the first six months of 1995 reached a compounded rate of 33 percent and even under the best of estimates will come close to 50 percent for the year.
The price of gasoline, produced only by the state oil monopoly Pemex, will have increased 48.5 percent by the end of the year, pushing up prices for everything that moves by truck. Even the price of tortillas, the flat corn pancakes that are a daily staple, has risen twice since the crisis began.
As part of its plan to avoid hyperinflation, raise revenues and suppress demand, the Government increased the national value-added tax to 15 percent, from 10 percent, on April 1.
THAT in itself produced a spike in inflation for the month of April to a post-devaluation high of 8 percent, but the shock was great enough to stop demand short, theoretically limiting a spiral of price increases.
To survive the falloff in retail sales -- down at least 40 percent in the first four months of the year -- many store owners are opening earlier and closing later. And like the Mexico City pizza shop that now serves breakfast or the Chrysler dealer who turned his showroom into a car wash, they are willing to try anything.
Even the rich have been hurt. The number of billionaires in Mexico declined this year to 10, from 24, but there is no need to feel sorry for them. The net worth of Mexico's richest man, Carlos Slim Helu, whose holdings include the Mexican telephone company, was cut in half but still totals $3.7 billion.
Mr. Slim has said in interviews that he has no doubt Mexico will bounce back from the crisis, and perhaps be even stronger than before.
For their part, international investors and analysts say they are fairly confident that the harsh medicine that Mexico's leaders have administered will be enough to revive the economy.
But they are still uncertain whether, after all the pain and hardship caused by this latest crisis, Mexico will make the long-term changes necessary to correct fundamental problems in its economy.
They are still looking for some clearly defined Government policy to create the millions of new jobs needed each year to account for Mexico's high birth rate. They are hoping to see a plan for building on the export advantage offered by the devaluation, which is rapidly being eaten away by inflation.
And they are waiting to see how Mexico intends to increase productivity and efficiency to compete with other Latin American countries as they shake off the effects of the Mexican crisis.
Out in the plaza, plenty of angry people are also waiting. For them, it will take more than a continuing stream of good news from the palace to keep the anger from boiling over.

 BODY:
HE rode standing by the subway door, over 6 feet tall, and hanging to a strap on the No. 1 heading into the Bronx. He looked young, strong, mean. The dark look in his eyes, the sneer on his lips were unmistakable: blank hatred. Contempt.
Was he a gang member? Or a freelance thug? Was he armed? 
 Asked to talk for a few minutes, he said something, but too softly. He spoke again: incomprehensible. Frightening.
He reached into his back pocket.
The plastic card he pulled out said: "Hsiao I. Chyi (Show-Yee Chee). Father's name: Michael Chyi." And it gave a number for the Brooklyn Transition Center.
He was no thug. He was retarded. A few of his words became clear: "My mother . . . work . . . mother." Suddenly, his face showed utter vulnerability, not raging anger. He clung close for an hour, checking the subway map, trying to be helpful.
At the turn of the century, when the subways first opened, the ride was exhilarating. People rode just for the experience. At first, they even bought tickets just to stand on the platform to watch. In 1904, while Einstein was using imaginary trains to illustrate the theory of relativity, social theorists were supposing that the everyday mixing of races, classes and sexes on the subways would make them a breeding ground for practical democracy. Later the poets Langston Hughes and Joyce Kilmer would express the same hope.
But the subways quickly receded into the functional backdrop of life and the impersonal subway trance became an archetypal New York pose, one identifiable even to riders of subways in other cities. People ride hip to hip, sometimes for hours a day, years on end, in perfect obedience to some of the city's premier taboos: no eye contact and no talking to strangers.
The consistent rumble of the subway encourages the protective trance, lulling riders into inner worlds. And, as in the case of Hsiao I. Chyi, the masks that remain can tell a misleading story.
On Monday, between 7 A.M. and midnight, about 60 people on the Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 9 trains were asked about their ride, their day, their concerns at the moment.
Marcello Ortiz, a suited computer analyst, was on his daily 40-minute commuting trip from 225th Street to 23d Street. If the coming day was rough as he thought it would be, he said, he might stand on the platform in the evening as long as an hour, letting train after train pass. "Until I get my bearings," he said. "Then I get on a train, go home, see my son and my daughter."
Yvon Palomino, a 24-year-old architecture intern in a black dress, was on her way from White Plains to the World Trade Center, thinking about the visit she planned that night to a friend whose father had died. "He was pretty sick already, so it wasn't a surprise, but still. . . . " She looked sad.
A black-haired, genial man turned out to be Jorge Bustamente, a 36-year-old Peruvian who works in maintenance at the auto showrooms on 11th Avenue. He was thinking about his mother, back in Lima, who has diabetes, and about how he would like to be a painter. "Not like painting a house," he said. "Painting like arts. Sometimes I paint, I throw it away."
The gray-haired man with the overnight bag was Bob Guerra, 57, a film art director, on his way back to the city from his summer house in Greenport, L.I. Daniel Bogin, 18 and savvy, had stayed over at a friend's because they didn't leave the Limelight in Chelsea till 3:30 A.M. Sally Swischer was hurrying to get her two children to the opening day of the Bank Street day camp. All three were eating bananas. "We're late," explained Gabriel, 9, who had a cast on his left arm. "I tripped when I was running."
It was like that all day long. Rider after rider peeled off the subway mask and became a mother, a brother, a husband, a lost soul. Some inner worlds were happy places, filled with dreams and plans. Some revealed a deep awareness of status; people sized up other riders in terms of profession, income, attire. Some knew they looked odd or frightening to others. Some were filled with anguish. In general, the masks were thin, often removed willingly and rapidly at the simple request for a few minutes' talk.
Maybe their stories don't make any one point. But if you have ever sat on the train and and wondered who that was with the weird hair or the saggy eyes or the endless bundles, here is a sample of one day's answers.
 
THE TROUBLED MAN
William Murray, 31
It is nearing 10 A.M., and the No. 1 is moving into the Bronx. A red-haired, bearded man sits disheveled near the door. His skin is networked with broken blood vessels, his blue eyes shy and full of feeling under his cap. He is on his way to Yonkers.
"I go twice a week, to see Beverly," he says politely, his eyes on the floor. "We're separated. We separated three months ago. We have a daughter. Her name is Tammy. Her nickname is Tamika. She's 8 years old.
"She's pretty like her moms." There is pride, and ineffable loss, in his voice.
"Mother died four or five months ago. My dad died when I was 9. He was Alfred Sr. Her name was Rosella. She had a heart attack and died in Yonkers General. She knew she wasn't going to make it."
He's been checked out by every rider: glanced at, dismissed. He looks at their faces. "They got things on their minds. Sometimes you see it. I ask 'em what's the matter. Sometimes they talk about it."
He looks at a mother and son across the car. "It makes me think about my daughter, that she's O.K., that she's healthy." He pauses, and looks up. For the first time, he meets the interviewer's eyes. "I think about getting back together with my wife."
 
MAN WITH BIKE AND ATTITUDE
Carlos Cintron, 37, maintenance worker at a Barnes & Noble superstore
At 12:45 P.M. on the No. 2, heading out to Nevins Street, in Brooklyn, he sits with his bicycle secured against his knees, wearing bike gloves. There is a brace on his right knee and a white, knotted scar on his right upper arm. When a photographer takes his picture, he makes an obscene gesture. But little by little, he tells his story.
"I'm thinking about a lot of things right now. Mainly about an old girlfriend. I had to break up with her. She was using drugs. I helped her out, but she didn't show me appreciation.
"I read the subway posters. They used to have those pictures of hands with needles sticking out of them. Why do they have those? Kids see that, they copy from that.
"I read the poetry sometimes." He looks at a Poetry in Motion poster. It's "First Memory," by Louise Gluck.
Long ago, I was wounded. I lived
To revenge myself
against my father, not
for what he was --
for what I was. From the beginning of time,
in childhood, I thought
that pain meant
I was not loved.
It meant I loved.
"That touched me. I wasn't raised with a father. My stepfather used to hurt us a lot. I never had the love of a mother, with hugging and so on. She always pushed us away. Now, it's hard for me to find somebody.
"And if I find somebody, it's hard for me to let go. Even when they're bad to me. People tell me, 'Let go!' But I can't.
"The person who most loved me passed away in September. That was my wife. She had a heart murmur, and her liver wasn't strong. She was only 38.
"I only knew her about three years. I met her in front of a hotel on 34th Street. She looked so lonely. So we met, and we had a relationship, and the next month, we got married.
"Now, I'm always by myself. When I have a day off, I just go with my bike and leave. I don't call nobody on my block. I just leave."
 
BATTERED PREGNANT WOMAN
Clarissa Strong, 39
On the No. 2 at Atlantic Avenue, she lies down to sleep. Her face is shadowed; when she sits up to talk, the bruises leap out. Under her right eye is a purple crescent. Her lips are swollen and scabbed, her teeth reordered by force. She speaks clearly, but tears keep welling up in her eyes.
"I sleep on the subway. Why? Because I am a battered, pregnant woman." She lifts her skinny arms to put her hands on her belly, showing the firm swell.
"It's a girl, my first baby. I got prenatal. I haven't named her yet. This is the safest place I can find to sleep.
"He did this yesterday. The father of my baby. Because I dared to express my opinion. What about? Doesn't matter. Everybody has their own opinion.
"He lives in Park Slope, where I used to live. Since he's there, I'm here.
"Everybody complains about the subway, but it's the best place I know of to sleep."
She declines offers to help her find a place to go, but accepts a folded $20 bill. "God is good," she says. "What's your name? Maybe that'll be the baby's name."
 
SOCIALLY AWARE MAN
Michael Reid, 39
He's sleeping, a Gilligan's Island hat perched on his head. He wakes up, startled, but is willing to chat. He is on the No. 2, going to his job, security at a housing project in East New York. He bought the hat on Broadway, last winter.
"I go to the Burke Trade School during the day, and work 4 to midnight. I'm learning how to be a plumber. I was tired, so I was sleeping. Usually, I go over my work, or I read. I just finished 'Laughing in the Dark,' by Patrice Gaines. It's about the trials and tribulations of a woman, about growing up black in America. She had a lot of trouble, started using heroin. She wound up being a reporter at The Washington Post.
"It tells about the troubles she had with her father, her mother. How she fell in love with the wrong kind of men. How she struggles to educate her child.
"It's pretty serious stuff. I know other people read things to escape reality. But how often do you get to take a vacation from life? I think it's more important to learn about life, in order to become a link in the chain. To do any kind of job, as long as you know why you're doing it."
 
YOUNG MOTHER WITH PLAN FOR ESCAPE
Lucrecia Applewaite, 34
It's 1:30 P.M. in Brooklyn, and the No. 2 train rumbles above ground out of the Utica Avenue station, amid broken buildings and shattered car-strewn lots. There is a dog on a roof on the left; on the right, a plane coming out of J.F.K. In the corner of the train, she plays with her 18-month-old daughter, Rodericka, and keeps an eye on her various bundles of dry cleaning and shopping bags.
"I work on the subways. I'm a track worker, on the 10 P.M. to 6 A.M. shift. But I guess I see them like most people: I'm just as frustrated as anybody else when they don't run right. Maybe I take a little bit of pride in it when they do.
"I go to Chambers Street, to shop for clothes and to do my dry cleaning. It's a lot cheaper than in this neighborhood. But I go to Pathmark in Starrett City for groceries. I take Rodericka with me wherever I go. I don't trust day cares. When I do a lot of shopping, I try to have the bigger stroller; it can hold more.
"My husband, Roderick, he works days as a train operator. So we trade off taking care of her.
"I'm into business, like how to get involved in the stock market. I'm going back to school in hotel and restaurant management. She'll go to day care then. I found one I can trust, run by some relatives. But I'm going to school full time, right through to my master's. It'll take about seven years.
"That'll be about 2002. I'll be ready to move out of New York. Maybe to Connecticut. I like that place."
 
THE SUBWAY CASANOVA
Felix I., 18
At 2:35 P.M., he gets on the No. 2 to head to 14th Street, to his job as a package handler at a delivery service. He looks simultaneously forbidding and comfortable; the subway is his domain.
"I don't do anything on the train. I sleep. Catch a few winks. I don't worry, not at all. Nobody taking nothing from me.
"I guess I scare people sometimes. Sometimes I sit down, and somebody gets up and walks away. I don't really care. That's up to them. Everybody has their own way of thinking.
"I think about girls. Not any one in particular, just in general. You meet a lot of girls on the subway. If I want to talk to one, I ask her what's her name. Something simple. And just go from there.
"Sometimes they talk back.
"Did I have a relationship from that? You could say I did." He looks a little embarrassed. "Not for a long time, if you get my meaning."
 
WOMEN BUSINESS TYPES
Kana Norimoto, 23, and Leah Zarahn, 34
Just before 6 P.M., and a No. 9 train heads north out of Times Square, crowded with officer workers heading home. Ms. Norimoto, who just got a job at Salomon Brothers, is lost in the crowds of legs and briefcases. Ms. Zarahn, who is about to take over a printing company, is sitting next to her, looking pensive and satisfied.
Ms. Norimoto: "I was a student at Columbia, in poly sci. But I start at Salomon Brothers next week, in the corporate bond research group. That's what I wanted.
"I was looking for apartments today. It was quite hellish. But I think I found one, in Gramercy Park.
"I normally don't take the subway at rush hour, though I guess I will be soon. I was trying to escape. Lose myself in The Economist, or escape from reality. And I was thinking, It's sort of hellish, isn't it?
"It'll be exhausting. And until I move, I'll have a 15-minute walk to the subway, wearing uncomfortable shoes. I've been contemplating wearing sneakers to work. But it looks kind of dorky."
Ms. Zarahn: "I work at a printing company, Angstrom Business Forms. I'm in graphics, sales. I wear a lot of different hats: Suzy Operator, Mr. Estimator. Whatever comes up. I love it. I've been doing it about eight years now. The guy who started it is getting on, and it's time for new blood. I'm in the process of taking the company over; I'll be president."
The two women have been listening to each other talk. They smile. "It could happen to you," Ms. Zarahn tells Ms. Norimoto. "I was in the right place at the right time. Shoot for the top. You never know where you're going to end up."
Ms. Norimoto smiles shyly. "It would be nice if it came true. But I'm a perserverer."
Ms. Zarahn nods. "In New York, you've got to be a survivor."
 
THE YUGOSLAVIAN REFUGEE
Hal Muriqi, 32
He gets on the No. 9 at Times Square, heading up to the last stop in the Bronx, 242d Street, where he'll get a bus to Yonkers. He clutches a Daily News, but is lost in thought.
"I came from Kosova, in the former Yugoslavia, seven years ago. It was before the war started, but I could feel it was coming. I'm not Muslim or Croat. I'm Albanian. But the Serbs control us. The repression police.
"My mother, my father is there. And a brother. Three sisters. They're all right. Here, I have two brothers and one sister. I came with my sister just now. She got an immigrant visa.
"I just read today how in Serbia they change, they don't control the media. But I don't believe it.
"I work in building maintenance, on 42d Street. And I study at N.Y.U. I am a mechanical engineer, and my diploma is equivalent from there to here. It will take me a year to get a master's. But when you are not happy about what is going on there, it is hard to concentrate.
"It is different there. When you ride in a bus or train, you speak to people. There, everybody is more friendly, more helpful. Here it is not so. I feel lonely sometimes.
"Maybe people are nice. Secretly nice. You can't tell if somebody's nice until you talk to them. And maybe that's why people are afraid here. They don't talk to each other."
 
THE YOUNG LOVER
Enrique Gutirez, 19
 6:30 P.M. He gets on at 242d Street, drops into a seat and starts nodding off. Homemade blue tattoos stretch down his left arm. He looks impassive, but agrees to talk and speaks in a strong Mexican accent.
"I'm working dispatch, for a messenger service for Color Labs. It's 7 A.M. to 3 P.M. That's why I'm asleep. When I'm finished, I have to go see my girlfriend, and I'm asleep in the subway. I live in East New York, she lives up here. It's two hours on the train.
Her name is Betsy. "She's beautiful," he says reverently. "I met her at a party. She didn't know how to dance. I show her. Tropical style: salsa, merengue. I came from Mexico City, six years ago."
He pulls a gold chain from his left pocket, a popular kind that has a name in gold script at the front. Betsy, it says. "I was going to give it to her today. But her brothers and her father was there. I'll give it to her tomorrow. I have to see her every day, because I like her much."
 
PROSPEROUS PAIR BASED IN L.A.
Robert Benavides, 35, broker, and Buck Gibbs, 45, who works in retail marketing for Federal Express
9:20, heading downtown on the No. 1 train. They get on at Christopher Street, sit down, cross their legs, and start reading. They are here for a visit. Mr. Benavides was born in New York, and has a native's reticence. But Mr. Gibbs, who is from Los Angeles, says he has always liked the subway and seems delighted by the novelty of being interviewed there.
Mr. Benavides: "I just block it all out."
Mr. Gibbs: "And I asked him why he did that. But I think I know why. I think they do that so they're not bothered." He points to Mr. Benavides. "He started walking fast as soon as he got here. But he's adapted well to L.A. He bought a 4 by 4.
"I used to people-watch more. Actually, I think the subways are like the freeways in L.A. You look over into the next car, and you either speed up or slow down."
 
THE OLD MAN
Sean Callery, 70
10 P.M. at the Chambers Street station, and a young black man stands to scream at a photographer. "What are you doing? You aren't supposed to do that!" he yells over and over. A white-haired old man floats by. There is something odd about him. His dark T-shirt is a bit small for his big chest and belly, his pants hang beltless. The No. 3 pulls in, and he gets on, followed by Vandel Matthews, 43, who sings a lilting version of "Summertime." He hands her some coins. He is well spoken, and wry, a former political publicist.
"You know, 'Porgy and Bess' is politically incorrect. It's patronizing.
"I'm headed home to Bay Ridge. I was at an A.A. meeting. I go to the meeting on Houston Street because it's various. The meeting in Bay Ridge tends to be more homogeneous. It's not, shall we say, of my milieu exactly, except that they're drunks.
"I mainly worked for Democrats, but the Republicans bought me. Republicans have much better manners. I used to say they ran the only campaigns where I was allowed to finish a sentence. Democrats, on the other hand, are much more fun. They're various.
"My ride is slightly under an hour. So I think. What do I think? I think what a wonderful human being I am and how underappreciated I am." He takes a quick look to make sure he isn't being taken too seriously. His voice doesn't change, but suddenly he speaks without irony.
"I was very taken with that lady who sang. I thought, why can't she be directed somewhere where her talent would be appreciated. And I thought, Isn't that sad? And, Isn't that just like me?
"And that very angry man who didn't want his picture taken. He thought you were putting him down. He sees you as the oppressor. I don't see you that way. I have a nice home. I bet he hasn't. No one's ever put me down for being white or an Irish Catholic.
"But then so many people are angry, it's not exceptional. I think we're all afraid. I think there's a war against children and against old people. We're both useless."
 
FOUR HAPPY CHRISTIAN GIRLS
Latoya Reid, 16; Regina Antoine, 15; Rosa Linda, 16; Nicole Sanchez, 16
10:30 P.M., and they're coming from Central Park, from a skating party arranged by their church, Christian Lifestyle, on Linden. They regularly erupt into laughter, collapsing against each other's shoulders. In conversation, they merge into one mega-teen-ager. Sometimes all four answer in the same words at the same time.
"We're going to Brownsville, to her house!" "To her house!"
In unison: "We're not related; we're close." Gales of laughter.
What do they talk about on the train? Do they talk about boys?
"Yes!" "NO!" "Sometimes!"
What were they talking about just before? When they were laughing so hard?
All together now: "KISSING!"
Who is the cutest boy? "We know a lot," say two girls. "We know too many," say the other two.
 
THE BOXER AND THE SINGER
Dennis Groce, 27 (and 220 lbs.) and Terri Little, 25
11 P.M. New Lots Avenue, coming back on the No. 5 to Nevins Street to switch back to the 2/3. Both are on their way to work; he works security at Trump International, on 59th, she does encoding at Chemical Bank, 55 Water Street. She's wearing a Walkman. He speaks first.
"I have a Walkman, too, I just haven't put it on yet. I listen to reggae, rap. I listen to that when the train isn't crowded. When it's crowded, I turn it down, so you can be aware of what goes on around you. Say there's a bunch of dudes on the train. You have to watch them."
Ms. Little breaks in: "They bother me a lot." She says she's been flashed. "If you don't want to talk, they want to hit you. Sometimes you have to give your phone number, just so they don't hit you." The morning is worse: When it's crowded, people rub up against her, or stand in front of her like she doesn't exist. "Like I'm nothing," she says, eyes wide in complaint.
Mr. Groce nods. "It's better when she rides with me."
Mr. Groce would like to return to boxing. "I boxed for eight years. I was pretty good. I boxed last at 190 pounds. I also boxed at 160, 147. I started in 1980, at 108. Now, I'm about 220. That feels pretty good.
"I have to have the time to dedicate myself to it. But you have to work, you have to pay your bills. You really don't have the time. I just pulled a double. I got four hours' sleep and I'm headed back. And I'm just making ends meet."
Ms. Little has some connections in the music industry. "I would like to sing. My favorite song is Rochelle Ferelle, 'Nothing Has Ever Felt This Good.' She is the best, the best. No joke, for real."
 
THE NIGHT CLERK
Albert Benajam, 42
It's nearing midnight, and the No. 3 is heading into Manhattan. A night clerk at a Times Square hotel, he's carrying a grocery bag and reading from a stack of papers and books. He speaks earnestly but without humor, as though he's not used to it.
"This is my lunch. It's cookies and soda. Club soda and chocolate chip cookies. It's not balanced, but it's the best you can do. There really isn't time for anything else.
"I work midnight to 8 A.M. I live in downtown Brooklyn. Benajam is a British name, from way back.
"My hotel is right next to 'Grease' and across from 'Buttons on Broadway.' It has 180 rooms. Mostly for tourists. Most hotels work on cash or credit. These work on vouchers, paid for abroad in foreign currency. It isn't swank, but it's not one of those hotbeds or slum hotels. Though there are plenty of those in the area.
"It's interesting and it's a living. Nobody got murdered or had a dramatic story there. Not like the Chelsea or something like that. I doubt you really want to talk to me; it's not glamorous.
"I worked as a token booth clerk at the Nevins Street station a long time ago. I saw stabbings, muggings. And downtown Brooklyn, we had shopping bag robberies. There's A&S, and the Wiz, so you could be fairly sure the shopping bag would have something pretty good in it. They would just cut the strings.
"How should people ride the subway? Having worked in the subway token booth for two years, I'd say, you don't make eye contact."
He fans out his reading material. There are two hardbound copies of American Heritage magazine from 1968. "I like these. You can often find them used. They usually have something about the Civil War. That's interesting." He looks up, his gray brows high on his forehead. "I watched the PBS series." He thinks. Looks around. "Although it's a civil war down here."

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

 BODY:

STOCK OPTIONS
The Low Four Figures
 There are stock options and there are stock options; never has this been clearer. You often hear of top executives getting them -- windfalls that would pay off the mortgages in entire neighborhoods, with enough left for a few centuries' worth of groceries. But at Chemical Bank, some goodies trickled down to humbler workers last week, too; when the stock topped $50 for three days running, a share plan announced a year ago kicked in. The numbers had considerably fewer decimal places than those in executive pay packages -- a profit of $1,481 (before taxes) -- but it did spark interest. "It was amazing how suddenly the whole organization began paying attention to the stock price," said Chemical's chairman, Walter Shipley, who at yearend owned 551,950 shares and has options to buy 530,000 more.
 
TOBACCO
Yes, It's a Drug. Now What?
 The F.D.A. has this tricky problem. It has decided that nicotine is an addictive drug, and one that's clearly dangerous; plug those facts into a legal computer and you'd have to ban cigarettes. It can't do that, of course -- smokers would probably burn Washington to the ground (or bury it in ashes). So last week the agency sent some more modest ideas to the White House (given the explosiveness of this issue, it passed the buck). These included banning vending-machine sales, clamping down on sales to minors, and barring "Joe Camel"-type ads (which seem to have nearly vanished anyway). Even such modest measures face a rough ride, though. Tobacco is "a legal commodity" and should be treated as such, said one tobacco-state lawmaker, while another was "distressed" and "annoyed." . . . Also last week, a glimpse into tobacco history: In 1950, an epidemiologist named Morton Levin wrote one of the first papers to show that smoking causes lung cancer, and campaigned against smoking throughout his career. Dr. Levin just died at 91.
 
SPENDING IT
Down and Out at Genentech
 It's hard to get by on nearly $1 million a year. So to make ends meet -- and considerable ends they must be -- G. Kirk Raab kept borrowing from Genentech, where he happened to be chief executive. Finally, Mr. Raab sought a $2 million personal-loan guarantee from Roche Holdings of Switzerland, even as he was negotiating the sale of his company to Roche -- a deal, by the way, that shareholders say shortchanged them. This was too much for the board, which sent Mr. Raab packing last week. That ended a stormy tenure at this fast-growing company, one marked by strong criticism of its sales practices. A top Genentech sales executive, in fact, is about to go on trial on charges of paying kickbacks to a pediatrician to prescribe Genentech's growth hormone.
 
INVESTIGATIONS
Blowing a Golden Whistle
 It is not, generally, a great idea to bite the hand that feeds you -- especially if that hand belongs to a powerful company like Archer-Daniels-Midland. That company has fed Mark Whitacre very nicely, in fact: as head of the BioProducts division, he is a rising company star. But it's unclear whether that star will keep rising. For last week it turned out that Mr. Whitacre, working with the F.B.I., secretly taped executives' conversations as part of an inquiry into possible price-fixing. Though whistleblowers have popped up in all sorts of places to denounce corporate naughtiness, it's highly unusual for such a high executive to play that role.
 
TRADE
No Favors From China
 Yes, we can talk tough with China all we want -- on human rights, on Taiwan's status. But highmindedness, no matter how virtuous, might also have its costs, for China's sheer bulk gives it indisputable power. Last week, after saying that no decision was due for months, China snubbed Ford and Chrysler to give Mercedes a $1 billion contract to build mini-vans and engines in China, even though Mercedes has never actually built a true passenger mini-van -- you know, with all the cup-holders. Chinese officials denied that rising tensions with Washington had anything to do with the decision, but Detroit has to be wondering.
 
DIPLOMACY
The Next Step in Vietnam
 The building of a diplomatic bridge to Vietnam raised emotional issues -- some people saying the move was overdue, others insisting it wouldn't be time till all the missing were accounted for. But put those issues aside for a moment: a big step in healing the wounds will come when goods can flow freely between the nations. And despite last week's opening, that can't happen quite yet. Still needed are a trade agreement and preferred trading status, and even then American companies must struggle to catch up with Asia and Europe to do business in a country with 73 million people, more than France or Britain.
 
AUTOS
Japan Meets One Trade Goal
 Remember that hoopla-laden trade agreement with Japan last month, the one that made the world safe for Lexus owners? No numbers. No specific targets. Just words. But most people have probably forgotten that when George Bush went to Tokyo three years ago, Japan's auto industry set a target of buying $19 billion worth of American parts in the year that ended this past March, twice the previous level. And guess what: Japan did so, and more. Figures out last week showed $19.86 billion in purchases. There's a footnote, though: that figure is total purchases, not imports. Most parts were for Japanese plants here. Japan had set a goal of $4 billion in imported parts, but fell short with just $3.23 billion.
 
CONSOLIDATION
One Bank, Indivisible
 Something strange is going on. One advantage of a national Government -- politics, if possible, aside -- would seem to be the economies of scale it offers in running things. But everyone's been slamming the centralized bureaucracy as a failure. Banking, though, is heading full-blast in the opposite direction. Repeatedly citing "economies of scale," the nation's banks are tripping over themselves in a rush to merge into behemoths. A few weeks ago, First Union said it would buy First Fidelity of Newark. Then last week PNC agreed to buy Midlantic, and First Chicago and NBD agreed to merge into a Midwest powerhouse. The value of the deals: $5.4 billion, $3 billion and $5.3 billion. But there was no truth to rumors that Citibank was buying the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MANHATTAN UP CLOSE;
More Bookstore Casualties

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
After decades as a favorite haunt of book lovers on the Upper East Side, the Burlington Book Shop on Madison Avenue near 81st Street closed recently for the last time. Just last week, Endicott Booksellers, a fixture on Columbus Avenue near 81st Street for 14 years, announced its own going-out-of-business sale.
The two shops have something besides their demise in common. In the last few years, each got a new neighbor, a Barnes & Noble superstore. 
 When Barnes & Noble began opening their large stores with cafes and lounges five years ago, they revolutionized book retailing and, to a lesser degree, socializing in the city.
But some independent book shop owners insist the change is forcing out many smaller, traditional stores that have prided themselves on personal service and dedication to customers seeking not just best-sellers but rare or esoteric volumes.
Encarnita Quinlan opened Endicott Booksellers in 1981 and for the first 12 years, she says, "everything was going swimmingly." The store turned a profit right away. Then two years ago Barnes & Noble opened its superstore at Broadway and 82d. "Immediately sales dropped 20-25 percent," Ms. Quinlan said. "I thought it would stabilize, but it never did. It kept going down." Soon the store was in the red.
Ms. Quinlan feels Barnes & Noble "elbowed its way in."
"I suppose this is capitalism," she says, "but there is something unfair about it."
Burlington Books took a longer route to the same fate. In recent years it was owned by Jane Trichter, a former City Councilwoman, whose staff included Morris Bender, a bookseller for nearly half a century, and whose dog, Ingrid, was Burlington's mascot.
Then Barnes & Noble moved onto Lexington between 86th and 87th Streets. "Barnes and Noble was devastating," said Lenny Golay, a friend who is a co-owner of the Corner Bookstore at Madison and 93d Street, which took over Burlington's customer list. "It hurt her a lot. That plus the recession was like a double whammy," Ms. Trichter did not respond to requests for an interview.
Lisa Herling, a Barnes & Noble spokeswoman, declined to comment on Burlington and Endicott. "Our goal is to keep focused on the needs of customers, and they decide every day where they want to shop," she said.
Some still clearly prefer the small shops like Burlington, even though the number of such stores is dwindling. "Burlington was a very special store," said Ms. Golay. "Jane is a brilliant book person. She and her staff just know everything. She is an intellectual mentor to so many people." When customers were notified of the closing, she said, "a phenomenal number wrote back, a stack of letters almost a foot high."
Endicott has been filled with bargain hunters drawn by its 40-percent-off sale. "It's terrible," J.P. Baccarat, a software specialist, said of the closing. "Its layout is conducive to browsing. Its stock was always deep and broad, and the help is friendly and knowledgeable -- everything Barnes & Noble isn't." BRUCE LAMBERT

HEADLINE: Need an Extra Week Off? Visit the Company Store

BYLINE: By ROBERT BRYCE 

 BODY:
AS long as there's a market, it seems, everything is available for a price. In the United States, where the average worker is relatively well-paid but vacation-poor, time off has become a commodity to be bought and sold.
Since the late 1980's, an increasing number of companies -- Du Pont, Quaker Oats, Coca-Cola and American Express among them -- have begun including extra vacation time in their flexible benefits programs. Hewitt Associates, the employee benefit consulting firm, estimated last September that about 15 percent of American companies let employees buy or sell time, though usually no more than five days a year. 
 "It's a growing trend, an outgrowth of employers' wanting to create a flexible work environment," said Ken McDonnell, a research analyst at the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington.
One regular customer at the Du Pont "leave bank" is Maria Kelly, a 38-year-old benefits counselor for the company. Last year, Ms. Kelly, who calls herself a "vacation junkie," went to Venezuela and Australia. In 1993, she toured Israel and France.
Ms. Kelly has worked at the company for 14 years and gets four weeks of vacation a year. Without the leave bank, she said, "It would take me 20 years of service to get to that five-week vacation allowance." Instead, she pays $57 a month, or $684 a year, for the extra week.
Ms. Kelly, who is planning a Sept. 30 wedding, has enough vacation remaining to take a few days off before the wedding and still have time for a honeymoon on the island of St. Lucia. "Having that time off is worth so much that I don't even think about the cost factor," she said.
In flexible benefit programs, employees can choose among cafeteria-style options for benefits like life insurance and health insurance. To use a leave bank, employees typically forgo a percentage of their salaries to gain the extra time, or convert some of their unused time into cash at the end of a year.
Linda Bell, an economics professor at Haverford College who has studied labor practices in the United States and Germany, applauded the move toward more flexible vacation time. Still, she said, the policies are in the American tradition of discouraging leisure time because they put "the onus of the vacation time on the worker."
Indeed, a 1993 study by William M. Mercer Inc., a human resources consulting firm based in New York, found that Americans work more days in a year than their counterparts in Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Sweden and Mexico. The average worker in the United States gets about 30 days off for vacation and holidays every year, compared with 46 in Germany, 33 in Canada and 36 in Mexico.
Given those figures, Ms. Bell said it was not surprising that the majority of workers who participate in leave bank programs are buying, rather than selling, vacation time.
Quaker Oats added vacation options to its flexible benefits program in 1993. About 6,500 of the company's 10,000 United States employees can now buy or sell time. Melanie Pheatt, a benefits manager for Quaker Oats, says buyers predominate.
"We have around 35 percent of people who buy and about 9 percent who sell," said Ms. Pheatt, who usually buys an extra week of vacation herself each year.
Mr. McDonnell of the Employee Benefit Research Institute predicted that the practice would become more common as the population aged and more workers took time off to care for ailing parents. He added that large companies were more likely to offer leave banks than small ones because of the administrative costs involved.
Eileen Canty, an organizational psychologist and principal at Mercer, said vacation flexibility could be used by companies with excess workers. "It's a nice alternative to reducing head count," she said.
While leave banks are gaining popularity, Ms. Canty does not see them becoming common in upper management or in firms like hers, which depend on workers' ability to generate billable hours.
"In a consulting firm," she said, "nobody is interested in letting an employee take more time off."

HEADLINE: How Can You Describe Meager Defense Spending as Lavish?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Pentagon Jackpot" (editorial, July 10) serves as an example of what happens when misinformed journalists attempt to analyze a military budget without understanding the budget process or the nation's security needs. 
 In the future, you may want to proceed with care when offering advice on how to defend more than 250 million Americans.
The characterization of defense spending as "lavish" ignores the overwhelming preponderance of evidence to the contrary.
The Clinton Administration's continuing reductions in defense spending -- reductions that do not reflect priorities outlined by the military -- have deprived units of essential training and operating resources while dramatically reducing the investment available for force modernization.
In fact, measured as a percentage of gross domestic product, defense spending has fallen to the lowest level since 1941. This year a bipartisan coalition of House and Senate members responded by establishing a defense budget level designed to reverse troubling signs of deteriorating readiness.
The view that "threats to the United States are diminishing" as a result of the disintegration of the Soviet empire demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of basic current events. While we may have succeeded in reducing the threat of nuclear annihilation, the collapse of the Soviet Union has unleashed a host of potentially destructive forces, engendering a new era of global insecurity.
Conflict still threatens many of the regions important to United States interests, and we must continue to stand ready to defend those interests.
The term "extravagant" to describe efforts to maintain our capacity to fight two major regional conflicts simultaneously makes little sense. Should the United States rely on good fortune to deter foreign tyrants from pursuing their expansionist agendas at the same moment?
Would not a restricted, one-region capability leave the United States vulnerable during multiple conflicts scattered around the globe?
Finally, I am certain that many of your readers were as perplexed as I was by your use of the term "social services" -- a phrase normally employed referring to organized welfare efforts -- to describe the basic housing earned by our men and women in uniform. Your suggestion that such support constitutes some sort of charitable government giveaway reveals a contemptible lack of appreciation for the work of America's fighting men and women.
Your editorial proves the futility of trying to formulate American defense policy from the cozy confines of a Manhattan skyscraper. Perhaps you should learn something beyond an intense dislike for military institutions before attempting to find a place in the legitimate debate over the needs of America's armed forces.

HEADLINE: New York City's Recovering Fiscal Health

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Bond Rating Can't Be Ignored" (Op-Ed, July 12): Ester R. Fuchs, former Mayor David N. Dinkins's campaign adviser, is wrong to assert that Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade New York City's bond rating has significant monetary implications. The market has taken into account a BBB+ rating for city bonds since 1991, when Moody's downgraded the city in the prior administration. 
 Every measure of the city's fiscal health has improved since I came into office, despite inheriting a collapsing private-sector economy, a bloated city bureaucracy and a multibillion-dollar budget deficit with massive projected gaps.
We reduced government spending and the city work force by almost 17,000 employees. We redeployed workers to safeguard vital services and negotiated landmark productivity agreements. We vastly decreased the projected gaps. Our pro-jobs, pro-business policies helped produce the city's first substantial private-sector job growth since 1987.
The city today by all accounts is more creditworthy than it was in 1993. There are indications that the city's bonds have been trading up in the secondary market.
Ms. Fuchs claims that "Standard & Poor's bases its judgments on a specific and well-known set of municipal finance criteria." Last Wednesday, based on the same criteria, Fitch Investors Service -- one of the three major rating agencies -- affirmed the city's bond rating at A-, stating that our budget "reflects significant progress toward achieving ongoing balance."
In just 18 months we have turned New York City's economy around. I am proud of that achievement. S. & P.'s decision is the action of someone looking backward, not forward. It will not impede our progress toward fiscal stability and economic growth.

HEADLINE: U.S. Opening to Vietnam Sends China a Message

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Lost in the controversy surrounding normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam has been one overriding geopolitical accomplishment. 
 With ties between the United States and China at their lowest point since official diplomatic relations were established in 1979, President Clinton's decision to normalize relations with Vietnam couldn't have come at a better time.
Recently, Chinese officials decided to play diplomatic hardball with the United States, as China's actions in light of the visit of President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan and in the matter of the Chinese-American dissident Harry Wu have signified.
However, President Clinton's decision to normalize ties with Vietnam sent a clear message to the Chinese. By establishing relations, the United States now adds Vietnam to the list of Asian countries in which its presence will expand and solidify.
It is no coincidence that the Chinese request to return to the status quo with the United States (news article, July 13) came only after relations between Vietnam and the United States were announced.
If the Chinese forgot who they were dealing with, President Clinton reminded them. Intentional or not, his move was a power play that deserves credit.

HEADLINE: Can Industry Do the Job In Health Care? No Way

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The Princeton economist Uwe E. Reinhardt, in the July 9 Soapbox essay "When Trenton Plays Obstetrician," bemoans the Legislature's passage of the bill requiring two-day maternity hospitalizations. We will never know how well the health insurance industry can do the job, he complains, if new laws "countermand the industry's guidelines." He's dead wrong. We already know. 
 Health insurance companies are raking in billions in profits at the same time that employers' costs are less. We don't have to be rocket scientists to figure that the quality and quantity of patient care is being mightily squeezed. On the same day, your paper carried a front-page article about H.M.O.'s denying emergency room claims -- just one of many reports of poor service from managed-care corporations.
Professor Reinhardt admits that "some government regulation and supervision of health care is necessary." Why not the kind that all other advanced nations have: the kind that forbids or limits private profiteering on health care?

U.S. Watches Out for Its Own. Well, Sometimes.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHAT does Harry Wu have in common with Milton Meier?
 Both are American citizens and both are behind bars in foreign countries because, among other things, they are accused of being spies. 
 But there the similarity ends. The differences between them underscore the arbitrariness with which the United States Government, the Congress, human rights groups and news organizations focus attention on Americans who get in trouble overseas.
 Mr. Wu is a world-famous human rights advocate who is under arrest in China on charges that he entered the country under aliases, traveled to places not open to foreigners, spied, bought secrets, stole secret documents, carried them abroad and provided them to outside organizations.
 But Mr. Wu has the full weight of the Clinton Administration and the Congress behind him. His wife, Ching Lee Wu, was welcomed at the White House and on Capitol Hill last week in her campaign to win her husband's freedom; both houses of Congress have passed resolutions condemning the Chinese in the case, and the Administration has warned that continued detention will keep the United States and China from having good relations.
 The seriousness of the matter was captured at a recent State Department briefing when the spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said: "We're not playing games. We are not politicizing the relationship. On the issue of Harry Wu, we're seeking justice for an American citizen."
 Milton Meier does not enjoy the same high-level attention.
 A little-known travel agent and businessman, he lived quietly in Iran throughout the revolution and seizure of the American Embassy, citing his love of Iran. But he was arrested in September 1992, and in April 1994 he was sentenced secretly to 24 months in prison and a $285,000 fine after confessing, the Iranians say, to corruption and charges of espionage.
 His wife is an Iranian citizen who still lives in Iran and was a sister-in-law of the head of the Shah's secret police, who was executed in the early days of the revolution. So it is not surprising that she hasn't spoken out publicly about her husband's plight. The State Department says it knows little about why Mr. Meier is in prison, except to insist that he is not guilty of spying and to speculate that he got in trouble for business deals gone bad. News organizations have only fleetingly paid attention to him.
 Officials and residents of Milpitas, Calif., where Mr. Wu lives, have tied yellow ribbons throughout the town; no one at the State Department seems to know where Mr. Meier comes from.
 It is not that the United States Government is convinced that Mr. Wu is innocent and that Mr. Meier is guilty of something.
 Mr. Wu, who spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps and is now determined to uncover and publicize their evils, has long said that during previous trips he penetrated more than two dozen Chinese labor camps under false pretenses. In most any country, that might be grounds for arrest, at least for trespassing.
 "A question is what criteria should Americans use in evaluating a foreign legal system," said Stanley B. Lubman, a San Francisco lawyer and specialist in Chinese law. "On the one hand, we shouldn't judge another country's practice by our ideals. On the other hand, total relativism is unsatisfying and leaves us without the capacity to form judgments. The Chinese criminal code is badly drafted, because its definitions of crimes are vague and ambiguous. But some of the conduct that he is alleged to have engaged in could be defined as punishable under the laws of many Western countries."
 As for Mr. Meier, the official Iranian media has said he was charged with links to "foreign intelligence officials" and had confessed to operating illegal trading firms, collecting economic information and receiving bribes from foreign companies for information.
 The Swiss, who represent American interests in Iran in the absence of diplomatic relations, have tried unsuccessfully to obtain a written verdict or a status report on Mr. Meier's appeal.
 Mr. Meier's plight is not unique.
 Through bad judgment or circumstances beyond their control or a combination of both, William Barloon and David Daliberti find themselves in a small cell in Baghdad. The two Americans were arrested after wandering over the border from Kuwait into Iraq last March, and have been sentenced to eight years in prison.
 The Iraqis accused them of illegally entering the country; the two men, employees of American military contractors in Kuwait, insist that they strayed into Iraqi territory by mistake.
 A pilgrimage to Baghdad by their wives was reported only briefly by news organizations. The Poles, who represent American interests in Baghdad, have been rebuffed since early April in efforts to visit the two men.
 Unlike Mrs. Wu, Mr. Barloon's wife, Linda, expresses frustration with the United States Government, which she says has left her out in the cold. "I feel like this black curtain is drawn all the time," she said in May during a trip to Baghdad to visit her husband. "I get no information."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: The New Bipartisanship;
Resolved: No More Bleeding Hearts

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ALMOST every week in Washington these days, liberal advocacy groups like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities publish analyses of Republican budget cuts that show they fall disproportionately upon the poor.
 Almost every day, some lonely liberal stands in the House or Senate, or takes the microphone in a congressional committee, and warns that the restructuring of poverty programs dating back 30 or 60 years will lead, inexorably, to the suffering of children. 
 But by and large, these voices are lost in the din. As Congress reviews the basic anti-poverty programs this summer, the argument that government has an obligation to the poor -- and the old notion that Federal resources, wisely used, can transform their lives -- sounds increasingly archaic.

 
 
Compassion Redefined
 Instead, Republicans on Capitol Hill -- and many Democrats, too -- are marching toward a tough new vision of social welfare in which the poor have an obligation to society. Personal responsibility is the catchword, embodied in an array of proposals to discourage behavior like out-of-wedlock births and to cure dependency by limiting help. Compassion has been redefined to mean liberation from the welfare system.
 At times it seems a politician has nothing to lose by patronizing or even insulting those who receive Government aid. The Republicans' welfare overhaul is stalled in the Senate at the moment in large part because conservatives think it does not go far enough.
There probably never was a time when poor people were a truly powerful constituency on Capitol Hill. But there were times, notably in the 1930's and 1960's, when they had powerful champions. And rarely have the programs that served them -- programs that for decades seemed part of the architecture of the American system, like food stamps and Medicaid and Aid to Families With Dependent Children -- seemed less sacred than they do now.
 The reigning ethos is what Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan calls "the great rhetorical inversion" of the Republican Party: that the current welfare system is such a failure, so faulty and so perverse in the behavior it encourages and discourages, that almost anything would be better. To cut or restructure it, by this line of reasoning, helps rather than hurts poor people. The Republicans argue, in short, that they are not blaming the victim; they are blaming the system.
 "Year after year, generation after generation, we have enslaved these people," Representative William F. Goodling, Republican of Pennsylvania, declared on the floor of the House earlier this year. "Unless we make a change, they will never have an opportunity to get part of that American dream."
 In his book "To Renew America," Speaker Newt Gingrich rails against "a welfare state" that "breaks up families, minimizes work incentives, blocks people from saving and acquiring property, and overshadows dreams of a promised future with a present despair born of poverty, violence and hopelessness." In contrast to the heavy hand of government, Mr. Gingrich writes approvingly of an earlier model of charity.
 Some Democrats scoff at the Gingrichian inversion even as they recognize its power. "Poverty isn't the problem, A.F.D.C. is the problem," said Andrew Cuomo, assistant secretary for community planning and development at Housing and Urban Development (an agency that many Republicans want to abolish). "It's not starvation, it's food stamps. It's not homelessness, it's public housing. That's how they define the problem."
 But not many politicians want to defend the current system, mired as it is in chronic dependency and the breakdown of the family. This is the genius of the Gingrich approach to welfare: a choice between liberating change with the Republicans and suffering with the status quo under the Democrats.

 
 
The Murray Principle
 These ideas began bubbling a decade ago; the conservative Charles Murray, in his book "Losing Ground," argued that welfare and other anti-poverty programs caused more problems than they solved. Many liberals also began to rethink the welfare system, and by 1992 it was the Democratic Presidential candidate who promised to "end welfare as we know it."
 Still, the argument that anything is better than the current system meets some important tactical needs for the Republican Party. Throughout its heyday in the 1980's, the party still had to worry about appearing hard-hearted. As President, George Bush promised "kinder, gentler" policies.
 But the current debate reflects more than tactical considerations. To begin with, Congressional power follows people, and more and more of them are in the suburbs; the urban underclass, which is less likely to vote anyway, can seem distant and alien to those constituents -- and the representatives they send to Congress.
 "Often the only contact now is a very negative one," said the Rev. Joseph R. Hacala, executive director of the Campaign for Human Development, the anti-poverty program of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. "It's getting off the subway and geting hounded by a homeless person who doesn't have an outlet for food or shelter."
 This sense of "otherness" was evident in the House debate over the Republican welfare bill earlier this year. Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, held up a sign that said, "Do Not Feed the Alligators" and noted, "We post these warnings because unnatural feeding and artificial care creates dependency." Representative Barbara Cubin, Republican of Wyoming, rose to draw a similar parallel with wolves.
 Some Democrats, including Representative John Lewis of Atlanta, suggest that race indeed matters. "It's us and it's them," Mr. Lewis said. "It's 'the black poor, the Hispanics.' "
 This is all the more true when much of the middle class feels under siege. Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, said: "One of the angriest focus groups I ever did was in Bangor, Maine, among working women. They said, 'Let me get this right. Every day I have to pay for child care, but people on welfare should get it for free?' "
 This is a hard time to make the argument that many policymakers say ought to be made: that true "welfare reform" probably means spending money on child care and job training to allow the transition to work, and that curtailing Medicaid may only mean that poor people's health costs get shifted elsewhere in the system.

 
 
No Organized Opposition
 But that argument often goes unmade or unheard. "What shocks and surprises me is that while this revolution is taking place and taking prisoners there doesn't seem to be any organized opposition -- certainly not in the Democratic Party," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York.
 Privately, and sometimes publicly, many liberals mourn that their own party has failed to defend the Federal safety net, particularly the guarantee of assistance to every eligible poor family, known as an entitlement.
 In fact, since the Democratic Party's devastating defeat in 1984, many party strategists have been consumed with regaining the allegiance of the middle class. Mr. Clinton was in many ways the apotheosis of that school of thought: He ran on a promise to redeem the "forgotten middle class" in addition to putting welfare recipients to work.
 His ideas on welfare were, to be sure, very different from the Republicans'. But some Democrats say he has been far too reluctant to challenge their proposals, particularly the plan to eliminate the Federal entitlement to assistance. Many other Democratic politicians are spending their political capital in the fight against Republican plans to curtail Medicare and other programs with large middle-class constituencies.
 Meanwhile, the Republican welfare bill, with its automatic time limit on benefits and its five-year freeze on funds, is still a top priority for Republican leaders. It is stalled in the Senate largely because of the way the money is divided (a squabble that pits the states against one another) and because conservatives feel the bill does not go far enough to discourage out-of-wedlock births.
 Marvin Olasky, the author of "The Tragedy of American Compassion," who envisions a shift from Government welfare to a system that draws more from community and religious organizations, says he has no qualms about the transition. "I've seen enough of the present suffering," Mr. Olasky, who has become one of the Speaker's favorite authors, said in an interview. "Whenever somebody says, 'If you do this, there will be suffering,' my tendency is to say, 'Compared to what?' I see suffering out there now, and it's terrible."
 Mr. Moynihan has taken to warning that those who think nothing could be worse than the current system need only wait.

Today's Drama: Twilight of the Nukes

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
FIFTY years ago today, physicists detonated a nuclear explosive they called The Gadget, rigged on a 100-foot steel tower in the desert near Alamogordo, N.M. Since that first nuclear test, the United States has built 70,000 nuclear weapons of almost every conceivable kind: warheads, artillery shells, land mines, depth charges and even backpack-style plutonium explosives weighing 58 pounds but equivalent to 10 tons of TNT. And then there were plain old bombs, those bulbous things with tailfins, designed to be dropped out of airplanes.
 But now it is the twilight of the nukes. They are being taken apart by the United States and the Soviet Union at the rate of 10 or 12 a day, and the new problem is how to keep track them of all. 
 Keeping tabs on nuclear weapons used to be easier: they were all sitting in the field and aimed at the enemy. Now there is no enemy and no clear role for the weapons, for either side.
 When the Trinity test was done, on July 16, 1945, the new physics seemed to be in perfect alignment with the United States' military strategy and with its economy; it looked as if nuclear weapons could save both dollars and human lives.
 Now there is a consensus that all the weapons that the United States pointed at its adversaries over the years -- about 30,000 during the peak year, 1967 -- did not make the nation any safer than the 8,750 operable weapons the Pentagon has today. Indeed, the thinking now is that the United States might be just as safe or safer with only 5,000 weapons at the turn of the century, and maybe with even fewer later.

 
 
$4 Trillion
 The economic considerations have changed too. Nuclear weapons no longer look like the deal they once did. By one estimate last week, the United States has spent nearly $4 trillion (in 1995 dollars) in nuclear weapons since 1945, an amount equal to one-quarter to one-third of all the money spent on defense since World War II. Included in the cost is a $385 billion cleanup bill, most of it not yet spent. And whatever the theories were about nuclear bombs cutting down the casualties that would have resulted from an American invasion of the Japanese home islands during World War II and later preempting World War III, now the feeling is that a big arsenal is not going to save anyone.
 The physics exercise in progress now is proving difficult: taking back weapons from the field, taking them apart and making the nuclear fuel less weapons-ready. Then there is the question of just how far all of this should go.
 Pulling back the weapons is proceeding apace. Five years ago the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons in 15 republics, in East Germany and in other parts of Eastern Europe, according to Robert S. Norris, a weapons expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Now they have been removed from all the republics, except for Ukraine and Belarus, and from the rest of Eastern Europe. "This is a logistical feat of enormous proportions," said Mr. Norris, "and they should be given great credit for doing it."

 
 
Pile-Up at Pantex
 For the United States, dismantling has proved more complex. Nuclear weapons have been taken off frigates, destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers and ships all over the world; now they remain only on ballistic missile submarines, said Mr. Norris. And the artillery shells and short-range missiles have been recalled from Europe.
 Now the weapons parts are piling up at the Pantex weapons plant, near Amarillo, Texas, which used to be the final assembly point. And so, another problem brews. What will become of the components?
 For a nuclear power, a mass of fuel sufficient for a bomb is just a few steps away from becoming a bomb again. And for nuclear wannabes -- Pakistan, Iraq or smaller figures on the world stage -- the situation is much the same. There is no longer any secret about how to build an atom bomb; the main challenge is obtaining the plutonium or uranium. Last year, radioactive material that was apparently of Russian origin turned up repeatedly in Germany, embarrassing Moscow and raising fears that stolen uranium or plutonium would be used to build new bombs.
 In the hands of a physicist, neither plutonium nor uranium is immortal. The enriched uranium can be diluted, to a level suitable for nuclear reactors but not bombs; that is what the United States plans to do with the uranium that it is purchasing from the Russians. But the Energy Department has not decided yet what to do with its own surplus uranium, now piling up at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, or with the plutonium building up at Pantex.
 Plutonium is the harder problem. There are three leading options, none risk-free or cheap: The first is to bury the plutonium at the bottom of a deep well. Another is to mix the plutonium with molten glass, and possibly with highly radioactive waste as well, so that re-using the material would require complicated chemical reprocessing. A third option is putting the plutonium in power reactors, and fissioning it to make electricity. For now, though, the plutonium sits in bunkers at Pantex. At the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, in Takoma Park, Md., the president, Arjun Makhijani, a nuclear physicist and engineer, said, "The Department of Energy is extending its definition of interim to longer and longer periods. "Before, 'interim' at Pantex was six to 10 years," he said. "Now they're talking about building 50-year storage facilities."
 The issue at Pantex is not so much security as appearances. The Government could keep the plutonium secure in the bunkers, said Mr. Makhijani, but there are other problems. "I don't think we can afford to just park it," he said. "Parking it sends the message we could just build up to 20,000 weapons again."
 The Energy Secretary, Hazel R. O'Leary, said this will not happen. "We're on a course to come to some real conclusions by next summer," she said in an interview. The trouble is that this large, expensive project must be taken on during what Mrs. O'Leary termed a "tumultuous season of dismantlement, downsizing, decapitation of the department," In such a climate, she asks, "Is the public likely to want to pay the price?"

 
 
Russian Know-How
 The Russians are now ahead of the United States in deciding what to do with their nuclear material. They are determined to use their plutonium in a new generation of nuclear reactors that would make yet more plutonium. The plan is to convert the bomb fuel, now pure metal, into plutonium oxide, and mix it with regular reactor fuel, uranium oxide, into a mixed oxide fuel known as MOx.
 Unless or until that happens, though, someone has to safeguard the nuclear materials in Russia. There, as here, in a strange reversal of goals, weaponeers are now trying to revise systems that were designed for secrecy into systems that are designed to be transparent, to track the whereabouts of radioactive materials.
 After a slow start, the two countries are learning techniques from each other and are working together to fence in some of the vulnerable materials. Last year, at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, for example, the Russians built a new fence around Building 116, which houses two test reactors and 75 kilos of fissile material. The fence, built with American technology, has microwave sensors and alarms and cameras. At the opening is a nuclear materials detector. At Obninsk, a laboratory that stores nuclear materials in hundreds of stainless steel disks, Americans have helped the Russians install a computerized inventory system and portal monitors, which, like airport metal detectors, sound an alarm when something suspect passes through.
 In return for their help, the Americans have come home with some ideas from the Russians. One is a "passport" for containers of nuclear materials. The radiation output of a container is scanned to establish its radiation profile, which, like a fingerprint, is unique to that container. Then the container is marked with a bar code that links it to its profile. If the profile changes, a computer reading the bar code knows that the contents have been tampered with.
 The Russians have also tested a piece of software called a "frame grabber," which analyzes video pictures for suspicious-looking characters. With a camera trained on, say, a corridor in a warehouse of nuclear materials, the Russian software discriminates between innocent passersby and thieves.
 The Russians may also have a superior hand geometry reader, according to American experts. While American workers often use passwords or identification cards to gain entry to high-security locations, Russian workers stick a hand in a reader that confirms their identity.

 
 
Sharing and Caring and Secrets
 For all the sharing between Russia and the United States, though, there are still plenty of crucial secrets. The United States Navy believes it has the best fuel for propulsion reactors and it does not want the Russians to see it; hence Russians have not shown the Americans their nuclear fuel. And the Atomic Energy Act, a cold war era law, forbids the United States from disclosing the exact mass and geometry of the plutonium in its weapons. In return the Russians have kept that data about their weapons to themselves.
 But when it comes to security of those secret materials, Russia and the United States have a lot in common to worry about. "I think that the Russians recognize that the security of weapons-capable materials is a serious problem and they're addressing it," said Charles Curtis, the Under Secretary of Energy. "It's going to take a lot of time and resources to address. In the interim," he added, "we're going to have to be lucky."

HEADLINE: A Business Deal Makes a Point for China

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 15

 BODY:
At first glance, China's selection of Mercedes-Benz over the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company to be a partner in a $1 billion mini-van plant looks like a clear sign that American businesses will pay a steep price for the political bickering between Washington and Beijing.
But the mini-van deal, announced on Wednesday, is probably a better sign of something else: China's ability to make a decision for business reasons and, by carefully timing its announcement, have it look politically motivated. 
 Neither Chrysler nor Ford pursued the mini-van project with any enthusiasm in recent months, executives familiar with the deal said. But by announcing that American companies were passed over in a high-profile competition, China is highlighting the potential consequences of diplomatic trouble without actually losing a beneficial deal.
For all the concern that Beijing is looking for ways to punish American businesses, executives at more than a dozen companies here said they expected the tensions to have little effect on their businesses, especially those involving large investments.
"At this point, we don't see any real reason for concern," said James J. Paulsen, Ford's chief representative in China. "I think, based on the rocky relations we've seen between the U.S. and China in the past, that decisions are still based on economic reasons."
Among the large deals for which American companies are competing this year, two are in Shanghai: a $1 billion venture to build passenger cars, where General Motors is considered a front-runner over Ford and Toyota, and two subway projects worth a total of $500 million, a toss-up between a German group and an American consortium that includes General Railway Signal of Rochester and Cubic Automated Revenue Collection of San Diego.
In each case, executives said, commercial factors are likely to outweigh the nationality of a partner.
Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce, said in a telephone interview from Paris that his department was carefully tracking a dozen pending projects worth more than $100 million that involve American companies bidding against foreign competitors in the power, transportation and telecommunications fields. "We have no indication that any have been affected" by the disputes, Mr. Garten said.
Besides, Chinese organizations do not want to lose the money and technology that American partners bring, and would likely object if Beijing made any kind of unilaterally anti-American business decisions.
"They don't just send out central directives saying, 'Don't do business with Americans,' " said Anne Stevenson-Yang, director of the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing. "People seem to think there are five guys sitting around making all the decisions. That's not the way it works."
To be sure, politics does intrude on foreign business operations in China. Several executives said their meetings with Chinese officials on ordinary issues like operating regulations and taxes had become more stern in recent weeks, sometimes interrupted with questions about why the United States Government was interfering in China's affairs.
In politically sensitive areas like publishing and information services, executives said, it is not a good time to approach the Chinese. Business-related exchanges have been canceled, including a visit by Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to talk to Chinese officials about the advantages of regulation.
"When tensions are high," said Jim Bercaw, executive vice president of AT&T China, "no one in the Chinese Government wants to be accused of making a decision" that looks pro-American.
Unless, that is, the decision is made at the top. Senior Chinese leaders, in times of strained relations with the United States, sometimes like to reward American companies they regard as particularly friendly -- in the hope that the companies will reciprocate by putting pressure on Washington to ease its stance.
Last week, senior leaders told the American International Group that it would be allowed to start selling both life and general insurance in the big southern center of Guangzhou, making it the first foreign insurer allowed to operate outside Shanghai, where A.I.G. has been selling insurance since 1992. The timing of the permission surprised even A.I.G., said Michael I. D. Morrison, the company's general manager here.
Maurice R. Greenberg, the big insurer's chief executive, has been working on his relationships with Chinese leaders for more than 20 years. During a visit to Beijing last week with another "old friend" of China, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Greenberg was named special economic adviser to the Beijing municipal government, a position created for him.
Germany, known for granting generous low-interest loans to finance projects in China involving German companies, appeared to reap a pile of benefits during President Jiang Zemin's visit to Bonn. More than $3 billion of contracts and letters of intent were announced.
In addition to the mini-van deal, Mercedes, a unit of Daimler-Benz A.G., was chosen as a partner in a $50 million venture to make tour buses and bus chassis in Yangzhou, President Jiang's hometown in Jiangsu Province.
Yet among the dozens of other projects announced, reporters noticed, many were the same ones disclosed last year when Prime Minister Li Peng visited Germany.
For Mercedes-Benz, auto executives noted, being selected as a partner for a Chinese venture is still some distance from actually signing a contract, to be negotiated only after a feasibility study is completed, which may take more than a year.
The mini-van project invited attention last year when it seemed to turn into a hot race between Chrysler, the mini-van leader in the United States, and Mercedes-Benz, a company with high name recognition in China but one that has never before made a mini-van.
Late last year, however, Chrysler executives became frustrated by their negotiations, including what they saw as China's unwillingness to protect Chrysler technology from being illegally copied. Chrysler is particularly sensitive to the issue, in part because the Jeep Cherokees it makes with a Chinese partner in Beijing have been imitated by pirate factories.
One auto executive who is not with Chrysler, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Chrysler was driven away by the "botched negotiating" of the Chinese at the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry.
Executives at Ford, once considered a leading contender for the Shanghai sedan-making venture, said they were surprised early this year when they were asked to submit a bid for the mini-van venture.
Although Mercedes-Benz was clearly the favorite, Ford executives duly prepared and submitted a proposal. Since they did not really expect to win the deal, Ford executives have stressed their determination to make cars in China in the future.
"We do not expect it to be easy, because the logistics and bureaucracy are so complex," a Ford executive said of working in China. "But over the long term, we feel we have to be assembling vehicles here."
Not that doing business in China has ever been easy or predictable.
"We knew this wasn't going to be a smooth ride when we got on the bus," Mr. Bercaw of AT&T said.

HEADLINE: Japan Proposes More Talks in Air Dispute

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 15

 BODY:
Japanese trade negotiators proposed today that high-ranking transportation officials from the United States and Japan meet next week to try to end a dispute over air cargo flights. Lower-level talks broke off here this morning.
"The talks can't go any further at this level," Masahide Ochi, senior general counsel of Japan's Transport Ministry, said at a news conference after the talks ended. "There is still a wide gap between both sides." 
 American negotiators left for Washington immediately after the talks to discuss the Japanese proposal. The head of the American team, Daniel Tarullo, Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs at the State Department, declined to comment on the American response to the Japanese proposal or on details of the talks.
The dispute focuses on the Japanese Government's refusal to grant permission to the Federal Express Corporation for seven new routes through Japan unless Washington agrees to renegotiate a 43-year-old aviation treaty.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth Leaves States In Best Shape Since Early 80's

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
An economy that has been growing for more than four years is finally shining on state governments, easing the way for nine of them to make significant cuts in taxes and allowing many to increase spending on popular programs like education and prisons, according to a survey published today.
For the first time in a decade, the National Conference of State Legislatures reports that states, on average, have reduced taxes by more than they raised them. The survey did not examine whether some of these reductions simply represented shifts of programs to county and local governments. 
 The report, a preliminary look at state finances for the 1995 fiscal year, which ended in June, and for the current year, was released on the eve of the organization's annual meeting, an event that draws 3,000 state legislators and other state officials.
It called the states' finances "the best they have been since the early 1980's." In general, the states' tax revenues in the 1995 fiscal year grew twice as much as state budget planners had predicted.
But much as the report encouraged officials, it also brought warnings that the best was probably over. With the economy slowing and Congress planning to cut aid to the states and shift responsibility for some Federal programs to them, tax collections are likely to slow and spending to rise, making new surpluses harder to build.
As the delegates gathered in Milwaukee today for the opening session, it was the specter of Federal cuts that most dampened enthusiasm over the states' improved revenues.
"We are not sure what the actions of Congress will be," said Jane Campbell, the assistant minority leader in the Ohio House. "The discussions about block grants are not so much about giving the states power as they are about reducing Federal expenditures."
Fearing that Congress will be tempted to balance the Federal budget on the backs of the states, Ohio is using its surplus as a "state savings account, a rainy-day fund" equal to 5 percent of the state's total tax revenues, Ms. Campbell said.
Indeed, expectations of rough times ahead are widespread.
"I think this is the high-water mark," said Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York in Albany. "Budgeting was easy for the states this year. The only decision was whether to cut taxes, and if so, how much. Now they're worried about the changes coming out of Washington. They recognize that they might hit a brick wall."
What is more, in some states, tax cuts were fueled not by robust economies but by the political agendas of their Republican governors. In New York and New Jersey, for example, Governors George E. Pataki and Christine Todd Whitman have each made deep income tax cuts despite facing serious budget problems.
In both cases, Democrats have criticized those cuts as political sleight of hand that will simply shift responsibilities for government programs from the states to county and local governments -- pretty much the same kind of cost shifting that states now fear as a result of Federal budget cuts.
The organization's report is an incomplete picture of state finances because it was prepared before 16 states could supply material in time for the meeting. Among the 16 is California, the nation's most populous state and, by some measures, the state with the weakest economy.
For the past year, California's unemployment has hovered around 8 percent, the highest of any state, surpassing even West Virginia, which has the nation's most chronic unemployment. But despite the burden of helping the unemployed, California's economy, too, is brightening.
Kevin Eckery, a spokesman for the California Finance Department, said that tax receipts for the year ended in June had exceeded projections, even surpassing the peak three years earlier. Gov. Pete Wilson, who is seeking the Republican Presidential nomination, has proposed a 15 percent cut in business and personal taxes in the 1996 budget, which has yet to be enacted.
For the states, a balanced budget -- that is, tax revenues that match or exceed spending -- is more of a necessity than a political promise. Because of legal and political constraints, states do not have the luxury enjoyed by Congress and the White House of routinely running deficits and issuing debt to cover the deficiencies.
While states often borrow to build roads, hospitals or government buildings, they must generally keep their spending in line with their income.
Thus in October, when the next Federal budget is enacted and some Federal programs are turned over to the states, governors and legislators will face some difficult decisions over taxes and spending.
Even the larger of the states' budget surpluses are "far from spectacular," the report warned -- almost the automatic reward of a growing economy. The report said that the current surpluses "represent a return to what might be considered normal or prudent levels" after a long period of dangerously low reserves beginning in 1989.
William T. Pound, executive director of the conference, predicted that in view of the prospects for the next Federal budget, cuts in state taxes had about run their course. "Many legislators feel their revenue will not be sustained," he said.
Some improvement in state finances had generally been expected. As the economy grows, more people go to work and pay taxes, and businesses collect higher profits, which are also taxed. But tax revenues rose 6.4 percent in 1995, about twice what had been expected.
An increase in jobs and new eligibility controls for welfare programs in 1995 also meant that the states were required to shell out less than they had expected for their share of the principal Federal-state welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Connecticut, Iowa and Michigan reported the largest savings -- 10 percent or more.
But in coming months continued reductions of that magnitude could be difficult. The Federal Government has been spending a little more on welfare this year than last, and it is likely to require that the states assume more of the cost.
Of the 34 states that provided budget reports, 24 reported a strong enough growth in tax revenues to allow spending increases. Two others stuck with their original spending goals, and eight spent less than they had planned.
Of 44 states that reported tax changes last year, those enacting the largest cuts were Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington, Arizona, Utah, Montana and Delaware. In sum, these 44 states cut taxes by $700 million more than they raised them -- "the first net state tax reduction since 1985," the report said.
New York would move into first place on that list, the report said, if all the tax cuts enacted in the last two years are realized.
In most cases states cut personal income taxes, but some also made sharp reductions in business taxes. Sales taxes were cut only slightly. Vermont extended a 5 percent sales tax that it had planned to cut, and South Dakota extended coverage of its sales tax to more businesses. Several other states found another way to raise revenues with new or extended taxes on hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
In general, states reported plans to slow spending growth in areas like environmental protection, economic development and aid to local governments. They were also planning for faster growth for welfare, all levels of education, prisons and Medicaid, the health program for the poor.
Utah, with a fast-growing youth population, plans a 14.2 percent increase in spending for students through the 12th grade, the nation's largest increase in education, and Nevada, also young and growing, plans the largest increase for colleges -- 11 percent.
But spending to operate prisons that states have been building to relieve overcrowding, the report said, is "by far the fastest area of state appropriations." On average, states have budgeted an increase of 13.3 percent, and that does not include construction costs.
Florida leads the nation with a 50 percent increase, or $500 million more than last year's level. The state will spend another $97 million for new prisons.

HEADLINE: Bolivia's Chief Struggles to Fulfill Promise to Indians

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia

 BODY:
By way of explaining his promise to shift political and economic power to Bolivia's majority Indian population, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada says his reformist zeal probably stems from feeling like an outsider in the United States as the child of an exiled Bolivian diplomat.
"I know what it's like to be different from the rest and to be shut out of the mainstream because for a long time my family was banned from this country," Mr. Sanchez de Lozada said in an interview. 
 While many Bolivians questioned whether Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, a member of the white aristocracy that has ruled Bolivia for centuries, could understand the plight of the disenfranchised, high hopes surrounded his election and promise in June 1993. Bolivia, South America's most impoverished country, had long neglected its indigenous people, most of whom live in deep poverty in the countryside.
Today, at the halfway point of his presidency, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada is struggling to make good on his promises while facing growing public disenchantment with his policies and violent demonstrations by labor unions and opposition political groups. But Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, who is 61, has made some headway in carrying out reforms that could radically change the economy of Bolivia and give its Indian population an equal voice in government.
If his reforms are successful in uplifting Bolivia's rural Indians, they could serve as examples for other Latin American countries, which are facing increasing demands from long-marginalized indigenous populations for political and economic power.
Perhaps the most significant change under the President's program is an extensive decentralization that gives poor municipalities and Indian villages a much larger percentage of federal money that they can spend as they see fit.
Previously, Bolivia distributed its revenue-sharing funds according to where they were produced, meaning that three large cities received about 90 percent of the money. This year, rural towns received about 40 percent, or some $255 million, of the federal funds for things like roads, schools, soccer stadiums and water and electrification projects.
"It's very exciting because we are seeing democracy working the way it should: the people are spending their money the way they want to spend it," the President said.
But critics, mainly officials from big cities that now receive less federal money, say the plan is flawed because it puts money in the hands of municipalities that have no experience managing it and are prone to corruption.
The Government has also taken steps to integrate indigenous culture into mainstream life. For the first time, Bolivia has legalized indigenous organizations and the practice of folk medicine, and it has allowed bilingual education in Spanish and local Indian dialects. Before, schools were prohibited from teaching in any other language than Spanish.
While these measures and the decentralization plan have had an immediate influence on the average Bolivian, most of Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's reforms are not expected to show results until long after he has completed his four-year term. The Constitution limits presidents to one term only.
Bolivia, a landlocked country of seven million people, desperately needs foreign investment to reduce poverty and create jobs. According to the World Bank, about 70 percent of the population lives in poverty and unemployment stands at 30 percent.
Among the major reforms that Mr. Sanchez de Lozada is racing to complete before the end of his term are the privatizing of state-owned industries and the overhauling of the education system, goals that he had hoped to achieve in his first two years in office.
In many ways, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, who speaks Spanish with an American accent, is an unlikely savior for Bolivia, whose indigenous people make up 70 percent of the population.
He was born in La Paz but went to the United States when a year old after his diplomat father, Enrique, was exiled in the 1930's for his opposition to the Government. After being educated in the United States, at a Quaker grade school and the University of Chicago, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada returned to Bolivia at the age of 21 to make a fortune in mining and later enter politics.
"Have we bitten off a little too much in trying to make these changes?" he said. "Sometimes I think that we have, but we are going to keep on chewing."

HEADLINE: Dutch Settlers Start Boom in Texas Dairy Farms

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: STEPHENVILLE, Tex.

 BODY:
It is near midnight on Friday at the Cutting Horse saloon, and only nine boisterous young men remain. They are drinking Coors Light and speaking Dutch.
Martin Van Beek, a thatch-haired blond, jumps from the table and, seizing the Country and Western duo's microphone, belts out a bawdy, foot-stomping Dutch ballad about life after work on a dairy farm. 
 Every Friday after the weekly cow market closes, these men, all in their 20's and 30's, blow off steam at the Cutting Horse. The rest of the time they feed and milk cows.
More than three centuries after the Dutch settled the city that became New York, and a century after the peak of European immigration, scores of these men have fled the crowded green pastures of the Netherlands for the oak-dappled ranges of north central Texas and a land that for them can still open doors to riches and opportunity. Content to leave oil and cattle to Texans, the Dutch have reinvented the Lone Star state's dairy industry.
Since the late 1970's, Dutch immigrant dairymen -- along with second-generation Dutch-American dairymen whose parents settled in California and Washington state -- have been moving into a 100-square-mile area around Stephenville, little more than an hour's drive southwest of Fort Worth. In combination with a few large dairy farmers from the West Coast, they have made this area the state's leading milk-producing region.
Other Dutch immigrants have settled east of Dallas around Sulphur Springs. No other areas in the state produce much milk.
The Dutch own fewer dairy farms than longtime Texans own, but they own most of the newest, most efficient and biggest farms. Some have herds of more than 1,000 cows, 10 and 20 times more than the typical dairy farm of the Midwest and Northeast. They have brought Texas from next to nowhere in milk production to sixth in the nation, after California, Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania and Minnesota. They also win disproportionately high numbers of industry awards for dairy farm management.
"It ain't a walk in the park," said Mr. Van Beek, who is 30 and single and started his business here six years ago. With no established credit, it can be hard to borrow from American banks to expand, he said, and hard to meet the state's environmental regulations prohibiting the runoff of animal wastes into the Bosque (pronounced BAHS-kee) River. "But if you work hard and have luck, you can get something accomplished," he said.
Sherry Webb, editor and publisher of Texas Dairy Review, a monthly newspaper published in Stephenville, said, "Martin's a perfect example of the Dutch here. He loves America. He will never move back. He keeps asking, 'Do I sound Texan yet?' "
Mr. Van Beek has yet to master the inflections of Texas English, but he is fluent in milking profits from cows even as the economics of milk production have chopped the number of the nation's dairy farms from 282,000 in 1984 to 150,000 last year.
The influx of Dutch dairy farmers has stirred some uneasiness here. A persistent rumor has it that the Government of the Netherlands subsidizes them with low-interest loans -- an assertion that the dairymen and the Netherlands embassy in Washington flatly deny. Merchants call them tightwads who invest freely in milking and processing gear but little in homes and good living. One young Dutchman lived in his milking parlor until health inspectors forced him to buy a trailer home.
They are also blamed for attracting state and Federal regulators. Small farmers used to get away with letting their waste pollute groundwaters and the Bosque River. But the volumes of waste soared with the arrival of the bigger Dutch and West Coast operations, so all farmers had to start hiring lawyers, putting up with regular inspections and investing in lagoons and other devices to protect the river and the water table.
For the most part, however, the Dutch are accepted. Bob Traweek, a longtime Texas dairy farmer in his sixties, who also raises peanuts and cattle, said, "They're willing to sacrifice and do things our older folks are not willing to do."
No one keeps track of just how many Dutch dairymen have settled in Texas. Arnold Parzer, agricultural counselor at the Netherlands embassy, estimates that over the last 15 years, 100 first-generation dairy farmers have moved into the state, nearly all here and in Sulphur Springs. The Stephenville-area telephone book now lists almost a column of names like De Vries, De Wit, De Jong, Houtsma, Talsma, Vander Lann, Van Leeuwen, Vander Linden, Vander Meer and Viss.
Few are Miss Liberty's impoverished huddled masses yearning for freedom. They grew up on farms on the lowlands of the Netherlands and yearned to follow their fathers into the business. But chronic surpluses of milk in Europe have led to quotas to reduce production, stifling initiative and opportunity. The cost of land is forbidding, too. Mr. Parzer said a hectare in the Netherlands -- 2.4 acres -- costs $80,000.
Usually in the Netherlands, the management of most farms is passed on from parents to just one offspring. So younger children who want to stay in the business sell their interest to the managing sibling and bail out for Texas. Compared with the Netherlands, getting started here strikes the Dutch as laughably cheap.
A real estate agent in Stephenville, Ron Koonsman, has listed a 430-acre farm for $748,000, including the land, sheds and dairy equipment -- but not the house. That comes to $1,411 an acre. In the Netherlands that much land, though more fertile, would cost $14.3 million.
Mr. Van Beek was 19 and in college when his father died and an older brother took over the family's farm. "It's just not enough to support two families," he said. So he sold out, and at 22, a year after college, he went off on his own.
For two years he worked at farms in Alberta, Canada, then moved to Stephenville where he leased a farm, left it and leased another. A year and a half ago, he bought an abandoned turkey farm. Today he owns 225 acres, leases 220 more, and has a herd of 600 Holsteins -- six times the size of his brother's herd. Immigration laws are not much of an obstacle, since the laws allow for visas for jobs like these and provide for the admission of foreigners who invest in a business and hire American workers.
The Dutch immigrants seem to acclimate easily to the local culture, donning boots and cowboy hats, buying second-hand pickups, drinking American beer and insisting that their children speak English at home. Still, some work in wooden shoes, and the single men -- the majority of the newcomers -- tend to marry the second-generation daughters of Dutch dairymen.
In Stephenville, nearly 40 families -- half first-generation Dutch, half second and third -- belong to a 10-year-old outpost of the Christian Reformed Church, a conservative cousin of the Dutch Reformed Church. Their 29-year-old pastor, the Rev. Elliot Vander Lugt, is an American of Dutch descent. Three years ago the church opened the Stephenville Christian School, and Rev. Vander Lugt says 40 of its 100 students come from Dutch families. The language of both the school and the church is English.
For years, the influx of both Dutch and West Coast American dairymen stirred little concern here. Texas produced less milk than the state consumed, so there was business enough for all. But production now exceeds consumption, here and nationwide, and that holds prices down. For a decade, the price farmers have gotten for their milk has been stuck at around $1.10 to $1.20 a gallon.
Meanwhile the costs of farming keep rising, and old, less efficient farms, unable to keep costs below their revenues, have had to close or sell out. Corporate dairy farms have more than made up for the production of the 3,800 family farms that closed from 1984 to 1994, leaving only 4,200 in Texas. The population of dairy cows surged 26 percent in the decade, and milk production grew 68 percent.
George De Vries, 40, a second-generation Dutch-American dairyman, was one of the first here, and his is now the second-biggest farm around Stephenville after the single corporate farm in the area. He moved from Washington state in 1978 at 17, leaving behind his parents and 10 brothers and sisters. All five brothers have gone into dairy farming, including one who followed Mr. De Vries to Stephenville.
The De Vries dairy is an immense, pristine establishment. Inside the farm gate stand structures of concrete and steel, with none of the litter or abandoned machinery seen on many farms.
"We're milking 1,200 cows," said Mr. De Vries, wearing starched and ironed, pale blue coveralls. Off in one corner, a giant composting machinery turns mountains of manure into bedding for cows that sleep and eat nearby in open-walled sheds. "It's just unused feed," he explains. "You can feed it to heifers," or adolescent cows. The cows, each with a plastic identification number riveted to each ear, roam between the shed and an adjacent grassless lot. They are set out to pasture only during the two months of the year when they are dry of milk.
Most dairy farmers milk twice a day. But the enriched rations the Dutch serve their the cows, laced with molasses to whet lethargic appetites in the 90-plus-degree Texas heat, produce prodigious volumes of milk and immense pressure on udders. So three times a day, Mr. De Vries guides his herd into his glistening steel and battleship gray milking parlors, where each typically yields close to three gallons of milk a day.
"They're all good dairymen," said Harold Parks, a third-generation Texas dairyman, whose own business, with 450 cows on 300 acres, is still holding its own. "They come from good dairies over there. They're just here to make a living."

HEADLINE: Jordanian Is Lionized In Israel

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: TEL AVIV

 BODY:
In the three months since he arrived as Jordan's first Ambassador to Israel, Marwan Muasher has become a celebrity, although sometimes a reluctant one.
He is a sought-after guest at dinners and receptions. He has appeared on television. He gives lectures. He has been interviewed by the Israeli press. 
 But when news photographers have tried to coax him into casual shots on the beaches and streets of Tel Aviv, he has declined, preferring instead the more sober setting of his office.
Back home, pictures of him at ease in Tel Aviv might cause criticism, especially from Muslim opponents of the peace treaty that Israel and Jordan signed in October. But Mr. Muasher insists that the problem is his own discomfort with star status.
Almost nine months after Israel and Jordan made peace, their peoples still view each other differently, forming a fault line that Mr. Muasher has had to straddle.
"The reception here is overwhelming, to the point where the Ambassador in some cases is almost treated as a celebrity," Mr. Muasher said, sitting in his small office, part of a hotel suite that is serving as Jordan's Embassy until permanent quarters can be found.
"People invite the Jordanian Ambassador many times because they want the Jordanian Ambassador to be there, not because they want to listen to what he has to say," he said. "And when you start focusing on the person rather than on the issue, I get worried."
Mr. Muasher, the 39-year-old former spokesman for Jordan's delegation to the Middle East peace talks, holds a doctorate in computer engineering from Purdue University in Indiana, but has specialized in public and media relations during his career in government. He is only the second Arab ambassador in Israel. Egypt has had one since signing its peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
The Israeli embrace of Mr. Muasher and his measured response mirror a larger reality. While Israelis pour into Jordan to visit and want to establish economic and cultural relations right away, ordinary Jordanians have been more reserved, lagging behind the peace policies of King Hussein and the Government in Amman. Some Jordanian professional groups have punished members who have had dealings with Israelis, and relatively few Jordanian tourists cross the border.
Mr. Muasher tries to allay concerns that relations with Jordan will turn out to be much like Israel's cool -- some would say icy -- peace with Egypt.
"The peace we seek is a warm one," he said in a recent lecture at Tel Aviv University. But he cautioned that it will take time. The Jordanian Government cannot force normal relations on its people, he said, adding that Israeli "over-eagerness" had raised fears among some Jordanians of economic and cultural domination.
Many Jordanians of Palestinian origin feel that there is still unfinished business, like the future of Palestinian refugees, Jerusalem and Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
"While Jordanians want to wait until all the political and economic problems are resolved before building relations on a people's level with Israel, Israelis tend to minimize existing problems and assume they do not affect their dreams of becoming part of the region," he said at the university.
In general, the Ambassador said in an interview, living in Israel has given him a better sense of Israeli hopes and fears.
Israel's terrain reminds him of home, he said, as do the names of Palestinian families with branches in Jordan. But he said he had been apprehensive at first about living in a country that used to be an enemy, and it intrigued him to discover that Israel is a mixture of the West and the Middle East, more raucous and faster-paced than Jordan.

HEADLINE: The House: Battlefield of Short-Tempered Partisanship

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Simmering with short-tempered partisanship, the House of Representatives has become a battlefield where Democratic obstructionism confronts Republican cockiness. The main casualty seems to be the timeliness and legislative efficiency that once marked the new Congress.
Last week, Democrats forced the House to hold 16 procedural roll-call votes, on such matters as "tabling the motion to reconsider the motion to order the previous question," or "that the committee rise and report the bill back to the House with a recommendation that the enacting clause be stricken." 
 They lost every one, but kept the Republicans from passing more than one of the three spending bills they had planned to act on last week. And what those 16 time-consuming votes on parliamentary gobbledygook showed was that the Democrats are learning the few tricks available to a House minority, to get even, if just for a moment, for what it regards as unfair treatment and to build a feeling of unity among the oppressed.
But the occasions that prompted their delaying tactics showed that the Republicans have learned to savor the power of the majority: enlarging the Ways and Means Committee to make room for the latest Republican convert; changing procedural rules midway in the debate on foreign aid spending to prevent an effort to bar aid to Indonesia, and forcing the House to work until midnight Thursday to create a four-day weekend beginning Friday.
The Republicans emphasized that power just before midnight Thursday by announcing new rules that would not only bar some of these dilatory procedural motions next week, but would also limit to 10 minutes each debate on all remaining amendments to the Department of Interior spending bill, including those dealing with the future of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, barring offshore oil drilling and curtailing the Endangered Species Act.
House Republicans insist that such moves are necessary so that they can pass 12 appropriations bills as planned before leaving on Aug. 4 for summer vacation. But they are working more late nights than they expected, and they may yet miss that deadline.
In the confusion, even committee members frequently do not seem to know what is in the bills before them, and the House is risking its reputation for knowing the substance of legislation better than the Senate.
The tie-ups on the floor are the strongest evidence of partisan disarray, but there is nothing in them original enough to take a patent out on. Democrats used to bully Republicans, of course, and change the rules or stack committees. And Republicans used to tie the House up in parliamentary knots.
That was last year, when the Democrats had the majority.
But in fact there is more flat-out partisanship in the House today, because it spreads out from the floor to reach committees, which were once largely free of it, especially the Appropriations and Ethics Committees.
On Tuesday, for example, the Appropriations Committee voted to eliminate all money for the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot of Iowa, a subcommittee chairman, described the agency's $3.4 million budget as "damn high-priced advice." He suggested that the Council, formed in 1947, could be replaced by a group of volunteers "or they could subscribe to the Kiplinger letter."
Democrats battled to save it, saying they had never interfered with appropriations for the Bush and Reagan White Houses. Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the Committee, called the move "a blatantly political act" as well as "a very dumb thing to do on its merits."
Only two Republicans spoke up for the cut. Several others kept their mouths closed when a voice vote was taken. But when a roll-call followed, they supported the change. Not one of the 28 Republicans joined the 16 Democrats in opposing it in a party-line vote.
There are examples of partisanship in other committees, too, from Science to Banking, and there is probably a simple explanation for it. Speaker Newt Gingrich is in control of committees, having picked their chairmen. No Democratic Speaker in recent times had that authority.
That influence, despite the occasional kind words exchanged by the President and Mr. Gingrich, is clearly behind the Appropriations Committee's moves to kill programs the President feels most strongly about, from the National Service Corps to the education program, Goals 2000, which grew out of efforts by governors of both parties to set national education standards.
Thomas E. Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, said: "Committees at this stage are very much creatures of the leadership and its agenda. There is relatively little deliberation going on in committees." The committees were behaving like the relatively powerless of the British parliament.
In the Judiciary Committee, proposed Constitutional amendments are being sent to the floor unscathed, neither amended, sharpened nor softened as a result of either expert testimony or debate among committee members. That practice of reporting out a measure the way it was introduced, with witnesses merely for show, was also reflected in the vote on the Council of Economic Advisers. While Mr. Lightfoot's subcommittee heard 174 witnesses, it never asked any of them about abolishing the council.
The one committee the Speaker does not control is the Ethics Committee, because it is equally divided between five Republicans and five Democrats. But it has routinely split on party lines when it deals with how to proceed on complaints filed against the Speaker himself. In 1988, the last time a Speaker was accused of ethics violations, Democrats and Republicans decided to hire an outside counsel to give their inquiry credibility.
In general, Republicans perhaps flattered by the way the Democrats seem to imitate their own tactics of the recent past. "The Democrats are getting the feel of their role as a minority party," said Representative Bob Walker of Pennsylvania, who used to lead the parliamentary charge for Republicans against a Democratic majority. He complimented the Democrats on dreaming up at least one obscure excuse for a vote that he had never thought of.
And Representative Dick Armey, the majority leader, said Friday that there was nothing really new about partisanship in the House, but that the Democrats were having a hard time of it because they were "still grappling with what was a very unexpected and very bitter disappointment," losing the right to run the House after 40 years in power.
He acknowledged that Republicans were still "struggling to learn" how to run the House. He admitted that the 10-minute limit for debate on amendments was tight, but said, "We've lost a lot of time."
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who serves as one of his party's full-time hall monitors trying to expose evil in Republican practices, replied: "This is the final mockery of their talk about running the place with a combination of efficiency and fairness. Gingrich is busy with his book tour and Armey isn't up to it."
The delaying tactics are only used intermittently.
Speaking from experience, Speaker Gingrich recently told Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, that the longest he could hope to maintain a full-fledged stall was two or three days. Democrats stalled last Monday and Tuesday morning, then legislated until Thursday night, and probably will speak against the plan to limit debate on amendments but not throw a full-fledged roadblock.
Some Democrats have been pleasantly surprised at how much support their stalling efforts have drawn so far. "Most of us are here to do something, so it's really kind of a pain to do this," said Representative Jim McDermott, acknowledging that stalling does not come comfortably to a party whose basic goal is to pass legislation that produces an activist government.
But with the long hours, tempers are frayed even when no stall is mounted. Mr. Walker was calm enough on Tuesday. But 24 hours later, when a neutron research project he favored was threatened by Democrats who noted he seemed not to mind cutting projects for the poor, he responded by shouting:
"The Republicans are for knowledge.
"The Democrats are for welfare."

HEADLINE: Newspaper Executives Gird for War of (Last Two) Tabloids

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
For years, the experts have held that financial troubles at New York City's tabloids were the market's way of saying that New York could not be a four-newspaper town.
The market finally spoke, with a vengeance, when an executive flew in from Los Angeles last week and, after 10 years of losses, closed New York Newsday in an instant. 
 Suddenly finding themselves in a three-newspaper town, newspaper people began to focus on a new question: What will the market say next?
Most importantly, it was clear that what had been a simmering three-way tabloid battle could suddenly become an unpredictable tabloid war between two men who have ego as well as dollars invested in the newspapers they own: The New York Post and The Daily News.
For the city's third newspaper, The New York Times, the question was whether it would continue to devote the same amount of space to local coverage, which had been increased during the years New York Newsday published. Times executives said yesterday that they would not retreat.
But there was no question that most of the attention was on Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the millionaire real estate developer who owns The Daily News, and his much wealthier rival, Rupert Murdoch, both of whom were suddenly in a new game. "I think they each want to win," said F. Gilman Spencer, a former editor of The News. "I think Murdoch would like nothing better than to eat Zuckerman with his morning oatmeal, and I think Mort would feel the same way."
The News, with a daily circulation of 725,599, and The Post, with a circulation of 408,204, differ greatly. The News is a working-class, broad-distribution paper that is cultivating a readership in the city's ethnic neighborhoods. The Post, under Mr. Murdoch, has developed a strong conservative voice that has sometimes seemed aimed more at winning political points and annoying The Times than doing battle with the other tabloids.
The consensus now, however, is that Mr. Murdoch faces a choice between sticking to a course that some newspaper analysts say is akin to running a vanity press, and diving fully into competitive newspaper publishing in the city.
John S. Reidy, a newspaper securities analyst at Smith Barney, said the death of New York Newsday would present Mr. Murdoch with possibilities. For example, he said, The Post could invest in a Sunday edition, which it has tried before, unsuccessfully. Most papers make the majority of their money with their Sunday issues, and the fact that The Post publishes only from Monday to Saturday has long been cited as a weakness.
For the six months ended in March, New York Newsday had an average circulation of 216,000 daily and 194,000 on Sundays. The News's Sunday circulation was 974,000. The New York Times's average circulation was 1,170,869 daily and 1,770,504 on Sundays.
Mr. Murdoch and his top aides were meeting in Australia yesterday and were unavailable for comment. But one person with close ties to the city's publishing executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said what was privately on the tongues of many newspaper professionals: "Murdoch has an advantage of exceedingly deep pockets now. I think you are going to see a monumental struggle."
Last week, as word spread that New York Newsday was in jeopardy, The Post cut its price to 25 cents in Queens, Newsday's longtime stronghold. Some executives saw that as a sign that Mr. Murdoch was raising the ante with Mr. Zuckerman.
Fred Drasner, Mr. Zuckerman's co-publisher, said that The News would move quickly to improve local coverage in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan and would "make a big push in Queens to convert Newsday readers to The Daily News."
Asked for his reaction to the Newsday closing, Mr. Zuckerman said it had long been clear that the market would not support the paper. "There is not enough advertising to support two tabloid papers, let alone three, in the city," he said.
Mr. Zuckerman, who has asserted that his paper is profitable, noted that some analysts believe The Post is losing several million dollars each year. But he did not predict The Post's demise outright.
Some analysts said the Zuckerman-Murdoch confrontation might not affect The Times significantly in circulation or advertising. But The Times's news coverage has arguably been affected more by Newsday than by the other two papers.
For many years before New York Newsday began to grow in the late 1980's, critics had said The Times, which had a broad national and regional circulation, was too passive in its coverage of the city. In recent years, The Times has increased its metropolitan staff, published new local sections and given added space to local news.
Some critics, and some of The Times's own journalists, have said those efforts seemed meant to fend off Newsday, and some wondered yesterday whether the paper would now retreat.
"A sharp stick prods people, and we were a sharp stick," New York Newsday's editor, Donald Forst, said yesterday. "We were a passionate, committed news organization that covered the city in a way it hadn't been covered before. I think The Times reacted to that. Whether it will continue to cover the city with the same resources and people, I don't know."
In interviews yesterday, The Times's publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and executive editor, Joseph Lelyveld, said The Times would continue to cover the New York City region energetically. "It is not just Newsday," Mr. Lelyveld said, "but our experience in the recession has taught us that our home market is very important to the health of The New York Times, and we're going to cover it aggressively as we have been."
Mr. Sulzberger said, "The Times's commitment to local coverage is absolutely unchanged by the unfortunate demise of New York Newsday. We have invested tremendously in bringing our coverage of the New York region up to the standards we are proud of."
Jon Katz, the media critic of Wired magazine, said New York Newsday was watched by publishers across the country because of its expensive bet that a new newspaper could be built in the core of the city, instead of in the more affluent suburbs where so many metropolitan papers have focused their efforts in recent years.
"The message to newspapers across the country," Mr. Katz said, "is going to be: 'Let's not put our money in mainstream urban journalism.' That's very, very sad for newspapers."

HEADLINE: Buying an Uneasy Home For New York City Waste

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: SIERRA BLANCA, Tex.

 BODY:
New York City has the people, the drains and the toilets -- more in a few blocks than in this entire West Texas county. Hudspeth County has the land, 15 times as much as all of New York. Which is why, when New Yorkers flush, their waste often ends up here, 2,065 miles away, in an isolated, impoverished county on the Mexican border whose largest town can't even afford a sewer system of its own.
Behind these simple facts lies a tale of political intrigue, legal maneuvering and big-city money, spent to persuade Texans to accept some 225 tons a day of what New Yorkers wouldn't. For a Long Island company named Merco Joint Venture, the prize was a $168 million, six-year contract, beginning in 1992, to dispose of nearly a fifth of New York's sludge, the gunk left over after sewage has been treated. Making virtuoso use of the legal means available, Merco took only 32 days to win a state approval that normally took months. 
 Merco, based in Freeport, L.I., hired former state environmental officials, handed out political contributions and threatened to sue anyone who stood in the way. Public relations costs alone had reached $598,000 by January. A $1.5 million contract to study the project's environmental effects went to Texas Tech University, which endorsed it even before the study began. Merco put more than 40 local people on its payroll, including a former county sheriff and his wife, a county auditor and several relatives of county employees, as well as a state game warden.
The company's efforts have split Sierra Blanca (pop. 700), an unincorporated county seat, pitting neighbor against neighbor, weekly newspaper against weekly newspaper, rancher against rancher. Some here have only scorn for their new neighbors from New York (pop. 7,322,564).
"They shouldn't be wearing cowboy hats," one rancher, the late Sam Dodge, said after the newcomers arrived. "They should be wearing toilet lids."
The protesters deterred the county judge, the highest local elected official, from seeking re-election, and promoted state regulations that cool the Texas welcome for New York wastes.
While experts disagree on sludge's benefits and safety, local foes say it is poisoning their land and fouling their air. They are already skirmishing over the renewal of the Merco contract, which expires in three years. They portray Merco as an outsider of the most sinister sort, citing court testimony that two of the company's partners paid tribute to a former Mafia boss several years ago, an accusation Merco has denied.
When the Hudspeth County Commission sued to halt the project in 1992, Merco responded so strongly that the commissioners, fearing that the legal battle could cost them their property, dropped the suit. When the leader of the local opposition and an Environmental Protection Agency official joined forces with Michael Moore, the documentary film maker, in a critical television report, Merco hired a legal team that included a former Maryland Senator, Joseph D. Tydings, to file a libel case seeking at least $16 million.
In legal filings and public pronouncements, Merco says what it calls "biosolids" are environmentally correct fertilizers that can make arid, overgrazed rangeland more fit for cattle. They are also reviving the county's economy, Merco executives say.
One of the Texans Merco hired is George Fore, a lobbyist and rancher who looks something like the Marlboro Man's uncle. Mr. Fore has no apologies for the way the company muscled the application through state agencies. "We got that done in record time," he said. "But even in your business, you don't take a number and stand in line. You try to get ahead of everybody else."
Merco urgently needed to jump the line. Federal laws had banned New York from dumping its sludge at sea after July 1, 1992, and Merco won the contract to haul much of it away. The firm had planned to take it to Oklahoma, but opposition there roused the state to impose requirements that might have taken a year to fulfill.
Merco says it could not locate a place to dump the sludge in New York, which has struggled for decades to find room to dispose of all its wastes. Finding the required 40,000 or more acres of reasonably flat land elsewhere turned out to be the easy part. The brother of a Merco partner who lived in Houston heard of the Mile High Ranch in Hudspeth County. A failed housing development and golf course, it has 128,000 acres, eight times as many as Manhattan.
Merco arranged to buy the land for $4.5 million, also paying $20,000 to a title company owned by the county judge, Billy Love. Merco had no choice, Mr. Fore said, because Mr. Love's title company is the only one in the county.
Mr. Love says that Merco in no way bought his support. "They had no need to bribe anybody," he said, pausing over a lunch of chiles rellenos and reflecting on the residents' outcry. "This is what they called it -- bribery. But they have poured untold dollars into this community."
Mr. Love -- dubbed "the sludge judge" -- says objections to the $20,000 payment helped keep him from running again. He now promotes Merco's cause in his weekly newspaper, The Southwestern Sun News, while the weekly Hudspeth County Herald takes the opposite view.
Merco's crucial triumph, however, came in Austin. Merco first hired Mr. Fore, a former Texas Water Commission official. He suggested that Merco hire Susan E. Potts, a savvy Austin lawyer, who in turn brought in Cliff Johnson, a former Water Commission board member and now an aide to Gov. George W. Bush Jr.
They recommended that Merco apply not for a dumping permit but for a beneficial-use registration, which could be issued by the Water Commission without potentially messy public hearings.
Still, the commission had more than 60 other applications on hand, and Merco's was the largest. The commission usually responded in months, not weeks or days. But Mr. Johnson was able to make sure that Merco's application did not get lost in the stack.
Meanwhile, Mr. Fore began asking Texas Tech officials if they would like $1.5 million to study the Merco project. A week after Merco applied to the Water Commission, Sam E. Curl, dean of the university's College of Agricultural Sciences, sent the state panel a letter stating that the college and two departments "fully endorse" the project.
"Our personnel are excited about the potential benefit of this project to the agricultural economy so essential to Texas," he said, in part because the project would train or employ some graduate students and faculty members.
Texas Tech officials say that Merco agreed to let them carry out objective, independent research. "They would not be able to tell us what to do," said the project leader, Ronald E. Sosebee. "They could not direct our research at all." So far, he said, Texas Tech has found increased grass growth and decreased erosion with no buildup of heavy metals. "Everything we have seen so far is positive," he said.
Ed Clarke, a spokesman for the Water Commission, now called the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, recently confirmed that the Texas Tech letter had sped his agency's action. "We expedited it," he said. "It was just a matter of moving it up to the top of a stack."
Sierra Blancans hardly knew what had hit them, or what was about to. They first heard of the project from El Paso newspaper reports in March 1992, said the leader of the opponents, Bill Addington. The Hudspeth County Commission sued to stop the project, although Mr. Love recalls that he objected. Ms. Potts quickly filed a countersuit for Merco. The commission promptly backed down.
For others in Sierra Blanca, however, it was only the start of a long fight. Residents now choose between the town's two general stores based on which side they favor. At Mr. Addington's establishment, the Guerra & Company General Merchandise Store, the windows boast more protest signs -- "Don't Mess With Texas" and "Don't let New York, Chicago, New Jersey and California turn our Rio Grande communities into toxic waste dumps" -- than a 1960's campus bulletin board. The rival R & G Grocery has ordered employees not to discuss politics on the premises.
Mr. Addington, 40, is a third-generation resident, but his flowing hair and ardent manner make him seem like a community organizer from a distant campus. His tour of the ranch, now called Sierra Blanca (literally, White Mountains), in his battered Camaro Z28 afforded a view of the dark brown clumps of New York waste.
"People are saying Merco has made our name Sierra Negro," Mr. Addington said. On a hot, dry day, the smell is distinctly fecal, though not as bad, most residents say, as when it rains.
He has found an ally at the E.P.A. in Hugh B. Kaufman, Assistant to the Director of the Hazardous Site Control Division and a persistent whistleblower. Mr. Kaufman has unsuccessfully asked the Attorney General to name a special prosecutor to investigate his agency's handling of the case. The agency says his views do not represent those of the E.P.A.
Some Sierra Blancans point to 1992 testimony by a former leader of the Lucchese crime family in a Brooklyn racketeering trial unrelated to Merco that two Merco partners had paid the family tens of thousands of dollars. Jon Masters, a lawyer for Merco, denied this. Even if they had made the payoffs, he said, they were only the Mafia's prey, not affiliates. "A Mafia connection?" he said. "When you're a victim of extortion? That doesn't flow."
Merco executives readily confirm that they have tried to cultivate Texas politicians. One Merco project manager donated $11,000 to Ann Richards's failed campaign to remain Governor. "We're doing business in Texas," Mr. Masters said. "That's the way the political system works."
Mr. Fore allows that several employees have political connections, but says in a town of 700 and a county of 3,000, everybody's related to everybody else and thus has ties to local government.
His own tour of the ranch, where cattle now graze, seems to be modeled on a Sierra Club wilderness walk. Thanks to the sludge fertilizer, he said, overgrazed land has tripled its productivity. "This is some of the best grass you can see in the whole state of Texas," he said.
The sludge, some 225 tons a day, arrives in red railcars. It is dumped into spreaders the size of large trucks, which heave it high into the air as they roll across the ranch. About three dry tons are spread per acre per year, about a salt shaker's worth per square foot.
To affirm that the sludge is sanitary, Mr. Fore shows off container seals, documents and logs. But sometimes the system fails. Merco was fined $12,800 for spreading sludge in 1993 that was not processed to meet the state's requirements for reducing microbes capable of causing disease.
Although Colorado and Arizona have welcomed New York's waste, many food processors refuse to accept produce fertilized with sludge. Among experts, a consensus in favor of using sludge on arid rangeland is lacking.
John Peverly, a Cornell agronomist, said Merco's low rate of sludge application could only improve the soil. "It's so nutrient-poor out there, it can make quite a difference," he said. But John Duda, a microbiologist who taught at West Virginia University, said spreading sludge was not worth the risk of contaminating water supplies. "If it's not very good for the ocean, it sure as hell is not good for the land," he said.
But in a mostly Hispanic county where two of five residents subsist at poverty levels, many say they can't be choosy about their opportunities. Steve Gibbs, president of the local community development corporation and Sierra Blanca's only bank, punches a calculator to determine that Merco's annual revenues from its contract are close to Hudspeth County's total personal income.
"It's very unlikely that Hudspeth County is going to be able to go out and compete with El Paso or Dallas for industry, unless we have some natural resources," Mr. Gibbs said. "Well, we have land."

Chart: "Why New York Sludge Found Its Way to Texas"
 
1924 -- New York City begins dumping sewage sludge, the solid byproduct of the sewage treatment process, at a site 12 miles from New York Harbor. Sevewral decades later, the Federal Government concludes that dumping has damaged the inner coast.
 
1984 -- The Environmental Protection Agency picks a new dumping site, 106 miles off the coast of Atlantic City.
 
1988 -- Congress bans the ocean dumping of sewage sludge after medical waste from other sources begins washing up on beaches. As a long-term solution, the city plans to build five plants by 1998 to turn sludge into fertilizer and similar products. In the short term, the city signs contracts toship the sludge by rail to rural areas. One company, Merco Joint Venture, initially plans to dispose of sludge in Oklahoma and Texas, but opposition in Oklahoma prompts the company to focus its efforts on Hudspeth County, Tex.
 
JULY 1992 -- The ban takes effect, and the first train loads of New York sludge roll into Texas.

HEADLINE: Tussaud's and Movie Chain Join Disney in 42d Street Project

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
Clearing the way for the redevelopment of 42d Street, Madame Tussaud's, the famous London wax museum, and AMC Entertainment, a movie theater chain, have reached agreements to open new attractions in the city's old theater district, people involved in the transactions say.
The agreements appeared to fulfill a requirement set by the Walt Disney Company, which has a tentative contract to rehabilitate the New Amsterdam Theater but threatened to pull out unless the city met yesterday's deadline to attract two more entertainment companies to invest in cleaning up the seedy block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. 
 Public officials and executives from each company involved declined to confirm the agreements until final terms are reached with Disney. Executives from Disney's development unit, based in Burbank, Calif., are in New York trying to complete their plans, and an announcement could come this week, sources said. "We are continuing to work," said Catherine Cary, senior development manager for Disney Development Company, "and negotiations are going well."
Disney has until July 30 to decide if it will go ahead with a $34 million restoration of the 92-year-old New Amsterdam theater, to be financed primarily through low-interest loans provided by the city.
Another Disney executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the success of the stage version of "Beauty and the Beast" had accelerated interest in the overall project. "'Beauty and the Beast' has proven to be a gold mine," the executive said. "You can't kill it with a gun. Disney would like to open something else soon." One show under discussion as a follow-up is a stage version of "Mary Poppins," to open next year or in 1997.
After nonstop negotiations in the last few days, Tussaud's and AMC agreed to join Forest City Ratner, a Brooklyn-based developer, to take over the site of the old Empire, Liberty and Harris theaters on the south side of 42d Street, spending a total of $150 million to create a 335,000-square-foot complex housing robotic and interactive wax exhibits, a 25-screen movie theater and more stores.
Tussaud's, London's top attraction with 2.6 million visitors a year, is expected to invest about $30 million and occupy 60,000 square feet. It is unclear how much AMC will invest, but the company, based in Kansas City, Mo., will operate New York City's largest movie theater, with 130,000 square feet and 4,900 seats. Officials involved in the talks estimate that AMC and Tussaud's will each attract about two million visitors a year.
Tussaud's officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment. Benjamin Fox, a partner at New Spectrum Realty Partners, AMC's broker in the project, said he could not comment. The city is spending $13 million to condemn the buildings but is not providing any public subsidies like those Disney is receiving for the New Amsterdam project.
As the first entertainment company to express publicly an interest in 42d Street, Disney jump-started long-stalled efforts to revive the former center of live theater in the city. In January 1994, the announcement that Disney might renovate the New Amsterdam "kind of blessed 42d Street," said John T. Livingston, the president of Tishman Urban Development Corporation. "It told everybody who was circling that this is an important project." In May, Tishman joined Disney to win a bid to build a $303 million hotel and entertainment complex on the northeast corner of 42d Street and Eighth Avenue.
But the executives at Pearson P.L.C., Tussaud's corporate parent, had recognized Times Square's potential value as a tourist attraction long before Disney entered the picture. For more than two years, Pearson, which operates many top theme parks and attractions in the United Kingdom and Europe, negotiated to develop an entertainment complex at One Times Square, best known as the site where the ball drops on New Year's Eve. But in March Pearson was outbid by Lehman Brothers, an investment banking firm, to buy the tower from a French bank. Pearson then attempted to buy the site from Lehman, but those talks fell apart.
People involved in the current talks with Disney said officials of the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the New York City Economic Development Corporation plan to bring executives from Tussaud's, AMC and Disney together with Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for a huge, festive announcement on 42d Street, possibly in the next few days, once Disney's contract is final.

HEADLINE: Carpenters' Union Readies For Supervised Election

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
The job now pays $360,791 a year, and on Thursday voting begins to determine who will get it: the presidency of the carpenters' union in the New York region, a union long beleaguered by corruption and mobsters.
As part of a government drive to reform the union, the election will be overseen by court-appointed monitors and investigators. And for the first time, the president and other officials will be elected by the membership instead of by delegates chosen by leaders of union locals. 
 Federal prosecutors say they have opened an investigation into allegations of fraud and bribery in the administration of the $1.5 billion pension and welfare funds of the District Council of New York City and Vicinity of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, the parent group for 17 locals in the city, Long Island and northern suburbs. Council officials, with trustees from employers' trade groups, determine how the funds are invested and select the lawyers, accountants and consultants who manage them.
The council's president, Frederick W. Devine, is opposed by three candidates in his effort to win a second four-year term. Some 24,000 active and retired members are eligible to vote in secret balloting from Thursday to Monday.
Mr. Devine's opponents assert that he has bestowed extravagant benefits on himself and his allies while the union's treasury has been depleted and about 40 percent of its members remain unemployed.
They contend that District Council officials doled out lucrative jobs at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to their friends and relatives and to members suspected of having ties to organized crime.
Union officials are also accused of dipping into pension and welfare-fund reserves to subsidize companies that failed to make required benefit payments for their employees. The payments, the authorities say, were made in behalf of several companies controlled by mobsters or linked to relatives of union officials.
Besides receiving more than $210,000 annually and a car as president of the council, Mr. Devine is accused of secretly getting a $150,000 salary and a $25,000 allowance for a second car as the administrator of a special fund financed by contractors. The fund, the Labor-Management Cooperation Fund, was established in 1993 to promote jobs. But Mr. Devine's opponents say he has used it to pad his salary and to buy campaign advertising.
Two of Mr. Devine's sons, a daughter, a daughter-in-law and his brother-in-law are on the union payroll.
Mr. Devine, 57, was a defendant in a civil racketeering suit brought in 1991 by the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan against the District Council's leaders and several mobsters. The suit was settled last year in an agreement that called for the appointment of Kenneth Conboy, a former Federal judge, as an investigator to look into wrongdoing and to supervise the direct elections of council officials.
Mr. Devine denied charges raised in the civil suit that he had accepted kickbacks from contractors and that he was tied to organized-crime figures. He declined to be interviewed.
John Abbatemarco, the council's first vice president, who supported Mr. Devine when he ran as a self-proclaimed reform candidate in 1991, is seeking to succeed him. Mr. Abbatemarco, 43, said in an interview that Mr. Devine had disillusioned him by running the union through secret deals.
Another candidate, John J. Greany, 54, a union member for 37 years who has never held office, contends that the union has been dominated by Mafia groups since the 1950's. Describing himself as "a maverick and a dissident," Mr. Greany said he had never earned more than $40,000 a year as a carpenter because union officials refused to assign him to jobs.
Also opposing Mr. Devine is Patrick J. Harvey, the president and business manager of Local 608, the city's largest carpenters' unit, with 4,300 members. Mr. Harvey, 55, describes the secret salary Mr. Devine gave himself from the Labor-Management Fund as a prime example of mismanagement.
Law enforcement officials said that Roger M. Levin, a former lawyer for the council, has become a cooperating witness in an expanding Manhattan grand jury inquiry into possible fraud and bribery in the handling of the District Council's pension, health and welfare funds. The officials said that Mr. Levin has admitted giving kickbacks to trustees who authorized unnecessary legal fees. Mr. Levin, who is awaiting sentence on charges of filing false reports to the Internal Revenue Service, declined to be interviewed. The District Council, in a report to the United States Labor Department, noted that it had paid Mr. Levin's firm $2,158,026 in fees in the 1993-94 fiscal year.
In another aspect of the investigation, Arthur M. Blau, who was an accountant for the council until last year, was indicted on July 6 on Federal charges that he kicked back thousands of dollars to an unidentified trustee of the funds in return for obtaining union work. Mr. Blau pleaded not guilty. The union reported paying Mr. Blau's accounting firm $1,554,110 in fees in the 1993-94 fiscal year.
"The carpenters' union won't be cleaned up by a single election," said Herman Benson, the executive director of the Association for Union Democracy, a group that monitors civil rights for union members. "The rank-and-file members must be convinced that the Government and law enforcement are there for the long haul and will protect their rights until all the bums are thrown out."

HEADLINE: The Winds Change For Claudia Shear: Now, She Blows Back

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
NOTHING in Claudia Shear's off-the-wall employment history has prepared her for her oddest job experience of all: being in demand.
Once, as an unemployed actress, Ms. Shear was so desperate for work she took a job answering phones in a Manhattan brothel. But these days, when the telephone rings in her Brooklyn apartment, the calls are often from Hollywood, conveying offers for her to star in romantic comedies or develop sitcoms or attend exclusive film workshops. 
 "I'm standing in the kitchen stirring pasta and beans, and Jeffrey Katzenberg calls," Ms. Shear said. A look of wonderment crossed her face at her own dropping of the name of the well-known movie executive, who recently formed a movie company with Steven Spielberg, the director, and David Geffen, the producer. "It is all getting a little Bunuel," she added.
That the turnaround in her life should remind her of a movie by the Surrealist film maker is a measure of how far Ms. Shear has come in the year and a half since her one-woman Off Broadway show, "Blown Sideways Through Life," opened to critical raves and played for six months to sold-out audiences. The play is an angry, moving account of the people she met and the tasks, bizarre and humiliating and mundane, that she performed over the course of taking up and then giving up a total of 64 menial jobs in her years as a struggling New York actress.
The rise of Ms. Shear continues on Wednesday at 10 P.M. as her play, tapered just a bit for the time constraints and primmer programming of public television, makes its debut on American Playhouse. Filmed in a frenetic seven days in Manhattan last December for $600,000, the teleplay features a heavyset Ms. Shear, clad in a blue organza gown, recounting her sometimes wrenching, frequently hilarious, adventures in the world of work.
The 32-year-old, Brooklyn-born actress, who has waited on tables, taken messages for doctors and even acted in a risque Italian movie (her part ended up on the cutting-room floor) says television seemed a much more appropriate vehicle than film for "Blown Sideways Through Life." Because the play deals with the everyday frustrations and incongruities of life in the most ordinary of jobs, Ms. Shear said she thought the piece demanded the broader audience television can deliver.
"There was an amazing range of people who came to see the play," Ms. Shear said recently as she sat in a bar in Greenwich Village, nursing a club soda. "That is why I believed it had to be on TV. I think both myself and the subject are accessible. If it had been a movie, it would have ended up at the Angelika, being shown to 50 people," she said of the movie theater complex in Greenwich Village known as a showcase for foreign and independent films.
In some ways, "Blown Sideways" is a daring choice for American Playhouse. Although one-person plays are not new to television, Ms. Shear's piece is not exactly "Mark Twain Tonight." It is, rather, a more personal and idiosyncratic play that may seem, by some viewers' standards, a tad racy, with its occasionally salty language and its colorful yet affecting portrayal of life in the whorehouse where Ms. Shear answered the phones.
Lindsay Law, the executive producer of American Playhouse, said some public television stations would not have run the stage version of the play. "It's tricky," he said. "It mostly has to do with an accumulation of language; when a 60-minute piece is completely sprinkled with questionable language, they can get quite hysterical. And there were several things in the whorehouse sequence that had to be removed. It's a reminder that this country diverges enormously on what it finds acceptable."
Ms. Shear is philosophical about the cuts demanded of some of the more explicit sexual references in the script. "We did have to cut a few things, which I regret," she said. "But I can't think that anyone could watch my piece and think that it is prurient or obscene. And to be fair, I think there are things I can say in person that are much more brutal if they come off your TV set in the house."
The delicacies of adaptation aside, what drew Mr. Law to the project, he says, was its wisdom about a topic that rarely gets such tender treatment. "I loved that it was funny, but I also found it tremendously moving," he said. "In New York, you see how horrible people are to service people. They really are just horrible."
The writing of "Blown Sideways Through Life" was an act of desperation by a woman who is eager to escape what seemed to be turning into a life sentence in the service industry. It all started three years ago in the offices of the New York Theater Workshop in Manhattan, where Ms. Shear, exhausted by the years of rejection for acting jobs, came to ask James Nicola, the workshop's artistic director and a longtime friend, to help her find an agent.
Instead, Mr. Nicola told her to find a pen. After years of hearing her tell tales about her life, he knew she had a natural gift. "She was a great storyteller," Mr. Nicola said. "She would come to visit us here, and I would notice that work would stop, people would gather around to listen to her stories. I thought, well maybe there was a way to focus her energy and make it pay off."
Ms. Shear, a classically trained actress with a lifelong love of books, started scribbling, and during the next two years, she worked with Mr. Nicola and another friend, Christopher Ashley, who would become the play's director, to fashion the monologue. The opening night at the New York Theater Workshop changed her life.
"I had 50 messages on my phone the next morning," said Ms. Shear, who is much slimmer than she was when the teleplay was shot, and has long blondish hair that falls in delicate curls. "After 15 years, it was overnight."
Suddenly she was a person of importance, the object of compliments from the likes of Stephen Sondheim and Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, who also began calling, she said. Soon Ms. Shear was in Hollywood talking deals and collecting screenplay assignments. Robert Redford invited her to Sundance. The book version of "Blown Sideways" was published in the spring by Dial Press, and she has been cast in a movie, "Body Language," a comedy that may be shot this year. She says she is also writing a screenplay about two sisters who hate each other.
The desperate job hunt, it seems, is over.
"I'm not a wannabe," Ms. Shear said, finishing her club soda. "I'm a be."

HEADLINE: Jackpot! The Lowly Slot Is a Cash Cow

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
SLOT machines are like pop songs, offering minute variations on established themes, with hooks to grab your attention. Some of them actually talk, telling the gambler in a coy digital voice, "Fill me up," or "You look like a winner."
They flash and pop and twinkle with multicolored charts that reveal a bewildering combination of payouts. The 25-cent machine that Norma Silverstein of Camden County is playing at the Trump Taj Mahal this morning has a handle that sets the fruit salad combinations spinning, as well as a button that does the same thing. But the button merely clicks; the handle comes down with an audible, ratcheting, satisfying crrrrunch. 
 And when the cherries or oranges or bars line up, the machine spews quarters into a thin, acoustically shaped metal pan that amplifies the sound until you can almost feel it in your teeth. Mrs. Silverstein loads her coin cup, puts more quarters in. In the low, indirect pink background lighting, the reels of the machine glow brightly. Her face relaxes, her mouth in a half smile. "I go here to be alone, to tune out the world," she says later. "To be honest, I'm very happy not seeing anyone or saying hello to anyone."
 These days, it is people like Mrs. Silverstein -- and not her husband, Robert, who is off playing blackjack -- who are keeping Atlantic City in business. Over the past decade, the casinos' revenue from table games -- blackjack, craps, baccarat, roulette and the others -- has barely budged. Revenue from slot machines has doubled. "They have become the most important revenue source in the casino industry," said Brian Ford, a Philadelphia-based gambling industry analyst for the accounting firm Ernst & Young.
These days, casino employees come up to slot players and ask them if they want a complimentary drink or a sandwich. These days, high rollers -- people who play machines that take up to $500 a pull, or who come to Atlantic City's 27,000 slots several times a week -- can qualify for the same luxurious comps that used to be reserved for table players, from chauffeur-driven rides to shaking the hand of Wayne Newton.
This aggressive pampering of slot players has helped keep the Atlantic City casinos afloat at a time of growing competition with those in other states (notably the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut, now the nation's largest in terms of gross revenue). But it also worries experts on gambling, who say that of all casino games, the slots may be the most seductive because they allow compulsive gamblers to be alone with their addiction.
"They see the coins coming down, or they're getting comps, and they think they're beating the system," said Edward Looney, executive director of the Council for Compulsive Gambling. "But they're not beating the system. They're paying for the system."
Most slot machine players aren't compulsive gamblers, of course. Most, like Mrs. Silverstein -- who plays once a week, and leaves her automatic teller card, credit cards and jewelry at home -- understand that the odds are against them in the long run.
The average machine has a "hold rate" of 92 percent: for every $100, it returns an average of $92 and keeps $8. These odds are actually more favorable for players than those of many table games, but what the slots have going for them is sheer volume. The average hand of blackjack, or round of dice at craps, is 30 seconds. A single pull at an Atlantic City slot machine is six seconds.
Multiply those numbers by about seven million players a year, and you begin to understand why the casinos are winning almost three times as much from the 25-cent slot machines alone as from blackjack tables. It's why the average Atlantic City slot machine generated $113,000 in revenue last year, and why Showboat is the most recent casino to join a trend in Atlantic City: in May the casino reduced the number of table games, from 130 to 88, to make room for more slot machines. In April Merv Griffin's Resorts closed its Rendezvous lounge, the most famous "little room" in the city, and put in more slot machines.
Elsewhere in town, comedians have stopped telling the joke that nobody tans in Atlantic City because the casinos haven't found a way to put slot machines on the beach.
Standing in line at the Taj to get a roll of quarters, Norma Silverstein explains the appeal of the slot machines this way: "You feel no pain on the casino floor. When I go into the bathrooms, I can hear them talking about this one that has a daughter who is in trouble, or this one with an operation. The machines take it all away."
She takes her roll of quarters, grabs a plastic, quart-sized Taj Mahal coin cup, and searches among the 3,543 buzzing, clattering machines -- the most under one roof in Atlantic City -- for the right one.
 
THE BUSINESS
Betting on the Slots
 Everybody likes to say they saw it coming," said Mr. Ford, the analyst with Ernst & Young, "but if I told you, back in 1984, that table games would become less significant than slots, people would say I wasn't playing with a full deck."
In the early 1980's, the industry considered no-tech table games to be the essence of the business. Though gamblers stood in line to play slot machines when Resorts International became the Boardwalk's first casino in 1978, table games raked in 60 to 70 percent of the casinos' winnings. The 40,000 or so gamblers who made up Atlantic City's high-roller core were exclusively table players.
Then, in 1984 in Atlantic City, long before Las Vegas's celebrated comeback as a "family" destination resort, the tide turned. For the first time in the history of the gambling industry, year-end total revenue from Atlantic City's slot machines exceeded that of table games by a few thousand dollars. A year later, the gap widened to a few million dollars.
Today, based on 1994's figures, slot machines in Atlantic City, Las Vegas and nearly every gambling mecca in the country that has them will beat the table games 2 to 1. (After a long period in which the two cities were nearly even, Las Vegas now outstrips Atlantic City in total gambling revenue, $4.4 billion to $3.4 billion in 1994. On the other hand, Las Vegas has about four times as many slot machines and three times as many table games as Atlantic City.)
Small wonder that the machines are growing ever more elaborate and the bets are getting higher: as much as $500 on a single pull. Then there are the Megabucks machines, linked by computer to several casinos, with a jackpot that increases until somebody wins, like the state lottery. (The other day the one in the Taj Mahal was at $405,000 and seemed to be growing by the second.)
"While no one in this town has given up on the table player, the economics speak for themselves," said Herb Wolfe, president and chief executive officer of Showboat, which has the second most slot machines in Atlantic City, behind the Taj Mahal. "If a table player comes here, and loses $10,000 at craps or blackjack, about 20 percent of that -- $2,000 -- will end up as profit for the casino. If a slot player comes here and loses the same amount, $6,000 is profit for the casino, because there's no dealer, there's no supervisor, there's no pit boss."
And none of the old condescension for the once humble slot machiness. "There is no difference between a slot player and a table player," said Paul Tjoumakaris, a vice president at Caesars, holding a $500 slot token. "We value their business equally. We listen to what they want and we do everything we can to give it to them."
This doesn't mean, added Mr. Tjoumakaris (once a slot player himself), that there are no distinguishing characteristics.
"Slot players like convenience," he said. "They like to find their machines quickly, so we've widened the aisles so they can get to the machine they want without bothering other players. They want to be able to sit at their machine, so we put seats in front of the machines that turn out only one way, so that people can come and go from one machine to another without bothering each other. They like to have a change machine right at the machine so they don't have to call for a person to make the change. More and more players don't smoke, so we've put in smokeless slot pits."
And like Greta Garbo, slot players want to be left alone -- with their machines.
"That's the scary part of the business," said Mr. Looney, of the Council for Compulsive Gambling. "The way the gambling industry, and the slots in particular, appeal to the desire among people to escape what's bothering them in their lives. This isn't the place to ask if they should be doing something about what's bothering them instead of squaring off with a machine."
 
 
THE CLUBS
Luring the High Rollers
 From the deck of the Black Whale III sightseeing boat, Atlantic City looks better than ever. The beach, the casinos, shops and hotels along the Boardwalk rise proudly, a flawless series of facades. A Ferris wheel turns grandly at the end of Steel Pier.
On the boat, a trio of Dixieland musicians are playing "In the Good Old Summertime." A few among the 250 guests -- members of the Showboat casino's slot club -- try their sea legs at dancing. Two weeks ago they received invitations in the mail to come down and take a free sightseeing ride. Some got follow-up phone calls from Showboat's slot hosts.
Before computer technology enabled Atlantic City to create its first slot clubs in 1985, identifying high rollers was virtually impossible. Unlike table players, whose bets are larger and more visible, slot players spend long hours at their machines making what amount to comparatively small wagers. Change makers and slot hosts had to watch a player over many hours. Now every casino has at least one slot club, each with 800,000 to 1.2 million members, and the computer keeps score.
Slot club members get a pile of discount coupons for show tickets, casino buffets and restaurant meals, not to mention an array of coin giveaways and other freebies. Members are encouraged to insert their club card each time they play; the more they do, the more comps they can earn -- and, of course, the better the casino can keep track of how much they spend.
 Sitting in the bow of the sightseeing boat, Vicki Graydon and Rod Murray don't consider themselves high rollers. Insurance underwriters from Port Jervis, N.Y., they rarely play with more than $100 each. Still, before they joined Showboat's slot club, they came to Atlantic City just two to three times a year. Then they joined, invitations and discounts began to arrive, and they began coming more often. Lately they've been in town once a month.
"When you think about it, you'd spend as much, or more, for a vacation anywhere else," Ms. Graydon said, taking in the Atlantic City skyline. "There are lots of different places to get away to, but we like this. And we happen to be winning right now."
 
THE FUTURE
Gearing for the Ultimate
 Exactly what attracts gamblers to machines is a subject of endless study. Some like the crunch of the handle, the feel of coins in their fingers, the buzz and dazzle of lights.
Others like the opposite: interactive machines in which action is committed at the touch of a very quiet button. And it is for this player that the industry is gearing up for what some feel might be the ultimate gambling device: a totally cashless slot machine -- pop in a credit card or automatic teller card, and away you go.
Since February, Larry Cole, vice president of information systems at the Sands Hotel and Casino, has supervised a cashless experiment at the Sands, in which coin and cash giveaways are credited to an individual machine rather than put in the player's hand. The idea is to stop "coin walking" -- in which players take their free rolls of quarters and leave the casino -- and to give players a gratifying up-to-the-second readout of how many comps they've earned.
Mr. Cole said the system was passing "with flying colors," but he added that "moral problems" might keep more advanced cashless systems out of casinos for many years to come. "We're not out to destroy people on their credit cards," he said. "That's not in the best interest of the player or the casino."
Larry Mullins, vice president of marketing at the Taj Mahal, agrees. "Slot players are in it for the long haul," he said. "They want to stay with their machines as long as possible. From the casino standpoint, we want them to come here, enjoy themselves, play with what they have, go home, come back and do it again."
Mr. Mullins says he has actually stopped slot players who seem to be in over their head. "It's a touchy thing," he said, "because some people can get offended if you tell them to take a breather. But the industry is moving away from the kind of desperation that put players in financial trouble. We're here for the long haul, too."
Still, like it or not, a cashless slot system is on the horizon. Within months a casino will open on the information highway. After electronically transferring money from personal accounts to a "casino bank" based on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, gamblers will be able to achieve slot machine bliss without ever leaving home, on -- where else -- the World Wide Web.
The prospect does not particularly worry Mr. Tjoumarkaris, of Caesars. "It will be like watching home videos as opposed to going to the movies," he said. "The web system can be the home video; we're the movies. There are always people who will want to go to the movies." And the others, he went on, "will come to Atlantic City to see what they're missing."

HEADLINE: Charting the Way to a Livelier Downtown

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IN a perfect world, downtowns are bustling places, full of enticing shops, restaurants and theaters. Alas, such has not been the case here in recent years, which is why the city retained Ferrandino & Associates, planning and development consultants of Elmsford, to devise a comprehensive marketing and development plan to revitalize downtown.
In August 1994, the consultants started work on the project. Eight months later, they filed the final report. 
 "Our goal was to prepare a road map, if you will, for the city to follow," said Vince Ferrandino, who heads the company. "We developed a comprehensive marketing strategy that will position the city of White Plains to embark upon a long-term downtown economic revitalization plan, focusing on both the retail and office sectors. The retail area is centered on shopping streets that include Mamaroneck Avenue, East Post Road and Main Street. We also examined the office market and ways to increase office occupancy in the city."
Mr. Ferrandino, who was formerly Commissioner of Planning and Development for Mount Vernon and the town of Greenburgh, started his own practice in 1988. He estimated that his company completes about 26 projects, of various types and sizes, a year.
"The White Plains assignment was big in scope and more complex than most," he said. "We had four people working on it; the city wanted it to be done quickly to maintain White Plains as the county's retail center and to increase office occupancy."
The consultants began by conducting in-depth surveys for months before releasing two reports: one on the retail market, the other on the office market.
The surveys revealed strength and weaknesses, Mr. Ferrandino said.
"White Plains is one of the largest retail centers in the New York metropolitan area, in a large upscale trade area," he said. "Our findings show that while there was a general positive image of the downtown, the stores and restaurants were seen as weak. One of our recommendations to the city was to devise a retail niche strategy, which translates as 'Don't compete with the malls; instead focus on market niches that you can dominate.' "
The consultants recommended that after identifying the niches the city expand and build on them. Niches under consideration were restaurants, bridal shops and sports, musical instruments and electronics stores.
"We also suggested that new niches be created," Mr. Ferrandino said. "Those might include home furnishings and design stores, specialty food shops, arts and entertainment ventures -- all latent market niches that we think could be developed successfully for the downtown."
The report on the office market suggested that the city identify industries that would be considered prime candidates for office space and then campaign aggressively to attract them.
"Downtown White Plains is competing with suburban and regional office markets in the entire tristate region," Mr. Ferrandino said. "The key in such a competitive market place is for White Plains to identify and promote its own unique assets."
The county seat, with its concentration of county, state and Federal offices and courts, is a major asset, he observed. Highway access, the Westchester County Airport and the Transcenter, which provides direct and quick rail access to Manhattan and regional bus routes, are other assets.
"We also point out the proximity to the graduate center at Pace University and the downtown branch of Mercy College in White Plains as strong assets," he said.
Such assets, he said, would attract the type of businesses identified in the report as insurance companies, business services, medical and legal services, engineering, accounting and management companies and nonprofit organizations.
But in order to carry out the downtown marketing and economic development plan, Mr. Ferrandino said the report recommended that the business community form a local development corporation, which would be responsible for administering the business development efforts on a day-to-day and long-term basis.
"The local development corporation, which we suggested, has recently been established as the White Plains Business Development Corporation," he said. "The incorporators are businessmen long active in White Plains. They are Leon Silverman, Peter Kempner and Joseph Potenza, who is the White Plains Planning Commissioner. The city has donated $75,000, and an additional $75,000 has been given to the effort by large individual property owners, which means the corporation will start with an operating budget of $150,000."
The search for a professional director has begun, and the development corporation will use the consultants' report as a blueprint to work with retailers and owners of commercial property and to recruit new businesses.
"In the report we also laid the groundwork for an ongoing marketing promotion and public relations campaign," Mr. Ferrandino said. "We have completed a brochure and other promotional materials to be used in the recruitment effort, and they are beamed at attracting new retail stores, and office tenants. We have already implemented such activities as the Farmers Market, which will be held downtown every Wednesday, and the Grand Prix auto race each September, which brings new life and recognition to the area."
Although the consultants have submitted their final report, Mr. Ferrandino said, "We're still developing a list of hot prospects that we will give to the development office to use in recruiting tenants to fill a vacant office and retail space."
He continued: "The way we operate is to go into the market, talk to brokers and owners and see who's looking for what. Then we give the list to the development office so they can aggressively call on the tenants and property owners and put the two together."
Mr. Ferrandino's list of projects ranges from a plan for the development of the Belmont section of the Bronx, which put Arthur Avenue on the map, to current assignments like a comprehensive plan for the village of Hastings-on-Hudson and an environmental study for the demolition of the existing New Rochelle Mall, which a developer, Kenneth Narva, intends to redevelop as an integral part of downtown New Rochelle.

HEADLINE: Teen-Agers Look in Vain for Summer Jobs

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
WITH few prospects for employment this summer, Tarik Curry, 16, spends most days in front of "X-Men, Children of the Atom," a popular game in the video arcade at Nathan's Famous restaurant here.
"I looked for work, but it's always the same old story," said Tarik, a student at Gorton High School in this city. "They say, 'Don't call us, we'll call you,' but they never do." 
 Jason Ko, a 17-year-old from Eastchester, had a similar story. He, too, has been unable to find a job, although he has applied for work at several fast-food restaurants and grocery stores. Like other teen-agers who have little else to do during their summer vacation, he goes to Nathan's and visits with friends there. "I'm in a waiting mode," he said. "For now, I'm hanging out."
It was the same in other parts of the county -- a limited number of jobs and many idle teen-agers, said administrators of youth employment programs. Federal money for summer jobs has been in short supply and late in coming in most cities. And the few private-sector jobs that were available early in the season have been filled.
Mary E. Rainey, a site director for the Westchester Community Opportunity Program in Peekskill, said she was worried about young people who did not find work during their summer vacation.
"They say they're hanging out, but I know it's just a matter of time until boredom sets in," she said. "I'm afraid they will get into trouble."
By last week, Ms. Rainey still had no word on Peekskill's application for $467,000 in Federal money for a youth employment program. Last year, the Job Training Partnership Act sponsored jobs for 400 low-income youths. So far this year, she has been able to place only 50 teen-agers in summer jobs.
At the Youth Bureau in Peekskill's City Hall, Carol L. Campbell, an advocate for the city's children, echoed Ms. Rainey's concerns.
"It breaks my heart to tell these kids who really want to work that I have nothing for them," she said. "Our goal is to keep them off the streets and out of trouble."
Federal funds came through this year in Yonkers, where L'Judie Matt-Simmons, Commissioner of Community Services, said she was able to offer jobs to 375 teen-agers with $500,000 from the Job Training Partnership Act -- the same amount the city received last year.
Still, close to 400 young applicants were turned away, and Ms. Matt-Simmons said she worried about "the ones who don't work: we have a problem here with gangs."
Mayor Terence Zaleski hires men from 23 to 35 years old to patrol the streets of Yonkers and refer teen-agers who who are loitering to community center programs. His Urban Street Walkers Program was formed to reduce the crime rate among the young.
White Plains only received $30,000 from the Federal Government -- $65,000 less than last year -- for summer jobs. But the city made up the difference from its own coffers, offering summer work to 150 youths, 14 to 21, in municipal offices or with the White Plains Greening Project, an outdoor conservation and ecology program, said Lois L. Perlmutter, a supervisor with the city's Youth Bureau.
She said private-sector jobs have been especially scarce this summer and speculated that many of the lower-paying jobs that often go to youths -- in fast-food establishments, for example -- have instead been filled by adults unable to find better positions.
"It's a ripple effect that we're still feeling from all of the downsizing," Ms. Perlmutter said. "Executives had to move down a notch or two, and that all filtered down."
She said that many students applied to stores in the Westchester, the million-square-foot mall that opened last March in White Plains. "But the teen-agers they used in the beginning are now being phased out," she said, "and new jobs for them are few and far between."
Neil Palmer, 20, a student at the State University of New York at Buffalo, failed to find a summer job at either of the two malls in White Plains, so he settled for $5.90 an hour working for the city's Department of Finance.
"The pay isn't great, but I took it because it's hard out there," he said. "You take what you can get."
Mr. Palmer is majoring in computer information services and said that even though his income was limited this summer, his work with the Finance Department complemented his studies.
Douglas Lin, 19, who graduated in June from White Plains High School and will be attending Harvard University in September, said he also applied to several stores but "heard nothing back."
"They didn't even seem interested," said Mr. Lin, who is working at a clerical job in White Plains City Court for $5.50 an hour.
The county continues to be one of the largest employers of young people in Westchester, although money for summer jobs was in short supply this year. Salvatore De Santis, Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, said his department offered jobs to 800 17- and 18-year-olds -- down about 100 jobs from last summer.
Competition was keen for those positions, with the county receiving several thousand applications for jobs at public beaches, pools, golf courses and parks.
Kelly Moroch, 20, a college student from Hastings-on-Hudson who is earning $8.06 an hour as a lifeguard at Sprain Ridge Park in Yonkers, said she waited five years to land that position -- working first at other county jobs, including as a cashier at parks, to get work experience and references.
At the state Department of Labor in Albany, Vincent F. DeSantis, a principal economist, confirmed that the job market remained difficult for youths, although the New York state unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds dropped to 17.5 percent in the second quarter of the year, compared with 22.5 percent for the same period last year. In part, that was because fewer teen-agers were looking for work -- 70,000 in 1995 compared with 93,000 last year, he said.
But he cautioned that the jobless figures for teen-agers told only part of the story.
"What we really listen to is the word on the street," he said, "and that is that job opportunities for young people are very limited."
He added that youths living outside of cities tend to fare better in the job market, often finding work at country clubs, swimming pools, lumber yards, garden clubs and amusement parks.
But competition is keen for those positions, and Mr. De Santis urged young workers to develop a good attitude, respect for authority and "a willingness to do all sorts of jobs without thinking anything is below you."
That was the advice heeded by Jason Katz, a 17-year-old from Yonkers, who is working as a caddy at Sunningdale Country Club in Scarsdale.
"It's not a human job, taking orders and listening to the golfers yell, but it's O.K. for now, although I would have liked something better," he said.
At Ardsley Swimming and Tennis Club, the manager, Leo Bragg, added to the list of job qualifications for young workers. "They should be well spoken and make a good appearance, especially when dealing with the public," Mr. Bragg said, explaining that he chose only 18 from a "very large pool of applicants" to work as lifeguards, maintenance workers and tennis attendants this summer.
Administrators of summer programs are suggesting that when all else fails, young workers seeking summer employment should consider volunteering.
"Sometimes that's the only option, and it's not a bad one," Ms. Campbell in Peekskill said. She said high school students there received elective credits toward their diploma for approved volunteer work.
Mr. Lin in White Plains said that he had applied for volunteer work at Westchester County Medical Center, in addition to his other job, because he is considering a career in medicine. "Employers are impressed when you have volunteer work on your resume," he said. "It looks good."

THE BOSTON IRISH
A Political History.
By Thomas H. O'Connor.
Illustrated. 363 pp. Boston:
Northeastern University Press. $24.95. 
"IF there had existed in the 19th century a computer able to digest all the appropriate data, it would have reported one city in the entire world where an Irish Catholic, under any circumstance, should never, ever, set foot. That city was Boston, Massachusetts." So begins Thomas H. O'Connor's book "The Boston Irish," which tells the raucous, tragic but also hopeful story of what happened when the Irish, most of them in flight from famine, dared to set foot in that city, and dared to stay.
In other places, Irish immigrants and their descendants moved rather smoothly into positions of economic, social and political power, but in Boston they were confronted by a Yankee establishment that did not want them. The stain of that rejection marked the soul of the city. Despite all appearances of patrician high-mindedness, Boston's initial hatred of the Irish remains its Original Sin. Thus, the Irish presence has been known from the start for a spirit of xenophobic defensiveness that is still evident.
But from the 19th century on, the most important and fateful conflict involving the Irish in Boston has been the group's argument with itself -- not the familiar, though still interesting, story of its combative hatred of others, whether other immigrants, blacks, Jews or the WASP upper class. Mr. O'Connor demonstrates that the familiar story is so far from the whole story that, as usually related, it is false. As he puts it, the popular image is fixed, say, on James Michael Curley sending "Yankees into fits of apoplexy by proposing to sell the Public Garden for $10 million." But it was Hugh O'Brien, the city's first Irish mayor, not the old aristocracy, who promoted the Boston Public Library and rescued Frederick Law Olmsted's plan for the "Emerald Necklace" park system, he writes.
Hugh O'Brien and James Michael Curley represent two strains of Irish political leadership in Boston -- one adept at coalition building, not only with the monied establishment but with a range of ethnic and racial groups, and the other devoted in populist fashion to the elevation of "neighborhood" interests. Mr. O'Connor contrasts bridge builders like O'Brien and his 20th-century counterparts, John B. Hynes and John F. Collins, with turf defenders like Curley and Patrick J. Kennedy and John F. (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald. This division between "city leaders" and "ward leaders" reached a climax in the school busing crisis of the 1970's. Mr. O'Connor defines the real Boston story of those years in the words of J. Anthony Lukas: "a feud within the Irish political family."
Raymond L. Flynn, then a member of the city council, and most other leaders of the Irish neighborhoods opposed busing; but the busing was ordered by a Federal judge who was Irish-American (and a Kennedy man at that), W. Arthur Garrity, and imposed by an Irish-American mayor, Kevin H. White. Even the dispute decided last month by the United States Supreme Court about the demand of homosexuals to march in Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade (the High Court said they could be excluded) is an argument among the Irish: the gay and lesbian group that forced the issue pointedly defines itself as Irish-American.
Thomas H. O'Connor is a professor of history at Boston College and a native of South Boston and, according to Jack Beatty, Curley's biographer, "the dean of Boston historians." In this book he earns that title, embodying as he does the best aspects of the two Irish strains -- openness and loyalty. His training and erudition enable him to turn a coldly objective eye on South Boston's blatant politics of racism; "frightening" is the word he uses. But his love not only for the city but for its wards comes through as well. Beginning with the ancient travails of the Irish-English wars and concluding with the triumph of the "New Boston," "The Boston Irish" is a work of the historian-as-citizen.
Because he has mastered Boston politics' deep past, Mr. O'Connor is able to give us, in the concluding chapters, the best recounting of the contemporary scene that I have seen. It is a neglected story, often lost in the cliched perception of Boston parochialism. The truth is that while other cities have approached collapse, Boston, under the leadership of a generation of well-educated, public-spirited Irish-Americans, has reinvented itself, become energetic and open to newcomers. Even intractable problems are being faced head on: for all its costs, busing in Boston succeeded in ending government-sponsored segregation.
Mr. O'Connor makes clear the particularly important contributions of Mr. White and Mr. Flynn, who succeeded him as mayor. Each represented an opposite side of the Boston Irish tradition, but each found ways to transcend himself and enable his broad constituency to do the same. The thrust of Mr. O'Connor's story is clear: the Irish succeeded in turning hostile Boston into their own city. The question is, will they -- can they -- complete the job of turning it over to someone else?

The Tech Stocks Defy Gravity and Rewrite Conventional Wisdom

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Conventional wisdom has it that the second quarter brings a slump to the producers of computers, software, semiconductors and disk drives. Not so this year.
With a few exceptions, the companies that have reported second-quarter results have met or exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates, sending already lofty prices of technology stock to new highs on an almost daily basis. 
 The exceptions, like Advanced Micro Devices and Sybase, have had product problems that say little about the group as a whole. But among the big gainers, the strong performance of issues like Motorola and Seagate Technology appears to bode well for all technology issues, as does the anticipation of the introduction of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system on Aug. 24.
Many investors are betting that the tech stocks can continue to defy gravity through the third quarter and into the Christmas season. But some analysts caution that so powerful is Windows fever that if the introduction is even just a little slower than the buoyant forecasts, disappointment may follow for many technology companies.
The parade of strong earnings is expected to continue this week with results from Intel, Microsoft, Apple Computer, Texas Instruments, Cypress Semiconductor, LSI Logic, Integrated Device Technology, Informix Software and Sun Microsystems. Electronic Arts is expected to report lower revenue and profit, reflecting the transition to new systems in the video game market.
Making the case for bullishness, Bruce Lupatkin, research director at Hambrecht & Quist, said there has been a fundamental change in the technology industries from the old cyclicality.
"In years past, the technology market was almost self-contained," Mr. Lupatkin said. "Semiconductors went into work stations that were used to write software that was used to design more powerful semiconductors. What's happened is a dramatic proliferation of technology into consumer products, information infrastructure around the world and in corporations. All of these things came together at the same time and effectively broadened the market opportunity."
Hambrecht & Quist's analysts expect a major buildup in anticipation of a strong fourth quarter, with some weakening at the retail level during the summer as customers wait for Windows 95 and then for hardware and software that takes advantage of it.
Another factor driving up the prices of tech stocks is the major positions taken by big mutual funds, like the Fidelity Magellan Fund of the FMR Corporation. The funds now "need to be in technology," Mr. Lupatkin argued. "It's a big enough part of the economy; it's not a niche, and the market caps are large enough." The real sign that the group is topping out will be overpriced and oversubscribed initial public offerings -- something that has not happened yet, he said.
Michael Murphy, editor of The California Technology Stock Letter, is more pessimistic, saying that the tech group is at or near its peak and poised for a fall.
"This is a classic case of buy on the rumor, sell on the news, and the news is the introduction of Windows 95," he said. "I think this is going to be a successful product inevitably, but it's going to have a very slow adoption rate. If you have a slow ramp, you very quickly get price-cutting."
Previous new versions of operating systems, including Windows 3.0 and Novell's Netware 4, have taken 18 months or more to catch on. Companies are loath to switch until all compatibility issues have been resolved, and a major new operating system like Windows 95 is likely to demand more powerful processors, larger hard disks and more memory, as well as new applications, to show its best.
"It's a very expensive upgrade by the time you get done -- $1,200 to $1,500 a set," Mr. Murphy said.
Price-cutting on personal computers, he continued, would quickly ripple back through components like memory chips and disk drives, causing earnings disappointments throughout the technology group. His advice is to take profits now.
"We're down to 40 percent invested, with no PC-related stocks," Mr. Murphy said. "We're buying biotech stocks, and letting this thing play itself out."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. PROPOSING GREATER CHOICES ABOUT MEDICARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
House Republicans have begun drafting proposals to make immense changes in Medicare, by imposing annual limits on spending in the program and by giving elderly people a choice of private health insurance plans as alternatives to the standard Federal program.
Confidential documents prepared by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee describe numerous options that would increase costs for Medicare beneficiaries who stay in the standard program, under which the Government pays separately for each doctor's visit and each hospital admission. More than 90 percent of the 37 million Medicare beneficiaries receive care through such fee-for-service arrangements. 
 Under the Republican plan they would be allowed to remain in the standard program, but the proposals would create strong financial incentives for them to switch to health maintenance organizations; the number of Medicare recipients in H.M.O.'s is already on the rise.
"A greatly expanded choice of plan options will be made available to Medicare beneficiaries at time of initial eligibility and during subsequent annual open enrollment seasons," say the documents, which put flesh on the bones of the budget cuts already endorsed in principle by both houses of Congress. The budget plan approved by Congress last month would slow the growth of Medicare by cutting projected spending by $270 billion, or 14 percent, over seven years.
Under the main Republican proposal, the Government would make regular payments to private health plans chosen by Medicare beneficiaries. The basic Federal contribution would be the same for each person in a given market area, but it would be "adjusted for demographic and risk factors." An H.M.O. would, for example, get more money from the Government for enrolling an 86-year-old woman with cancer than for signing up a healthy, vigorous 65-year-old.
If a Medicare beneficiary chose a private health plan that charged less than the Federal payment, he or she would receive a cash rebate equal to the difference. But if a beneficiary enrolled in a private plan that charged more than the Medicare rate, "the beneficiary must pay the additional premium to the plan."
This proposal for a Government-supervised bazaar, in which health insurers compete for business, resembles the system of managed competition recommended by many health policy experts. President Clinton proposed a form of such competition in his ill-fated effort to remake the nation's health care system in 1993 and 1994.
But there is a big difference: The Republican plan applies only to Medicare beneficiaries, while Mr. Clinton wanted the Federal Government to guarantee and regulate health insurance for all Americans. He insisted on "universal coverage" and got nothing.
Under the Republican plan, the options available to Medicare beneficiaries would include health plans sponsored by employers, labor unions and trade associations. Retiring workers could stay in their employers' plans.
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who heads the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said the documents, dated July 5, accurately reflected the "general conceptual approach" being taken by House Republicans in their effort to modernize Medicare and save its Hospital Insurance Trust Fund from bankruptcy.
But he added that the proposal would be refined as work on the legislation continued. Many Republicans have said they do not want to disclose or discuss details of their Medicare plan until they roll out a formal legislative proposal in September.
The fight over Medicare promises to be the biggest battle between the new Republican majority in Congress and the Democrats, who repeatedly accuse the Republicans of planning drastic cuts in Medicare to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.
The documents from the Ways and Means Committee show that the Republicans are considering many novel ideas. They would, for the first time, try to impose limits on the growth of Medicare, which since its creation in 1965 has been an open-ended program, purchasing health care for anyone who meets the eligibility criteria.
Under the Republican proposal, there would be "specific growth rates in Medicare outlays" for each of the next seven years. The spending targets would be set separately for Part A of Medicare, which pays for hospital care, and Part B, which pays for doctors.
"If program spending exceeds growth rates set in law," the documents say, "then outlay reductions will be triggered." Federal payments to H.M.O.'s and other private health plans "would be set in advance to meet the targets, so outlay reductions, if necessary, would be made only in the Medicare fee-for-service program."
Representative Jim McDermott of Washington, a leading Democratic spokesman on health policy, said the Republican proposal for a standard Federal payment, or voucher, would reduce the choices available to Medicare beneficiaries. "Seniors will be forced into the most restrictive H.M.O.'s," he said. "They will not have more choice because they will not have the money to buy an adequate policy. They will have to buy the cheapest policy possible."
H.M.O. patients typically pay just a few dollars for each visit to a doctor, but those in the traditional Medicare program are responsible for at least 20 percent of the fees charged for doctors' services. One of the Republican proposals would discourage Medicare beneficiaries from buying private insurance to cover that 20 percent share. The Republicans evidently believe that such Medigap coverage insulates patients from the cost of their care and encourages them to overuse doctors because they do not have to pay the patients' share of the bill, or coinsurance.
Thus, under one Republican option, "a new program would be established to encourage beneficiaries to self-insure (not purchase Medigap coverage) for Medicare coinsurance liabilities." This proposal would reduce the patients' share of doctors' bills to 15 percent if they agreed to do without Medigap insurance. But if Medicare beneficiaries chose to buy such coverage, as most now do, they and their insurers would be responsible for 25 percent of the doctors' charges.
Another proposal on the Republican list would increase the Medicare Part B deductible, now $100 a year, and raise it automatically to keep pace with medical inflation. Other proposals would require Medicare beneficiaries to pay 20 percent of the costs of home health care services, clinical laboratory services and the first 20 days of a stay in a skilled nursing home.
Yet another proposal would increase Medicare premiums for people with higher incomes. The documents do not say who would have to pay the extra premium, nor do they specify the amount. But they do say, "This additional premium would be collected annually, with payment accompanying the April 15 filing of income taxes." Under current law, Medicare beneficiaries, except for those with very low incomes, pay the same premium, $46.10 a month.
The Republicans would also give Medicare beneficiaries a one-time opportunity, at the age of 65, to set up medical savings accounts and enroll in private insurance plans covering catastrophic medical expenses. People choosing this option would permanently forgo other types of Medicare coverage and would pay most of their medical bills from their medical savings accounts.
Another Republican proposal would enable Medicare beneficiaries to share any savings achieved by the Government when they report waste, fraud or overcharges by doctors or hospitals.
But the heart of the Republican plan is the effort to create more choices for Medicare beneficiaries. Private insurance plans wishing to do business in the Medicare market would have to be certified as meeting Federal standards. Their benefits would have to be at least equivalent to those in the standard fee-for-service Medicare program, but could be delivered in different ways.
In addition, the documents say, private "health plans must agree to serve all beneficiaries in a market area on a first-come-first-served basis, up to plan capacity."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Another Proposed Pathmark and Another Debate

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
WELCOME to Pathmark II. Or is it Pathmark Too?
First came Pathmark I, the proposed supermarket in East Harlem so controversial that after years of planning, it's still on hold. Now come plans for another Pathmark megastore, this one in Springfield Gardens, Queens. And New York being New York, its fate is shaky too, even though the idea goes back six years, originated with a community organization, has the approval of the local Congressman, the Mayor, the City Planning Commission, the Borough President and half of an evenly split community board. 
 "This is ridiculous," complains Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President. "People want it and deserve to have it. On the merits there's no way it should fail."
But City Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins, worried about traffic, congestion, security and the future of local storeowners in her Queens district, opposes the project. Council members tend to defer to their colleagues on local issues unless the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, intervenes, and so far he has stayed away from Pathmark II. So nobody is predicting what will happen when it goes before the Council today and tomorrow.
The economic argument for the store is a strong one. The city estimates that residents of the thriving middle-class, predominantly black neighborhoods of southeast Queens spend $166 million a year on food, half of it in Nassau County. The border is just a few blocks away from the proposed 17-acre site of the new store -- at the intersection of Springfield and Merrick Boulevards.
Richard Lipsky, an aggressive lobbysist for food merchants in Springfield Gardens and Laurelton, argues that those Queens neighborhoods have good stores. But others say that, as is often the case in minority neighborhoods, those stores do not provide the choice, quality or lower prices available in Nassau. "We're just hemorrhaging sales across the border," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission.
THOUGH still undecided about the East Harlem Pathmark, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani supports this one because it is essentially a private enterprise, Mr. Rose said. It would benefit from the same city tax break available to all commercial development outside of midtown Manhattan, but unlike the East Harlem store, it would be built without large government subsidies, and on privately owned rather than city land.
The Queens store is also unencumbered by the ethnically charged infighting that seems to have silenced, at least temporarily, the normally outspoken Mr. Giuliani. In East Harlem, the fight is between black political leaders who would share in the development of the store, and Hispanic political leaders who oppose it in favor of local shopkeepers, many of whom are Hispanic, too. That presents the Mayor with quite a problem since he has never been popular with blacks in the city and lately seems to have lost support among Hispanic New Yorkers.
In Springfield Gardens, the disagreement is between Ms. Watkins and local shop owners on one side, and most everybody else on the other, including the often contentious Queens Citizens Organization. That community group sought construction of a supermarket in southeast Queens in the first place and does not get along with Ms. Watkins. That is not the reason for her opposition, she said. "Politics be damned. I care about what is in the best interest of the community I represent, and this is not."
But the neighborhood's Congressman disagrees. "The reality is that you develop anchor tenants, like the Pathmark, around which you build," said Representative Floyd H. Flake, a champion of economic development in his community. He contends that with so many shoppers leaving the area already, building a Pathmark would not do any more damage to local stores and could actually attract more economic activity. There is no guarantee that some stores would not be pushed out. But others might well move in.
On balance, most people in the neighborhood think that the logic argues for a Pathmark, not against it. But logic does not always prevail over politics in New York.
NEWSPAPER POSTSCRIPT: Those who are not journalists must wonder why it is that those of us who are react so dramatically to a newspaper's demise. One reason, of course, is that we empathize with colleagues and realize it could have been us. But there's another reason, a more noble one, forgive the earnestness: we realize that we are in this together and that losing a newspaper means losing an enterprise whose daily practitioners do not think about bottom lines and advertising and revenue.
Serious reporters, editors and photographers -- and they are to be found in every newsroom -- are dedicated to peeling away the hypocrisy and the hype, getting at the truth, and sharing it with the public. That is why the departure of New York Newsday hurts. It means the loss of a competitor whose work made every other newspaper in the city a better newspaper. It means the loss of a partner.

HEADLINE: Budget Slashes Could Close Hospital

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
If there is a tangible symbol of Big Government, and of its ideal of providing sophisticated services to all, it might well be the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center.
The sprawling hospital is by some measures the largest in the nation and serves most of the county's poor, its trauma victims, AIDS sufferers and serious burn victims. It trains more medical residents and nurses than any other hospital in the country. It treats 500 people with leprosy. The vast majority of its patients are indigent or receive public assistance, and just 1 percent have commercial health insurance. 
 The hospital also provides thousands of jobs in one of the most economically beaten-down sections of the county, East Los Angeles.
Unfortunately, the County-U.S.C. Medical Center has another standout feature -- an annual operating deficit of more than $200 million at a time when Los Angeles County is in a serious fiscal crisis. The vast majority of the deficit is not the result of tighter finances in the county, but of budget cuts in the state capital and in Washington. Combined, the state and Federal Governments provide about three-fourths of the county's health services budget.
That is why this monument to a social and political ideal is the subject of two urgent debates: one is about the details of cutting costs and making do with less while the other, more far-reaching debate is over how many people the county government will allow to go without proper medical care, who those people will be and where people will go for what medical care they can obtain.
The county's chief administrative officer, Sally R. Reed, has proposed closing the medical center, which she has estimated would save the county almost $350 million a year, more than a quarter of the $1.2 billion budget gap it is facing in the current fiscal year. Union officials, some doctors and local politicians have called closing the center unthinkable, and a pitched battle is being fought over its future.
But whether the four-million-square-foot center is closed, or drastically scaled back, as many here expect it will be, it has become a potent symbol of the deep shift in the county government's view of itself, and of the impact that the new priorities in Congress are starting to have on the delivery of critical services.
"This represents the loss of a very noble effort on the part of the government to provide medical services for everyone," Ms. Reed said. "But we just can't do that anymore."
Douglas D. Bagley, executive director of the county's Department of Health Services and the former chief executive of the medical center, put it in plainer terms. "The question of whether we survive financially is a question of our social priorities and values," he said. "It's not a question of whether these services are needed."
Ms. Reed, like many others here, has argued that private hospitals would provide many services offered by the medical center, perhaps even more efficiently. But even officials at the private hospitals who embrace this view also make it clear that the poor would suffer.
"We're entering an age of the reality of the limits of health care," said William Parente, president of the Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center and a member of several committees from hospitals in the area studying these issues. "I fear that the result of saying we just can't spend the money is that there will be reductions in medical care for certain people. They'll be cared for, but only up to the limits of our financial capability."
Under the law, hospitals are required to provide at least initial treatment for most emergency patients. Mr. Parente and other private hospital officials have said that they would be financially capable of handling certain emergency patients, even those who are uninsured, and some Medicaid patients. But they have generally said that they would be unable to treat uninsured patients who had suffered the worst types of injuries or Medicaid patients who required expensive or long-term care.
The medical center carries a daunting burden. It is the only place where many of the patients can go for medical care, while at the same time it is at the forefront of many medical specialties, from trauma care to the treatment of troubled pregnancies.
It is a gritty and sometimes grim place. Its main waiting room, without air-conditioning, was a sea of troubled faces on a recent afternoon. In the general medical ward, there are five beds in a room, no air-conditioning and no telephones or televisions.
The medical center delivers more than 10,000 babies a year, receives more than 855,000 emergency and outpatient visits and treats 28 percent of the county's seriously injured patients.
In the intensive care ward on a recent afternoon, a 7-year-old girl who had been shot in the abdomen was sitting up for the first time in a week, surrounded by clouds of red, white and blue balloons. A few doors down, a prisoner from the county jail lay in the coma he had fallen into six weeks earlier, when he was savagely beaten.
One issue on which nearly all agree is that, though the patients of the hospital will be the most affected, they appear to have had the least influence over the hospital's fate. That is just another part of the reality of the hard-edged budget politics of the 1990's.
"Closing County-U.S.C. would be a disaster of catastrophic proportions, even more than any earthquake," said Antonio Villaraigosa, who represents East Los Angeles's in the State Assembly and has helped organize some of the many protests and marches by residents struggling to keep the medical center open.
"Unfortunately," he said, "the people of this community often don't have an avenue to support or criticize a government program, but local residents have at least tried to register their dissatisfaction."
The hospital faces two basic problems. The first is cuts in health care budgets by the Federal Government. Of the hospital's $756 million operating budget last year, the county provided just $93 million. The remainder came from the state and the Federal Government.
A total of 64 percent of the hospital's patients are on Medicaid, the Federal-state health care program for the poor. About 30 percent are indigent with no means of paying their bills. A large proportion of those patients are illegal aliens. The remainder are either Medicare patients, have commercial insurance or pay for their own care.
"The problem is not runaway expenditures," Mr. Bagley said. "The problem is not carry-over deficits from previous years. In fact, we have a surplus in most years. The problem is that 80 percent of the budget is financed from external sources, and those sources are shrinking."
The second basic problem is that private hospitals feel the big public medical centers have encroached on their business. "They should provide primary care for those who have no alternative," Mr. Parente said. "That is their responsibility, and it should stop there."
Many private hospitals in the county are operating with about 50 percent of their beds filled, on average, while 76 percent are filled at the County-U.S.C. Medical Center. Closing the medical center could thus help fill many empty beds in private hospitals.
That could potentially improve their profitability but at a cost to the county's poorest residents. "Everyone would very much like to see it survive for a long time," Ms. Reed said. "The center is a source of pride in the community. But I see this as inevitable. We cannot meet all the needs of all the needy people in the community."

HEADLINE: Not a Laugh Riot: Comedy Writers in Short Supply

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif.

 BODY:
Just as professional sports teams struggle to find enough quality players to fill each position during an expansion year, the number of television comedies has grown so much this year that television executives say they are worried that there will not be enough quality comedy players -- in this case, writers -- to go around.
This summer in Hollywood, 59 comedies are going into production, up from about 45 last year. The demand has been increased because of the addition of two new would-be networks -- WB and UPN -- and the growing interest among cable networks in producing original comedy programs of their own. In addition, aggressive moves to develop a base of comedy shows are being made by new production studios like Dreamworks and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment. 
 Executives at the networks and studios said that 500 to 600 writers would be required to fill the staffs of these new comedies, and that it was highly unlikely that the industry could find that many bright comedic minds.
"It's really insane," said Jamie McDermott, the senior vice president in charge of prime-time series for NBC. "All over town, bidding wars are breaking out for second- and third-level writers on successful comedies."
The battle for comedy writers has serious financial implications for a business that relies on the situation comedy for the bulk of its profits. "Are people making sensational deals? Yes," said Jeff Greenstein, a young comedy writer whose first series, "Partners," created with Jeff Strauss, will appear on the Fox network this fall. "Have prices gone up for everybody else? Yes."
Comedies are in demand because they usually attract the biggest audiences and always make the most money in syndication. Thus, the networks want prime-time schedules filled with comedies and the companies that produce shows want to make as many comedies as possible to generate more syndication revenue.
The problem of the dilution of comedy talent is made worse by the emphasis most new comedies place on writing. "The new shows are driven by smart writing," Ms. McDermott said. Her network, NBC, has set the standard for smart writing with shows like "Seinfeld," "Frasier" and "Friends."
"Friends" has become the most copied show in television. But its director, James Burrows, said: "It's silly to try to clone a show like that. The call for good writing is too demanding."
Still, the networks are trying. Mr. Strauss said he and Mr. Greenstein looked at more than 200 writers to build their seven-person staff on "Partners."
The competition for good writers is coming from everywhere, including some well-financed new production companies looking to establish themselves quickly as comedy producers.
"Both Dreamworks and Brillstein-Grey are cash-rich situations," Mr. Strauss said. Both companies have co-ownership deals with ABC. As a result, the network has backed them with cash, which they are using to sign up comedy writers at a rapid rate.
"We've been very aggressive," said Brad Grey, co-chairman of Brillstein-Grey. Among the long list of comedy writers lured to his company are former writer-producers from series like "Roseanne," "Frasier," "The Simpsons" and "Grace Under Fire." Dreamworks has grabbed important staff members from shows like "Mad About You" and "Ellen."
Mr. Grey denied that his company's recruitment blitz came down to throwing a lot of money at writers. He cited his company's quick success in getting shows on the air -- the first four comedies the company developed have made it onto network schedules -- as well as the writers' desire to "help us build this company."
Mr. Grey acknowledged that every writer lured away by Brillstein-Grey and Dreamworks created a hole on an existing show that needed to be filled. "We've brought a lot of writers into the fold who've done well elsewhere," he said. "From that perspective we've caused other people a lot of problems."
A senior executive from another production company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Grey's heavy-wallet approach was damaging the economics of the business. He cited a former producer-writer from one series whom Mr. Grey had lured away with a two-year deal worth about $5 million. That was more than double the amount the writer might have received elsewhere, the executive said.
What troubles some industry executives, including Ms. McDermott, is the raiding of young writers who may not be ready to take on their own series. "It's the most frustrating thing in the world," she said, adding that as more comedies get onto the air, more and more talent with less and less experience is getting raided.
Mr. Greenstein agreed. "People who have not had the experience of growing with a show or even being in the editing room or casting, these people are getting high-dollar deals," he said. And that, naturally, elevates the money that has to be paid to experienced talent, he said.
The escalation of prices for writers is rippling through the industry in other ways. Ms. McDermott said that with the studios having to pay higher salaries to sign writers, they now demand longer commitments from networks for their series.
"Everybody is forced to step up," she said. "Instead of 6 episodes they insist on getting an initial order for 13. We have to give them what they want because Les Moonves at CBS is going to give them 13. So we say 13. Then all the costs go up." Leslie Moonves is the new president of CBS Entertainment.
And as salaries skyrocket, so does the pressure on hit shows. "What now happens on the first year of a successful show," Mr. Greenstein said, "is first of all the staff gets depleted because everybody rushes to grab up any interesting eligible members of the writing staff. Then the studio is already on the backs of the executive producers saying, 'We need more shows, like now.' "
All television shows generate a deficit for their owners, who count on syndication money to make up those deficits and generate profits. A strong comedy can make hundreds of millions of dollars from its repeats in syndication.
But, Mr. Greenstein said: "There could be a major reckoning this fall, when 'Seinfeld' and 'Home Improvement' go into syndication. If they don't perform as well as expected, everything is going to sink."
Indeed, at some point soon the syndication market can be expected to be as saturated with comedies as the networks currently are in prime time. Mr. Greenstein said it might become very difficult for a middling hit comedy to command an acceptable price in syndication if it had to compete with 25 others.
"At some point you start asking yourself: How much comedy viewership is there to go around?," he said. "I'll tell you, we're pushing the limits."

HEADLINE: A Worthy Competitor

 BODY:
After 10 valiant years, New York Newsday has closed its doors. Its relatively brief turn on the city's stage unfortunately produced $100 million in losses. Despite staff opinion that a turnaround was possible, the paper's corporate bosses at the Times Mirror Company in Los Angeles decided on Friday to shut the paper down.
This may have been a sound economic call, but it was a sad outcome nonetheless. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lamented a further loss of the "diversity of opinion" needed in a city as diverse as this one. He noted further that competition from a variety of newspapers produces strong journalism. 
 In the paper's final edition on Sunday, its editors and writers struck notes of pride, sorrow and anger in equal measure. There was pride in the paper's record of accomplishment, sorrow for the 700 employees who will lose their jobs, anger that a living newspaper had -- prematurely in their view -- been sacrificed to the bottom line by business managers on the West Coast.
Murray Kempton, the columnist, said on Friday, "You know, I've never been folded by strangers before." He was even more annoyed when he sat down to write his last column. "It is a very bad deed, my masters, to set a tree to growing and then kill it full of life and growing still."
The Times Mirror people obviously felt that the tree could not be saved. In the beginning, they had hoped to find a profitable niche between the two tabloids, The Daily News and The New York Post, and the upmarket New York Times. That niche turned out to be small. Essentially a hybrid, New York Newsday never acquired a sufficiently compelling identity to attract enough readers and advertising. Circulation, which peaked in 1991 at just over 300,000, declined to 216,000 this year -- half that of its next largest competitor, The New York Post.
The paper also faced the same inexorable demographic trends, compounded by a durable regional recession, that have made New York City a tough go for all newspapers. In the late 1920's, New York supported 13 citywide newspapers. As recently as the early 1960's, it supported seven. It is now back to three.
Along the way, New York Newsday gave its readers a good ride. It won three Pulitzer prizes and boasted a distinguished roster of columnists, a lively editorial page, a solid sports section and aggressive local coverage.
The editor, Don Forst, said that New York Newsday had given its best shot. "This was a gutsy newspaper. You came in and tried to elbow and knee your way, literally, onto newsstands." The Times Mirror Company made an expensive bet that a new newspaper could be built in the core of urban America, instead of in the affluent suburbs where many metropolitan papers have focused their efforts. That it did not win that bet is a sad message not only for the newspaper business but for our cities as well.

HEADLINE: Iraq Frees 2 Americans After 4 Months

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Two Americans who had been imprisoned since they crossed into Iraq four months ago were released today by President Saddam Hussein in what American officials said was an effort to persuade the United Nations to lift economic sanctions against his country.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, however, that the United States had promised nothing in exchange for Iraq's sudden decision to release the two men, William Barloon, 39, and David Daliberti, 42. Mr. Hussein released them after Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat, appealed to Mr. Hussein in a one-hour meeting this morning to free them on humanitarian grounds. 
 Mr. Richardson, who has adopted the role of a globe-trotting troubleshooter during the last two years, had consulted closely with the Clinton Administration before making the trip to Baghdad. He said in a statement released by his office that "there were no deals made in the meeting; there was no quid pro quo or concessions."
Mr. Barloon, of New Hampton, Iowa, and Mr. Daliberti, of Jacksonville, Fla., seemed relaxed and healthy when they appeared at the Milya-Mansour Hotel today in Baghdad alongside Mr. Richardson. In early May, both men complained of chest pains and stress and were taken to a Baghdad hospital, where doctors said Mr. Barloon had some possible scarring of tissue in his heart.
In their brief public appearance today, Mr. Daliberti would only say that it was "a wonderful day."
Mr. Barloon's brother, Edward, said in a telephone interview from his home in Rosemount, Minn., "This was a very, very pleasant surprise to wake up to on a Sunday morning." He said that not only had he not known about Mr. Richardson's trip before today, but that he had never heard of Mr. Richardson.
A spokesman for Mr. Richardson said that the Congressman had left Baghdad by car today with the two men and that they would arrive in Amman, Jordan, early Monday morning, after what was expected to be a 10- to 12-hour drive through desert.
In March, an Iraqi court sentenced Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti to eight years in prison for illegal entry, although Iraqi officials often accused the two men of being spies.
The two men, who worked for American aircraft maintenance companies in Kuwait, insist that they made an innocent wrong turn across the Iraq border on March 13 when they were seeking to visit a friend at a United Nations outpost in northern Kuwait, just south of the Iraq border.
United Nations officials acknowledged that their guards had mistakenly allowed the two Americans to cross the border. As soon as Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti entered Iraq, they were seized by the police.
The detention of the two men aggravated the already bitter relations between the United States and Iraq, with American officials often saying it was uncivilized to jail two people for what the Administration described as having innocently strayed into another country. Iraqi officials asserted that the two Americans could not have accidentally stumbled into their country and could have entered it for just one reason: to spy.
Appearing today on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Mr. Christopher said any international efforts to ease economic sanctions against Iraq were "totally unconnected with this."
Nonetheless, Mr. Christopher said, "this is a very, very important step."
Speaking about Mr. Hussein, he added that "perhaps he was trying to court some international favor," to win easing of the trade sanctions that were imposed against Iraq to punish it for invading Kuwait in August 1990.
A White House official interpreted Mr. Hussein's decision to pardon the Americans this way: "The Iraqis have tried for some time to get the sanctions lifted. They probably have concluded that as they move into the fall and a series of U.N. Security Council reviews of whether to ease the sanctions, this is an impediment they don't need around. They concluded that not only are they not going to get anything from keeping these guys in jail, but it is a liability."
Shortly after learning about the release of the two men, President Clinton called their wives, and he had 10-minute telephone conversations with each to pass on the news.
The two women said they were overjoyed to learn that their husbands would no longer have to spend their days in Abu Ghraib Prison near Baghdad, where they shared a six-by-eight-foot cell and often had just rice and water for meals.
"Obviously I am absolutely elated and can't believe this ordeal is coming to an end," Mr. Barloon's wife, Linda, who is on a business trip in Singapore, told CNN.
Stu Nagurka, a spokesman for Mr. Richardson, said the Congressman left for the Middle East Thursday night after an intermediary had urged him to get involved in the issue.
In the statement he released today, Mr. Richardson said, "I commend the Iraqi Government for taking this positive humanitarian action."
White House officials said Iraq had sent messages for months through intermediaries that it wanted something in exchange for releasing the two Americans. The Iraqis called for unfreezing Iraqi assets, easing the United Nations trade embargo and obtaining millions of dollars in food and medicine.
Iraq's Foreign Minister, Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, suggested in May that Mr. Hussein might release the two Americans if Mr. Clinton sent him a letter requesting clemency.
Administration officials said they refused to provide a quid pro quo or a Presidential letter because they did not want to give Mr. Hussein any reward for imprisoning the two men, or to lend his Government international legitimacy by dealing with it. Nonetheless, they said they had no objections to private citizens or members of Congress approaching the Iraqis to try to win the release of the two prisoners so long as they made clear that they were not envoys of the Administration.
On "Meet the Press," Mr. Christopher said, "No letter was delivered; no concessions were made." He added that Mr. Richardson "wasn't authorized to negotiate."
The state-run Iraqi News Agency sought to portray the release of the two Americans as a response to a request from Mr. Clinton. The agency said Mr. Richardson had conveyed an appeal from "President Clinton, the U.S. Congress and the American people."
Mr. Richardson, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, went to Burma in February 1994 to meet the opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who was then under house arrest but who was recently freed. In December 1994, he interrupted a trip to Seoul to go to North Korea to help negotiate the release of an American soldier and the body of another after their helicopter went down over North Korea.
When Mr. Richardson visited Hanoi a month ago, North Vietnamese officials gave him 100 pages of documents about missing American soldiers -- documents that the Administration later said were important.
To back up the Administration's assertions that it made no concessions to Iraq, a senior White House official said the Administration would continue to insist that Iraq comply with all the United Nations conditions for lifting sanctions, including eliminating all its weapons of mass destruction and accounting for missing Kuwaitis and stolen Kuwaiti military equipment.

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
The ambitious Republican campaign to undo major environmental programs reaches full force this week on several fronts in both the House and Senate.
One of this year's most significant environmental votes is set for Monday evening, when Republicans will try to cut off debate in the Senate so they can force through a measure to change the way regulatory decisions are made. The bill is sponsored by the majority leader, Senator Bob Dole. 
 In the House, the Appropriations Committee is scheduled to vote the next day on cutting spending by the Environmental Protection Agency by one-third, severely curtailing the agency's operations and flatly prohibiting it from enforcing central parts of several existing laws, including those on air and water pollution.
These are only two of the many lines of attack in a coordinated legislative effort that sees new developments almost every day. All over the Capitol, legislators are considering changes to the principal laws that govern mining, grazing, logging, toxic wastes, water quality, endangered species and pesticides, in each case considering proposals to make the laws more favorable to industry.
"It is clear that this is a concerted effort," said Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator, in an interview on Friday. "If they can't get it one place, they try it another place. This is about shutting us down, there can be no mistake."
Under the budget proposal, her agency's workforce would be cut by thousands of employees, while under the bill on regulations they would be confronted with vast new procedural requirements, putting the agency in a double bind.
Congressional Republicans, aided by many conservative Democrats, intend to limit sharply actions by the E.P.A., the Interior Department, the Energy Department and any other agency involved in environmental programs. Their strategy is four-fold:
*Rewriting the nation's basic environmental laws, a process that takes time but is gathering speed.
*Singling out particular regulations by passing narrowly focused provisions, sometimes attaching them to unrelated bills.
*Cutting the overall budgets of the environmental agencies, sometimes abolishing whole branches.
*Altering the procedures used to write regulations, putting more emphasis on cost-benefit analysis and opening new avenues for industries to appeal Federal rules in court.
Some of the proposals are breathtaking in their potential effect. For example, the Clean Water Act amendments passed by the House would drastically reduce Federal protection for wetlands. A new survey by regulatory agencies has found that in some states almost all regulated wetlands, where development is controlled for environmental reasons, would be removed from Federal jurisdiction.
The survey was conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers, the E.P.A., and the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service. They found that using the new definitions of wetlands, almost 98 percent of all wetlands in South Carolina would be removed from Federal jurisdiction. So would 90 percent of wetlands in Georgia, 94 percent in Alabama, 88 percent in North Carolina, 75 percent in Nebraska, 65 percent in South Dakota, 71 percent in Wyoming, and more than half in Florida.
But even though the Senate Environmental Committee is about to consider a wetlands provision like the one that the House has already approved, the bill's prospects are considered uncertain in the Senate. So Republicans are simultaneously trying to put a provision in the E.P.A. spending bill that prohibits it from enforcing the existing wetlands law. And they are pressing for anti-regulatory legislation requiring that property owners be compensated for declines in property values when wetlands are regulated.
The all-out attack has thrown the Clinton Administration into a pitched battle, if a defensive one. President Clinton, who in his first two years rarely threatened a veto and never employed one, now routinely says that he will veto environmental initiatives from the Congress.
In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Mr. Clinton strongly criticized the bill limiting Federal regulations. For the past week, the Administration has worked closely with Senate Democrats as they sought to highlight the problems they see in the bill.
"This Congress is willing to adopt a regulatory system that would let polluters delay and sometimes even control the rules that affect them," Mr. Clinton said.
Although the Republicans have made some concessions in the Senate bill -- for example, eliminating a provision that would have halted clean-up projects at hundreds of Superfund sites contaminated with toxic pollutants while further studies were conducted -- the core provisions of the bill are still unacceptable to the Administration, which has pledged to veto it unless there were fundamental changes. (Republicans agreed to delete the Superfund provisions partly because they planned to rewrite the law anyway, eliminating the liability of companies for past pollution.)
But before Senate Democrats can force major changes to the regulatory bill, they must survive a motion to cut off debate altogether. Democrats are confident of defeating the first such vote, scheduled for Monday, but there will be another on Tuesday night and they are not sure how long they can hold on to the necessary 41 votes to keep the debate alive.
The votes in the Senate are being watched closely as a significant political barometer, because House Republicans have demonstrated repeatedly that in alliance with a core of conservative Democrats they have the votes to approve far-reaching environmental changes.
Environmentalists and the Clinton Administration have pinned their main hopes on the Senate, where a minority can force modifications to more radical proposals by threatening to filibuster proposals after they emerge from the House.
Even a Presidential veto is of limited use when the Congress changes environmental laws by attaching riders to spending bills, like a rider to a spending bill for the current year that would suspend environmental statutes as they apply to logging on certain Federal lands. Having vetoed that bill once, Mr. Clinton has signaled that he will accept a compromise version, which is awaiting final clearance by the Senate, even though it still includes the logging provision.
The House proposal for the E.P.A. budget makes clear the power of spending bills to influence environmental policies.
The bill would cut the agency's annual budget to $4.9 billion in 1996, a reduction of $2.3 billion from this year's spending, proportionately the biggest reduction proposed for any major Federal agency.
"The agency has headed in the wrong direction, for the wrong reasons, and in a manner which can impose unnecessary costs on American industry," said the report of the Republican-dominated appropriations subcommittee that drafted the measure. "The agency needs to recognize that there are simply not enough available financial resources to 'fix' every perceived environmental problem."
The subcommittee removed money for the agency to enforce air pollution permits, to regulate toxic air pollution from oil refineries, to encourage tough state automobile inspections, to require accident prevention plans in the chemical industry, to limit pollution from cement kilns, to encourage state car-pooling plans, to gather and publish data on chemical use, to protect wetlands, to set water quality guidelines for the Great Lakes, to write new industrial water pollution regulations, to issue stormwater runoff rules, to control sewage overflows into rivers, and much more.
Some of the toughest fights involve issues that the Administration and Congress have been struggling over for more than two years: logging, grazing and mining on public lands. Votes could be cast in all three areas within the next several days.
A Senate committee is expected to move ahead on legislation on grazing that the Administration opposes because it focuses the management of 170 million acres of public land exclusively on livestock production, which environmental advocates contend damages the land if not carefully controlled. In testimony before the House last week, Mike Dombeck, director of the Bureau of Land Management, said the bill would "set back public rangeland management 50 years."
And in the House, there is likely to be one more vote on Monday on whether to give mining companies the right to buy Federal land containing valuable mineral deposits for low prices. A moratorium on these mining patents will expire unless Democrats win a vote in the House to extend it.


GRAPHIC: Congress is considering a wide range of proposals, pushed mainly by Republicans, to overhaul environmental statutes and lessen their impact on businesses and landowners. Here are some of the major laws under review:

 Regulatory Overhaul
 A broad relief bill that changes how regulations on health, safety and the environment are written, placing more emphasis on costs and opening important new avenues for challenging burdensome regulations in court. The House has already passed a similar bill. Pending in the Senate.

 Clean Water
 Proposed revision of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 would allow new waivers of anti-pollution requirements, remove most wetlands from Federal jurisdiction and allow states to continue to emphasize voluntary, not mandatory, controls on polluted runoff from farms and other sources. President Clinton has threatened to veto the version that passed the House in May. Senate action is pending.

 Endangered Species
 Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican, has introduced legislation that would try to limit Federal regulators' ability to declare endangered species' habitats off-limits to development and force the regulators to give greater consideration to human and economic costs when developing species protection plans. The House has taken no action.

 Grazing Fees
 Senator Pete V. Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, and Representative Wes Cooley, an Oregon Republican, have introduced bills that would institute a new formula for calculating grazing fees. The fees would be more modest than the increase proposed in February 1994 by the Administration, which would have gone to $4.28 per cow per month from $1.86. The White House withdrew the plan in December in the face of violent opposition and probable defeat.

 Pesticides
 On May 23, a House Agriculture subcommittee approved a bill to make it more difficult for the Environmental Protection Agency to bar certain pesticides. Both the regulatory overhaul bill being debated in the Senate and the E.P.A. budget being considered in the House would prohibit the agency from enforcing the Delaney clause which bans cancer-causing chemicals in processed food.

 Forest Management
 As part of the spending cuts for the current fiscal year that President Clinton vetoed, Congress approved provisions to require the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to undertake a 30-month program to promote the harvesting of salvage timber, a measure environmentalists said would lead to harm in forests. Mr. Clinton cited the provision as a reason why he vetoed the bill, but has agreed to sign a new version that also includes it. The compromise is held up by a procedural dispute in the Senate.

 Mining
 Seeking to preempt stricter proposals to update the antiquated 1872 mining law, members from Western states, with the support of industry, have proposed bills that would impose modest royalties, limit regulations and preserve the rights of miners to take ownership of their claims. A bill has been introduced in both the House and Senate.
 The Interior Department spending bill before the House would allow the sale of public lands, which had been suspended, to resume; a vote is expected this week.

 Superfund
 Republicans contemplate a major overhaul of the program that cleans up the nation's worst hazardous waste sites. They want to eliminate the provision that can hold private businesses responsible for cleaning up waste dumped before the Superfund law was enacted. No bills have yet been introduced.
 The regulatory bill being debated in the Senate, like the one that has passed the House, would have delayed hundreds of clean-up projects so that new studies could be conducted. But the Senate, in a concession to Democrats, dropped that provision from the bill. (pg. A11)

HEADLINE: World Bank Plans Small Loans to Poor

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 14

 BODY:
The World Bank is leading a drive to raise more than $200 million from international donors to provide small loans to help poor people start their own businesses in developing countries.
Donors met on June 27 and 28 at the World Bank in Washington and created a group to oversee the program, which would provide the money to local banks that specialize in loans, training and advice to help poor people achieve self-sufficiency. 
 The loans would be as small as $100 and would be repaid with modest interest in as little as a year, generating capital for other borrowers. The group estimates that the $200 million in cash and programs pledged so far could finance credit for a million prospective entrepreneurs a year.
No money is available yet, because the agreement is awaiting approval from governing boards of the donor institutions. Ismail Serageldin, the group's chairman and a vice president at the World Bank, said the group would meet again in January 1996 to allocate funds.
"The bank is the only one of the financial institutions that works on a global basis rather than a regional basis," Mr. Serageldin said in an telephone interview from Washington.
He said the program was "new to the extent that we've never done this before, but it's not an abandonment of our philosophy" of working through governments of developing countries.
The program will tap the successes that specialized local banks have experienced in making modest loans, often without collateral, to poor applicants in countries like Bangladesh, Kenya, Indonesia, the Dominican Republic and Colombia.
The most prominent of them, the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, had assisted two million cooperative members of the bank, most of them women with families, as of last year. The bank's loans, which average $100, help poor people support themselves by livestock and poultry-raising, handicrafts, shopkeeping or trading.
The World Bank's charter requires it to channel financial assistance through governments. The bank, which has been accused of not reaching those who most need help, described its new effort to help the poor more directly as "an important complement to the current efforts" in its development aid.
In addition to the World Bank, prospective donors include the United States Agency for International Development, the United Nations Development Program and Capital Development Fund, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the African and Asian Development Banks and the governments of Canada, France and the Netherlands.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 1995, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a group created to provide loans to the poor in developing countries omitted its name, and referred incompletely to the involvement of the World Bank. The new organization is the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest. It is nominally independent but will have its headquarters at the World Bank; the bank is its most prominent donor.

HEADLINE: New Brokerage Guidelines Are Approved

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Brokers must take greater care to insure that securities they sell to pension funds or other institutional customers are suitable, an industry group said in guidelines disclosed today.
The National Association of Securities Dealers's guidelines would require brokerage firms to determine whether customers have the expertise and resources to make informed investment decisions. 
 The new guidelines were approved at the agency's board meeting on Friday and announced today by the executive vice president for regulation, John Pinto. The guidelines require Securities and Exchange Commission approval, which could come this year.
"Our rules require members to have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommendation is suitable for the customer to whom it is made," Mr. Pinto said. The guidelines list questions firms should answer in dealings with institutional investors.
The proposals, which generated intense industry interest, gained a higher profile after the bankruptcy filing of Orange County, Calif., in December. County officials have accused their broker, Merrill Lynch & Company, of selling them unsuitable derivatives and other interest-rate-sensitive investments. Merrill Lynch strongly denies wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: Businesses Trim Inventories in May to Slowest Growth This Year

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
Stocks of unsold goods on company shelves grew at their slowest pace this year in May, the Commerce Department said today.
Economists said the more modest advance suggested that businesses -- which earlier this year began trimming output to rein in swelling stockpiles -- had begun to get a better handle on inventories. 
 "It looks like businesses are getting very close to eliminating the inventory overhang and may be preparing to step up production in the fourth quarter to meet current demand," said William Griggs, an economist with Griggs & Santow Inc.
Business inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted $956.21 billion, after a revised increase of 1 percent in April. That increase was previously reported as eight-tenths of 1 percent. The May advance was the smallest since a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in December 1994. The last time inventories fell was in March 1994.
Some economists worry that a combination of flagging demand, bulging inventories and production cuts could lead to a recession. Indeed, economists believe the economy showed little or no growth in the second quarter.
But recent information suggests a pickup may be imminent. On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales were up an estimated seven-tenths of 1 percent in June. The same day, the Federal Reserve said industrial production rose one-tenth of 1 percent in June, the first gain since January.
"The direction of inventory changes is critically dependent on growth in demand," said Sam Kahan of Fuji Securities Inc. "If demand picks up, we'll see an inventory-accumulation cycle starting. And if demand doesn't pick up, then we should see a continued decline in inventories."
In May, inventories increased at all stages of business activity. Retail inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Manufacturers' inventories increased six-tenths of 1 percent, and wholesalers' inventories grew one-tenth of 1 percent.
Business sales rose half a percent in May, the first rise in three months. Sales fell a revised three-tenths of 1 percent in April, which was previously reported at four-tenths of 1 percent.
The inventory-to-sales ratio -- a measure of how long it would take to sell existing stocks at the current pace -- fell to 1.41 month's worth in May from a revised 1.42 month's worth in April. The April ratio previously was reported as 1.41.

HEADLINE: Officials Shift Their Tactics On Housing

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Frustrated by high costs, community opposition and an inability to find public housing sites in white neighborhoods, city and Federal officials have all but abandoned an effort to build any new public housing in New York City.
Instead, the Federal Government will allow the city to spend $230 million earmarked for new housing to rehabilitate existing units. 
 The shift, which was announced yesterday by Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, will allow the New York City Housing Authority to upgrade at least 22,624 units of public housing. And just as critically, the maneuver allows the city to keep money it might have lost otherwise because the Housing Authority has not been able to find development sites that comply with Federal rules.
"This is an example of how cooperation between HUD and city and state officials can lead to creative uses of Federal housing funds," Mr. Cisneros said.
Although officials say the agreement will improve the living conditions of an estimated 57,000 residents of public housing, it effectively halts an expansion program by the Housing Authority that sought to add 2,500 units of new housing.
The authority now has more than 150,000 families on a waiting list for public housing. Officials say the list has grown by a third since the early 1970's because of the economic downturn in the late 1980's and the increasing homeless population.
The agreement was also a setback in the Government's effort to give more low-income families the opportunity to live in mixed-income neighborhoods where schools and services tend to be better than they are in poor neighborhoods.
In recent years, Federal regulations have discouraged the development of new housing projects in low-income and predominantly minority neighborhoods. And although the city's housing needs made New York City eligible for more than $250 million in development funds, officials said the city could not meet the Federal regulations. The rules require cities to expand the areas in which new public housing is built, a response to the fact that the worst public housing developments are often in racially segregated and economically isolated neighborhoods.
Because of the high cost of real estate in New York, officials said the Housing Authority was limited almost exclusively to property the city already owned. And most of the land the city owns consists of abandoned buildings in poor, minority neighborhoods.
But even with city-owned sites in appropriate neighborhoods, the Housing Authority often found the going rough. In one case, the authority battled the residents of a neighborhood on the Upper West Side for more than two years over plans to build 35 units on the site of a beloved community garden.
The Housing Authority went forward with the project, which is now being built, only after a carefully negotiated plan to move the garden.
Despite the city's pressing need for more affordable housing, housing advocates were largely supportive yesterday of Mr. Cisneros's plan.
"You have to make judgment calls on things like this," Frank P. Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, said. "But in general, from my perspective, it seems like a pretty good tradeoff. The Federal Government's site and neighborhood standards was a policy that had no friends, and New York was finding it impossible to meet them. This way the money will be used as a preservation tool," he said.
Officials said the money would be directed at public housing developments that are owned by the city and the state. Together they represent about 12 percent of the properties managed by the Housing Authority. The rest are owned by the Federal Government. And officials say the state and city have lagged far behind federally assisted developments in maintenance and repairs.
"This agreement complements and extends the city's ongoing efforts to revitalize housing and commercial development in distressed city neighborhoods," said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who joined Mr. Cisneros and other officials at City Hall for the announcement yesterday.
Ruben Franco, chairman of the Housing Authority, said that between 1983 and 1995, his agency received annual subsidies of about $284 for each unit of state-owned public housing that it manages and about $548 for each unit of city-owned housing. By contrast, HUD has contributed about $951 for each unit of federally owned public housing.
The Housing Authority is responsible for about 167,000 units of federally owned housing. It manages 13,904 state-owned units and 8,720 city-owned units.
Twenty-six state- and city-owned public housing developments in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx will benefit from the renovation funds. The Housing Authority expects to spend about $10,000 per unit on reconstruction, remodeling and repairs. The money will be spent primarily on upgrading plumbing, heating and electrical systems.
Once the work has been completed, 2,481 units will be transferred to the Federal inventory.

HEADLINE: Japan's Schools: Safe, Clean, Not Much Fun

SERIES: Main Street, Japan: In the Schools

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: OMIYA, Japan

 BODY:
It is the end of a school day, and Hiroyo Ikoma is laughing in the junior high bathroom, doing what 12-year-old girls in Japan normally do with their classmates at this time.
She's scrubbing the floors. 
 "Bathroom duty is the worst," Miss Ikoma complained lightly as she sprayed a hose in the direction of her partner's mop. "Of course, we're supposed to scrub the toilets, too, but we don't."
In Japanese schools, like this one in the verdant hills near Ise in central Japan, it is children rather than janitors who do the cleaning. From first grade through the senior year of high school, children spend 15 minutes to half an hour a day to take out the garbage and remove any graffiti that their buddies have unkindly left behind.
"Kids write graffiti in pencil," explained Miyuki Shibahara, a teacher at the junior high school in the nearby town of Nishiki, since they have to clean it themselves. "They don't have the stomach to write in pen."
As Americans dissatisfied with their own educational system look at alternatives, Japanese schools stand out in many ways. They offer discipline, orderly classes, safe corridors, rigorous training in basics like reading and mathematics, and practical lessons in physics like this one: For every action, like sticking gum under a desk, there must be an equal and less pleasant reaction, like removing it.
Several days around Omiya, a town of 5,700 set at the foot of hills covered with cedar forests, leave one with a feeling that schools here are not so much institutions of learning as of social engineering. Much of Japanese society, good and bad, seems rooted in school practices; if the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, the Japanese economic miracle was won in the (student-scrubbed) classrooms of Omiya and a thousand towns like it.
No diverse country can be captured in a single microcosm, but Omiya has rhythms and anxieties that resonate beyond the rice paddies that mark the edge of town. In Tokyo, nearly 200 miles away, people talk about who will be the next Prime Minister; in Omiya, folks chat about whether fireflies are visible and whether schoolgirls will be allowed to wear skirts that rise above their kneecaps.
These days the young people of Omiya (pronounced OH-mee-yuh) are eagerly anticipating the beginning of summer vacation on July 21, for if they sometimes seem angelic during the school year, perhaps it is only because they are too busy studying to get into trouble. Japanese schools provide a crime-free and drug-free environment, but sometimes they also risk providing a fun-free environment.
In Omiya, as in many Japanese towns, loudspeakers broadcast a message each evening during the school year: "Good boys and girls, it's almost 6 o'clock. Let's be careful of cars and go home now."
 
Regimentation
Lots of Rules;
Some Rebellion
Schools are social cookie-cutters in Japan, assembly lines that press students into the same shape and constantly remind them that they are members of a larger community. Rules are ubiquitous, and the atmosphere even at public schools is a bit like that of an American military academy.
Omiya Junior High, for instance, not only stipulates the uniform but also bans wristwatches, hair ribbons, curled hair, bleached hair, perfume, scented deodorant, earrings, makeup, money, non-standard school bags or anything else that could set one student apart from another. The school even bans colorful shoes, although footwear is left at the entrance and exchanged for identical slippers that students and teachers wear inside the school building.
Yet the student whom the others describe as the coolest kid in the junior high school, Kazuhiro Fujikura, has triumphed over the homogenization process -- and that is what makes him so kakkoii, or cool. That plus the fact that, although mediocre academically, he is a good baseball player and, as 14-year-old Asaha Shimomura gushed, "he's so cute."
Mr. Fujikura bored a hole in the heel of his slippers. This creates a distinctive "thump, thump" when he walks down the hall, sending pulses soaring among his admirers.
It is striking that for all their reputation for docility, students in Japan seem as rebellious in spirit as American youths. The difference is degree: they smoke cigarettes instead of marijuana, get into fistfights instead of knife fights, and mostly just get kissed instead of pregnant.
Mr. Fujikura rebelled by showing up at school earlier this year with brown hair. The teachers made him dye his hair black again, but he is unapologetic.
"It's interesting to have a funny hair style," he said as he sat on the floor in a corridor. "I'd love to have blond hair."
Students test the rules in many other ways. Skirts are supposed to extend to at least the kneecap, but girls pull them up at the waist to titillate with an inch or two of flesh above the knee.
One boy used a fragrant mousse in his hair -- only to have a teacher drag him by the hair to a faucet and wash it out.
A problem for students is that the school uniform requires white socks, and it is difficult to be kakkoii while wearing white socks. But white socks are regarded as acceptable if they are bunched up a bit above the ankle.
So to keep socks at this height, without having them drop further, students use Sock Touch, a special glue stick marketed for just this purpose. One girl demonstrated by applying Sock Touch to her bare calf and then putting on the sock at just the kakkoii height.
Schools in Japan freely set standards for students not only in the classroom but also at home and even during summer vacation. The idea is that schools not only teach students but also train them how to fit into society -- and remind them that the school is the source of their identity, and that they can no more escape it than they can flee their other family, the one at home.
Junior high schools bar students from stopping anywhere on their way home from school, even at a store to buy a drink. On vacation, they are not allowed to visit karaoke restaurants, coffee houses or arcades.
Romances are scrutinized as well. Some of the 154 students in Omiya Junior High School have boyfriends and girlfriends, and teachers try to keep an eye on them and make sure that no one gets hurt.
"If they're really going out, then we have to talk to the parents and make sure that they don't get in trouble," said Akio Murata, the principal.
Schools begin to inculcate the values that dominate Japanese society, like the emphasis on hierarchy. Beginning in junior high school, for instance, everyone is cast as senpai, or elder, or as kohai, or junior.
"If a senpai says 'morning,' we're supposed to answer politely with 'good morning,' " explained Naomi Yoshida, an eighth grader. "If a senpai says 'bye' in a casual way, we're supposed to say 'goodbye.' "
Miss Yoshida is addressed by older students as "Yoshida" or with the diminutive "Yoshida-chan." But to younger pupils she is "Yoshida-san," just as if she were an adult.
 
Work, Work, Work
School Pressure
Means Little Play
Mr. Fujikura, the coolest student, says he does no homework and does not go to a cram school, but that is unusual. Most Japanese students work far harder than their American counterparts.
For starters, there is a half-day of school two Saturdays a month, and summer vacation lasts only six weeks. During vacations, teachers assign homework, so that students will not forget what they have learned.
Shingo Horie, a 16-year-old junior, catches a train each morning at 7 A.M. for the hourlong ride to senior high school. Omiya has no senior high, so the 7 A.M. train is jammed with the town's young people commuting to several high schools in the larger city of Matsuzaka.
Mr. Horie dozes or does homework on the train, and then plays on the basketball team after school. He gets home at 8 P.M. and then does two or three hours of homework before going to bed.
"I have hardly any time to play with friends," he said.
Why do young people work so hard?
"We want to go to good universities and get good jobs," Mr. Horie said. "Then there's also pressure from parents and teachers."
Pressure from teachers includes the requirement that students take all school books home each night. The high school has lockers -- though nearly all students leave them unlocked, for theft is unknown -- but even so, students must lug all their books home as an inducement to use them.
The pressure from parents is even greater, particularly from the "education mama." These are devoted housewives whose mission in life is to wheedle and bully their children to spend every moment studying.
Some "education mamas" have been quoted in the Japanese press as saying they had sex with their own sons, so that the boys would not need to waste time dating girls. Soap operas and a movie have been made about such mother-son relationships.
The Japanese themselves refer to the teen years as "examination hell," a time of extraordinary pressure when a few failed exams can peg a student as a prospective lathe worker instead of a corporate executive. But Japanese youths also have intact families and sometimes a close-knit community of students to provide support, and in fact the suicide rate for Japanese teen-agers is well below that for Americans.
In any case, the academic pressure perhaps pays off, for Japanese students learn a lot. At Matsuzaka High School, where some of the best Omiya students go, all pupils learn calculus, chemistry and trigonometry.
International studies have consistently shown that Japanese students perform among the best in the world in math and science. A survey of 13-year-olds in 15 countries found that in math, Japanese ranked first and the United States ranked 11th.
Japan excels in these comparisons even though Government spending on education accounts for a smaller proportion of its gross national product than in the United States. The lower spending is partly attributable to Spartan physical conditions: not only do students do all the window-cleaning and floor-waxing themselves, but students are left to shiver in the winter in unheated classrooms.
 
Shortcomings
Some Learning
Omits Thinking
While the academic side of the ledger is generally very impressive, there are some subjects that Japanese schools teach miserably. One is English, and after visits to English classes in Omiya it is easy to see how Japanese manage to study the language for six or more years without learning to speak it.
English classes are taught almost entirely in Japanese, by a teacher lecturing at a blackboard with very little class participation. English words are memorized as if they were chemistry symbols.
Takeshi Niwa, the English teacher at Omiya Junior High School, notes that the all-important college entrance exams test only the students' knowledge of written English.
"If we taught a lot of spoken English, we would be behind on the grammar, and students would fail the entrance exam," Mr. Niwa said.
Another area that seems poorly taught, perhaps because it conflicts with the Japanese desire for consensus, is World War II. The young people in Omiya seem to learn almost nothing of the war and their country's role in it.
The Rape of Nanjing, in which Japanese soldiers killed tens of thousands of Chinese civilians, was a central event in the war and remains a major sticking point in relations between Japan and China. Yet of a dozen students interviewed only a few had even heard of it.
None knew that the massacre had happened in China, and one said he thought that it had occurred in the United States.
The textbooks edited by the Government suggest why students know so little about the war. The high school textbook simply records in one sentence that "Nanjing was occupied," without specifying that more people may have died in the course of that occupation than immediately after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
More broadly, while American students learn to question, Japanese students learn to obey. The network of rules seems intended partly to teach the same lesson that is central to Marine boot camp: that people must obey even rules that they think are silly, that they must subsume themselves to a larger community.
Students in Omiya are taught to memorize but perhaps not to think. Class participation is rare, and the ideal educational task is an equation for which there is only one precise answer.
Perhaps as a result, Japanese students do very well in international mathematics comparisons with questions that are purely equations. But in story problems, where students have to think as well as compute, they do not do nearly so well, though still much better than Americans.
Some scholars say Japan's educational system served admirably over the last century, in building an industrial society with a labor force skilled at bolting together cars or even engineering steadily smaller radios. But these scholars worry that "trained seals," as one Japanese critic described graduates, will lack the creativity to master the information age in the coming decades.
"I serious believe that if we do not change our educational system, it will be the ruin of our country," Morihiro Hosokawa, a former Prime Minister, warned in an essay this month. He complained that the system is so regimented and so focused on cramming information into young minds that it stifles the children.
Whatever the merits of these concerns, it would be too harsh to suggest that schools around Omiya are nothing more than bleak assembly lines of memorization.
In rules and rigidity, the overall atmosphere is a bit like that of parochial schools or especially private boarding schools in America or Britain earlier in this century. The system can be brutal for those who do not fit -- bullying is a big problem in Japanese schools, though not in Omiya -- but it also creates a tight sense of family for most of the students.
"I've never seen any system that is so family-oriented, where teachers and students are together as one," said Matthew Low, an American who lives near Omiya and has taught English for two years in Japanese high schools. "You see the kids crying at junior high school graduations, and then they hold reunions. Whoever heard of a junior high school in the U.S. having reunions?"

HEADLINE: New Conversion Spin: Military Contractor Really Rocks

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: WATERFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
Kevin Falvey is the archetype of cool. He spent 15 years playing keyboards for Joe Cocker. His boots are still pointy-toed and black, and he looks like a man who would curl up and die if forced to wear a tie. But his latest gig has a new twist: he gets to know Pentagon secrets.
At Sonalysts Studios, it's all in a day's work. Sonalysts (pronounced SAHN-ah-lists), a submarine technology company founded in the early 1970's to exploit the intricacies of zero-tolerance underwater acoustics, is trying to mix top secret with Top 40. 
 This is not your father's military-industrial complex. In the post-cold war economy, dramatic departures from the old ways of thinking are often the only way for a military contractor to insure survival. But it can make for a long, strange trip: Sonalysts, which is just down the road from the giant submarine construction bays of the Electric Boat shipyard, is staking its future on a bet that state-of-the-art video and sound production is essentially the same, whether for the United States Navy or for Time Warner.
Proving that point, however, means mixing together two very different cultures: ex-submariners and production artists. In the company's work force of 475 people, 150 are former submarine fleet officers, including 25 former commanders. Newer hires include graphic artists like Rena DeBortoli, known for her peasant dresses and dangling earrings, and Neil Goldberg, the former lead guitarist with the Annihilators, who is now an engineer-composer for the Sonalysts recording studio. Mr. Falvey is a vice president for music publishing and a talent scout for promising new bands.
This is a place where offices with encryption-coded door locks exist side by side with hospitality suites for visiting film producers, and where guests who must aver their status as United States citizens to enter one building can then proceed next door and listen to a blistering guitar riff.
"In my world, a problem can be you ran out of Perrier," said Mark Levinson, a Hollywood film producer who signed on with Sonalysts early this year as a vice president, and is now on the lookout for motion picture deals from his office in Los Angeles. "In their world, a problem can be that you sprung a leak at 300 feet below the surface and you all might die."
The company's first Hollywood exposure came several years ago when it helped produce sound effects for the submarine chase movie, "The Hunt for Red October." The first feature actually filmed here, "Killer," with Mr. Levinson as co-producer and starring James Woods, was completed last fall, but has yet to be released.
"They're very good at stabilizing the more hysterical aspects of show business," said Mr. Levinson, whose films include "Mystic Pizza," and "Teen Wolf." "It's just like in 'Apollo 13.' " They say, 'We're working the problem.' "
Experts who track the military industry say that trying to convert a technology from military to commercial use is tough, and that the entertainment industry is as cutthroat as they come. Still, a few have tried: a California-based company, Greystone Technology, which made flight simulators for pilot training, has shifted into software programs for virtual-reality computer games. A few other software producers are trying to get into computer animation for movies and television.
But can a company that thrived by silent running really make the leap into the world of glitz, glamour and self-promotion required by show business? Or is a dose of saltwater discipline just what the entertainment business needs?
"They know how to meet deadlines," said J. Keith Green, president and chief executive officer of Patient Education Media Inc., which is producing 75 medical videos at Sonalysts with Time Life. "You don't find that everywhere in my business."
One added spin to the Sonalysts culture clash is that the military part of the company is very much alive and well -- accounting for 75 percent of Sonalysts' $40 million in revenues last year -- with no walls between the two sides of the business. What that means is that nearly everyone must have security clearance because military work flows through even some of the most artistically minded new departments. Mr. Falvey, for example, needs a red "secret" level clearance badge because he sometimes works on soundtracks for military training films.
The company's finances are also all lumped together, a fact that gives Sonalysts' new music publishing unit the distinction of being almost certainly the only competitor in its field that is routinely audited by the Pentagon.
But employees say the growing artistic presence inside the company has also changed its military side. Ralph Guardiano, a senior executive vice president who came here after an earlier career in commercial television, said that when he arrived six years ago, the military training videos produced by Sonalysts were just about as boring as you would expect: talking heads, dull scripts, flat productions.
The first time he tried something slightly new, by "flipping" an electronic image on the screen so that it appeared to spin three-dimensionally -- an effect used all the time on television news -- the officers in charge were stunned, Mr. Guardiano said. Approval had to come down through a whole chain of command. All that has changed.
"Now, they've come to expect everything at a very high quality, with lots of flash and sizzle," he said. "Where we used to ask permission, now they're telling us that's how it needs to be."
David Hinkle, who retired from the Navy in 1973 as commander of nuclear submarine Pargo and founded Sonalysts with his wife, Muriel, shortly thereafter, said he thought the cultural strains would be much worse. He believes artists secretly want some discipline.
"They cope because, as we explain to them, it's fine and well to be an artist, but you also have to be a success at it," Mr. Hinkle said.
Mr. Hinkle has formulated a whole theory of corporate management based around what he calls the "matrix" system found in every submarine: a mix of iron-willed discipline and freedom all centered around the knowledge that every member of the crew has the power to sink the boat.
"When things go bad," he said, "you're in this little enclosed cylinder. Everybody can kill everybody else."
Apparently, not too many show business people talk, or think, like that.
"There's no doubt about it, when you go to Sonalysts, they're ex-submariners, and they walk and talk submarines," said Tony Bongiovi, owner of the Power Station, a New York recording studio that has produced the likes of Eric Clapton, Branford Marsalis and Pat Metheny. Mr. Bongiovi, whose second cousin is rocker Jon Bon Jovi, is a partner with Sonalysts in Power Station New England, the sound-recording studio scheduled to open here in late July.
Mr. Bongiovi said that a major rock band has signed to record its new album here this summer, launching the new studio. The name of the group and the dates and times of the session? Top secret, of course.

BYLINE: By Orrin G. Hatch and Jon Kyl; Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, is a member of the committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton has said that the efforts in Congress to change the way Federal regulations are made "would let polluters delay and sometimes even control the rules that affect them." Such scare tactics have clouded real debate about how to whittle away the excesses of bureaucracy without sacrificing public health and safety.
In the Senate, the proposal sponsored by Bob Dole, the majority leader, would simply make sure that agencies undertake cost-benefit and risk-assessment studies so that the regulations the Government adopts are sensible -- that they save lives and protect the environment without imposing needless costs on business and the consumer. 
 Yet critics insist the bill would lead to tainted meat in grocery stores and carcinogens in drinking water. To clear the air for real debate, several myths need to be debunked.
Opponents insist that the bill would roll back rules protecting the environment and public health and safety. Unlike a bill already passed by the House, the Senate plan wouldn't overturn anything. It would require agencies to study costs and benefits of existing rules, but they would not be forced to modify or repeal any regulation. That would be voluntary.
Critics say that requiring cost-benefit analyses would prevent agencies from enacting urgently needed regulations. But the bill allows for emergency exemptions from such studies if regulations are needed quickly to prevent serious health or safety problems or immediate damage to the environment. If there was a sudden outbreak of the bacteria E. coli in hamburger from a certain manufacturer, the agency could shut down the contaminated plant through an enforcement order; new rules could be worked out and studies done once the emergency was over.
The activities of Federal agencies would not, as some have said, grind to a halt. The bill would require agencies to review their rules, but only those imposing huge costs without significant benefits are in jeopardy. (An example is the Environmental Protection Agency's hazardous waste disposal ban, which prevents one premature death for every $4.2 billion spent.) Only regulations that have a projected long-term cost to the economy of more than $100 million would need to be reviewed, and agencies would be given 11 years to do so.
The bill allows anyone challenging a Federal rule in court to ask the judge to review any improperly done cost-benefit and risk-assessment studies. Opponents say this right would clog the courts with lawsuits. But every major regulation is already challenged in court. The cost and risk studies could not be separately challenged. Affected parties could only challenge an entire rule. Nor would the bill allow judges to second-guess the conclusions of agency experts, as critics claim; it would require judges to defer to the factual and technical findings of the agencies.
Critics say the bill would require a huge new bureaucracy to review the rules. This isn't true. Many agencies, including the E.P.A., already have employees who do such studies. Any new costs incurred in the review would be small compared with the sums saved by eliminating unneeded regulations.
Those who rail against regulatory reform claim the high ground on the environment, but they really want to protect the status quo. They don't consider that the economic burden of complying with Federal rules amounted to more than $600 billion last year. They are also ignoring popular opinion. Most Americans are tired of big government and want Congress to use some common sense.

Treasury Prices Take Fall; Trading Is Reported Quiet

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended sharply lower in quiet trading yesterday, dragged down by a growing view that the Federal Reserve will not cut short-term interest rates again this summer.
The market has been re-evaluating the prospects for a rate cut since a report on Friday showed surprising strength in retail sales for June. A separate report that day showed a gain in industrial production in June for the first time this year. Treasury prices fell on Friday. And a report yesterday on business inventories suggested that businesses might be preparing to step up production. 
 The decline yesterday was "a continuation of Friday's downward move," said Michael McGlone, a bond futures trader at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York. "The numbers on Friday basically knocked the whole idea of economic weakness and further Fed easings out."
A sharp rise in commodity prices, reviving fears of inflation picking up, also weighed on bonds yesterday. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds. Yesterday, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities jumped 2.5 points, to 233.98, led by sharp gains in grain prices.
"Anytime the C.R.B. index moves more than two points, that matters to me," Mr. McGlone said. "The C.R.B. rallying should heighten fears of inflation."
On July 6, the Federal Reserve said the threat of rampant inflation had receded enough for lower interest rates for the first time in nearly three years. The Fed cut its target for overnight bank loans a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent.
Yesterday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32 , to 1128/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.67 percent, from 6.60 percent on Friday. The price of the two-year note also fell, pushing its yield up to 5.74 percent, from 5.68 percent on Friday.
Still, yields on the 30-year bond are hovering near the 16-month low of 6.47 percent on June 22. Lower borrowing costs enticed the World Bank, RJR Nabisco Inc. and other companies to schedule debt sales of more than $2.5 billion for this week.
In the municipal market, bonds fell yesterday as investors shied away from bonds that mature in more than 15 years amid concern that proposals in Congress could reduce their tax benefits, traders said.
The Treasury, meanwhile, sold $13.2 billion in three-month bills and $13.2 billion in six-month bills at is regular weekly auction.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Cross-Border Taxes Complicate Trade

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Transfer pricing -- what multinational companies charge their affiliates for goods and services moving across national borders -- is creating growing problems in world trade, a leading accounting firm says in a study published today.
"Transfer pricing is the most important international tax issue facing multinationals today," Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, said after surveying 210 companies. 
 Five of six companies surveyed have had a transfer pricing dispute with the tax authorities, Ernst & Young said, and 49 percent are now engaged in a dispute.
Ernst & Young noted that around the world governments "have become increasingly aggressive in their endeavors to maximize and protect" their revenue base by challenging transfer prices.
As a hypothetical example of transfer pricing issues, consider a company with two subsidiaries. One subsidiary makes tennis shoes in Malaysia for $1 a pair. The other sells the shoes at shopping malls in the United States for $100 a pair. By having the American subsidiary pay $75 a pair to the Malaysian subsidiary the parent company effectively takes its profits in Malaysia, which has been known to declare tax holidays to attract companies, and not the United States.
The United States taxes significant profits of overseas subsidiaries unless they are invested or paid out as dividends. Thus, tax experts say, the law encourages these companies to invest in new plants overseas rather than repatriating profits or investing in American factories.
Ernst & Young found that inquiries by tax authorities about such arrangements affect behavior. Among the 165 surveyed companies that have had transfer prices questioned, half in setting other prices took into consideration the prospect of another inquiry, compared with 17 percent among companies that have not been challenged.
The survey covered companies with headquarters in eight countries -- Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States.
Transfer pricing issues have grown in tandem with world trade and budget deficits in the United States, Ernst & Young found.
A 1986 law expanded a decades-old requirement that multinationals base transfer prices on arm's-length dealings to include standards commensurate with economic benefit and industry practices, said Joy DeGrosky, an I.R.S. expert on the issue. She said a 1990 law directed the I.R.S. to ascertain that prices were not structured to reduce Government revenues unfairly.
Ernst & Young found that 93 percent of transfer pricing disputes involved management and administrative fees charged to subsidiaries. The big money, however, is in royalties and in transfers of finished goods, which were at issue in nearly half of the challenged transactions.
A key strategy to reduce such disputes is negotiated agreements between companies and tax authorities. "We will see a considerable increase in advance pricing agreements," said Richard V. L. Cooper, an economist and a report author.
But a leading international tax lawyer, Charles Bruce of Moore & Bruce in Washington, warned yesterday that advance pricing agreements carried significant risks.
One is that confidential information given to the I.R.S. may be used by the Government to negotiate a similar agreement with a competitor. "There is worry that competitors may calculate backward, from what the I.R.S. says is confidential information," Mr. Bruce said.
A second concern, he said, is that in litigation a company may be forced to disclose its advance pricing agreement to a competitor.

Rumors of Central Bank Buying Spur Dollar's Rise Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar surged against the Japanese yen yesterday as speculation grew that the United States and Japan would again act in concert to weaken the yen.
Since the Federal Reserve and the Japanese central bank surprised the market on July 7 by buying dollars for yen even as the dollar was starting to rise in value, traders have been wary of further interventions. 
 Indeed, traders said yesterday that the central bank, the Bank of Japan, had probably bought dollars at rates of 88.20 yen and above in Asian trading. The Japanese bank did not comment on its actions.
"It's becoming more and more apparent that the U.S. and Japan have some sort of agreement to push the dollar over 90 yen," said Steve Flanagan, currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York.
The dollar was also helped by a report by Japan that its trade surplus with the United States declined in June for the first time in eight months. The surplus gives Japanese exporters a hoard of dollars they sell for yen when bringing profits home.
The dollar rose as high as 89.20 yen yesterday, its highest level since March 31. In late New York trading, it was quoted at 89.04 yen, up from 87.83 yen on Friday. It also rose to 1.3969 German marks from 1.3903 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5947 from $1.5954.
Even after yesterday's gains, the dollar is still down 11 percent against the yen so far this year. The strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive, thwarting a revival of the economy.
The damaging effect of the strong yen showed up clearly in Japan's June trade report. Its surplus with the United States fell 11.5 percent, to $4.19 billion, compared with last June -- the biggest one-month drop since September 1993.
"The focus overnight was the decline in Japan's trade surplus," said Jeffrey Yu, senior currency dealer at Sanwa Bank in New York. "The market has used that as an impetus to buy dollars against the yen."
Also contributing to the dollar's gains yesterday was speculation about options purchases by big investors. The options would give them the right, though not the obligation, to purchase dollars and sell yen at a predetermined price. The options will rise in value if the dollar extends its gains against the yen. "There are some indications that U.S. hedge funds are buying call options for around 95 yen," Mr. Yu said.
The banks selling the options have in turn been buying dollars as a form of insurance, in case the option owners exercise their right.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aids Bolivia in Trampling Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Defying U.S. Threat, Bolivians Plant More Coca" (news article, July 11) fails to mention one critical aspect of the United States role in that country: its deep and direct involvement in human rights abuses. 
 Bolivia's rural counternarcotics forces -- created, funded and trained by the United States -- run roughshod in the Chapare, the country's primary coca-growing region, beating residents, stealing their money and goods, arbitrarily searching their homes at all hours day and night.
Bolivia's harsh antidrug law, passed under strong United States pressure, denies defendants any possibility of pretrial release and requires acquitted defendants to remain in prison until the court's decision is mandatorily reviewed by the Supreme Court, a process that can take years. Bolivians detained on drug-trafficking charges allege that agents of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration participate in abusive interrogations.
The effects of United States pressure were demonstrated in April, when the Bolivian Government, threatened by the United States with the loss of crucial economic support unless rigorous counternarcotics policies were implemented, declared a state of siege.
Although the Government ostensibly imposed the state of siege to end demonstrations by teachers' unions, it used the resulting suspension of certain constitutional rights to suppress peaceful opposition to antidrug actions demanded by the United States, arresting leaders of the coca growers' unions and sending them into internal exile.
Rather than ignoring these violations, the United States should use its influence on Bolivian counternarcotics policy to seek the elimination of laws and practices that trample fundamental rights, whatever their contribution to counternarcotics objectives.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus With U.S. Narrows

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 17

 BODY:
Japan's global trade surplus grew 2.1 percent in June, but the politically sensitive surplus with the United States narrowed for the first time in eight months, the Finance Ministry said today.
Economists said the increase in the overall surplus was caused largely by the yen's strength, which inflated the size of the dollar-denominated surplus. In yen terms, June's surplus declined 16.6 percent. The yen-denominated surplus has narrowed for seven consecutive months. 
 As the yen strengthens, it raises the dollar value of Japanese exports, resulting in a temporary widening of the dollar-denominated surplus, The stronger Japanese currency slows exports, eating into the surplus, by making them expensive overseas.
The Finance Ministry said the overall trade surplus rose to $11.57 billion in June from $11.34 billion in the month a year earlier. That was the second monthly increase.
Japanese exports rose 19 percent, to $40.05 billion, from $33.72 billion in June 1994. Shipments of machine tools more than doubled, while exports of computer chips increased 46.4 percent.
Imports increased 27 percent, to $28.48 billion from $22.39 billion. Imports of office equipment, mostly personal computers, contributed the most to the increase, up 79 percent.
In trade with the United States alone, Japan's June surplus shrank for the first time in eight months, contracting 11.5 percent from a year earlier, to $4.19 billion from $4.74 billion.

HEADLINE: Store Project In Queens Has Backing In Council

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Despite opposition from some neighborhood merchants, several members of a key City Council subcommittee yesterday said they would support plans to construct a 65,000-square-foot Pathmark supermarket in Springfield Gardens, Queens.
After hours of testimony in a packed Council chamber from residents, religious leaders, politicians and others, Council leaders said a vote on the issue would be put off until today. But the statements of support from several Council members suggested that it would be difficult for opponents to derail the plan, which has deeply divided the middle-class Queens community. 
 Neighborhood merchants have largely opposed the building of the new store, saying that the supermarket will drive them out of business, increase traffic and ruin economic development plans. But supporters of the supermarket, including many neighborhood residents, contend that a new store would provide an important shopping alternative for people who are forced to drive long distances to a large supermarket.
The City Council must vote on the plans because the area selected by Pathmark -- at the intersection of Springfield and Merrick Boulevards -- is not zoned for stores larger than 10,000 square feet.
Many members of the Council's subcommittee on Permits, Dispositions and Concessions, said they supported the project. But Juanita Watkins, a Democratic Council member who represents Springfield Gardens, has led the opposition toward the Pathmark store, saying it would be too disruptive a presence in a quiet neighborhood.
The subcommittee was scheduled to vote on the matter yesterday. But Council leaders said that a vote would likely come this morning, in part because the volume of people who showed up to testify extended the hearing well into the night. Some Council members also said Ms. Watkins was seeking to negotiate modifications in the plans for the store.
The issue of the Queens Pathmark store comes just two months after Pathmark Stores, in Woodbridge, N.J., faced bitter opposition by small merchants over its plans to build a large store in East Harlem, with the help of government financial incentives.
The plans for the East Harlem store were approved by the Manhattan Borough Board, but Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani still has not said whether he supports or opposes the 53,000-square-foot project. As a result, the supermarket that was planned at 125th Street and Third Avenue as an anchor in the revitalization of commerce in the blighted neighborhood remains stalled.
Pathmark officials say that the two episodes illustrate the difficulties of completing economic development projects in New York City.
"We certainly would have liked to see decisions made expeditiously," said Stanley Sorkin, vice president of public affairs for Pathmark. "People say time is money. And when you delay a decision, I think everyone loses something. The consumer, in terms of getting better shopping quality. And we are obviously disappointed that we do not have a new store under construction that would generate sales and profits for us."
Representative Floyd H. Flake, a Democrat whose Congressional district includes Springfield Gardens, said: "This project has the potential to anchor and invite further development by entities that have ignored communities like yours and mine."
He added that the project was expected to bring in 200 new jobs to the community, and that Pathmark had promised to hire 80 percent of those employees from the neighboring community.
But Monica Webster, a local resident, said she opposed the project because "it would bring increased traffic, strangers and crime to our community."
More than three-fourths of the 300 people in the Council chamber cheered the elected officials who testified in support of the project.
Still, there were efforts last night to make the plan more palatable to Ms. Watkins, who met with Pathmark officials and Councilwoman June M. Eisland, a Democrat who heads the Council's Land Use Committee, to determine what changes might be acceptable to all parties.
Among the considerations, staff members said, was a plan to scale the project down by 5,000 square feet and to reduce its hours of operation to something less than 24-hours a day. Also, there were discussions on having Pathmark create a fund to make money available to local merchants to make improvements on their stores.
Mr. Giuliani has supported the Queens Pathmark store, citing the fact that it did not include any major government subsidies. When asked about the difference between the Queens project and the Harlem proposal, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that "they raised totally separate issues."
Mr. Giuliani has been accused by many officials of being reluctant to take sides because supporting the project could alienate the many smaller store owners, many of them Hispanic, who are against it. They further cite the Mayor's declining numbers in opinion polls among Hispanic New Yorkers.

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on July 18 ("A Pathmark for Queens") stated that a Pathmark supermarket planned for East Harlem would be built on land donated by the city. In fact, the city would provide a mortgage allowing a nonprofit developer to buy the land over 25 years at a 1 percent interest rate.

HEADLINE: In House, Spending Bills Open Way to Make Policy

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
House Republicans took the unusual step today of using a spending bill to make policy, approving an appropriations measure that would revoke or substantially restrict nearly 20 environmental laws that have become anathema to big business.
The action was but one skirmish in a multifront budget battle in the House of Representatives and in committee, as House Republicans worked furiously to finish their 13 appropriations bills before the scheduled August recess. 
 But whatever final legislation emerges from the House, its decisions on the series of bills that provide financing for Government agencies are likely to be mediated by the much more moderate Republican majority in the Senate.
Ample evidence of that was seen today when Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, chairman of the Budget Committee, released the budget limits for the Senate Appropriations subcommittees.
The Senate plan included the same bottom line in budget authority as the House, $489.161 billion, but differed significantly on how to spend that sum.
Mr. Hatfield would allocate $1.6 billion more for labor, health and human services and education programs than the $61 billion that the House allowed. He would give $1.6 billion more to water and energy development, a traditional haven for legislators' pet projects or pork barrel spending, than the House's figure of $18.7 billion
Mr. Hatfield also cut deeper into spending for a half-dozen departments, including Defense, $1.4 billion; Commerce, $1.3 billion, and Transportation, $200 million, than the House.
Even as the House Appropriations Committee moved to rein in some environmental laws that big business has complained about most, the Senate balked at passing regulatory changes that big business has also championed, causing the majority leader, Bob Dole, to pull the bill off the floor.
The House committee, voting along party lines, approved a $61.7 billion allocation for veterans, housing, environmental and other programs for 1996, but included language that would withhold money for enforcement of statutes like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts until Congress had decided on reauthorizing them.
As the Appropriations Committee worked, the full House ended its debate and voted on an $11.96 billion allocation for the Interior Department. That bill, which passed 244 to 181, includes legislation that would reduce Federal financing next year by 40 percent for the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities and would halt all financing to the arts agency in two years.
That vote was followed immediately by the opening of a floor debate on the appropriations for the Treasury Department, the Postal Service and other agencies. That $23.2 billion measure is $322.7 million less than in 1995 and $1.8 billion less than the Administration had requested. There are $41 million in cuts from the Executive Office, including all money for a major advisory group, the Council of Economic Advisors, and the bill prohibits Federal employee health-insurance plans from covering abortions, except when a mother's life is at risk.
Before the House quits for the week on Friday, it is also scheduled to debate three other appropriations bills, for the Agriculture Department, for the Transportation Departments and for the Commerce, Justice and State Departments, as well as for the judiciary.
The bill on veterans, housing and environmental programs, which the committee approved today in a party-line vote, was one of the sparest appropriations bills to gain favor.
Although the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget sailed through virtually unscathed at $13.67 billion, $705 million less than its budget request, the bill overall cut discretionary spending by $8.3 billion from the 1995 allocation.
The major cuts are from the Environmental Protection Agency, which would receive $4.88 billion, 33 percent or $2.4 billion less than its current budget, and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which was allocated $19.1 billion, a 23 percent or $5.5 billion reduction.
"It is certainly the case that many of the agencies in this bill are unhappy," said Representative Jerry Lewis, Republican of California and chairman of the Subcommittee on the Veterans Affairs Department, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies. "But the House Appropriations Committee is clearly prepared to draw a line on spending."
The bill would close four agencies, for savings of $723 million, the subcommittee's part of the National Service Program, known as Americorp; the Community Development Financial Institutions, the Chemical Safety and Hazards Investigation Board and the Council on Environmental Quality.
The bill also has 17 riders or side language about the E.P.A., which Democrats complained went beyond the Appropriations Committee's traditional powers and intruded into realms usually reserved for authorizing committees.
The bill would allocate $1.5 billion for the water programs, but it has a rider that none of the money would be available unless Congress reauthorizes the Clean Water Act.
Another rider would exempt states from having to start centralized vehicle-emissions tests.
"The effect of this bill is that people in communities across this country will suffer," the E.P.A. administrator, Carol Browner, said in a telephone interview. "My ability to make sure that the quality of air that people breath and the water that they drink is good will be in question."

HEADLINE: In Hamptons, Lines in the Sand Ignite Tempers;
Oceanfront Residents Try to Restrict Public Access to Beaches

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, L.I.

 BODY:
From the edge of his beach towel on the sugar-soft sand of Fowler's Beach, Joseph Obermayer can see the rise of newly built ocean estates, which he scornfully derides as potato mansions inhabited by the territorial nouveau riche.
From the edge of eight-foot-high privet hedges bordering his oceanfront development on the old Henry Ford estate, Joern Brunvall can see Fowler's Beach bathers like Mr. Obermayer, gauche summer tourists who litter country roads with beer bottles and lines of unsightly cars. 
 These are the lines in the precious sand that divide wealthy oceanfront landowners from middle-class visitors in the Hamptons, where only a handful of beaches are open to the public. As the East End's potato lands have sprouted houses, each new enclave of owners has sought bans on parking along the access roads to the beaches. They have been so effective that the metal No Parking signs are as ubiquitous as service entrances to the local estates.
Of course, the right-of-way along the beach below the high-water mark has been guaranteed to the public since Colonial days by a law known as the public trust doctrine. The enduring question is: Can you get there?
"It's a question of a natural conflict between people who choose to live on the ocean and people who don't and want to use it," said William W. Esseks, a lawyer who has represented several Hamptons property owners who have won parking restrictions along beach access roads. "You should not park on the roads because they're trying to have a certain ambiance in the town: views across pastoral fields without cars and trucks."
On the South Fork of eastern Long Island, beach territory is so prized that earlier this summer in Sagaponack, a tourist came to blows with the young daughter of a corporate executive who the police said had demanded the removal from "our property" of a car parked on a public road.
Many of these fierce sand struggles are territorial fights pitting the Upper East Side, wealthy Manhattan newcomers who value the privacy of their second homes, on the beachfront, against middle-class New York City beachgoers.
Along the coast of Northeastern states, this debate is acute, as rural properties edging the Atlantic are subdivided into lots and expensive homes. "Potato mansions" is the term that critics like Mr. Obermayer use for the airy, contemporary houses that have replaced potatoes along the two-lane roads leading to the beaches.
"The reason why this is a big issue in the Northeast is because beach towns that used to be strictly tourist towns are becoming residential, and in becoming residential, the people who live there no longer want tourist space," said Jack Samuels, a professor of recreation and tourism at Montclair State University in New Jersey. "They want to have privacy. They don't see the fact that tourism is sustaining the local economy."
All of these forces have come into play on the sandy shores of places like Peter's Pond in Sagaponack and Fowler's Beach in Southampton, which has had a reputation for almost two decades as the East End's oldest gay beach, drawing bronzed sunbathers from all over Long Island and Manhattan.
Both beaches lack amenities, except the cobalt blue of the Atlantic and wind-scoured stretches of sand. There are no garbage cans, lifeguards or toilets. There are also no requirements for beach passes, and tourists are accustomed to parking along the two-lane public roads that lead to the beaches.
Residents of the Fordune development, 44 lots and homes that have been carved from the old Henry Ford estate, wanted to achieve a country look along the country road that borders their development. Last summer, the development's association moved successfully to ban the very vehicles that made Ford rich. As a result, up went a string of No Parking signs on the road by the development's entrance.
In turn, the development's Fowler Street neighbor, a farm family that has worked the land for generations, sought a parking ban on the road near their large Colonial-style house. The Village of Southampton had put up No Parking signs along that road, but the beachgoers had draped the signs with paper bags, contending that the village lacked the authority to impose those restrictions. They argued that only the Town of Southampton had that right.
When frequent beach visitors like Steven Welch and Carol Hageman realized how quickly parking spots were vanishing, they formed a group, walked beach blanket to blanket in search of donations and hired a $150-an-hour lawyer to reclaim lost spaces. Many supporters were gay men with homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons who could afford to write a check, but not the time to fight Town Hall.
"They want the beach to themselves and they don't want outsiders coming there," said John Rogers, 51, an interior designer with residences in Southampton and the Upper East Side, who has been active in the fight to reclaim parking spaces on Fowler's Beach. "The people at Fordune have multimillion-dollar homes and they don't want to go through the beach and stumble over boys and girls frolicking in the sand."
"It's their delicate sense of privilege and sense of privacy," said Mr. Welch, 38, a Southampton resident and a chef by trade.
On the other side of the road, the oceanfront residents give several reasons for concern about parked cars: safety, esthetics, litter, unsanitary beach conditions, public urination.
Margaret H. Fowler, whose in-laws have farmed the land along Fowler's Street for generations, said the crush of traffic along the road was "an accident waiting to happen." She said the parking spaces should not have been eliminated by the Fordune development.
But her neighbors there will not accept the cars. "We pay high taxes and high costs and therefore we are trying to maintain the pristine areas that we live in," said Clifford V. Brokaw 3d, 67, president of the Fordune Association and a retired investment banker with residences in Southampton and the Upper East Side.
The association's vice president, Joern Brunvall, a former Upper East Side resident who now lives year round in Southampton, said some day trippers crashed into the development's privet hedges and trampled the grass planted by the homeowners. "I don't think class is an issue at all in this," he said. "It's parking that's an issue. It seems like the people from the city are trying to overrun us here."
That is basically the same argument of Daniel Shedrick, the chief executive officer of the KMS Group Ltd. in Connecticut, who owns 64 acres of potato fields fronting Peter's Pond beach in Sagaponack. Earlier this summer, Mr. Shedrick drew his line in the gray sand of Peter's Pond with a full-page advertisement that appeared in the Southampton Press.
"Not Murder," declared the headline in bold block letters. "Just a broken nose," added the smaller print of his complaint, about beach thugs who had attacked his daughter and tourists who had tramped along his property to "dump their garbage, destroy private property and enjoy the sun." Not to mention the bacchanalian beach parties of "indescribable proportions."
In June, Mr. Shedrick sued the Southampton Town Board for $5 million in damages, asserting that his property had lost value because the board had failed to enforce parking restrictions along the beach-access road that runs past his property.
Mr. Shedrick has proposed the banning of parking on the road at all times, along with the posting of an attendant in a guard house to monitor activity and break the "criminal, Pavlovian" habits of beachgoers.
In his advertisement, Mr. Shedrick railed against "nine unidentified male teen-agers" who assaulted his daughter, Elizabeth Shedrick, a 25-year-old Fordham University graduate student.
But the Southampton police said they had investigated the incident involving Ms. Shedrick and had concluded that only two teen-age boys had been involved in the dispute. One arrest was made last week in connection with the fight, and Ms. Shedrick has also filed a harassment complaint against a 17-year-old East Hampton resident who the police said was involved in the incident.
Detective Doreen Isola of Southampton said a fight apparently erupted as a beach party broke up and people headed toward their cars along the road. As Ms. Shedrick tried to drive around a parked car, somebody made a comment.
"She told them to leave and that that was her property," the detective said. "And the argument escalated from there."

HEADLINE: Pataki Walks Fine Line on Rail Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 18

 BODY:
In his quiet efforts to resolve the Metro-North Commuter Railroad contract dispute, Gov. George E. Pataki is struggling to balance two conflicting mind-sets within his administration: those who want him to take a hard line against labor and those who believe he must work with the unions to avoid a disruptive strike.
To some of his advisers, the talks between Metro-North's 17 unions and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority give the Republican Governor a sterling opportunity to show that he can be tough with organized labor as part of his effort to hold down government costs. 
 But today, a spokesman for organized labor said that he had seen no evidence that the Governor was even involved. Indeed, Mr. Pataki has made few public comments about the negotiations, neither attacking labor nor vigorously endorsing management's positions. While negotiations were going on, Mr. Pataki spent the afternoon viewing storm damage in the Adirondacks.
Mr. Pataki's low-key role has arisen partly because some advisers have counseled that a harsh stand against the unions could result in a strike that would disrupt the region's economy and the lives of 100,000 commuters who live in the northern suburbs, which strongly supported the Governor in last year's election.
Moreover, some of Mr. Pataki's aides argue that taking an aggressive position against the unions could antagonize blue-collar workers who supported Mr. Pataki last year and undermine the Republican Party's efforts to expand its base among working-class voters in the New York City region.
Mr. Pataki does not sit at the negotiating table, but wields immense influence over the M.T.A. through his appointments to its board. He has taken a two-pronged approach to influencing the talks.
On the one hand, he has studiously avoided making inflammatory comments about the unions. He has sought to cast himself as a moderate voice interested in a settlement, not brinkmanship. He has been in daily contact with M.T.A. officials, while the State Labor Commissioner, John E. Sweeney, has been in close touch with union officials.
But in the mold of his political hero, Theodore Roosevelt, the Governor has also threatened to use what many of his aides consider the biggest stick available to influence the unions: a change in Federal labor laws that would effectively make it impossible for Metro-North's unions to strike.
To do that would require the passage of legislation by the Republican-controlled Congress. Mr. Pataki's aides think that would happen quickly if the Metro-North unions did go on strike. Congressional hearings on this legislation had been scheduled for Wednesday, and Mr. Pataki had planned to testify. But those hearings have been postponed, partly at Mr. Pataki's urging because of progress in the talks.
In an interview today, Mr. Pataki made it clear that he wants to resolve the dispute without a strike. "We're not looking for a victory for one side or the other," he said. "We're looking for a resolution that is fair and in the best interests of all of us."
But the Governor made clear that if the unions did not agree to work-rule changes that could save the M.T.A. millions of dollars, a strike might be inevitable.
"I don't intend to micro-manage or dictate to the negotiators how it should go," he said. "But I think this is an important long-term question for the state. If it cannot be resolved, the unions have a right to strike and Metro-North would have an obligation to not sign off on a pact that they cannot afford."
Mr. Pataki also emphasized that he was intent on avoiding what he considers the mistakes of his Democratic predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, in his handling of a similar labor dispute last year between the Long Island Rail Road's unions and the M.T.A.
The dispute came during the heat of last year's gubernatorial campaign, and a prolonged strike threatened to make life miserable for thousands of people in a region politically vital to Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Cuomo leaped vigorously into the talks, making repeated calls to both labor leaders and M.T.A. negotiators. He sent his own representative to the bargaining table. He canceled many public appearances to monitor the negotiations.
As a strike loomed, Mr. Cuomo took a hard line against labor, saying the M.T.A. should not "use taxpayer dollars to bribe the union." But five days later, after the strike had begun and he had been sharply criticized by labor leaders, Mr. Cuomo pressured the M.T.A. to accept a settlement that acceded to many of the unions' demands.
Mr. Pataki said that Mr. Cuomo's role in those talks was inappropriate and political and that he would avoid micro-managing the current talks so as not to undermine the authority of the M.T.A. chairman, E. Virgil Conway, who is his appointee.
"We are not going to repeat that mistake," he said of Mr. Cuomo's involvement. "We put together a very sound team that is going to look not for a short-term political gain but for the long-term best interests of the entire region."

HEADLINE: Regents Prepare for Storm on Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 18

 BODY:
With an agenda of hotly contested proposals to eliminate affirmative-action policies at the University of California, the meeting of the university's governing board on Thursday will be a proving ground for a central social issue of the decade.
Gov. Pete Wilson, using the dismantling of affirmative action as a cornerstone of his Republican Presidential bid, has announced he will exercise his right for the first time in years to preside over the meeting. Jesse Jackson is coming to town on Wednesday to lead protests. And the White House has announced that President Clinton will deliver an important address on the subject on Wednesday. The 26 regents themselves appear to be sharply divided. 
 At the center of the tempest is a close Wilson ally on the board, Ward Connerly, 56, a wealthy, black Sacramento housing developer who says affirmative action has outlived its usefulness.
In January, after discussing the matter extensively with Governor Wilson, Mr. Connerly proposed that his fellow regents eliminate the use of race, sex, religion, color or national origin as a criterion for admission to the university and for hiring and contracting. Part of Mr. Connerly's proposal would ask the university administration and the faculty senate to propose supplemental criteria that would let admissions officers consider socioeconomic status.
Since he made his proposal, Mr. Connerly has been under an intense spotlight. He has received praise for his courage in taking an unpopular position, but because he is black, some blacks have denounced him as a turncoat, an Uncle Tom and worse.
An earnest, intensely expressive Mr. Connerly leaned forward repeatedly to emphasize his points when interviewed in a Sacramento restaurant on Monday.
A friend of the Governor for more than 25 years, he said his proposal was incubated in a conversation with Mr. Wilson on Thanksgiving Day. The Governor had called to extend his good wishes, but Mr. Connerly began a discussion about his discomfort with the university's affirmative-action policies.
"I told him," Mr. Connerly said, "I'm all for the outreach programs and the efforts to break up the old-boys network that prevents equal access to participate in university life. I said I thought it was wrong of the university to sign a multimillion-dollar contract with the same auditor year after year because it would be too expensive and take too much time to open it up to bidding. That's wrong.
"But, I also said I was troubled by the affirmative-action policies that impose racial preferences. They are exclusionary to some, and that's not fair.
"And what do those race-based policies say to black kids? They say, just do enough to get by. They undermine hard work and I want to oppose them."
Mr. Connerly said the Governor encouraged him to proceed with the proposal, which parallels Mr. Wilson's own initiatives in state hiring and contracting.
"So I started talking to individual regents, asking them, 'Have you thought this through?' " Mr. Connerly continued. "Only about 3 of the 26 regents agreed with me. The Governor then began talking to them. Today, because of his efforts, we have about 14 or 15 who agree with us. That should be enough to adopt the resolutions but you've got to get them there to vote and they have to find the courage to go through with it."
Asked how he reacted to blacks who denounced him as a traitor to his race, Mr. Connerly said: "When I was growing up, my friends were white, Hispanic and black. I'm one of the most cosmopolitan people you'll ever meet. Now, some of the whites who associated with me were called nigger lovers. But it didn't deter them. They felt our relationship was more important than letting bigots dictate who their friends would be. It's the same here. If I'm opposed by people with infantile views, should I give up? Certainly not."
Mr. Connerly also said that he had once been staunchly in favor of affirmative-action programs, but that now he believed that they were harmful.
"I think there were compelling reasons in 1960 to change the culture of our country," he said, "but today we're not in an institutionally racist society as we were in 1965."
The policy, he said, "devalues the black person who gets up every morning and works and excels."
Asked what might be the impact on enrollment of his resolution if adopted, Mr. Connerly said: "It's impossible to say until the supplemental criteria, socioeconomic or whatever, are determined and approved by the Board of Regents. We shouldn't make policy based on how many blacks or Hispanics get admitted. That's what got us into this trouble in the first place."
In 1968, when Mr. Wilson was a member of the state Legislature, he named Mr. Connerly a consultant for the state Housing Committee. In 1992, Governor Wilson appointed him to the California Competitiveness Committee and then to a 12-year term as a regent.
Mr. Wilson himself began his Presidential bid soon after endorsing a statewide initiative that would overturn laws taking ethnicity and sex into consideration for hiring and contracts. Aides say Governor Wilson's opposition to admissions practices granting preferences based on race and sex is one of the central positions in his Presidential campaign, and he hopes that the meeting will let him present his ideas to a national audience.
Speaking to a group of business leaders in Los Angeles today, Mr. Wilson restated his view that affirmative-action programs result in reverse discrimination and should be dismantled.
Another possible Presidential contender, Mr. Jackson, has threatened that he and his supporters will practice civil disobedience if not granted time to defend the programs. The regents have placed Mr. Jackson's name on a list of 17 public officials and guests who will be allowed to speak for more than the usual three minutes on Thursday.
The sprawling nine-campus university, which now enrolls 151,000 students, is also caught up in the events. Faculty and student-action groups have bombarded the regents with mail and petitions most of them supporting affirmative action.
Jack Peltason, president of the University of California, will address the regents asking them to preserve the affirmative-action policies. He declared in a letter to the regents last month that abandoning racial preferences would be a grave mistake.
He also persuaded the regents to postpone consideration of a change in policy until this month after the Legislature had appropriated money for the university system, fearing that if the regents acted on the issue sooner, the Legislature might seek to punish the university by cutting its budget.
The session will open on Wednesday afternoon when a group of about a dozen regents will meet with 200 students.
Governor Wilson will address the meeting on Thursday in a departure from the usual practice of allowing others to speak first. Aides said the Governor wished to set the tone of the meeting.
After the 17 officials and guests have spoken, about 30 out of 150 names will be drawn out of a hat to randomly select other speakers.
"The format will be something like a Phil Donahue show," said Terry Colvin, a spokesman for the University of California.
Governor Wilson contends that as few as 40 percent of all students are admitted to state-run universities in California strictly on the basis of their academic achievement.

Chart: "Proposals: Grappling With Affirmative Action"
Proposals before the California Board of Regents on whether to dismantle, modify or retain the university's affirmative-action programs.
DISMANTLE PROGRAM: Ward Connerly, a Sacramento businessman, proposes that as of Jan. 1, 1997, the university eliminate "race, religion, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin as criteria for admission" or for hiring or contracts. He modified his proposals last month to allow for the consideration of supplemental criteria like social or economic discrimination.
ELIMINATE GROUP PREFERENCES: David Flinn, a regent whose term ended in June, has proposed a compromise that allows consideration of race and sex on an individual basis, and not give preference in hiring or admission based on membership in a racial group. He would consider an applicant's education, family environment, economic hardship, physical disability and racial, sexual or religious discrimination.
MAINTAIN RACE-BASED PREFERENCE: The student member of the Board of Regents, Ed Gomez, a graduate student in history at the Riverside campus, will ask on behalf of the Student Association to keep current policies, and expand preparatory programs and hiring.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Off For 4th Day

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower yesterday after a report showed a strong gain in retail sales.
The decline was the fourth consecutive decline in prices as traders continued to assess the direction of the economy and interest rates. Recent data have shaken the market's view of a slowing economy and cast doubt on the prospects for another move by the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates. 
 A report yesterday provided further evidence of a rebound in consumer spending. The Johnson Redbook service said retail sales rose 1.1 percent in the first two weeks of July. Sales were also running 8 percent above the pace recorded a year ago, the service said. Johnson Redbook's weekly reports are watched by many traders and investors because they are considered harbingers of the Government's own monthly report on retail sales.
"The economy is not dead," said Joseph Bench, who manages $450 million of bonds at New Castle Advisers in White Plains. Now, "bond yields are more likely" to climb to 7 percent during the next four weeks, he said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 17/32 , to 1101/32 , pushing its yield up to 6.76 percent, from 6.67 percent on Monday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.
The yield on the two-year note, which mirrors expectations for changes in Fed monetary policies, rose yesterday to 5.80 percent from 5.74 percent. On July 6, when the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, the yield on the two-year note fell nearly 26 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
If traders conclude "the Fed is done easing, the two-year could move 35 basis points in a real hurry," said Cary Leahey, a money-market economist at Lehman Brothers Inc.. Two-year notes could yield at least 6.5 percent if the Fed is leaving its overnight target where it is, he said.
Recent data suggest the "economy is on the mend," said Steven Wood, director of financial markets research at Bank of America in San Francisco. "Many people would assume that implies the Fed's not going to lower rates again," he said.
The market's attention will be focused today on Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, as he appears before a House Banking subcommittee for his semiannual testimony on the state of the economy and monetary policy.
Some traders said bonds could rise after testimony concerning the rate cut.
"In the context of talking about the rate cut, you have to say bullish things," said Tony Crescenzi, head of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company. "You can't say, 'I cut rates because growth and inflation are speeding up.' "
Mr. Greenspan may also "hold up the possibility that the cut was the first of a series," said Ken Sullivan, a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. "He's more likely to get hammered for why he didn't cut more than why he cut in the first place," he said.
Earlier yesterday, bonds recovered from an overnight decline as securities firms underwriting $1.5 billion of World Bank bonds bought back Treasury securities sold earlier as insurance against losses on the new bonds.
The World Bank, the international development agency, sold 10-year global bonds through firms led by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Lehman Brothers International (Europe).
Securities firms that underwrite corporate bonds often sell borrowed Treasuries, in so-called short sales, to protect against losses until the new debt is sold.

HEADLINE: Twist a Dial and Cab Fare Soars, Police Say

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
Thousands of people who rode taxis in New York City in recent months may have noticed that the drivers fiddled a lot with their CB radios. What they didn't notice, the police said yesterday, was that sometimes as the radios got louder, the fares got higher.
The police arrested Mohammad I. Ahmed, a cab driver, yesterday and said they believe that in the last six months, he has rigged the meters in at least 500 yellow cabs, including his own, to overcharge passengers. 
 Deputy Inspector Vincent Kennedy said Mr. Ahmed charged fellow cabbies $75 to $100 to install a device called a zapper, consisting of a pin and two wires. One wire was attached to a wheel and another to a CB radio -- separate from the dispatcher radio -- and the meter reading increased along with the radio volume.
"The price went right up," said Inspector Kennedy, who is in charge of the taxi enforcement unit, which was formed in April when the police took over enforcement of taxi rules from the Taxi and Limousine Commission. "There are a lot of people who are getting ripped off."
So far, Mr. Ahmed has been charged with altering three taximeters, but the police made it clear that they think he is responsible for far more cases of meter tampering and that he was clever enough to swindle riders familiar with New York as well as unwary tourists.
Mr. Ahmed, the police said, would approach cabbies waiting for fares in the early morning in front of the New York Hilton on West 51st Street and Avenue of the Americas and offer his services. He could install a "zapper" in less than 20 minutes and worked on about 10 cabs in a typical day, the police said. The rigged meters charged passengers up to twice the legal fare of 25 cents per one-fifth of a mile, the police said.
Inspector Kennedy said that Mr. Ahmed, 39, of 710 Beverly Road in Flatbush, Brooklyn, was arrested at 5:45 A.M. yesterday after he was videotaped tampering with two meters. He was charged with possession of forged instruments and was given a summons.
"We've taken a major meter tamperer off the streets," Leonard Kaplan, First Deputy Commissioner of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said.
Although city officials suspected that Mr. Ahmed was fixing the meters, they said they could not move to arrest him without the help of one of his colleagues, who could provide them with details. Then, 10 days ago, a driver approached the police and helped them set up a sting to nab Mr. Ahmed, Mr. Kaplan said. Mr. Ahmed looked stunned and did not utter a word when officers clamped handcuffs on his wrists.
Police and taxi officials could not estimate how much Mr. Ahmed's scheme had cost riders altogether.
In recent years, the economics of driving a cab has suffered along with the decline in the region's economy, making it more difficult for drivers to earn a living. Last year, the Taxi and Limousine Commission rejected the industry's call for what would have been the first fare increase since January 1990, arguing that drivers would not benefit since taxi owners share most of the profits.
"I think it's just a case of water seeking its own level," Michael Higgins, publisher of Taxi Talk newspaper, said. "Unfortunately, some guys are not making that and some guys are taking the low road into putting more money into their pockets."
For years, taxi officials have grappled with ways to make meters tamper proof or resistant. The latest measure was to install a plastic cover on the meter.
So far this year, the taxi commission has received 1,026 complaints of rigged meters, Eugene Rodriguez, an agency spokesman, said, and officials believe that many of the complaints in recent months involved cabs that Mr. Ahmed had worked on. There were 1,093 complaints lodged all of last year.
Customers who have been the victims of overcharging by a cabbie welcomed the news of an arrest.
In March, Isabel Delgado, a dental assistant, was heading home to Elmhurst, Queens, after a flight from Kennedy International airport. About four blocks from her home, the fare, which normally cost her $16, was already at $20. Ms. Delgado, who only had $20 with her, said she had to leave the cab and walk the rest of the way home, her luggage in tow.
She said the driver began to curse her in Punjabi, but Ms. Delgado understood everything he said because her husband, a cab driver, is from India.
"I was so upset," Ms. Delgado, who took the driver to court, said. Last month a judge ordered the driver to pay a $100 fine.
"I wanted to make a difference," she said. "Next time, he's going to think twice before he does something like that."
Many taxi drivers declined to discuss Mr. Ahmed's arrest yesterday, but a few conceded that meter tampering is widespread. They also said, however, that the Police Department's takeover of the taxi and limousine enforcement had spurred some drivers to disconnect their devices.
"Whoever had a fast meter fixed it properly," Balvinder Singh, sitting behind the wheel of his cab in Chinatown, said. "People are scared of the police."
Officials said that Mr. Ahmed also offered his customers a way to avoid detection before the required inspections three times a year. For an additional fee of $25 to $40, they said, he would temporarily disconnect the device to thwart taxi inspectors.
While Mr. Ahmed's specialty was the zapper connected to a radio, officials said they had in the past seen similar devices hooked up to horns or even the window crank of a cab.
Mr. Ahmed could not be reached for comment last night. A man who answered the telephone at Mr. Ahmed's residence in the evening refused to discuss the case, saying he did not know the details of the arrest.
Earlier, sitting in Mr. Ahmed's living room, his oldest daughter, Sonia Ahmed, 17, told a reporter that her father was a talented mechanic who knew how to fix everything.
Mr. Ahmed emigrated from Pakistan in 1981 and first got work in gas stations. But after seven years and one too many robberies, he began driving a cab, his daughter said.
About a year ago, Mr. Ahmed brought his own $175,000 medallion, Mr. Kaplan of the Taxi and Limousine Commission said.

Diagram: "Taken, for a Ride"
 The police say that Mohammad I. Ahmed wired his cab with a device known as a "zapper." These wires and plugs allowed him to trip the meter when he adjusted the volume on his CB radio, they say.

HEADLINE: Orange County Financial Plan Is Devised

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., July 18

 BODY:
Orange County's financial advisers today recommended a new recovery plan designed to lift this county from bankruptcy without new taxes, but with the help of the California Legislature.
The plan calls for the county to cover some $2 billion in bankruptcy-related debts by diverting taxes -- primarily property and sales taxes -- already paid by residents. If approved by the county's Board of Supervisors, the plan would be submitted to the Legislature in mid-August. Under California law, such tax diversions require legislative action. 
 With the defeat last month of a half-cent increase in the county sales tax, Orange County has been groping for ways to repay debts incurred after a failed investment scheme last year forced this wealthy county to file for bankrtupcy. The sales tax measure took such a drubbing, and the county is so strong an anti-tax stronghold, that financial experts and local politicians have since recognized that any new recovery plan would have to be based more on tax-shifting than tax-raising.
Until now, the county's resistance to proposed solutions to its financial crisis had left its five-member Board of Supervisors facing options that seemed either unrealistic or politically unpalatable. After the board tried last week to rein in William J. Popejoy, the independent-minded banker who had served for five months as Orange County's unpaid chief executive, Mr. Popejoy resigned, calling the government "dysfunctional." On Friday the board chose Jan M. Mittermeier, director of the county's main airport, as his interim replacement.
Mr. Popejoy had reduced the county's debt by $300 million and put off $800 million in debt for another year, after the loss last December of $1.7 billion in high-risk investments.
But everything he did to achieve those results seemed to bring pain to a county that still seems reluctant to face the dimensions of its problems. He cut the operating budget by 41 percent, threatening 15,000 county government jobs, and led the failed campaign for the tax increase to 8.25 cents per dollar.
Political analysts said Mr. Popejoy might have been unable to make these cuts, or even suggest the tax increase, had the supervisors been more closely involved.
Only one of the five supervisors joined Mr. Popejoy in vigorously campaigning for the tax increase. And on June 27, 60 percent of those voting rejected it.
Ms. Mittermeier, who is 55, has been a county employee for 21 years. She rose from chief of its internal audit department to director of John Wayne Airport, and is accustomed to working under the board's close direction. She will be one of the candidates the board will consider as it seeks a permanent successor to Mr. Popejoy in the next month or two.
"We don't need any more drama," Supervisor William Steiner said when Ms. Mittermeier's appointment was announced.
As outlined today the new plan, drafted by Salomon Brothers, seems to avoid dramatic cuts or tax increases, proposing instead to shift a portion of the sales tax used to cover local transportation needs to debt repayment. It would also take property taxes that are given to special municipal districts -- water, flood and sanitary districts -- and divert them to the county's creditors.
The plan also calls for restructuring some of the county's long-term leases, a form of debt, to reduce its annual borrowing costs. Salomon Brothers estimates that this three-pronged approach would raise more than $1 billion, with the rest of the county's debts covered by budget cuts, asset sales and some recently issued short-term notes.
Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy lawyer, said the proposal is based on the notion that the county must repay all its creditors in full if it is to calm noteholders and other creditors, who fear that they might be forced to accept partial payment on their claims.
Such concerns, particularly on the part of municipal bond investors, have made it difficult, if not impossible, for the county to borrow in the credit markets. The proposal is intended to signal the municipal markets that the county will honor its debts -- even if it must turn to Sacramento to do so.
With Gov. Pete Wilson, who has long opposed tax increases, running for President, there is little political will in Sacramento to aid Orange County. But the new plan is designed to provide a solution generated by the county that requires neither state funds nor additional county funds, but that could lift a cloud of uncertainty that has settled over all California municipal borrowers since the Orange County bankruptcy filing.
"If we achieve this financial package our debts will be able to be repaid in fully next year," Mr. Bennett said. "If we don't, we won't have enough money and it will be a long time before we emerge from bankruptcy."
Some lawmakers in Sacramento have expressed concern about setting a tax-shifting precedent, particularly if what is being shifted to a county government is property taxes that were to go to cities. But Chris Vareles, a Salomon banker, said that the plan tries to address that concern by shifting taxes only from special municipal districts and not from the cities themselves. Better still, Mr. Vareles said, since the plan obviates the need for tax increases, which under California law must be approved by the voters, it is "a more creative way of accessing money without having to go to a vote."
At today's meeting, members of the county's board expressed relief that no new taxes would be needed to resolve the bankruptcy.
One supervisor asked whether the plan could be adopted only in part, leaving out the proposed tax diversion but retaining the long-term debt restructuring. William J. Popejoy, the county's outgoing chief executive, expressed serious doubt: "Maybe," he said. "But only if you took this package and sold it to a foreign buyer who had never read a newspaper about Orange County."

Customer Incentives Take a Big Toll on Chrysler Profits

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 18

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation said today that net income tumbled 85.9 percent in the second quarter, as higher customer incentives slashed the profit from each vehicle.
Net fell to $135 million, or 35 cents a share -- below Wall Street's expectations -- from $956 million, or $2.61 a share, a year earlier. The results in the latest quarter included a previously announced charge of $143 million, or 36 cents a share, related to the ending of a shift at an assembly plant in Newark, Del.. 
 Even on an operating basis, Chrysler's earnings were below expectations. Chrysler's profit from operations of 71 cents a share fell below Wall Street's forecast of 93 cents, based on the mean estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue fell 4.6 percent, to $12.5 billion from $13.1 billion.
Even as per-vehicle profit plunged to one-quarter of what it was a year ago, analysts said the worst might be over for the nation's third-largest auto maker. Chrysler has depleted inventory and absorbed the cost of introducing its restyled line of minivans, allowing it to raise prices later this year, said Nick Lobacarro, an analyst at S. G. Warburg & Company.
"I don't think the third quarter is going to be anything to write home about either, but they are setting themselves up to have a gangbuster fourth quarter," he said.
Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman, said the results were disappointing but expected because of higher incentive and production costs.
Shares of Chrysler fell 37.5 cents, to $49.50, on the New York Stock Exchange today.
Not even sales in June, the biggest month in company history, could bolster Chrysler's earnings. The company increased incentives such as cash rebates and less expensive financing by more than any other American car maker.
Incentive costs rose to $1,035 a vehicle from $610 a year earlier. The incentives helped increase Chrysler's sales 12 percent in June from a year ago, to 236,404 vehicles.
But Chrysler earned just $303 on every sale. A year ago, Chrysler led Detroit's auto makers with a per-sale profit of $1,298.
The company's share of the North American market declined to 15.2 percent from 15.4 percent in the second quarter. In 1995's first six months, market share fell to 15.1 percent from 15.6 percent.
The auto makers are counting on a stronger economy to lift profits during the rest of the year and into 1996. The Federal Reserve's decision earlier this month to ease credit could spur more consumer spending, allowing Chrysler to cut incentives, Mr. Eaton said.
Chrysler said sales of its revamped mini-vans were strong. It said it expected its 1996 Dakota pickup trucks and Jeep Wranglers to increase earnings later this year.
Chrysler's cash balance fell to $6.9 billion in the second quarter from $7.4 billion because of capital spending on production startups. The company expects to return the balance to more than $7 billion by the fourth quarter.
The cash was the focus of efforts by the investor Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation to buy Chrysler earlier this year. Upset that Chrysler was not doing more to increase the value of its stock, Mr. Kerkorian offered to buy the company for $55 a share, using $5.5 billion of the cash reserve to help finance the transaction.
The offer was rescinded in May after it failed to win financial backing.

HEADLINE: Legislators Against the Arts

 BODY:
It is an astonishing day for New York when it has a better friend in Alan Simpson than in its own Congressional representatives. The Wyoming Senator is one of three Republicans who have come up with a sensible alternative to the House's slash-and-burn approach to arts funding. Yesterday the entire Republican side of the New York delegation voted to write the death warrant for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, approving a bill that would end all funding within two years.
It is surprising to see upstate moderates like Amo Houghton and Sherwood Boehlert joining the anti-arts swing, but it is at least understandable. Their constituencies are not nearly as dependent on the arts as is the New York metropolitan area. But for Susan Molinari, Michael Forbes, Peter King, Daniel Frisa and Rick Lazio, it is mind-boggling. These Representatives are selling their constituents down the river. 
 Do they think that the 100,000-plus jobs generated by the arts and other cultural institutions in the New York metropolitan area are held only by Manhattanites? Do they believe there are no residents of Staten Island or Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Putnam counties who are performers, painters or sculptors? These die-hard budget-cutters are not only punishing the artists. They are also hurting the thousands of people who work as production assistants, secretaries, stagehands and accountants for the theaters, television studios and galleries in the area, not to mention restaurants and other businesses that depend on the huge tourist trade attracted by New York's cultural riches.
The arts in New York will not, of course, die without Federal support. For many institutions, N.E.A. money represents only a small percentage of their budgets. But Federal support also gives them a special stamp of legitimacy that, in turn, gives private donors the confidence to support them.
To some members of Congress, jobs in the art world may seem much less vital than, say, jobs in the defense industry. But they are every bit as important to the New York economy as those of submarine workers at Electric Boat are to southeastern Connecticut. Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, would rather jump off the Groton pier than cast a vote threatening his constituents' jobs. The New Yorkers cannot even take shelter behind claims that they are fixing the budget. These are small amounts, and there are far more wasteful expenditures they are ignoring.
Federal funding for the arts is also highly important in rural areas, where artists have less access to rich veins of private philanthropy. But for New Yorkers, the arts are Electric Boat, Long Beach, Newport News. Representatives Forbes, Lazio, King, Frisa and Molinari should not be allowed to forget this come election time.
Their more enlightened colleagues in the Senate, Nancy Kassebaum, Alan Simpson and Jim Jeffords, are sponsoring a much less bloodthirsty alternative to the House bill that would cut the N.E.A. by only 5 percent a year over five years, and contains no eventual cutoff. That is still not ideal. But in these times it may be the best deal the arts can get. May the Senators restore sanity to the arts budget when their turn comes.

MERRILL LYNCH & CO. (MER,N)

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company, bolstered by rallies in the stock and bond markets, said yesterday that earnings rose 12 percent in the second quarter.
Profit at Merrill, the nation's biggest securities firm, rose as interest rates fell to 16-month lows, stocks reached record highs, underwriting of corporate stocks and bonds advanced, and mergers surged. Earnings were $282.7 million, or $1.40 a share, up from $251.8 million, or $1.18 a share, in the 1994 quarter. 
 The per-share profit of $1.40 was well above the forecast of $1.19 from analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue, net of interest, rose 6.3 percent, to $2.55 billion, from $2.4 billion a year ago.
Reflecting an increase in stock trading, revenue from commissions rose 11 percent in the quarter, to $765 million.
Trading revenue increased 10 percent, to $615 million, as rising profits from convertible securities, interest-rate and currency swaps, junk bonds and over-the-counter stocks offset lower revenue in municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Investment banking revenue, bolstered by fees for advising in mergers, rose 4 percent, to $335 million. Underwriting revenue was flat.
Fees from asset management rose 8 percent, to $464 million, as assets under management increased 12 percent, to $180 billion.
The firm said expenses increased 6 percent in the quarter because of increased compensation and legal fees resulting from its litigation with Orange County, Calif., over investment losses suffered by the county. Professional fees, which include lawyers' fees, rose 21 percent, to $105.5 million. (Bloomberg Business News)

HEADLINE: We Paid a Terrible Price for Atom Bomb

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Richard Rhodes is no doubt correct in stating that the emergence of nuclear weapons 50 years ago "changed the conditions" for global war ("Echoes of the Big Bang," Op-Ed, July 15). But we can't agree with his view of the bomb's enormous value as a peacemaker, past and future. And Rhodes also ignores the terrible price we paid for embracing the bomb following the Trinity test. 
 Trinity, in fact, was a tragic event. It marked the birth of America's lasting dependency on ever more destructive nuclear weapons. Trinity also enhanced the idea of the bomb as a usable military weapon; our leaders were drawn to its power, leading directly to the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Mr. Rhodes attributes the absence of world war after 1945 to the credibility of United States and Soviet deterrents. On numerous occasions, however, one mad, or misperceived, act could have instigated a nuclear holocaust. For the same reason, he is too sanguine in suggesting that we have "little to fear" from an Iraqi, Iranian or North Korean bomb. We can hardly put permanent faith in the mixture of nuclear restraint and good luck that has prevailed so far.
Even if the bomb played a part in avoiding another world war, it has not prevented hundreds of regional wars, including America's own bloody involvement in Korea and Vietnam.
And Mr. Rhodes fails to emphasize the crucial fact that miscalculation might lead not just to another world war, but also to the end of the world as we know it.
Mr. Rhodes also does not explore the many ways that the bomb has severely damaged America and its people. The economic price of the arms race -- recently placed at $3.9 trillion -- and its environmental impact are well known, but other costs are just as significant.
The secrecy of the Manhattan Project, for example, did not end with Nagasaki.
It came to surround the entire nuclear realm with horrible results for millions of Americans unwittingly exposed to forms of radiation or subjected to cruel medical experiments.
That climate of secrecy would eventually pervade much of our Government -- and society as a whole.
Trinity, far from liberating us from fear, marked the beginning of our nuclear entrapment, and of enduring danger to a human future.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Big Monthly U.S. Trade Deficit Broadly Drives Down the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most other leading currencies yesterday, weighed down by a report that the the United States had recorded its largest monthly trade deficit in May and by a selloff in American stocks and bonds.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the trade deficit in goods and services widened to $11.4 billion in May, slightly above that in April, but also more than $1 billion ahead of the figure expected by many economists. A big trade deficit weakens the dollar because the currency must be sold to pay for the excess of imports. 
 "The dollar sold off a little after the trade deficit was bigger than expected," said Earl Johnson, currency adviser at the Bank of Montreal-Harris Bank in Chicago.
It was further weakened by declines in American stocks and bonds. When foreign investors sell American assets, they convert the dollar proceeds into their own currencies. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.01 points, to 4,686.28, and the price of the 30-year Treasury bond also fell, driving up its yield to 6.76 percent.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.3899 German marks, down from 1.3969 marks on Monday. The dollar settled at 88.40 Japanese yen, down from 89.04 yen.
Even with the dollar's decline yesterday, traders did not expect it to fall much further because many of them think that the American and Japanese central banks are committed to weakening the yen. On July 7, the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve intervened in the markets on a huge scale, buying hundreds of millions of dollars for yen. Since then, the Japanese bank has bought an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion more in dollars, said David Gilmore of Foreign Exchange Analytics.
As a result, said Graham Broyd, manager of currency sales at National Westminster Bank in New York, "a lot of people are expecting a higher dollar against the yen."
While the American trade deficit weighs on the dollar, the assumption of additional dollar purchases supports it, Mr. Johnson said.
In other currency trading yesterday, the dollar was last quoted in New York at 1.1586 Swiss francs, down from 1.1692 francs, and at 4.8257 French francs, down from 4.8633. The British pound rose to $1.5962 from $1.5942. The dollar slipped to 1,611.5 Italian lire from 1,612.5. The Canadian dollar fell to 73.48 American cents, from 73.76 cents on Monday.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS: One Year to Atlanta 1996;
A Lot of Optimism But Hurdles to Leap

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Exactly one year from the opening of the centennial Summer Olympic Games, the temperature is rising into the high 90's, dormitories at the athletes' village are sinking from unexpected settling and the financial forecast remains as hazy as a humid July morning.
If Billy Payne, the chief organizer, is sweating, however, it doesn't show. He has promised the biggest and best Olympics ever, and he expects to deliver. A year out, the track is being installed at Olympic Stadium, ticket sales have exceeded expectations, 5,000 athletes have begun arriving for pre-Olympic competitions and the economic impact of the Games has been projected at $5.1 billion. 
 Although organizers insist the Games are "on time and on budget," the Atlanta committee's original surplus, forecast at $156 million, shrank to $60 million last year with a final projection due in October. Whether the Games will have their familiarly lavish look or a bargain basement feel will depend on whether organizers meet their $1.58 billion budget as they seek to sign more second-tier corporate sponsors and shore up disappointing sales of Olympic coins.
For Atlanta, there is much more at stake than the threat of a blown budget. A year and 17 days from today, will the Games, with 10,700 athletes from 197 countries and two million visitors expected, be remembered for wilting heat, sclerotic traffic and an endless parade of corporate logos? Or will they be remembered for embracing Southern hospitality, racial harmony and stirring athletic achievement?
Not everything has gone like clockwork, and some considerable hurdles remain. A planned $50 million, 21-acre Centennial Park remains a glorified dirt-bike course, and the intended sale of two million personalized bricks that will line the park's walkways has faltered at 160,000. The Olympic drug lab has yet to gain accreditation. The official mascot, Izzy, resembles a soap bubble with a thyroid condition. Last week, the temperature hit 98 degrees, considerably higher than the 75 degrees that organizers contend is the average for July.
"It's one of those situations where you exceed even your own very high expectations, and then you wait to see how folks measure it -- and you kind of hold your breath a little," Payne said in an interview last week.
The Atlanta Games will be Southern in character -- "Our friendliness will steal the show," Payne said -- and uniquely American in their financing. As the curtain goes up and Atlanta steps upon the international stage, these Games will be played against a backdrop of unprecedented corporate involvement.
The Games will be held in the backyards of Coca-Cola, CNN and Delta Airlines, and in a city deemed one of the world's four best in which to do business in 1994 by Fortune magazine. At a cost of $1.58 billion, these Games are being privately financed by the Atlanta organizing committee, meaning that the money comes from broadcast rights, corporate sponsorships, ticket sales and merchandising.
NBC wrote the largest corporate check, paying $456 million for American television rights. Twenty sponsors paid up to $40 million apiece to become Olympic "partners." If Atlanta lacks the inspiring architecture, culture, exotic presence and teeming boulevards of Barcelona, if the downtown area is where they paved paradise and put up a parking lot, at least these Games will have something that no previous Olympics could claim -- an official game show, an official anti-theft device and an official country and western album.
Since the wide world of commerce will be as prominently featured as the wide world of sports, the Games may seem more like an international Super Bowl. Corporate sponsors, along with Olympic v.i.p.'s and members of the news media will have many of the best seats and stay in the most convenient hotels, while thousands of spectators will have to commute from places like Birmingham, Ala., and Chattanooga, Tenn.
The corporate footprint will be on everything from drug testing to security to building the Olympic stadium to providing ambience to deciding the start time of the men's marathon. A 92-foot Swatch watch will adorn a local building, McDonald's will place six restaurants in the athletes' village, an eight-acre Coca-Cola Olympic City will feature interactive games, and Daimler-Benz, the German automaker, has pledged to restore the crumbled house where Margaret Mitchell, author of "Gone With the Wind," was born.
Some $500 million worth of building projects, funded in large part with corporate money, will be available for local use after the Games. Centennial Park will enliven a blighted area of downtown. The 85,000-seat Olympic Stadium -- the first to have luxury suites -- will be downsized into the home of baseball's Atlanta Braves, while the track will be reinstalled at Clark Atlanta University. A new aquatic center and eight new dormitories will go to Georgia Tech, a basketball arena to Morehouse College and a football stadium to Morris Brown University.
 
Dissenting Notes From Sponsor Tune
 Not everyone, though, is smitten with the idea of strictly privately financed Games, which lack the safety net of a public bailout. The concept was developed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, after the 1976 Montreal Games went into public debt of $1 billion. Unlike Los Angeles, which used existing facilities and accumulated a surplus of $220 million, Atlanta has had to construct 10 new competition venues and refurbish several others.
Dick Pound, a Montreal attorney who is the International Olympic Committee's liaison to the Atlanta Games, suggested last year that the Games may no longer be awarded to a city without a Government committed to rescue any financial shortfall. Last week, Pound said he still believed that no organizing committee should pay for the construction of stadiums and infrastructure.
"Revenues should pay for the party, not the banquet hall," Pound said.
Organizers also have been criticized as elitist for giving special ticket considerations to politicians. Some have said that the reliance on corporations to provide atmosphere is confirmation that Atlanta's downtown is sterile and in danger of becoming indistinguishable from other cookie-cutter Sun Belt cities. Others believe it is excessive to build a $170 million Olympic Stadium for 17 days' use, then carve it in half for the Braves while bulldozing their current home, Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
Anita Beaty, co-chairwoman of the Olympic Conscience Coalition, said that despite a $75 million project to build 1,000 new housing units near Olympic venues and a $42 million Federal grant to renovate the Techwood-Clark Howell housing project near the Olympic village, Olympic construction would displace 5,000 housing units for the poor. She also said that she feared that homeless people would be incarcerated during the Games to prevent their appearance on the streets.
"The Olympics have become a commercial circus, using athletes and athletic events to make incredible profits at a cost of great human suffering," said Beaty, who is also president of the National Coalition of the Homeless.
 
Traffic and the Heat Could Mean Trouble
The most critical unresolved issue for organizers is traffic. The plan is essentially to turn Atlanta's downtown into a pedestrian mall, with cars intercepted at park-and-ride lots and spectators ferried to events on the local rail system and in 2,000 buses. The city is notorious for gridlock, and the recent Super Bowl was a traffic nightmare.
If Atlanta the city won't be the star of these Olympics, perhaps the Games themselves will. Eleven million tickets -- more than the Los Angeles and Barcelona Games combined -- went on sale in May. Athletes, staying for the first time in fully air-conditioned dorms, will participate before the largest Olympic crowds ever; the Georgia Dome, for example, will hold 30,000 spectators for basketball and gymnastics.
Still, Atlanta's claim of being the best Olympics ever will be diminished if searing heat debilitates any runners in the men's marathon, which will start at 6:30 P.M. next Aug. 4, a time when the average temperature is 80 degrees with 65 percent humidity. Several runners have said the heat will turn the race into a "death march."
Also, Michael Johnson of Dallas, the world's top-ranked sprinter at 200 and 400 meters and potentially the most dominant American athlete at the Atlanta Olympics, said he will not run both events at the Olympics as long as their preliminary rounds overlap.
"Whichever one I decide not to run is going to be a joke," Johnson said last month at the national track and field championships.
 
Vision of Showcase For Racial Harmony
 On display at these Games will be Atlanta's emotional history of the Civil War and the civil rights movement. Remnants of the Confederacy are still visible in the Georgia state flag; golf was hurt from consideration as an Olympic sport because of exclusionist policies at the Masters course in Augusta; volleyball was moved out of Cobb County after the county passed an anti-gay resolution, and Somali athletes looking for a training site were rebuffed by Barrow County over the treatment of American soldiers in that East African nation.
But Atlanta also served as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights pulpit. It is home to a large black middle class and six historically black universities. Minority-group members make up more than one-third of the organizing committee's employees and minority-owned businesses have been the recipients of one-third of the committee's contracts.
"I would maintain that in terms of black and white working together in friendship and cooperation and achieving significant success, we're the best example of that in the world," Payne said.
Andrew Young, the former Mayor and Ambassador to the United Nations, said the American South may free itself of an image of racial intolerance and backwardness during the Olympics, just as South Africa's apartheid-fermented reputation "got out of jail" last month when it was host to rugby's world championship.
"These will be the affirmative action Olympics," Young said. "Atlanta can become the center for the export of Southern idealism."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gasoline Prices Fall as Traders See Lower Stocks as Adequate

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gasoline prices fell yesterday as traders bet that American refiners would be able to meet demand this summer while running on leaner inventories.
On other commodity markets, copper prices fell while corn rose. The Commodity Research Bureau index gained 0.11 point, to 234.11. 
 Gasoline stockpiles fell to a seven-month low of 207.6 million barrels two weeks ago and have been running 3 to 5 percent below levels of a year ago all year, according to American Petroleum Institute data.
After the market closed yesterday, the institute said gasoline stockpiles rose by 560,000 barrels last week, or less than 1 percent, surprising analysts who had expected a decline.
While such low inventories would normally keep prices high, traders said the oil industry was adjusting to a new, lower level of inventory that keeps costs down.
"Everyone is living hand to mouth," said Tom Knight, manager of East Coast refined products trading at the Fina Oil and Chemical Company in River Edge, N.J.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for August delivery fell 0.4 cent, to 53.58 cents a gallon, the lowest price since March 14. August crude oil gained 15 cents, to $17.35 a barrel.
Copper prices gave up early gains to settle lower amid concern the pace of inventory declines is slowing.
Copper stockpiles held in London Metal Exchange warehouses fell by just 350 metric tons since Friday, to 141,100 tons. While that is the lowest inventory level since September, 1990, the drop was less sharp than the two previous weekly declines.
As a result, many analysts are beginning to think a weakened United States economy has begun to slow demand for copper from industrial users like automobile makers.
Corn prices rose for the third consecutive day, reaching a 17-month high, as traders sought indications of how much rain would fall in the Midwest this week.

HEADLINE: POP REVIEW;
Two Calypso Monarchs in the Park

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
Super Blue summed up the mission of Trinidadian calypso at Central Park Summerstage on Sunday afternoon. "We are informing, educating and entertaining at the same time," he announced. Calypso watchers have long worried that the party chants of modern soca (or soul-calypso) are driving out calypso's long tradition of sophisticated wordplay and social commentary. Sunday's concert brought something from both sides: Super Blue's jubilant, participatory soca hits and Black Stalin's buoyant message calypsos.
Super Blue, born Austin Lyons, has won Trinidad's Road March competition seven times since 1980 and has held the Soca Monarch title since it was introduced in 1993. The winning road march is the song played most often by the mobile sound systems in the carnival parade; it's the people's choice for party music. 
 Super Blue's voice has a cheerful growl that can sound like classic soul music or Jamaican dancehall toasting. He's a master of the propulsive groove, the sing-along chorus and the exhortation to join the party. He alludes, now and then, to Trinidadian culture and history, but his songs are made to get people moving.
After doodling with North American pop songs, Super Blue settled into his soca hits and turned the audience into a dancing, shouting mass. Many had brought something to wave during songs like "Flag Party" and "Signal for Lara," a tribute to the Trinidadian cricket player Brian Lara, with its chorus, "Raise your bat and party!" For a finale, Super Blue strutted into the audience, dancing from the stage to the bleachers.
The gray-bearded Black Stalin (born Leroy Calliste), who was named Calypso Monarch in 1979, 1985, 1987, 1991 and 1995, merges calypso traditionalism with touches of Rastafarianism and hopes for pan-Caribbean unity. With more conversational, behind-the-beat vocals and more lilting, less aggressive music than Super Blue used, he was openly didactic; "We Can Make It," from 1988, exhorted Trinidadians to stand firm during an economic crisis; "Burn Dem," from 1987, told St. Peter what to do with certain world leaders.
There were lighter songs, too, including "Tribute to Sundar Popo," this year's calypso winner, in which Black Stalin asked a songwriter to deliver a song he had requested long ago. Black Stalin sang it during his short set, as an encore, and again with Super Blue and a cameo guest calypsonian, Gabby.

HEADLINE: High-Speed Ferry Service To Begin Across the Sound

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: SOUTHOLD, L.I., July 18

 BODY:
The Foxwoods Casino on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian reservation near New London, Conn., thinks it has a sure bet: promoting the launching of the first high-speed ferry service across Long Island Sound. The Long Island Rail Road also wants a piece of the action.
The new service, operated by Cross Sound Ferry Services Inc., is scheduled to begin on Wednesday morning, when a twin-hulled catamaran, Sea Ski 1, designed to carry 350 passengers, will make its maiden run to Orient Point, L.I., from New London. 
 No reservations are required for the ferry, and boarding will be first come, first served. The cost of a same-day round trip is $20. Passengers on the first three daily ferries from Orient Point will be able to take advantage of free coach service to the casino and a $25 food and gambling bonus provided by Foxwoods. The bonus includes $10 in food credits and $15 in gaming vouchers.
While the 12 daily crossings may please gamblers, as well as others planning to catch an Amtrak train in New London for Boston, officials on Long Island, including Thomas Wickham, the Supervisor of the Town of Southold, are not happy.
"Southold has become a funnel for all those on Long Island who seem to have an insatiable appetite for gambling," Mr. Wickham said. "They all take the one and only winding two-lane road to Orient Point and leave their cars parked all over the place."
"We don't want to close the operation down," he said. "We just want a site plan for parking so we can get out of our driveways and the fire trucks can get out of the firehouse."
Attorneys for the town of Southold went to court today seeking to block the new service. They argued that Cross Sound Ferry had failed to discuss the traffic problem with town officials and file a plan to improve the terminal's parking lot to accommodate the expected increase in traffic.
Justice Patrick Henry of State Supreme Court in Central Islip ruled that Southold and the ferry operator should work together to measure the impact of traffic and resolve their parking dispute.
Using the combined L.I.R.R. and express ferry service, it should take less time for Long Islanders to get to the Connecticut casino than it now does to get to Atlantic City, said Stanley Mickus, a spokesman for Cross Sound Ferry, whose headquarters are in New London.
Cruising at 30 knots, Sea Jet I is the fastest ocean-going passenger vessel ever built in the United States, he said, and should cut travel time for the 16-mile trip across the Sound to 30 minutes. The larger, more conventional ferries, operated on the same route by Cross Sound Ferry, take an hour and a half to transport cars and trucks as well as passengers.
Even the Long Island Rail Road has joined in promoting the new high-speed service. The commuter line will be offering a $25 package for a round trip from Penn Station to Foxwoods.
The gamblers special will leave Penn Station at 7:39 A.M. five mornings a week and return at 12:26 A.M. The package includes a 10-minute bus ride between the L.I.R.R. station at Greenport, L.I., and the Orient Point ferry terminal, and a half-hour bus ride from the New London ferry terminal to Foxwoods, in Ledyard, 15 miles northeast of New London.
The train will also pick up passengers at stops in Mineola, Hicksville, Farmingdale and Ronkonkoma.
High-speed ferry service across the Sound has been a dream of the tourist and business community ever since plans to build a third bridge across across the Sound died in the 1970's.
Most recently, the Suffolk County Legislature supported a proposal for a new ferry terminal and high-speed service to Connecticut from Shoreham, L.I., the site of the Long Island Lighting Company's decommissioned nuclear power plant.
Opponents, including Shoreham residents, along with Lilco's hesitancy to sign a lease, buried the idea.
The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, said he welcomed the new ferry service as a way to boost the Island's economy.
"But I think I'll stick to the slower ferry," he said. "It's been my experience with casino gambling that the longer the trip takes to get there, the better it is for me."

HEADLINE: Newspaper to Cut 450 Positions

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 18

 BODY:
The Los Angeles Times announced today that it planned to cut 450 full-time positions by the end of this year, and employees in the editorial department said they were told that these cuts would include up to 160 out of 1,300 news-gathering positions.
Breaking with the newspaper's recent practice of using attrition and buyouts to cut its staff and save operating costs, the reductions announced today would include an undetermined number of outright layoffs, said Laura Morgan, director of communications for the newspaper. 
 In a memorandum to the staff, the publisher, Richard D. Schlossberg 3d said, "Although we will use attrition and other voluntary methods we will have involuntary terminations in some departments."
In the past five years, as the paper's staff was cut to 5,800 employees from 6,500, many reductions were made through buyouts. This time, Mr. Schlossberg said, there will be no companywide buyout offer, although the methods of reduction will vary by department. The publisher said retirement packages would be based on years of service and would be up to one year's salary and health benefits.
He said the cuts were necessary because of the continuing weakness of the Southern California economy and fast-rising newsprint costs.
Reporters said they were told that cutbacks in the news operation could affect all parts of the newspaper, in the home office, suburban bureaus, in Washington and abroad.
Speculation about cutbacks was accelerated with the closing this week of New York Newsday, which is also owned by the Times Mirror Company.

HEADLINE: In Hamptons, Lines in the Sand Ignite Tempers;
Oceanfront Residents Try to Restrict Public Access to Beaches

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, L.I.

 BODY:
From the edge of his beach towel on the sugar-soft sand of Fowler's Beach, Joseph Obermayer can see the rise of newly built ocean estates, which he scornfully derides as potato mansions inhabited by the territorial nouveau riche.
From the edge of eight-foot-high privet hedges bordering his oceanfront development on the old Henry Ford estate, Joern Brunvall can see Fowler's Beach bathers like Mr. Obermayer, gauche summer tourists who litter country roads with beer bottles and lines of unsightly cars. 
 These are the lines in the precious sand that divide wealthy oceanfront landowners from middle-class visitors in the Hamptons, where only a handful of beaches are open to the public. As the East End's potato lands have sprouted houses, each new enclave of owners has sought bans on parking along the access roads to the beaches. They have been so effective that the metal No Parking signs are as ubiquitous as service entrances to the local estates.
Of course, the right-of-way along the beach below the high-water mark has been guaranteed to the public since Colonial days by a law known as the public trust doctrine. The enduring question is: Can you get there?
"It's a question of a natural conflict between people who choose to live on the ocean and people who don't and want to use it," said William W. Esseks, a lawyer who has represented several Hamptons property owners who have won parking restrictions along beach access roads. "You should not park on the roads because they're trying to have a certain ambiance in the town: views across pastoral fields without cars and trucks."
On the South Fork of eastern Long Island, beach territory is so prized that earlier this summer in Sagaponack, a tourist came to blows with the young daughter of a corporate executive who the police said had demanded the removal from "our property" of a car parked on a public road.
Many of these fierce sand struggles are territorial fights pitting the Upper East Side, wealthy Manhattan newcomers who value the privacy of their second homes, on the beachfront, against middle-class New York City beachgoers.
Along the coast of Northeastern states, this debate is acute, as rural properties edging the Atlantic are subdivided into lots and expensive homes. "Potato mansions" is the term that critics like Mr. Obermayer use for the airy, contemporary houses that have replaced potatoes along the two-lane roads leading to the beaches.
"The reason why this is a big issue in the Northeast is because beach towns that used to be strictly tourist towns are becoming residential, and in becoming residential, the people who live there no longer want tourist space," said Jack Samuels, a professor of recreation and tourism at Montclair State University in New Jersey. "They want to have privacy. They don't see the fact that tourism is sustaining the local economy."
All of these forces have come into play on the sandy shores of places like Peter's Pond in Sagaponack and Fowler's Beach in Southampton, which has had a reputation for almost two decades as the East End's oldest gay beach, drawing bronzed sunbathers from all over Long Island and Manhattan.
Both beaches lack amenities, except the cobalt blue of the Atlantic and wind-scoured stretches of sand. There are no garbage cans, lifeguards or toilets. There are also no requirements for beach passes, and tourists are accustomed to parking along the two-lane public roads that lead to the beaches.
Residents of the Fordune development, 44 lots and homes that have been carved from the old Henry Ford estate, wanted to achieve a country look along the country road that borders their development. Last summer, the development's association moved successfully to ban the very vehicles that made Ford rich. As a result, up went a string of No Parking signs on the road by the development's entrance.
In turn, the development's Fowler Street neighbor, a farm family that has worked the land for generations, sought a parking ban on the road near their large Colonial-style house. The Village of Southampton had put up No Parking signs along that road, but the beachgoers had draped the signs with paper bags, contending that the village lacked the authority to impose those restrictions. They argued that only the Town of Southampton had that right.
When frequent beach visitors like Steven Welch and Carol Hageman realized how quickly parking spots were vanishing, they formed a group, walked beach blanket to blanket in search of donations and hired a $150-an-hour lawyer to reclaim lost spaces. Many supporters were gay men with homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons who could afford to write a check, but not the time to fight Town Hall.
"They want the beach to themselves and they don't want outsiders coming there," said John Rogers, 51, an interior designer with residences in Southampton and the Upper East Side, who has been active in the fight to reclaim parking spaces on Fowler's Beach. "The people at Fordune have multimillion-dollar homes and they don't want to go through the beach and stumble over boys and girls frolicking in the sand."
"It's their delicate sense of privilege and sense of privacy," said Mr. Welch, 38, a Southampton resident and a chef by trade.
On the other side of the road, the oceanfront residents give several reasons for concern about parked cars: safety, esthetics, litter, unsanitary beach conditions, public urination.
Margaret H. Fowler, whose in-laws have farmed the land along Fowler's Street for generations, said the crush of traffic along the road was "an accident waiting to happen." She said the parking spaces should not have been eliminated by the Fordune development.
But her neighbors there will not accept the cars. "We pay high taxes and high costs and therefore we are trying to maintain the pristine areas that we live in," said Clifford V. Brokaw 3d, 67, president of the Fordune Association and a retired investment banker with residences in Southampton and the Upper East Side.
The association's vice president, Joern Brunvall, a former Upper East Side resident who now lives year round in Southampton, said some day trippers crashed into the development's privet hedges and trampled the grass planted by the homeowners. "I don't think class is an issue at all in this," he said. "It's parking that's an issue. It seems like the people from the city are trying to overrun us here."
That is basically the same argument of Daniel Shedrick, the chief executive officer of the KMS Group Ltd. in Connecticut, who owns 64 acres of potato fields fronting Peter's Pond beach in Sagaponack. Earlier this summer, Mr. Shedrick drew his line in the gray sand of Peter's Pond with a full-page advertisement that appeared in the Southampton Press.
"Not Murder," declared the headline in bold block letters. "Just a broken nose," added the smaller print of his complaint, about beach thugs who had attacked his daughter and tourists who had tramped along his property to "dump their garbage, destroy private property and enjoy the sun." Not to mention the bacchanalian beach parties of "indescribable proportions."
In June, Mr. Shedrick sued the Southampton Town Board for $5 million in damages, asserting that his property had lost value because the board had failed to enforce parking restrictions along the beach-access road that runs past his property.
Mr. Shedrick has proposed the banning of parking on the road at all times, along with the posting of an attendant in a guard house to monitor activity and break the "criminal, Pavlovian" habits of beachgoers.
In his advertisement, Mr. Shedrick railed against "nine unidentified male teen-agers" who assaulted his daughter, Elizabeth Shedrick, a 25-year-old Fordham University graduate student.
But the Southampton police said they had investigated the incident involving Ms. Shedrick and had concluded that only two teen-age boys had been involved in the dispute. One arrest was made last week in connection with the fight, and Ms. Shedrick has also filed a harassment complaint against a 17-year-old East Hampton resident who the police said was involved in the incident.
Detective Doreen Isola of Southampton said a fight apparently erupted as a beach party broke up and people headed toward their cars along the road. As Ms. Shedrick tried to drive around a parked car, somebody made a comment.
"She told them to leave and that that was her property," the detective said. "And the argument escalated from there."

HEADLINE: Twist a Dial and Cab Fare Soars, Police Say

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

 BODY:
Thousands of people who rode taxis in New York City in recent months may have noticed that the drivers fiddled a lot with their CB radios. What they didn't notice, the police said yesterday, was that sometimes as the radios got louder, the fares got higher.
The police arrested Mohammad I. Ahmed, a cab driver, yesterday and said they believe that in the last six months, he has rigged the meters in at least 500 yellow cabs, including his own, to overcharge passengers. 
 Deputy Inspector Vincent Kennedy said Mr. Ahmed charged fellow cabbies $75 to $100 to install a device called a zapper, consisting of a pin and two wires. One wire was attached to a wheel and another to a CB radio -- separate from the dispatcher radio -- and the meter reading increased along with the radio volume.
"The price went right up," said Inspector Kennedy, who is in charge of the taxi enforcement unit, which was formed in April when the police took over enforcement of taxi rules from the Taxi and Limousine Commission. "There are a lot of people who are getting ripped off."
So far, Mr. Ahmed has been charged with altering three taximeters, but the police made it clear that they think he is responsible for far more cases of meter tampering and that he was clever enough to swindle riders familiar with New York as well as unwary tourists.
Mr. Ahmed, the police said, would approach cabbies waiting for fares in the early morning in front of the New York Hilton on West 51st Street and Avenue of the Americas and offer his services. He could install a "zapper" in less than 20 minutes and worked on about 10 cabs in a typical day, the police said. The rigged meters charged passengers up to twice the legal fare of 25 cents per one-fifth of a mile, the police said.
Inspector Kennedy said that Mr. Ahmed, 39, of 710 Beverly Road in Flatbush, Brooklyn, was arrested at 5:45 A.M. yesterday after he was videotaped tampering with two meters. He was charged with possession of forged instruments and was given a summons.
"We've taken a major meter tamperer off the streets," Leonard Kaplan, First Deputy Commissioner of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said.
Although city officials suspected that Mr. Ahmed was fixing the meters, they said they could not move to arrest him without the help of one of his colleagues, who could provide them with details. Then, 10 days ago, a driver approached the police and helped them set up a sting to nab Mr. Ahmed, Mr. Kaplan said. Mr. Ahmed looked stunned and did not utter a word when officers clamped handcuffs on his wrists.
Police and taxi officials could not estimate how much Mr. Ahmed's scheme had cost riders altogether.
In recent years, the economics of driving a cab has suffered along with the decline in the region's economy, making it more difficult for drivers to earn a living. Last year, the Taxi and Limousine Commission rejected the industry's call for what would have been the first fare increase since January 1990, arguing that drivers would not benefit since taxi owners share most of the profits.
"I think it's just a case of water seeking its own level," Michael Higgins, publisher of Taxi Talk newspaper, said. "Unfortunately, some guys are not making that and some guys are taking the low road into putting more money into their pockets."
For years, taxi officials have grappled with ways to make meters tamper proof or resistant. The latest measure was to install a plastic cover on the meter.
So far this year, the taxi commission has received 1,026 complaints of rigged meters, Eugene Rodriguez, an agency spokesman, said, and officials believe that many of the complaints in recent months involved cabs that Mr. Ahmed had worked on. There were 1,093 complaints lodged all of last year.
Customers who have been the victims of overcharging by a cabbie welcomed the news of an arrest.
In March, Isabel Delgado, a dental assistant, was heading home to Elmhurst, Queens, after a flight from Kennedy International airport. About four blocks from her home, the fare, which normally cost her $16, was already at $20. Ms. Delgado, who only had $20 with her, said she had to leave the cab and walk the rest of the way home, her luggage in tow.
She said the driver began to curse her in Punjabi, but Ms. Delgado understood everything he said because her husband, a cab driver, is from India.
"I was so upset," Ms. Delgado, who took the driver to court, said. Last month a judge ordered the driver to pay a $100 fine.
"I wanted to make a difference," she said. "Next time, he's going to think twice before he does something like that."
Many taxi drivers declined to discuss Mr. Ahmed's arrest yesterday, but a few conceded that meter tampering is widespread. They also said, however, that the Police Department's takeover of the taxi and limousine enforcement had spurred some drivers to disconnect their devices.
"Whoever had a fast meter fixed it properly," Balvinder Singh, sitting behind the wheel of his cab in Chinatown, said. "People are scared of the police."
Officials said that Mr. Ahmed also offered his customers a way to avoid detection before the required inspections three times a year. For an additional fee of $25 to $40, they said, he would temporarily disconnect the device to thwart taxi inspectors.
While Mr. Ahmed's specialty was the zapper connected to a radio, officials said they had in the past seen similar devices hooked up to horns or even the window crank of a cab.
Mr. Ahmed could not be reached for comment last night. A man who answered the telephone at Mr. Ahmed's residence in the evening refused to discuss the case, saying he did not know the details of the arrest.
Earlier, sitting in Mr. Ahmed's living room, his oldest daughter, Sonia Ahmed, 17, told a reporter that her father was a talented mechanic who knew how to fix everything.
Mr. Ahmed emigrated from Pakistan in 1981 and first got work in gas stations. But after seven years and one too many robberies, he began driving a cab, his daughter said.
About a year ago, Mr. Ahmed brought his own $175,000 medallion, Mr. Kaplan of the Taxi and Limousine Commission said.

 The police say that Mohammad I. Ahmed wired his cab with a device known as a "zapper." These wires and plugs allowed him to trip the meter when he adjusted the volume on his CB radio, they say.
 
Meter Watching
 When traveling north or south in Manhattan, a meter should click every four blocks; crosstown, every block; in slow or stopped traffic, every 75 sjeconds.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS: One Year to Atlanta 1996;
A Lot of Optimism But Hurdles to Leap

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Exactly one year from the opening of the centennial Summer Olympic Games, the temperature is rising into the high 90's, dormitories at the athletes' village are sinking from unexpected settling and the financial forecast remains as hazy as a humid July morning.
If Billy Payne, the chief organizer, is sweating, however, it doesn't show. He has promised the biggest and best Olympics ever, and he expects to deliver. A year out, the track is being installed at Olympic Stadium, ticket sales have exceeded expectations, 5,000 athletes have begun arriving for pre-Olympic competitions and the economic impact of the Games has been projected at $5.1 billion. 
 Although organizers insist the Games are "on time and on budget," the Atlanta committee's original surplus, forecast at $156 million, shrank to $60 million last year with a final projection due in October. Whether the Games will have their familiarly lavish look or a bargain basement feel will depend on whether organizers meet their $1.58 billion budget as they seek to sign more second-tier corporate sponsors and shore up disappointing sales of Olympic coins.
For Atlanta, there is much more at stake than the threat of a blown budget. A year and 17 days from today, will the Games, with 10,700 athletes from 197 countries and two million visitors expected, be remembered for wilting heat, sclerotic traffic and an endless parade of corporate logos? Or will they be remembered for embracing Southern hospitality, racial harmony and stirring athletic achievement?
Not everything has gone like clockwork, and some considerable hurdles remain. A planned $50 million, 21-acre Centennial Park remains a glorified dirt-bike course, and the intended sale of two million personalized bricks that will line the park's walkways has faltered at 160,000. The Olympic drug lab has yet to gain accreditation. The official mascot, Izzy, resembles a soap bubble with a thyroid condition. Last week, the temperature hit 98 degrees, considerably higher than the 75 degrees that organizers contend is the average for July.
"It's one of those situations where you exceed even your own very high expectations, and then you wait to see how folks measure it -- and you kind of hold your breath a little," Payne said in an interview last week.
The Atlanta Games will be Southern in character -- "Our friendliness will steal the show," Payne said -- and uniquely American in their financing. As the curtain goes up and Atlanta steps upon the international stage, these Games will be played against a backdrop of unprecedented corporate involvement.
The Games will be held in the backyards of Coca-Cola, CNN and Delta Airlines, and in a city deemed one of the world's four best in which to do business in 1994 by Fortune magazine. At a cost of $1.58 billion, these Games are being privately financed by the Atlanta organizing committee, meaning that the money comes from broadcast rights, corporate sponsorships, ticket sales and merchandising.
NBC wrote the largest corporate check, paying $456 million for American television rights. Twenty sponsors paid up to $40 million apiece to become Olympic "partners." If Atlanta lacks the inspiring architecture, culture, exotic presence and teeming boulevards of Barcelona, if the downtown area is where they paved paradise and put up a parking lot, at least these Games will have something that no previous Olympics could claim -- an official game show, an official anti-theft device and an official country and western album.
Since the wide world of commerce will be as prominently featured as the wide world of sports, the Games may seem more like an international Super Bowl. Corporate sponsors, along with Olympic v.i.p.'s and members of the news media will have many of the best seats and stay in the most convenient hotels, while thousands of spectators will have to commute from places like Birmingham, Ala., and Chattanooga, Tenn.
The corporate footprint will be on everything from drug testing to security to building the Olympic stadium to providing ambience to deciding the start time of the men's marathon. A 92-foot Swatch watch will adorn a local building, McDonald's will place six restaurants in the athletes' village, an eight-acre Coca-Cola Olympic City will feature interactive games, and Daimler-Benz, the German automaker, has pledged to restore the crumbled house where Margaret Mitchell, author of "Gone With the Wind," was born.
Some $500 million worth of building projects, funded in large part with corporate money, will be available for local use after the Games. Centennial Park will enliven a blighted area of downtown. The 85,000-seat Olympic Stadium -- the first to have luxury suites -- will be downsized into the home of baseball's Atlanta Braves, while the track will be reinstalled at Clark Atlanta University. A new aquatic center and eight new dormitories will go to Georgia Tech, a basketball arena to Morehouse College and a football stadium to Morris Brown University.
 
Dissenting Notes From Sponsor Tune
 Not everyone, though, is smitten with the idea of strictly privately financed Games, which lack the safety net of a public bailout. The concept was developed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, after the 1976 Montreal Games went into public debt of $1 billion. Unlike Los Angeles, which used existing facilities and accumulated a surplus of $220 million, Atlanta has had to construct 10 new competition venues and refurbish several others.
Dick Pound, a Montreal attorney who is the International Olympic Committee's liaison to the Atlanta Games, suggested last year that the Games may no longer be awarded to a city without a Government committed to rescue any financial shortfall. Last week, Pound said he still believed that no organizing committee should pay for the construction of stadiums and infrastructure.
"Revenues should pay for the party, not the banquet hall," Pound said.
Organizers also have been criticized as elitist for giving special ticket considerations to politicians. Some have said that the reliance on corporations to provide atmosphere is confirmation that Atlanta's downtown is sterile and in danger of becoming indistinguishable from other cookie-cutter Sun Belt cities. Others believe it is excessive to build a $170 million Olympic Stadium for 17 days' use, then carve it in half for the Braves while bulldozing their current home, Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
Anita Beaty, co-chairwoman of the Olympic Conscience Coalition, said that despite a $75 million project to build 1,000 new housing units near Olympic venues and a $42 million Federal grant to renovate the Techwood-Clark Howell housing project near the Olympic village, Olympic construction would displace 5,000 housing units for the poor. She also said that she feared that homeless people would be incarcerated during the Games to prevent their appearance on the streets.
"The Olympics have become a commercial circus, using athletes and athletic events to make incredible profits at a cost of great human suffering," said Beaty, who is also president of the National Coalition of the Homeless.
 
Traffic and the Heat Could Mean Trouble
The most critical unresolved issue for organizers is traffic. The plan is essentially to turn Atlanta's downtown into a pedestrian mall, with cars intercepted at park-and-ride lots and spectators ferried to events on the local rail system and in 2,000 buses. The city is notorious for gridlock, and the recent Super Bowl was a traffic nightmare.
If Atlanta the city won't be the star of these Olympics, perhaps the Games themselves will. Eleven million tickets -- more than the Los Angeles and Barcelona Games combined -- went on sale in May. Athletes, staying for the first time in fully air-conditioned dorms, will participate before the largest Olympic crowds ever; the Georgia Dome, for example, will hold 30,000 spectators for basketball and gymnastics.
Still, Atlanta's claim of being the best Olympics ever will be diminished if searing heat debilitates any runners in the men's marathon, which will start at 6:30 P.M. next Aug. 4, a time when the average temperature is 80 degrees with 65 percent humidity. Several runners have said the heat will turn the race into a "death march."
Also, Michael Johnson of Dallas, the world's top-ranked sprinter at 200 and 400 meters and potentially the most dominant American athlete at the Atlanta Olympics, said he will not run both events at the Olympics as long as their preliminary rounds overlap.
"Whichever one I decide not to run is going to be a joke," Johnson said last month at the national track and field championships.
 
Vision of Showcase For Racial Harmony
 On display at these Games will be Atlanta's emotional history of the Civil War and the civil rights movement. Remnants of the Confederacy are still visible in the Georgia state flag; golf was hurt from consideration as an Olympic sport because of exclusionist policies at the Masters course in Augusta; volleyball was moved out of Cobb County after the county passed an anti-gay resolution, and Somali athletes looking for a training site were rebuffed by Barrow County over the treatment of American soldiers in that East African nation.
But Atlanta also served as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights pulpit. It is home to a large black middle class and six historically black universities. Minority-group members make up more than one-third of the organizing committee's employees and minority-owned businesses have been the recipients of one-third of the committee's contracts.
"I would maintain that in terms of black and white working together in friendship and cooperation and achieving significant success, we're the best example of that in the world," Payne said.
Andrew Young, the former Mayor and Ambassador to the United Nations, said the American South may free itself of an image of racial intolerance and backwardness during the Olympics, just as South Africa's apartheid-fermented reputation "got out of jail" last month when it was host to rugby's world championship.
"These will be the affirmative action Olympics," Young said. "Atlanta can become the center for the export of Southern idealism."
