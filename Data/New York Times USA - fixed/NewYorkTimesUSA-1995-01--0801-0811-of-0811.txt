HEADLINE: Governors Deadlocked on Replacing Welfare Programs With Grants to States

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Split along party lines, the National Governors' Association could not agree today on whether to endorse Republican proposals to replace existing welfare programs with lump-sum payments of cash to the states.
The impasse represents a setback for Republican governors and House Republicans who support such lump-sum payments, or block grants. The House of Representatives still appears likely to approve them; the outlook in the Senate is unclear. 
 After governors met in closed session, Gov. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, a Democrat, said "there was no consensus" on how much freedom states should have to redesign their welfare programs.
Three Republican Governors, John Engler of Michigan, Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and William F. Weld of Massachusetts, have proposed consolidating welfare, food stamps and more than 300 other Federal programs into eight lump-sum payments.
The proposal is supported by Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia. But Mr. Weld said, "We didn't have the three-fourths vote" needed for the governors' group to endorse such a huge change in the safety net for poor people.
Under the proposal, there would be almost no Federal restrictions on how states used the Federal money, provided that it helped low-income people in some way.
In effect, the governors have agreed to disagree, but they will continue trying to forge a compromise among themselves over the next 24 hours. At the heart of the debate is a profound question: Should the Federal Government or the states guarantee a minimal standard of living for all Americans?
Democratic governors said they agreed that states should have much more flexibility. But many contend that welfare should remain an entitlement program, guaranteeing cash assistance to anyone who meets certain eligibility criteria.
At a White House meeting today, President Clinton told the governors that he was willing to support a major change in welfare and Medicaid, so states would not have to seek waivers from Federal laws and regulations when they wanted to try innovative experiments in the two programs.
Mr. Weld quoted Mr. Clinton as saying, "The waiver system should be blown up."
Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., the Florida Republican who heads the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, said House Republicans were determined to establish a block grant for welfare. Each state would get a fixed amount of money, Mr. Shaw said, but Congress could set aside a small part of the total as a "rainy day fund" to help states that developed severe economic problems.
"We're not going to let babies starve," Mr. Shaw told the governors at their winter meeting here today. "We're not going to let Federal funds dry up in time of recession."
Leaders of the governors' association said the group would not endorse either a block grant approach or a new welfare entitlement program. Instead, the group may specify the factors that Congress should consider with both alternatives.
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who is chairman of the association, said: "There are not enough votes to endorse either a block grant or an individual entitlement. We may adopt guidelines so that our staff can lobby on both proposals."
Mr. Weld said that the 30 Republican governors were "unanimous for a block grant" but that the Democrats would not go along.
Mr. Thompson, who has worked closely with the new Republican majority in Congress, said: "The train is leaving the station. It behooves the Democrats to get on board and work with us on this issue."
The main Federal-state welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, is an entitlement program that now serves 14 million people. In hard times, its spending increases automatically with the demand and the need.
Democratic governors say block grants could leave children unprotected, especially in a recession, and could force states to raise taxes if Congress decided to cut the money designated for such grants.
"There has to be some protection for state and local taxpayers to make sure they are not left holding the bag," said Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana, a Democrat.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, a Republican, said she did not understand why the Democrats distrusted state officials.
"I am very puzzled by the premise that you can't trust states and governors to look out for their neediest citizens," Mrs. Whitman said in an interview. "I don't know any governor who is going to abandon children."
Mr. Clinton, a former Governor, said today that he favored "maximum flexibility for the states."
"But," he added, "we do have a national interest in protecting the welfare and the possibilities of our children."
The President said he wanted welfare legislation that "lifts people up without punishing children."
Mr. Clinton said he wanted to "push more responsibilities down to the state and local level," and he agreed that "there must be more state and local flexibility."
Finally, he declared, "we must pass welfare reform this year."

HEADLINE: Kemp Rejects Presidential Bid, Citing Dislike of Fund Raising

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Jack F. Kemp, a former professional football quarterback who became a successful political figure as an apostle of conservative economic theories, said today that he would not seek the Republican Party's Presidential nomination in 1996.
In a meeting with reporters, Mr. Kemp gave a variety of reasons for declining to enter the race. But time and again, he emphasized his distaste for the business of raising money. He said that for him to be a Presidential candidate he would have to start now to raise $15 million to $20 million, a task in which he had little interest. 
 "My passion for ideas is not matched with a passion for partisan or electoral politics," he said. He said that after considering a run for the Presidency in 1996, he decided that he enjoyed talking about policy issues but detested raising money.
"There are a lot of grotesqueries in politics, not the least of which is the fund-raising side," Mr. Kemp said. "You end up talking more about why you should vote for somebody or support somebody and less about what he or she should be supporting, what their ideas are."
Mr. Kemp, a former Congressman from Buffalo and the Housing Secretary in the Bush Administration, said that at fund-raising events, "I don't seem to be talking about the things that the fund-raising people want me to talk about."
Mr. Kemp's comments mirror the exasperation he had been causing among many of his supporters who had been pressing him to make a decision about the race. In recent weeks, some of his potential leading fund-raisers had decided to go with other candidates, Republican strategists said.
Mr. Kemp, 59, is involved with Empower America and the Heritage Foundation, two conservative Washington organizations. He is the second possible contender for the Republican nomination to withdraw from the race this month. Dick Cheney, a former Defense Secretary and Wyoming Congressman, said on Jan. 3 that he would not run for President.
With their withdrawals, the Republican field is becoming clearer. The most active likely candidates are Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader; Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Mr. Gramm is expected to declare his candidacy on Feb. 23, and the other two are expected to follow soon.
Also, former Vice President Dan Quayle has been saying his recent health problems will not be an obstacle to a candidacy, and he is expected to announce that he will run, perhaps in April. Other possible candidates are Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania; James A. Baker 3d, former Secretary of State; Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts.
Mr. Kemp would not say today whom he favored but said he would probably do so in the primaries.
Mr. Kemp said he was shocked that he was so heavily criticized by many fellow Republicans for his opposition to a California ballot measure in the last election denying most social services, including schooling and non-emergency health care, to illegal immigrants. Nonetheless, he said the criticism of his opposition to the ballot initiative, known as Proposition 187, was not a major factor in his decision not to run.
Proposition 187 was approved in the November election but is being challenged in the courts.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Speech By the House Speaker

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, to the National Hospital Association Conference here today, as recorded by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service:
I come here today to ask the American Hospital Association and all of its members to profoundly rethink your stance and your assumptions, to literally say erase the board. I don't care what your positions were as of 9 this morning, just drop all of them and rethink it. . . . 
 What I want to do is start a new dialogue. I want to propose to you that we need a new vision of health in America, which by the way, precedes health care. We need a new set of strategies for health in America, we need new projects for health in America, and we need different tactics for health in America. It has to start with a vision of health care within a balanced Federal budget, but with every citizen having far more responsibility than they have today.
I think it means going back to re-establishing customer status, which means you've got to have marketplace information available so people can call and say, "What do you do? How much do you charge? And what is your outcome like?" And they need to be able to do it before, not after. I think it means looking at the notion that the real gatekeeper ought to be the patient, that they ought to be able to see their bill, understand their bill and question their bill, and that they ought to have an economic interest in that bill, and that that ought to be true of everybody. And if you say, "Well, they're not competent or they're too sick," fine, then who's their guardian? But this notion of third-party gatekeepers negotiating on behalf of patients has led to a constant inflation and a constant increase in bureaucracy.
I want to urge you to set up a series of study groups to look at the Toffler revolution of a third-wave information revolution. I recently talked with a world-class biologist, who said we need to popularize the concept of the age of molecular medicine. We're on the edge of breakthroughs so enormous that they will transform how we deal with a whole range of particularly expensive lifelong debilitating problems that are genetic. But he said no one has yet got a clue to how rapidly the world knowledge base is going to increase in biology and how dramatically that could transform medicine. And if we could cut three to five years out of the transition from R.& D. to treatment, and if we could be networked to things like Internet, so that every doctor and every hospital has equal access, equal information, so that literally when you walk in, you're entering the world body of knowledge.
That takes rethinking medical school, it takes rethinking a lot of what we do. And I'll tell you, people like the U.S. Army are doing it. They're trying to design systems where a soldier who's been shot and has a particular problem, is by distance medicine being connected directly from the field hospital to the finest specialist on the planet.
Now we can do that for our young men and women in uniform because we have a large system, systematically thinking through it. But then we ought to transfer that to everybody else. . . .
There's no reason, in the age of the Internet, that if you have a disease, and you can't access the information personally, you can't learn about it personally -- I'm going to tell you, I've had several friends die of pancreatic and liver cancer. And several friends whose children were born with very unusual problems. The sophisticated ones, despite the current system, learn an immense amount on their own. . . .
That will cause a revolution and will lower the cost of health care. I had one doctor who's a specialist in diabetes has said that she thought we would save $10 billion a year by simply designing a training program for diabetics and a reward system for diabetics that maximize not going blind, not having amputations, not suffering severe disabilities, and learning to care for yourself in a serious wellness problem -- and the entire current structure of H.C.F.A. for payments, the Health Care Finance Administration payments basically say, I think it's $35 for a one-time educational visit, and then we're really not going to do anything to help you avoid losing your legs, but we'll pay as much as it costs to amputate your legs when you fail to take care of yourself.
Now, that is an incredibly anti-human and destructive model of dealing with people. So we should empower citizens and their families.
The answer to aging is not to build more nursing homes. The answer to aging is to design expert systems, decentralize care and the ability of families to take care of their own and to live as long as possible with a sense of independence and involvement. . . . But the current system says we're not really going to help you till you get sick enough that we put you away, and so we're going to maximize a program which maximizes your costs and minimizes your quality of life. Now, we should redesign that from the ground up, and we'll not only save money, but we'll save lives and improve the quality of care.
In addition, we ought to have a massive shift toward preventive care and wellness. And I know doctors that say, "Oh, my patients won't do it." My answer to that is nonsense. The fact is, you have more people trying to be fit than we've ever had in history. . . . And if we were to work at designing a system which rewarded wellness, if, for example, if your cardiovascular signs were good, we automatically gave you a deduction -- and I'd say for Medicare, if we had some system where people had a break at the end of the year if their cardiovascular signs were good, we'd be astonished how much it would shift behavior. . . .
Two last points. We are going to have a better Medicare task force. We are going to rethink Medicare from the ground up. The goal of Medicare, which is to insure that all of our parents and grandparents have access to health care and do not have to live their later years in fear, is a powerful and a legitimate goal. The current highly centralized bureaucratic structure offering one menu for everybody in a monopolistic manner is the opposite of how America works. And so we need to start from the senior citizens, with their help, thinking through how we get to a better Medicare system that actually works more effectively, that gives them greater choices, but that is also financially more honest.
And lastly, . . . we are looking at a Medicaid revolution which we work with the states to go to a very dramatic and bold block-grant process. That's something you have to be involved in and you have to play a major role in.

HEADLINE: Smithsonian Scales Back Exhibit Of B-29 in Atomic Bomb Attack

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
This spring, when the Smithsonian Institution displays part of the fuselage of the Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan, it will be accompanied only by a small plaque and perhaps a video interview with its flight crew.
Yielding to critics, the Smithsonian's Board of Regents voted today to eliminate the rest of the 10,000-square-foot exhibit that had been planned to commemorate the end of World War II and the 600-page script that was to accompany the bomber. 
 For months, veterans' groups and members of Congress have complained that the exhibit and script portrayed Americans as racist, raised doubts about the United States' rationale for dropping the bomb and underestimated the number of casualties that would have resulted if American troops had invaded Japan.
The complaints touched off a bitter debate about the morality of the bombing and the lessons of history, not only in the United States but also in Japan, America's leading economic rival.
"In this important anniversary year, veterans and their families were expecting, and rightly so, that the nation would honor and commemorate their valor and sacrifice," said I. Michael Heyman, secretary of the Smithsonian, in announcing today's decision to scale back the exhibit. "They were not looking for analysis and, frankly, we did not give enough thought to the intense feelings such analysis would evoke."
The scaled-down exhibit is scheduled to open in May at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum here.
Arguments over the original plan erupted almost as soon as it became public more than a year ago. Veterans' groups complained that the presentation undervalued their part in ending the Pacific phase of World War II and painted the use of the bomb as tantamount to a war crime. They said it should have explained how the United States entered the war and should have mentioned Japanese atrocities during the war.
Members of Congress and veterans groups had called for the dismissal of Martin O. Harwit, the director of the Air and Space Museum. Mr. Heyman said that he would look into the management of the Air and Space Museum, but would not say whether he would ask for Mr. Harwit's resignation.
"One doesn't make personnel decisions in the middle of passion and heat," Mr. Heyman said at a news conference here. He also said there would be no catalogue of the show and that items and artifacts relating to the bombing, lent by the Government of Japan, would be returned.
Some veterans groups said they were pleased with today's decision, while others, including the Air Force Association, remained skeptical, saying it would wait until the exhibit opened before offering an opinion of today's decision.
But several historians and groups like the Physicians for Social Responsibility, an antinuclear group based in Washington, decried the move, calling it censorship and arguing that the original exhibit provided a historical context for the bombing that would not be available now.
Gone is any discussion of the issues that influenced President Harry S. Truman's decision to drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and another on Nagasaki three days later. Japan surrendered on Aug. 14, 1945.
Gone are arguments over the morality of using atomic weapons. Gone, too, is talk of American lives saved by the use of the bomb or of the 130,000 Japanese who were killed or injured in the attack on Hiroshima, and the 75,000 killed or injured in Nagasaki.
After the veterans complained, several groups, including the American Legion, met with Smithsonian curators and, by late October, a compromise seemed to be in the making that would have preserved the entire exhibit. But the discussions broke down over the question of how many casualties the United States would have had if it had invaded Japan instead of dropping the bomb.
The veterans, who maintained that the exhibit underestimated the likely casualties, won support in Congress. Last week more than 80 Republican and Democratic members of the House sent a letter to Mr. Heyman demanding the dismissal of Mr. Harwit because of the controversy.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said President Clinton supported the Smithsonian's decision. He said the President conceded that academic freedom was an issue in the debate, but "nonetheless felt that some of the concerns expressed by veterans groups and others had merit."
But some historians and antiwar groups were bitterly disappointed by Mr. Heyman's decision.
"It was a tragic capitulation to political pressure," said Dr. Robert K. Musil, a historian who is director of policy and programs for Physicians for Social Responsibility. "It is reminiscent of the McCarthy era, when pro-military veterans groups intervened directly into what could be taught, learned or displayed about American history or American culture."
Dr. Musil said the American people had lost a chance to learn about the advent of the atomic age. "This is more than just about one bomb; this ushered in a whole new era, the atomic era with all its proliferation of weapons and environmental and health consequences," he said.
But leaders of the American Legion, which spearheaded the move to cancel the exhibit, said they were pleased with the decision.
The exhibit "was flawed from the start," said William M. Detweiler, national commander of the American Legion. "We don't have the complete picture, but over the past two months, it has become clear that the Air and Space Museum was committed to the negative message and intended to present it no matter what, or who, they offended."
The Enola Gay came to the Smithsonian from the Air Force in 1949. The historic bomber remained in storage in Suitland, Md., until the 1960's, when efforts to restore and reconstruct the plane were begun. The restoration began in earnest in 1984, when Mr. Harwit said he viewed it as a tool to teach the public about what led to the bombing of Hiroshima.

HEADLINE: Peso Plummets Anew on Fears Congress Won't Assist Mexico

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The battered Mexican peso plummeted today to its lowest point yet in the current crisis, driven down by mounting doubts that the United States Congress would approve the $40 billion in loan guarantees for Mexico proposed by the Clinton Administration.
The Mexican currency closed at 6.35 pesos to the dollar, down nearly 10 percent from Friday's close of 5.735. Its continuing decline disrupted financial markets and provided ammunition for officials here and in Washington who have warned that Mexico needs a rescue package to keep its economic crisis from becoming a financial debacle that could affect the rest of the world. 
 Scrambling to win support for his $40 billion loan-guarantee package for Mexico, President Clinton asked the nation's governors to endorse it and issued a bipartisan list of past Presidents and Treasury Secretaries who back the plan. But the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, said he was not sure when a bill could be introduced in Congress. [Page D6.]
In the six weeks since the peso was devalued and allowed to float against the dollar, it has lost 45 percent of its value, pummeling the buying power of most Mexicans and devastating Mexican companies in which many Americans invested.
The peso, which was worth nearly 29 cents before its devaluation on Dec. 20, is now worth less than 16 cents.
The dollar, too, was dragged down today against some other currencies, reaching a three-week low against the mark. And the peso's plunge sent American bond and stock prices falling, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 25.91 points. [Page D1.]
During the dark days of Mexico's worst economic crisis in a decade, neither reassuring telephone calls to key investors by Mexican officials, nor the statements of President Clinton and other Washington heavyweights have been enough to stop the peso's slide.
Opposition to the package, which would authorize $40 billion in loan guarantees but not loans themselves, has steadily increased on Capitol Hill.
Still, a senior Mexican official with knowledge of the negotiations described the Mexican Government as being "prudently optimistic," that the package would soon be approved. "The perception here is that a major effort is on in Washington," the official said, "and it is likely that things will go well."
Opposition to the loan-guarantee package has grown in Mexico, as well. Surveys in Mexico City have shown that an overwhelming majority of Mexicans oppose accepting such assistance from the United States, feeling that it compromises their nation's sovereignty.
President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon has sent his finance officials to Washington and New York on several occasions to take part in negotiations. Mexican officials said that there was now complete agreement with Washington on the fundamental contents of the proposed legislation, and most of the remaining discussion had to do with the economic and political conditions that are to be added to the support package.
The Mexican stock market took a beating today, for the fourth straight day, as investors grew pessimistic about passage of the American loan guarantees. The market index plunged 3 percent to close at 1,898.90, its lowest level since October 1993.
Mexican stocks traded in New York were hit hard, as well. American depository receipts of the bellwether Telefonos de Mexico fell $2, to close at $30.75 in trading of nearly 11 million shares.
Markets in Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Chile also fell sharply, in part because of Mexico's problems.
American mutual funds investing primarily in Latin America declined by 6.1 percent today. The funds have fallen 19.9 percent so far this year.
"Until there's some white smoke from Capitol Hill, people will just be waiting," said Jaime Campbell, a broker with C.B.I. Securities in Mexico City. "People are just buying dollars and waiting until things clear up."
As the peso tumbled, new doubts arose about Mexico's assertions that it was experiencing nothing more than a short-term liquidity problem. The Mexican central bank denied a report in The International Herald Tribune quoting unnamed American officials as saying that Mexico's international currency reserves had fallen to as little as $2 billion, which is far less than the $5.5 billion it reported on Jan. 9. If true, Mexico would be far closer to a technical default than had been believed.
Central bank officials called the report false, but would not give the current level of reserves. A spokesman said the size of the reserves would be announced on Wednesday or Thursday.
The assertions did little to ease doubts about the ability of Mexico to pay its debts. In New York, some investors said they feared the possibility of a forced restructuring of short-term Mexican bonds if the American loan guarantees were not approved. In such an event, the Mexican Government could arbitrarily extend the maturity of bonds, which could damage even further the dwindling confidence that investors have in Mexico.
"You wake up one morning believing you have a 28-day piece of Government paper, and surprise, it's now got a maturity of three years," explained Lawrence B. Goodman, vice president of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers in New York. "That would be an extremely negative scenario, and the fact that there is even a perception that this could occur shows how nervous the market is about being in Mexican investments."
About $25 billion worth of the short-term bonds, called tesobonos, fall due this year. This week, $1.3 billion of them are scheduled to mature, and investors are worried that there will be few takers at the Government's weekly bond auction on Tuesday. The Bank of Mexico said a modest $300 million in bonds would be offered for sale this Tuesday.
At last Tuesday's auction, investors took just two-thirds of the $400 million in bonds that were offered.
Mexican officials told New York investors today that they expected the International Monetary Fund to vote on Wednesday to approve a $7.8 billion standby line of credit it announced last week. Half the money would be available almost immediately and could be used to cover bond obligations, the officials said.
Despite speculation against the peso, which pushed it to a low against the dollar today, the Mexican Government did not use any of the $18 billion in swap lines available from the United States and other nations, and from commercial banks.
That fueled rumors here and in New York that the Mexican Government had tried to manipulate today's market instability to bring additional pressure on the United States Congress to approve the loan-guarantee package. Mexican officials, speaking off the record, said that the severity of the situation was already sufficiently clear.
Some investors agreed that the peso's continuing decline was a harbinger of what is to come if the loan guarantees were not approved.
"This is the type of scenario you're going to see every day if the package doesn't go through," said Eduardo Cepeda, managing director of J. P. Morgan in Mexico City. "For the U.S. to say that maybe Mexico can live without it, today shows the contrary."

Dollar Tumbles on Worries Mexican Aid May Not Pass

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled to a three-month low against the German mark and declined against other leading currencies yesterday as worries intensified that Congress would not approve a loan-guarantee package for Mexico.
President Clinton pressed Congress to draft a bill for $40 billion in loan guarantees yesterday. There is a broad perception among investors that without the package, Mexico's economic woes will hurt United States exports, weakening the dollar. 
 "A recession or slower economic growth in Mexico will mean a reduced market for U.S. exports," said Chris Iggo, international economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
There are also concerns that the Federal Reserve may be compelled to sell dollars for pesos to support the sinking peso.
Yesterday, investors fled the dollar for German marks and Swiss francs. Some traded in dollars for yen, as concerns about how the Japan will pay for damages from the Kobe earthquake faded into the background.
"Weakness in the peso cast a pall over the dollar," said John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at ING Capital Markets Inc.
The dollar fell as low as 1.5015 marks, its lowest level since Nov. 2. It was last quoted in New York trading yesterday at 1.5054 marks, down from 1.5150 marks on Friday. The dollar fell to 1.2672 Swiss francs from 1.2746 francs, and to 98.42 yen from 99.40 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5955 from $1.5890.
The peso fell to a record low of 6.35 to the dollar.
The weakness in the dollar came even amid expectations of higher United States interest rates, which typically bolster the value of the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments and deposits more attractive to foreign investors.
Currency dealers expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates by a half percentage point this week after a policy-making meeting that begins today.
But if the Fed does raise rates by that much, the dollar is not expected to benefit because the increase has already been factored into its value.

HEADLINE: Amending Mindlessly

 BODY:
The House vote for a balanced-budget amendment demonstrates the political potency of a bad idea whose time has come. That explains the overwhelming House vote for the amendment. Attention now shifts to the Senate, starting today, and the state legislatures as outposts of common sense. The amendment fails as a matter of politics. It fails as social justice. It fails as economics. Yet 300 House members, including 72 Democrats, signed up anyway.
The amendment would be inequitable because budget cutbacks would single out the disadvantaged. The G.O.P.-controlled Congress vows not to touch Social Security, defense or Medicare. That means it must cut an astonishing 30 to 50 percent of domestic discretionary programs. The first to go will be those housing and social-service programs whose only support is among the politically vulnerable. 
 Perhaps Congress could justify such a sacrifice of social justice and political principle if the country's economic future were at risk. Indeed, some of the more hard-fisted House supporters of a balanced-budget amendment relish its punishing side effects. But proponents overlook the downstream danger. In hard times, the amendment would require government to raise taxes and cut spending as the economy slows, inflicting further wounds.
Proponents also exaggerate the threat of current deficits, which are modest compared with the size of the economy, and falling. Fiscal prudence requires only that Congress keep the Federal debt growing less quickly than the economy. By that standard, deficits in the $200 billion range -- the current level -- pose no financial problem.
Deficits are expected to balloon toward the end of the decade, primarily because health expenditures under Medicare and Medicaid will soar. But with wit and will, Congress has all the tools it needs to bring future deficits under control. Cut defense, which is a fortunate possibility at a time when the U.S. faces no serious military threat. Cut corporate subsidies that pump tens of billions each year into undeserving businesses. Reform health care.
Opponents of the amendment need not despair -- yet. The battle is far from lost. The upcoming vote in the Senate will be close. If the vote is based on common sense, the amendment will lose. The danger is that some senators will be tempted to make the easy political vote in the faith that state legislators will be smarter than their Federal counterparts.
Right now, it appears that the amendment could not pass the 38 state legislatures it needs. Many governors, especially in states with large pockets of poverty, are taking note of the transfer of budget burdens that the amendment threatens. If Congress cuts out housing, food and education assistance, the states are left the choice of forsaking their needy or facing emergency tax hikes.
That, of course, is the real lesson of amendment politics. Easy, simplistic votes in Washington lead to hard decisions and higher taxes at the state and local levels. Passing this misguided amendment may fulfill the "Contract With America," but none dare call it leadership.

It's Like Parole

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Somebody on the Brinkley show Sunday asked Governor Whitman of New Jersey about the Republican "revolution" and she looked uneasy with the word, but then went ahead and accepted it, hedging that, well, it was "in some sense" a "revolution."
It was one of the few reassuring public moments we've had from a Republican since the media and Washington succumbed to Noot madness. 
 No Republican worth the name can hear the word "revolution" without at least an interior shudder of revulsion. This, I fancied, accounted for that ever so brief pause by the elegant Mrs. Whitman when she was asked to acknowledge that she was in league with Robespierre.
Noot himself, however, seems to like the "revolutionary" tag. He often manages to talk like one, using inflammatory excesses that make even his press claque wince. By talking of "zeroing out" programs, he has created a neologism for "liquidating" or "disappearing."
Revolutionary or not, there seems no stopping the Washington image projectionists. They have latched onto "revolution," and "revolution" it is going to be until the word loses its power to ratchet up excitement a notch or two. Holding the American audience that needs ever more ratcheting upward of excitement levels is as important to this crowd as it is to the producers of "E.R."
In the past week some wordsmiths have been floating the word "devolutionary" as a kinder, gentler alternative to describe the Nootish philosophy. "Devolutionary" looks and sounds lumpish, lacks fire on the tongue and needs a professor to explain what it means. I predict it will fade in the second furlong.
"Reactionary" would be a more accurate word for that part of the Republican Congress that is in love with "states' rights." Their passion for this discredited old doctrine reminds us how little American young people know their history.
And the House's new Republicans, whether "revolutionaries" or "devolutionaries," are unarguably young, the great majority having first seen the light in the baby-boom years.
To those who were parents in the baby-boom years the cry of "States' rights!" is a call not for revolution, but for the preservation of a Southern culture of apartheid.
That history explains why the states lost so much of their power to the Federals. "States' rights" to most of the nation came to mean George Wallace, Ross Barnett, Orval Faubus, Bull Connor, White Citizens' Councils, Ku Klux Klan dynamiters and other horrific enemies of what Everett Dirksen -- a truly conservative Republican -- called "a time whose idea has come."
People who know what "states' rights" meant just 35 years ago may admire the Republicans for taking up that threadbare old banner, but they also know it's not "revolutionary." The proper word is "reactionary." This eagerness to give states' rights a second chance is weird for people who don't believe in parole.
Well, they argue that states can handle matters like welfare better than the Feds because they are closer to their people's problems. It sounds reasonable, but the question is, "Do states have the will?"
Segregationist politicians made the same argument: Their states could handle racial problems better than outsiders because they were closer to their black citizens. The trouble was, they just didn't.
The quality of state governments varies crazily. State legislators in many are for sale cheap, at least compared with the prices for members of the U.S. House and Senate.
In Washington the system of financing campaigns with PAC contributions, which is a form of legalized bribery, makes members of Congress relatively expensive commodities for the lobbyist who wants laws written his way.
Giving Federal power over big-money matters back to the states seems likely to raise the prices state legislators want for their votes. It's hard to guess if this would be inflationary enough to make Alan Greenspan raise interest rates again.
I speak with mildly facetious cynicism, of course, for no serious person truly believes our state legislators can be purchased by malefactors of great wealth. Consider, for example, the splendid character of your own state legislator. You do know who he is, don't you? Ah . . . I see.

HEADLINE: Amid Glamor of the Ski Resorts Lurk Poverty and Exploitation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Now that there's no doubt winter has arrived, another ski season is upon us. In rural northern New England what this means is that thousands of vehicles with out-of-state plates are flocking north to the slopes. Somewhat less spectacular but every bit as important is the fact that thousands more seasonal resort workers are earning another paycheck. 
 Life is not easy in resort towns where the only major employer opens and closes its doors with the changing of the seasons. Domestic violence, teen-age pregnancy and
drug use is high in these communities. For many families, unemployment compensation and food stamps are the key to survival during the lean months between ski season and "leaf-peeper" season. Wages are no higher than in other service industries, benefits are nil, and 60-hour workweeks are required around the holidays and other busy times.
Resort operators take full advantage of the fact that their lift operators, chambermaids and cooks usually have nowhere else to go. After all, family farms have rapidly become a thing of the past. Most of the mills closed down more than a decade ago; tourism is the only thing going in most of these towns.
Service workers everywhere deserve much more than they get under the present economic equation. But as a teacher who works with poor families in rural Vermont, I will only attest to the struggles I see locally. Poverty and exploitation are alive and well among the dirt roads and trailer parks of northern New England. Surely it will take more than a little bad publicity before resort owners start paying their workers a living wage. Creating real change will be up to the workers themselves, for the most part, especially given the current political climate. Perhaps a little more awareness on the part of the skiers wouldn't hurt.

HEADLINE: Cutting Capital Gains Tax Helps Investment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Contract's False Tax Promise" (editorial, Jan. 23) was refreshing in its clear exposure of your ignorance regarding basic economics. A general capital gains tax cut as proposed in the "Contract With America" would not "steer investment into unproductive assets" or encourage investors to "put their money where it would produce the biggest tax break." 
 Generally tax-rate considerations alone do not affect the choice of investment vehicles. A person selects assets that maximize returns on investment, regardless of whether gains are taxed at 28 percent or below 20 percent.
In fact, the capital gains tax stifles investment in more profitable assets because of its influences unrelated to typical tax distortions. The tax creates a transaction cost, which decreases subsequent investment capital and therefore provides a disincentive to change assets.
Hence a lower tax rate would encourage a movement from stagnant assets toward more valuable assets, for the penalties of such a shift would be lessened.

'Don't Tax, but Spend'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
What "The Contract's False Tax Promise" (editorial, Jan. 23) fails to make clear is the outright duplicity of the Republicans and the "Contract With America" on finance. 
 No small part of the Republican victory last fall was due to continuous chanting against "tax-and-spend" Democrats. The Republican response to victory, however, seems to be, "Don't tax, but still spend."
The simple truth is that the rewarmed Reaganomics proposed in the contract is deficit spending, as surely as any Keynesian plan mounted by the Democrats since Franklin Roosevelt and perpetually the butt of Republican scoffing.
Democratic "deficit spending" comes from the expense side of the budget; the Republican equivalent comes from lowering income -- taxes -- and is thus from the revenue side of the budget. The results, however, are the same.
No amount of hyperbole will change reality: The Republicans propose spending money they don't have, based on a spurious and disproven concept of how the economy will react.
