HEADLINE: A Remedy for the Rootlessness Of Modern Suburban Life?

BYLINE: By SARAH BOXER 

 BODY:
Attacks on suburbia are as old as cul-de-sacs. Suburbs have always been derided as bourgeois, consumerist and conformist. But now they have become the enemy of family values, too. That's right. Karl Zinsmeister, the editor of the conservative magazine The American Enterprise, has written that "suburbia is actually a fairly radical social experiment," one that can be linked to "the disappearance of family time, the weakening of generational links . . . the anonymity of community life, the rise of radical feminism, the decline of civic action, the tyrannical dominance of TV and pop culture over leisure time."
What is to be done? 
 A group of architects and planners who have named themselves the Congress for the New Urbanism have vowed to halt the spread of faceless, car-centered suburbs by promoting friendly, people-centered towns with corner stores and public greens.
They call for some old-fashioned things: walkable neighborhoods with a mix of residences, businesses and public places; straight and narrow streets; wide sidewalks, and no cul de sacs. They believe houses should be built close enough together and close enough to the sidewalks to define streets and public squares. Above all, they want strong town centers and clear town boundaries. No one, they believe, should live more than a five-minute walk from most of their errands. (Otherwise, what's to stop people from getting in their cars and driving?) And like their British counterpart, the Urban Villages Group, the architects favored by the Prince of Wales, they want to preserve old towns and cities through "infill," building on unused urban lots.
"No one can be opposed to those principles," said Alex Krieger, a professor of urban design at Harvard University. They are like "mom and apple pie," he said. Yet many new-urban towns have been scorned as cutesy, regressive and un-urban. The new urbanists -- or neo-traditionalists -- should instead be called the "new suburbanists," some say, because they are less interested in planning principles than in porches, picket fences and gabled roofs.
Seaside, designed in the early 1980's by Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and Andres Duany, two of the founders of new urbanism, is the oldest new-urban town. Built on a stretch of the Florida panhandle, Seaside was meant to foster community life and beach access. The houses, a pastiche of historical styles in pastel colors, are set close to one another and connected by straight brick streets and a network of sand walkways cutting through the middle of each block. When the town is finished, it is supposed to have 350 houses and 300 apartments, a school, an open-air market, a town hall, a tennis club, an amphitheater, a post office, and a number of shops, offices and beach pavillions.
If you're having trouble picturing it, think of the idyllic town in the movie "The Truman Show." That was no movie set. That was Seaside.
Since Seaside was built, new urbanism has won a lot of fans and building contracts. There are dozens of new-urban towns and projects built or under construction, including Celebration in Florida, Laguna West in California and Kentlands in Maryland. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is renovating some of its public housing according to new urbanist principles: more porches, more fences, lower buildings, narrower streets. Jane Jacobs, the author of "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," has praised the movement as "sound" and "promising." And publications from The Sierra Club Yodeler to The American Enterprise have smiled on the new urbanists.
"But is their particular vision of urbanization an innovative model appropriate to the 21st century," Michelle Thompson-Fawcett asked in the journal Urban Design International, "or is it regressive nostalgia?"
New urbanism is, by definition, nostalgic. Towns built on a human scale, with strong centers and clear edges, have been around for 5,000 years, said Robert Davis, the developer of Seaside and the chairman of the new-urban congress. It is only in the last 50 years, with the rise of modernism, he said, that Americans have forgotten how to build them.
The new urbanists want to induce neighborliness with architecture. In this sense they are utopian. Like the modernist master planners of the 1930's, they believe social change can be brought about through architecture and planning. The difference is that most of them hate modernism.
While the modernists "tried to get to the future by destroying the past," Robert Fishman, the author of "Bourgeois Utopias," said, the new urbanists "are reviving the past in order to change" the present. That, the new urbanists think, is why many architecture schools view them with contempt.
Most schools of architecture are "so in the grips of the modernist ideology and so defensive of the avant-garde that they see the Congress for the New Urbanism as fundamentally conservative," said Daniel Solomon, a founder of the movement. Peter Katz, the author of "The New Urbanism: Toward an Architecture of Community," said that the nation's most powerful architects, particularly those in New York, "laugh at the poor souls who live in suburbia."
Kenneth Frampton, an architecture professor at Columbia University, agrees that many architecture schools (though he excludes Columbia) have ignored some questions about land settlement. But what bothers most professors about the new urbanists, he said, is not their critique of suburbia or land settlement. It is their design ideas.
The new-urbanist charter says nothing explicit about what styles are acceptable. Yet because many new urbanists believe that modernism ruined American cities, nearly all of their designs rely heavily on building styles from the past. Kentlands in Maryland is full of Georgian houses. Celebration, Disney's village in Florida, is full of brand new Victorians and Colonials.
"What's upsetting" about new urbanism, said Mr. Frampton, "is that the imagery is so retrograde." It is based on a "sentimental iconography" as if there were something inherently good about Victorians, Georgians and Colonials and something inherently bad about modernism. To be fair, there were a lot of modernists in the 1930's who advocated low-rise, high density housing, he said. Besides, the kind of modernism that the new urbanists see as their enemy is a straw man. No one is advocating tearing down whole cities to make way for skyscrapers.
"If you want to look for the demon that destroyed Main Street in America," Mr. Frampton said, "it is not the modern movement but the American bureaucracy that opened the way for freeways and suburbanization." The railroads were deliberately undermined by the automobile industry, he said, adding, "That was an economic, a capitalist, operation," not an architectural one.
New urbanism has not attacked the root of the problem sufficiently, suggested Alex Marshall, who has often written about new urbanism for Metropolis magazine. "What new urbanism tries to do is imitate older communities that existed before the automobile" without getting rid of the automobile. But if you want to return to these older forms of life, he said, you "have to bring back the transportation system." If you simply change the way houses are built, "it's like changing hemlines."
New urbanists like to see themselves as radicals, said Mr. Krieger, who was once a supporter of the movement and is now a critic. But, he added, they are "no longer the radical fringe but conventional wisdom." Developers have begun using the term new urbanism to sell their projects.
That's not to say the movement hasn't had a good effect, Mr. Krieger said. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has dedicated $2.6 billion to "Hope Six," a nationwide plan to rebuild mid-century public housing according to new urbanist principles. From Boston to Cleveland to Helena, Mont., high-rise projects are being replaced by town houses with porches and fences. "That is the part of the movement that most impresses me," said Mr. Krieger.
The problem, Mr. Marshall noted, is that most new-urban developments are not urban at all. They are rich developments on the town's edge. "They are sprawl under another name," he said, and they are as restrictive as any suburban development. Most are privately run by homeowners' associations that give developers extraordinary control.
For example, in Celebration, Disney's new-urban town, the deed restrictions specify what kind of drapery, roofing tiles and political signs are allowed. "Disney has a history of making warm and fuzzy dog movies," said Evan McKenzie, the author of "Privatopia," a book on housing associations, but "they can take your dog if it makes too much noise."
"It's as if the people are saying: 'Who needs democracy? It's utopia already!' " said Mr. McKenzie.
People are looking for homeyness and safety, and they don't mind giving up some freedoms for it. In Kentlands, there is a gate in front of each entry into the development, Mr. Krieger said. "It's a decorative gate but it evokes the same associations as a real gate. It's a subtle form of 'Keep Out.' "
If decorative gates can evoke the same response as real gates, then maybe the look of neighborliness -- porches, wide sidewalks and village greens -- can evoke real neighborliness. Or can it?
The one big criticism about new-urban towns is that they are fake towns. Given that, it's curious that the developer of Seaside agreed to let "The Truman Show," a movie about a real man in a false world, be filmed in Seaside. The movie all but said, "This is not really a town but the shell of a town, an image of a town," Mr. Krieger said.
After the filming was over, the painted plywood storefronts that had been put up for the movie stayed up for months because the developer liked the way they looked, Mr. Krieger said. After all, looking like a real town is the next best thing to being one.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Team Backs a $2.2 Billion Loan for Hard-Up Ukraine

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: VIENNA, July 31

 BODY:
An International Monetary Fund team announced today that it would recommend a $2.2 billion loan to Ukraine, where the United States has showered assistance for much of this decade but where the economy remains crippled by corruption and a lack of reform.
The loan, small by the standards of recent bailouts by the fund but significant because of the political implications, will help Ukraine cover foreign and domestic debt payments due in August. 
 The tentative loan package is subject to a vote of the fund's board on Aug. 24, and the expected approval would clear the way for a first payment of $200 million to $250 million.
The agreement announced today followed visits to Ukraine last week by American officials, including Vice President Al Gore.
Mr. Gore said after meeting with President Leonid Kuchma that Ukraine would find it difficult to get an agreement with the fund unless the country made bolder economic reforms. Ukraine has a poor record in keeping its pledges, and in January the fund suspended a $542 million loan.
There was some question whether the steps announced by the Ukrainian Government this week to comply with the fund's conditions would translate into action.
Among the I.M.F.'s demands for the latest loan is a requirement to cut the Ukrainian budget deficit to 2.5 percent of its economy. In response, Mr. Kuchma has issued a series of decrees to raise revenue and slash expenditures. But these decrees could be overruled by Parliament, which is headed by an avowed opponent of the monetary fund.
Putting the best face on the situation, an American Embassy official said Mr. Kuchma had told Mr. Gore that he would push hard to insure that the fund's conditions would be met. The embassy official said that lately the Ukrainians had been presenting a "very different tone" to the fund.
Since becoming independent in 1991, Ukraine has been a critical focus of Washington's policy toward the former Soviet Union.
One of the early successes of American diplomacy in the region was persuading Ukraine to give up its nuclear arsenal, which was the second-largest in the Soviet Union after Russia's.
Washington has sent about $250 million in aid a year to Ukraine in an effort to insure its independence and bolster its economy, an amount that has made Ukraine the third-largest recipient of American foreign aid.
The Clinton Administration has justified the assistance by asserting that it would be difficult for Russia to become an imperial power again without Ukraine falling back into its clutches.
But foreign investors, citing rampant corruption, have largely stayed away from Ukraine -- the country has attracted a paltry $2 billion in outside direct investment. Industry and agriculture remain almost entirely state-run.
But under President Kuchma, Washington says, Ukraine has followed through on two important counts.
First, Mr. Kuchma is ambivalent -- but unlike Russia not hostile -- to NATO expansion. And this spring he agreed, under pressure from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, to cancel the sale of two turbines destined for a nuclear reactor in Iran. That made Ukraine's record on deterring the spread of nuclear arms much better than Russia's.
In canceling the sale of the turbines, Mr. Kuchma found an effective negotiating tactic with Washington.
Publicly, Mr. Kuchma has complained that his country was not compensated sufficiently for the loss of the $45 million order or for the loss of other commercial opportunities in Iran. Privately, Mr. Kuchma has told Washington that Ukraine should be rewarded for the cancellation in "units of I.M.F. funding," a Clinton Administration official said.
The head of the fund's mission, Mohammed Shadman-Valavi, who has been in Ukraine all week, said today that Mr. Kuchma had agreed to one of the fund's key conditions but that it would take time for his agreement to have an effect.
The fund demanded that the Ukrainians close a major loophole in their tax code that allowed energy companies to escape the value added tax, a kind of sales tax. Mr. Shadman-Valavi said at his news conference that a decree issued this week by Mr. Kuchma closing the loophole was subject to parliamentary veto.
It so happens that some of the most powerful members of Parliament are managers of Ukraine's major energy companies, including Yulia Timoshenko, who is head of the Parliament's budget committee and president of Unified Energy Systems.
Also, American officials said they were counting on the sudden good will of the Speaker of Parliament, Aleksandr Tkachenko, an avowed leftist and opponent of the monetary fund. In a letter last Friday, Mr. Tkachenko ceded Parliament's authority to pass the budget to Mr. Kuchma's Cabinet.
But there was debate among some financial analysts and diplomats about the legality of the move, since the Ukrainian Constitution says Parliament must pass the budget.
Mr. Tkachenko, who was elected Speaker earlier this month, has spoken repeatedly of his disdain for the fund, calling it of "dubious charity" and intent on swallowing Ukraine's independence.
But American officials were somewhat optimistic that Mr. Tkachenko would keep his word and allow the executive branch to decide the budget, if for no other reason than a special deal between the President and the Speaker.
Just after Mr. Tkachenko was elected Speaker, President Kuchma rewarded him with a big favor. Mr. Tkachenko was charged by prosecutors three years ago with embezzling about $70 million of Ukrainian and United States Export-Import Bank money. The Government issued a decree that wiped away the debts of Mr. Tkachenko's agro-industrial enterprise.

HEADLINE: Harvie Branscomb, a Shaper Of Vanderbilt U., Dies at 103

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Harvie Branscomb, the chancellor of Vanderbilt University from 1946 to 1963, who put the institution on the path to national prominence, died on July 23 at his home in Nashville. He was 103.
Dr. Branscomb was the first chairman of the United States Advisory Commission for Education Exchange, whose purpose was to keep alive the spirit of cooperation among Western nations and to combat Communism. 
 In the 1950's, he was chairman of the Commission on Education and International Affairs of the American Council of Education. He later was educational consultant to the World Bank and a chairman of the United States Commission for Unesco as well as a member or officer of other international conferences and organizations formed to counter illiteracy and foster education.
When Dr. Branscomb was named chancellor in 1946, he was only the fourth person to hold the office since Vanderbilt's founding in 1873. He proved an energetic and engaged leader.
By the time he retired, Vanderbilt was on its way to the top tier of American research universities. The number of full-time faculty members had doubled, faculty salaries had almost tripled and the number of buildings on the campus had more than doubled. The university's annual budget increased by more than 400 percent, and the endowment jumped to $88 million from $38 million.
From 1953 to 1962, the schools of engineering, divinity and law all acquired their own buildings and 15 additional residence halls were constructed. A history of the university, "Gone With the Ivy" (University of Tennessee Press, 1985), by Prof. Paul Conkin, asserted that at the end of Dr. Branscomb's tenure, Vanderbilt could count itself among the top 20 private universities in the United States.
Throughout his long tenure, he was a leading fund-raiser. In 1960, Dr. Branscomb became caught up in a fierce conflict that drew wide attention, over the expulsion of a black student from the divinity school. The student, James M. Lawson Jr., had been dismissed on grounds that he advocated civil disobedience as a leader of a civil rights sit-in in Nashville. At least a dozen faculty members, arguing that local ordinances had been used to deny blacks their constitutional rights, resigned.
Dr. Branscomb tried to negotiate a compromise, but wound up angering many African-Americans and their supporters on the faculty with his statement, "The law has been the basis for much of the Negro's progress in the past and is the guarantee of their continued progress."
Eventually, the dean of the divinity school, who had supported Mr. Lawson, was forced to resign, and Mr. Lawson completed his studies at Boston University.
In a memoir published in 1978, Dr. Branscomb acknowledged that "with the advantage of hindsight, it appears to me now that the best course might have been to bury the issue in administrative procedures."
In 1996, the Rev. Dr. Lawson, who had become a Methodist pastor in Los Angeles, returned to Vanderbilt to receive the divinity school's Distinguished Alumnus Award, at which time he was warmly greeted by Dr. Branscomb.
Educated at Birmingham College, later named Birmingham-Southern College, Dr. Branscomb won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, where he began his career as a New Testament scholar in 1914. He later published four books on the cultural and religious roots of Christianity.
While at Oxford, Dr. Branscomb was among the group of American student volunteers who worked for Herbert Hoover's Commission for Relief in Belgium. He and a fellow student daringly smuggled a letter out of Belgium addressed to Belgian religious leaders encouraging resistance to the German invasion then under way. The letter, published in The Times of London, led to the decoration of Dr. Branscomb and his fellow student by the Belgian Government.
After Oxford, he earned a doctorate in philosophy at Columbia University and later became dean of the divinity school at Duke University.
A native of Huntsville, Ala., he is survived by three sons, Harvie Branscomb Jr. of Corpus Christi, Tex., Dr. Ben Branscomb of Birmingham, Ala., and Lewis M. Branscomb of Concord, Mass.; a brother, Lewis C. Branscomb of Columbus, Ohio; two sisters, Dr. Louise Branscomb and Mrs. Charles L. Dill, both of Birmingham; nine grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren. Dr. Branscomb's wife of 71 years, Margaret, died in 1992.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Corporate Earnings, Hurt by Asia Crisis, Depress Shares

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Share prices dropped sharply yesterday, more than erasing big gains from the prior day, in a sign that investors remain troubled by unimpressive corporate earnings.
After having largely dismissed the Asian economic crisis, investors are finally awakening to the effects of a slowdown in the Pacific region, Wall Street analysts say. That slowdown may diminish the growth in corporate profits at home, and thereby stifle stocks for the remainder of 1998. 
 This prospect has caused several weeks of fluctuating expectations and volatile trading, pulling the major stock indexes down from all-time highs set earlier this summer. Many smaller-company stocks, which have been battered for months, are in negative territory for the year.
"This ain't pretty," Robert F. Dickey, a technical analyst at Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis, said. "We've been in a correction since April, but the big blue chips are finally joining the rest of the market, which has been crumbling for weeks."
Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.66 points, or 1.59 percent, to close at 8,883.29. The sharp drop came a day after the Dow rallied 111.99 points, or 1.3 percent. For the week, the average fell 54.07 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent.
Broader indexes were hit harder. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 22.28 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,120.67, and the Nasdaq composite fell nearly 2.5 percent to close at 1,872.39, leaving that index about 7 percent below its all-time high of 2,014.25 set July 20.
The swings in trading and sentiment have more than a few analysts worried about whether stocks can regain the momentum that has propelled one of the greatest bull markets in history.
Mr. Dickey and other analysts say the overriding concern among investors is corporate earnings. And the growing consensus is that despite a robust domestic economy, troubles in Asia and rising wage growth at home are depressing corporate profits.
With more than 80 percent of the companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500 reporting, corporate earnings are up just 1.7 percent from a year ago, according to I.B.E.S. International, which tracks earnings estimates. Analysts are lowering their third-quarter estimates.
Worries about corporate profits may have been aggravated by a Government report yesterday that the nation's gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent in the second quarter. Although stronger than expected, it was still a sharp slowdown from the first quarter's 5.5 percent rate.
"There's clearly a lot of nervousness out there right now," Philip J. Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management, said. "People are worried about Asia's impact on earnings, and this Asia problem is getting worse."
In contrast to stocks yesterday, bond prices rose slightly, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury down to 5.71 percent, from 5.72 Thursday.
Because investors have low inflation expectations, long-term bond yields have remained in a narrow range for much of the year. The 30-year bond has hovered between 5.6 percent and 5.8 percent.

Europe Says Yes to Arms Industry Mergers

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, July 31

 BODY:
Military industry mergers may be history in the United States, but in Europe they are very much alive.
France's decision last week to privatize its aerospace giant, Aerospatiale, shows that the process of sorting out European aviation and military industries is just beginning. 
 American military companies, by contrast, have evolved into a few giants, concentrated to the point that Lockheed Martin scrapped its bid for Northrop Grumman a few weeks ago. The Pentagon said the merged company would be too powerful, sending the message that further combinations were not likely.
European military companies, unlike their American counterparts, remain highly fragmented, with hundreds of small competitors struggling to pay for expensive research and development, even as national defense budgets have shrunk.
After the fall of Communism, European Governments slashed military budgets so much that they collectively equal only about half the Pentagon's $270 billion allocation.
This is the main reason why Europe wants its aviation and military industries to group into an enormous conglomerate, tentatively named the European Aerospace and Defense Company, with divisions that would include Airbus Industrie, the commercial aircraft manufacturer, as well as space and defense activities like military aircraft, missiles and weapons systems.
To be sure, Airbus has been a resounding success, getting half the worldwide orders this year for new jetliners despite bitter competition from its rival, Boeing.
Last week, Manfred Bischoff, chief executive of Daimler-Benz Aerospace, said that Airbus, which until now operated as a loose consortium of four European aircraft manufacturers, would be ready to start operating as a single company, probably a corporation under French law, by the first half of next year. The challenge now is building the rest of the new European aviation and military conglomerate.
"The real problem," said Nick Cunningham, aerospace analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London, "is putting the monster together."
The obstacles to such an undertaking are large. British Aerospace, privatized in 1981, is one of the most efficient and profitable companies, while Aerospatiale has a history of Government largess and bureaucratic management.
Moreover, as industries are merged and duplication eliminated, jobs will disappear. Deciding who remains employed will be particularly difficult because Europe's unemployment rate is roughly double that of the United States.
For Airbus, the chance to extend its newfound momentum by tapping financial markets and financing new products, like a planned jet for more than 500 passengers, depends on its ability to operate as a single company, with its own management and bookkeeping. European Governments agree. This spring, Bonn warned Airbus there would be no German Government money for the superjet until Airbus became a unified corporation.
But the idea for a unified aerospace and military company goes beyond the plans for Airbus.
Under a grand design proposed earlier this year by Germany, France and Britain, the big new company would be effectively owned by the present Airbus partners -- Aerospatiale, Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace, British Aerospace and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. -- plus private investors. Run by a single management, the company would consist not only of Airbus as its commercial aircraft arm, but other units for space technology, military aircraft and helicopters, missiles and weapons systems. Italy and Sweden, though not part of the Airbus consortium, support the plan.
The reasoning is that Europe's military contractors, without the influence of such a huge group, would wilt against the powerful American companies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon that emerged from five years of consolidation in the United States military industry. Earlier this year, the largest European companies -- British Aerospace, the market leader; Aerospatiale, the No. 2., and the No. 3, Daimler-Benz -- ratified the plan.
As part of that plan, the Government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin agreed last week to push the Government stake in Aerospatiale under 50 percent, bring in the big defense and publishing group, Lagardere, as a private shareholder, and give the Government a "golden share" to assure national security interests.
The carousel of mergers and acquisitions is now expected to begin in earnest to form the clusters that will ultimately be the planned European company's divisions.
Last week, Daimler-Benz announced that by year-end it will merge its space activities into Matra Marconi Space, a joint venture formed last year by Britain's General Electric Company and Lagardere. The resulting space contractor, with $2.5 billion of revenues, will be the world's third largest, after Lockheed Martin and Boeing-Rockwell. At the same time, Spain announced it would put 25 percent of its national aerospace group, the Airbus partner Construcciones Aeronauticas, on the block for private investors, and British Aerospace immediately said it would acquire a stake.
Of course, there is no assurance that the proposed new aerospace and defense group will succeed.
Indeed, even as Daimler and British Aerospace officials praised the French, they said they were continuing to talk with each other -- about first choices, like the shape of the new European company, but also about fallback positions, such as a possible merger of their own. "We're always talking with each other," said Simon Raynes, the British Aerospace spokesman. "All this talking is really about seeking solutions."
But reports of discussions between the British and the Germans have raised fears in Paris of a special British-German deal designed to cut out the French.
Moreover, Daimler's planned takeover of the Chrysler Corporation has contributed to speculation in France of Daimler's possible withdrawal from the aerospace business, to focus on automobiles. Daimler officials have denied that and said earlier this week that Chrysler could even create aerospace opportunities for Daimler in the United States.

Deal for Aerospace Unit
 LONDON, July 31 (Bloomberg News) -- BTR P.L.C. said today that it would sell its aerospace unit to a venture capital firm, Doughty Hanson & Company, for £510 million, or about $835 million, cash, extending a plan to trim its extensive holdings.
BTR, Britain's biggest diversified industrial company, said it would make a £190 million one-time profit on the sale. It includes the Standard Aero engine repair and overhaul business, a unit that makes turbofan engine parts and the Dunlop brake and rubber manufacturer.
The sale adds to more than £3.7 billion BTR has raised since September, when the London-based company put a third of its assets on the block to help revive a flagging stock price. Its stock still has slumped one-third since then on concern about a strong pound and Asia's turmoil.
BTR's shares rose 4.75 pence today to 151.25 pence, about $2.47.

Congress Cancels a Vote to Increase Visas

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
One week after announcing a compromise to increase the number of visas available for high-technology workers, Congressional leaders canceled planned votes today on the legislation under the threat of a veto.
Although supporters of the legislation remained optimistic about the chances of a compromise with the White House, the canceled vote dashed hopes of relieving critical worker shortages before the fiscal year ends in September. 
 The White House threatened a veto on Thursday night, expressing concerns that provisions to insure that American workers would not be replaced with cheaper foreign labor were inadequate.
The 65,000 visas available this year for skilled foreign workers were used up in May. Technology companies have been lobbying heavily for an immediate increase this year, saying crucial projects, including the repair of Year 2000 computer problems, have been delayed by the shortage of workers with the necessary advanced computer programming and engineering skills.
Among concessions the Administration is seeking is a fee on employers who sponsor foreign workers. The money would go into a fund to train American workers. The White House also wants stronger language to insure that Americans are not being laid off and then replaced with cheaper foreign labor and an arbitration process for American workers who think they have been wrongly let go.

HEADLINE: The Grand Central B.I.D. War

 BODY:
New Yorkers who understand the key role that business improvement districts have played in the city's revitalization may have been unnerved by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's decision to dissolve the Grand Central Partnership, one of the largest and best-known B.I.D.'s. The Mayor's action seems drastic, but his position is not, on the whole, unreasonable.
Mr. Giuliani's chief complaint is that the Partnership's president, Daniel Biederman, is also the head of two other midtown B.I.D.'s, at Bryant Park and 34th Street, creating a sort of mini-empire. Mr. Biederman's defenders say that the district operations are deeply intertwined, and that the smaller ones could not provide the present level of services if they were forced to stand on their own. That argument makes Mr. Giuliani's case. The money the city collects from neighborhood property owners for a B.I.D.'s use is supposed to stay in that neighborhood -- something that is hard to guarantee when operations are as blended as Mr. Biederman's seem to be. 
 The Grand Central Partnership's leaders seem ready to fight the city in court, a decision that could create a long period of uncertainty that would threaten all the gains the Partnership has made in improving the area around Grand Central Terminal. They appear to regard their organization as a private company that can do what it likes as long as the board of directors is pleased. But B.I.D.'s are actually public-private partnerships. There are now 40 B.I.D.'s in New York City -- The New York Times is a member of the Times Square B.I.D. -- and they have done a great deal to improve the cleanliness, security and atmosphere of our commercial districts. But if City Hall begins to feel that the districts threaten its prerogatives, the whole concept will be undermined.
Mr. Giuliani's position appears to be based on a reasonable conviction that B.I.D.'s should stick to a limited agenda, and remain both community-based and self-supporting. To end this crisis, Mr. Biederman must sever his ties with two of the B.I.D.'s he controls. The Grand Central Partnership should respond to the administration's other complaints about bidding procedures and keeping operations open to government scrutiny. Property owners who finance the Partnership's operations must protect their own investment in their community by making sure these things happen quickly.

HEADLINE: MONTANA JOURNAL;
Wide Open Spaces Lure The Best and the Worst

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: HELENA, Mont. July 26

 BODY:
Montanans are learning that their "last best place" label cuts two ways. It attracts land investors as prominent as Ted Turner and Charles Schwab. But it also attracts runaway loners as troubled as the Unabomber and Russell E. Weston Jr., the man charged with killing two Capitol Police officers.
Today, Montanans are saying it is unfair for the nation to judge a little-known state by its delinquents. 
 "We don't judge L.A. by O.J.; we don't judge New York by the World Trade Center bombers," Andrew H. Malcolm, the spokesman for Gov. Marc Racicot, said here in the state's capital. "Montana shouldn't be judged by its kooks."
Montanans emphasized this week that many of their state's notorious residents moved here from elsewhere.
Mr. Weston and Theodore J. Kaczynski, the convicted Unabomber, grew up in Illinois. In trials of members of the anti-government Freemen movement, based in eastern Montana, the state's juries have convicted people who came here from Canada and from Arkansas, California, Colorado, North Carolina and Utah. In the 1980's a sect based in California, the Church Universal and Triumphant, moved to a ranch north of Yellowstone National Park, dug bomb shelters and waited for the world to end.
"This guy Weston isn't a native -- it doesn't have anything to do with Montana people," Jim Allison, a retired cowboy, said this morning as he read a newspaper on Last Chance Gulch, the central pedestrian mall in this former gold- and silver-mining city. "They had the same problem in Texas after the Civil War. Every renegade, every outlaw, moved there. It got so bad they had to develop the Texas Rangers."
With a little prodding, Mr. Allison, a grizzled man in a straw cowboy hat, admitted that he, too, moved here from out of state -- from Texas.
Indeed, for the first time in decades, people who moved here from other states now outnumber native-born residents of Montana. Moreover, second-home owners are flocking to a state that is nearly the size of California, but has only 900,000 inhabitants.
Boosters of Big Sky Country would prefer that Montana's name be tied to these glamorous second-home owners: Stephen E. Ambrose, the author and historian; Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor, and a slew of Hollywood actors: Mel Gibson, Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Keaton, Jeff Bridges, Andie McDowell, Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid.
"A lot of people are drawn to Montana and Idaho because of the isolation of the mountains, because there are fewer rules and regulations, because there is a kind of mind-your-own-business ethic out here," said Robert Balch, a sociology professor at the University of Montana in Missoula.
Montana is the nation's fourth-largest state in area (after Alaska, Texas and California), but it ranks 44th in population. In this state with only six people per square mile, automobile drivers can cruise the Interstates in Montana during daylight unencumbered by speed limits.
"Montana has a certain mythical attraction to it that allows for 10 times as many people who live here to visit, to pass through," Governor Racicot said today, referring to the nine million tourists who are drawn to the state every year, largely in the summer. "The fact about Montana is that a huge amount of open space provides for a lot of privacy."
Some people say the Western penchant for self-reliance and small government might have been why the state mental hospital apparently did not conduct follow-up contacts with Mr. Weston in the 20 months since he was released, in December 1996. Doctors at Warm Springs State Mental Hospital released Mr. Weston after concluding that he was not a threat to himself or to others, and with the understanding that he would return to his family home in Illinois and continue treatment.
"Montana has no more mentally ill than the rest of the nation, but being so rural it is hard to keep up with them," said Dr. Nathan A. Munn, a psychiatrist in Helena.
But Mr. Racicot said the state was not at fault.
"Apparently, the Illinois authorities did not reach a conclusion that was distinctively different from Montana's," the Governor said. "Apparently, the F.B.I. and the Secret Service did not see the need for a higher level of security."
T. H. Watkins, a professor of Western history at Montana State University in Bozeman, also would not tar the region for its deviants.
"This guy, like Kaczynski, is an anomaly," Professor Watkins said of Mr. Weston. "He's a paranoid schizophrenic. I don't think the West did it to him. Why do we simply assume that the West breeds these characters? It doesn't."

HEADLINE: Dispirited Republicans Struggle for Foothold in West Virginia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W. Va., July 30

 BODY:
Sally Kay is running for Congress this year. But hardly anyone in her home state of West Virginia knows it.
As the Republican challenger to Representative Robert E. Wise Jr., a popular Democrat who has held his seat since 1982, she has no money, no campaign staff, not even a bumper sticker of her own. She has yet to make her first campaign speech and remains a virtual stranger to groups that typically support Republicans. 
 "My fear is that I'll start to get checks and I'll have to return them because I don't have a treasurer," Ms. Kay said, sitting in the cramped office of West Virginia's Republican Party headquarters here in the state capital. "I'm not abdicating, but without a treasurer, it's hard to run."
Ms. Kay's inability to find a campaign treasurer is only one example of the hard lot of Republicans in West Virginia, one of the few remaining examples of a one-party state, and a stark contrast to Republican gains elsewhere in the region.
Here, Democrats rule. As a legacy of strong coal-mining unions, the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and family traditions of party loyalty, Democrats have held sway over most of West Virginia's political institutions for more than 60 years. And it is unlikely that Republicans will achieve parity anytime soon.
In West Virginia, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2 to 1, a disparity that almost always works to the Democrats' advantage.
One exception is Gov. Cecil H. Underwood, who also served as Governor from 1956 to 1960. He won a narrow victory in 1996 by defeating a Democrat who was widely perceived as even more liberal than the out-going Governor, Gaston Caperton, who had served two terms. But since 1932, voters have elected only one other Republican Governor, Arch A. Moore Jr., who served two terms from 1968 through 1976.
Of the state's three members of the United States House of Representatives, only Mr. Wise faces opposition in the general election this year, as he did in 1996 when he won easily. Representative Nick J. Rahall 2d, who was first elected in 1976, faced his last challenger in 1992. Representative Alan B. Mollohan, who succeeded his father in 1982, faced his last in 1990.
A Republican has not held a House seat since 1980, and Democrats have held both Senate seats since 1959.
At the state level, Democrats have controlled the House since 1928 and the Senate since 1930, a dominance that was common among Southern states until recently.
In Florida, for example, Republicans won control of the state Senate in 1994 for the first time in 120 years and now have a majority in both chambers. Three years ago in Virginia, Republicans pulled even with Democrats in the Senate and, now with a Republican Lieutenant Governor as a tie-breaking vote, control it for the first time since the Civil War.
In West Virginia, Republicans have made marginal gains in the 34-member Senate, picking up eight seats since 1990, when they had a record low of one. But seats in the 100-member House have been harder to come by. Republicans picked up 6 in 1990 to reach 26 but no more since.
And it is unlikely they will make significant gains in this year's elections to fill all seats in the state House of Delegates and half the seats in the Senate. For the second election year in a row, the party failed to find candidates in more than 50 races.
The lopsidedness of a two-party system here has resulted in a state Republican Party that seems to exist in name only. Betty White is the executive director and sole full-time employee, with an annual salary of $19,000. She has a desk but no computer. Not that one is needed.
"Someone wiped our computer out in March 1995," Ms. White said, hinting at sabotage to erase the list of the state's Republican voters. "There were rumors about a virus, but I don't believe them."
The size and shape of the state party office reflects a grim reality for Republicans throughout West Virginia despite the recent efforts of a new state party chairman and a new group, the Republican Legislative Commission, to raise money and recruit candidates.
The absence of credible Republican challengers in more state and Federal elections reflects two chronic political conditions here, one feeding the other. The first is the star status of the state's leading politicians. The popularity and tenure of Senators Robert C. Byrd and John D. Rockefeller 4th have deterred potential challengers from both parties, including the three House members. And the House members' popularity has discouraged many state legislators from taking the next step.
Over the years, the overall dynamic has ushered in a certain ennui among Republicans, who have felt helpless to change the political balance. In a long conversation, Ms. White spoke several times of her unsuccessful efforts to raise money and to encourage people to run against entrenched, well-financed Democrats.
"The party has been pretty weak," Governor Underwood, who is 75, conceded in an interview. "I feel it needs to rebuild its base in the legislature. That's the only way we can build. We just can't depend on dissatisfaction from the other side."
Robert J. Gould, a 40-year-old lawyer and state lobbyist, said the party's lack of elective success led him to create the Republican Legislative Commission in 1994 as a vehicle to identify new candidates at the grass-roots level.
Mr. Gould said his narrow loss in the 1992 state attorney general race, his first run for public office, convinced him that many Democrats, despite their party affiliation, are more moderate than liberal and would be willing to vote Republican in certain elections. That belief, he said, was bolstered two years ago when Mr. Underwood's opponent, Charlotte Pritt, was widely perceived as a candidate too far removed from mainstream voters.
On the strength of his political connections, Mr. Gould began arranging fund-raisers with the goal of spreading the money among Republicans in elections where a Democrat appeared vulnerable. Through this year's elections, he said, the new group will have contributed $150,000 to Republican candidates for the statehouse.
In addition, the state's new party chairman, David R. Tyson, who was recently elected to a four-year term, said he had made great strides in raising money and generating new interest among Republicans across the state. Mr. Tyson said he was planning six fund-raisers to assist Mr. Gould's efforts.
But tugging against this kind of progress is the aversion of Mr. Gould's organization and Ms. White to working together even though Mr. Tyson insisted that he, not Ms. White, was doing the bulk of the work for the state organization and that he enjoyed a good working relationship with Mr. Gould.
Nonetheless, sparks have flown, leaving at least a perception of party disunity. Ms. White, who said she intended to resign soon, contended that Mr. Gould had intentionally undermined her by "promoting his own candidates while shoving others aside" and by tapping Republican donors for his own purposes.
Mr. Gould said his group was merely performing where the party had failed, searching out viable candidates and helping them financially.
Whatever direction the Republicans are heading, Mr. Tyson and other Republicans say any real measure of party progress will not come before one of the Democratic Congressmen resigns or runs for higher office, creating a rare opening. Mr. Wise has acknowledged that he is seriously considering a run for governor in 2000.
But even if the wait is longer, party leaders acknowledge that they have to do a better job of raising money, finding candidates and convincing voters that Republican positions are more in tune with their moderate views than the Democrats'.
"The state is changing," Governor Underwood said, referring to a diversifying economy that no longer depends solely on the coal industry. "With new jobs and new people, we have a different mix now. My instincts tell me that if we can capture that growth, we can build a new party."

HEADLINE: Study Says Trading Pollution Permits Would Be Economical

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Paying other countries to cut their pollution could be the cheapest way for the United States to help control the heat-trapping gases that cause global warming, the Clinton Administration said in a new economic analysis released today.
A system of buying and selling pollution permits internationally, as proposed by the Administration, would cut the costs to the United States at least in half and possibly by as much as 85 percent, according to a study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Many economists favor the trading of pollution permits as a free-market mechanism that reduces the costs of pollution controls. 
 "The world is filled with unbelievably cheap opportunities to reduce emissions abroad," said Janet Yellin, President Clinton's top economic adviser.
The study was intended to substantiate Ms. Yellin's recent testimony before Congress that the United States could meet the targets of a new international climate change protocol, negotiated last year in Kyoto, Japan, at a modest cost. She has estimated that the typical household's annual energy bill might rise as little as $70 per year, although others insist the amount would be far higher.
With the Senate balking at approving any treaty that does not include a substantial role for developing countries in the control of emissions, the Administration has struggled for more than a year to produce a comprehensive analysis of its proposals.
The study released today was attacked by critics on several sides of the climate debate.
Connie Holmes, the chairwoman of the Global Climate Coalition, a group representing large companies that oppose the treaty, called the report "smoke and mirrors." The Administration, Ms. Holmes said, had not faced up to the fact that many foreign nations oppose the idea of pollution trading.
Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who opposes the global warming treaty, said the report "gives every appearance of being a post hoc rationalization, full of tautologies and self-fulfilling, unrealistic or unprovable assertions and assumptions."
Some environmental groups strongly criticized the Administration, saying the study suggested that the United States, which emits more heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide than any other country, is seeking to avoid much of its responsibility for solving the problem of climate change.
"Their plan is to buy reductions abroad," said Gary Cook, legislative director for the climate campaign at Greenpeace. "We need to take the first steps largely at home."
The Administration's study was based on sophisticated computerized economic models, including one developed by the Battelle Laboratory in Ohio to estimate the economic costs of actions to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal heat-trapping gas produced when fossil fuels are burned.
The models suggested that the United States could meet its emissions targets, which require reductions of 7 percent below the 1990 level over the next 10 to 15 years, at an annual cost of $7 billion to $12 billion.
Energy prices would increase by amounts equivalent to about 5 cents per gallon of gasoline, according to these projections.
The models suggested that about one-fourth of the reductions in emissions would actually be accomplished within the United States. The rest of the reductions would be bought from other countries that were cutting emissions more than the treaty required, and therefore had surplus pollution permits to sell.
Ms. Yellin and Todd Stern, the White House's senior aide on climate issues, said today that these projections underestimated how much the Administration's policies would reduce emissions at home.
Ms. Yellin said the model did not take into account any of several initiatives the Administration favors to reduce domestic emissions of carbon dioxide. Among these are elements of its proposal to restructure the electric utility industry, to provide tax incentives for energy-saving investments, and to subsidize research into new technologies like solar power and fuel-efficient automobiles.

HEADLINE: Black Parents Say Learning Supersedes Integration

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
African-American parents are more interested in having public schools raise their academic standards than put their energies into promoting integration, according to a new survey by Public Agenda, a nonprofit research organization, and Public Education Network, a national umbrella group of organizations whose goal is to improve public education.
While 8 in 10 parents, black as well as white, said they believed that integrated schools could help improve race relations and were a laudable goal, the consensus of both groups was that schools should concentrate on academics. 
 "We've spent a lot of time on race issues, and we need to redirect some of those energies to getting our children better educated," said a black parent from Pennsylvania in one of the follow-up telephone interviews with parents who had taken part in the survey, which was released this week.
Half of the black parents polled and 72 percent of the white parents said they thought that integrated schools made little difference in the quality of the education their children received.
Furthermore, nearly three-quarters of black parents and 77 percent of white parents agreed with the statement that "too often, the schools work so hard to achieve integration that they end up neglecting their most important goal -- teaching kids."
The report is based on a national telephone survey of 800 African-American and 800 white parents conducted this spring. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points. In addition, Public Agenda held eight focus groups across the nation and interviewed 20 specialists in the field.
The study also called attention to fear among some white parents about integration. For example, one white parent in a Walnut Creek, Calif., focus group said: "They redrew the lines and brought in a large section of low-income-housing kids into my children's elementary school. Test scores dropped. These are kids that need help and they get it. But it dumbs down the curriculum, and it takes away from the gifted kids."
Three-quarters of African-American parents said race should not be a factor when choosing a teacher or superintendent for a predominantly black school district. "As long as he's doing his job, I don't care if he's green," said a black parent in a Cleveland focus group.
Among other areas of agreement between black and white parents was on the question of whether teachers should teach such values as honesty, respect and civility: 84 percent of the black parents and 83 percent of the whites agreed it was a good idea.
There was a sharp difference, however, in attitudes toward diversity. Sixty percent of the black parents favored it, while only 34 percent of the whites did.
Deborah Wadsworth, executive director of Public Agenda, said the big surprise to her and her colleagues was "the laserlike focus of black Americans on the need for achievement, rigor and standards, which must not be distracted by other considerations."
Irving Hamer Jr., an African-American member of the Board of Education of New York City, said the loss of interest in integration that the report revealed was "not surprising and somewhat disappointing."
Nevertheless, he said, he shares the view that educational quality should be the top priority.
"Society is facing cataclysmic change, what with technological development and the growth of the global economy, and once again African-Americans are being left out. If we want to prevent that, we have to focus, and the focus has to be on improved education."
The survey also studied views on standardized tests. Forty-four percent of African-American parents said the tests that are used to determine acceptance to college and eligibility for certain types of financial aid measure "real differences in educational achievement," and an additional 18 percent said whites tend to score higher because black students have less faith in their ability.
But only 28 percent said they believed that the tests are culturally biased against African-American students.
Over the next year, Public Agenda, which is based in New York City, and the Public Education Network, which is in Washington, intend to sponsor community discussions on issues raised by the survey.

HEADLINE: Paula Jones's Lawyers Ask That Her Suit Be Reinstated

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones asked a Federal appeals court today to reinstate her sexual misconduct suit against President Clinton, arguing, among other things, that a lower court should never have excluded evidence about any relationship he had had with Monica S. Lewinsky.
In their brief, Ms. Jones's lawyers maintained that Susan Webber Wright, the Federal district judge in Little Rock, Ark., who threw out the suit four months ago, exceeded her authority in ruling earlier that any evidence of a sexual liaison between Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky was not material to the case. 
 The Jones legal team said evidence of a Clinton-Lewinsky relationship would have helped them show a pattern of how Mr. Clinton treats subordinate women in the workplace. The lawyers said Mr. Clinton had used his position of authority to engage in sex with Ms. Lewinsky, a onetime White House intern.
The brief said evidence about Ms. Lewinsky was relevant to "the core issue of whether he engaged in the conduct alleged by Ms. Jones."
Ms. Jones's suit maintains that in 1991, at a Little Rock hotel where a state economic conference was under way, a state trooper summoned her to meet in a suite with Mr. Clinton, who was then the Governor. By the account of Ms. Jones, who at the time was a state employee, Mr. Clinton propositioned her there, dropping his trousers and asking her to perform a sex act. The President has vehemently denied such an occurrence, although he does not dispute that he may have met Ms. Jones at the hotel.
What might have been a sensational trial was averted on April 1 when Judge Wright ruled that Ms. Jones had not presented any tangible evidence of damage, even if the encounter had occurred as she contended. "While the alleged incident in the hotel, if true, was certainly boorish and offensive," the judge wrote in dismissing the lawsuit, "the Governor's alleged conduct" constituted neither sexual assault nor actionable harassment.
Despite his victory, the Jones lawsuit had already caused enormous damage to Mr. Clinton, both politically and legally. It became the basis for the current investigation by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, into whether Mr. Clinton had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and then colluded with her to lie about it.
In a deposition taken by Ms. Jones's lawyers in January, Mr. Clinton denied under oath that he had had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Mr. Starr is investigating whether Mr. Clinton committed perjury that day.
Ms. Jones's appeal today was filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis. The court has a generally conservative cast of judges who have been consistently unhelpful to Mr. Clinton in other cases. But those judges have also been notably reluctant to entertain complaints of workplace sexual discrimination like the one brought by Ms. Jones.

Stocks Resume Slide On Worries About Profits
Share prices dropped sharply, more than erasing big gains from the day before, on persistent concern about unimpressive corporate earnings. Wall Street analysts said investors were finally awakening to the effects of the slowdown in Asia, which could diminish growth at home and stifle stocks for the remainder of 1998. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.66 points, or 1.59 percent, to close at 8,883.29. The sharp drop came a day after the Dow rallied 111.99 points, or 1.3 percent. Broader indexes were hit harder. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 22.28 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,120.67, and the Nasdaq composite fell nearly 2.5 percent to close at 1,872.39.

HEADLINE: U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT A SLOWER PACE IN THE 2D QUARTER

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
A powerful array of forces at home and abroad slowed the economy to a modest but still healthy pace during the second quarter, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department said the nation's gross domestic product grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate during April, May and June. It was the most sluggish quarter in three years and marked a substantial slowdown from the blistering pace of growth in the first quarter, which the department today revised upward to 5.5 percent from its earlier estimate of 5.4 percent. 
 The slowdown further unnerved Wall Street, where investors are already anxious over the ability of companies to sustain strong earnings growth. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.66 points to close at 8,883.29. It has fallen more than 450 points, or nearly 5 percent, since hitting a new high two weeks ago.
But growth in the second quarter was considerably stronger than had been projected by economists. Many had expected no growth or even a slight contraction in total output.
Although considerable uncertainties remain, not least among them the continued effects of Asia's financial crisis on the United States, the consensus among analysts is that growth for the rest of the year should be 2 percent to 3 percent, considered respectable.
Indeed, the details of today's report suggested that the economy had so far weathered the Asia crisis -- plus the effects of the now-settled strike against General Motors and a decision by industry to prune large stockpiles of unsold goods -- without much fundamental damage or any serious risk of recession.
While export-oriented manufacturers and farmers are suffering from Asia's problems, many of the forces that have driven the seven-year expansion remained very much intact, especially strong growth in spending by consumers and businesses within the United States.
The report showed that domestic final sales, an indicator of domestic demand, surged 6.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 6.6 percent gain in the first quarter, as consumers continued to spend freely and businesses continued to invest in new equipment.
Personal consumption increased 5.8 percent in the quarter, down from 6.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Capital spending by businesses rose 17.8 percent, roughly half the rate of the previous quarter but still a vibrant pace.
The report also suggested that inflation remained dormant, with the main price index rising eight-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, down from nine-tenths of 1 percent in the first three months of the year.
"The economy has taken a lot and come through it well," said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities in New York.
Like many economists, Mr. Rippe said it was unclear how strong growth would be for the rest of the year, and that much depended on the situation in Asia.
Today's report was a preliminary estimate by the Commerce Department, and it will almost certainly be revised as new data come in.
Still, officials at the White House expressed relief that the economy, the cornerstone of President Clinton's political support, continued to show considerable resilience.
At a news conference in the Rose Garden, Mr. Clinton said that while "growth in the second quarter of 1998 was more moderate than the truly remarkable first quarter, it shows that our economy continues to enjoy steady growth."
The slowdown seems unlikely to have any immediate effect on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, economists said. The Fed's most aggressive inflation fighters will continue to focus on the combination of low unemployment and strong demand, while another contingent, including Alan Greenspan, the chairman, seems willing to keep rates unchanged as long as there are no clear signs of broad-based increases in wages and prices.
The second quarter's 1.4 percent growth rate followed six consecutive quarters in which growth was 3 percent or higher, a streak that was accompanied by falling unemployment and little or no inflation.
But much of the slowdown was caused by temporary factors that are unlikely to persist. Commerce Department economists estimated that the strike that crippled General Motors subtracted about one percentage point from gross domestic product during the second quarter. Because the strike was not settled until this week, it will also depress third- quarter growth somewhat, but economists said G.M. would likely try to make up for lost production, helping to strengthen growth by the end of the year.
The sharp downturn in exports to Asia and increased competition from imports took another two to two and a half percentage points off second-quarter growth rates, economists said. Decisions by companies to reduce production to work off some of the big inventories they had amassed in the first quarter also reduced growth by around two percentage points, they said.
Most analysts say the inventory adjustment is now largely complete, removing one impediment to more robust growth. With the G.M. strike settled, the big question remains how much of a drag Asia will have on exports for the rest of the year, with some economists saying the worst is past and others saying the deterioration will continue.
Some analysts also think there could be a downturn coming in consumer demand, which has been fed by the strong stock market, low unemployment and high levels of consumer confidence.
The Commerce Department report showed that the personal savings rate plummeted in the second quarter to six-tenths of 1 percent from 1.2 percent in the first quarter and 3.5 percent in 1994. Economists at Chase Securities in New York said in a report today that the low savings rate could leave many consumers with little financial cushion if the stock market were to plummet.
Today's report from the Commerce Department also included revisions to economic growth statistics for each of the last three years, showing that growth from 1995 through 1997 was slightly higher than previously reported. For 1997, growth was revised up to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent; for 1996, the revision was to 3.4 percent from 2.8 percent, and for 1995 the change was to 2.3 percent from 2 percent.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the second quarter of 1998 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: A Slaughter of Cormorants in Angler Country

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
The double-crested cormorant is a protected species, its safety guarded by Federal law. But on the Lake Ontario shoreline west of Watertown, N.Y., the long-necked black birds have become a pest to anglers, who say the growing colonies of cormorants are devouring smallmouth bass and, along with them, the livelihood of people who sell bait and run charter fishing trips.
This week, wildlife officials visiting an island nesting ground in eastern Lake Ontario made the grim discovery of more than 800 cormorants slaughtered by shotgun fire. Although they have no suspects and have made no arrests, officials say they think the festering conflict between conservation and commerce is the motive in what they are calling one of the worst mass killings of a federally protected bird species in recent years. 
 New York State biologists said that when they went ashore on the uninhabited Little Galloo Island on Wednesday they encountered heaps of carcasses of fledgling cormorants, piles of shotgun shells and starving chicks squawking weakly amid the carnage. Clifford Schneider, who directs Lake Ontario projects for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said, "You see a young chick still lying there alive among all the others that had been wiped out, and you can't help but be moved emotionally."
The mass shooting appeared to be the latest of several recent instances in which a once-rare species has recovered so much that it has come into conflict with local interests. On July 23, Carrollton, Tex., bulldozed a rookery filled with nesting snowy egrets, little blue herons and other species protected by Federal law, after complaints of noise and odors.
The count of dead birds from that incident could be more than 1,000, said Pamela McCroskery, a spokeswoman for the Texas chapter of the National Audubon Society.
Around eastern Lake Ontario, fish-eating cormorants have staged a remarkable recovery since the 1950's, when they were nearly wiped out by pesticides and hunters.
In Henderson Harbor and other fishing spots near Little Galloo Island, owners of charter boats and other fishing-related businesses, joined by some officials, have been pressing the Government for several years to allow legalized hunting of cormorants, which they say are responsible for a drop in the populations of smallmouth bass and other popular game fish.
But with no action from the Government and the sport fishing industry in decline, there has been more and more talk along the shore lately of taking action against the birds, said Ron Ditch, a charter boat owner and guide for 43 years in Henderson Harbor.
"I've been pretty instrumental in trying to do this in a proper and legal manner," Mr. Ditch said yesterday. "But everyone's been hearing rumblings forever about how people are going to go out and take care of the situation. Apparently someone finally wouldn't be talked out of it anymore."
The controversy over the cormorants has centered on Henderson Harbor, a hamlet on a peninsula several miles from Little Galloo Island. The docks are a magnet for fishermen from across the country, some of whom spend $300 a day to charter boats and pursue smallmouth bass, salmon and other trophy fish.
The hamlet has nine marinas and more than 60 professional captains, and for many years, fishing has been about the only source of jobs or revenue, said Grover Moore, captain of the Charter II. "When I was growing up, there were signs at both ends of the harbor that said, 'The Home of the Black Bass.' "
But black bass, including smallmouths, have been hard to come by for several years, he said, and the fishermen say the birds are the only obvious culprit.
He said anglers had shot videotape of cormorants devouring freshly stocked brown trout to persuade state officials to press for a hunting season. "You can see them eat so many that they couldn't fly off the water," Mr. Moore said. "But nobody wants to listen to the fishermen."
Growing threats against the birds first turned to action in April, when eight cormorants were killed, Federal wildlife officials said. In June, about 100 cormorants were killed. But this week's massacre, which left 840 birds dead and more than 100 others wounded, transformed the local issue into an extraordinary environmental crime.
Mitchell Snow, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington, said a quick survey of officials there turned up no recollections of mass killings of a protected species that compared with the cormorant slaughter, except perhaps for the incident in Texas. "I've been with the department for almost 20 years and this is certainly the biggest in my memory," he said.
The long-necked diving birds have been protected for 25 years under the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the killing of ducks, geese, egrets, cormorants and other migrating birds without a permit.
Cormorants have made a comeback in recent years, amd the island now contains the largest rookery for those birds in eastern Lake Ontario, with as many as 8,400 active nests. The 52-acre island is owned by the Phillips Petroleum Company but is only used as a bird preserve, state officials said.
Fishing guides and charter captains in the area have increasingly pressed members of Congress to write legislation authorizing controlled, legal hunting of the cormorants to reduce their numbers.
Representative John M. McHugh, a Republican who represents the lakeshore area in northern New York State, complained last fall that the Fish and Wildlife Service was taking too much time to assess the impact of the birds on local fish stocks.
The birds can be legally hunted in only a few places where they pose a clear economic threat, for example at catfish farms in Louisiana, Federal wildlife officials said. But research on their impact, if any, on the fish in Lake Ontario is still in the early stages, the officials said.
Federal biologists have estimated that cormorants eat 400,000 to 1.2 million smallmouth bass a year in the eastern part of the lake. But the significance of that number depends on the age of the bass, said James Farquhar, a biologist for the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
"If those are newborn bass, that's a drop in the bucket," Mr. Farquhar said. "There are literally billions. But if those 1.2 million fish have already lived through several years, that is a significant number."
Yesterday, officials were continuing their investigation. Conservation officers were interviewing anglers and others who might be able to pinpoint suspects around the fishing town of Henderson and other spots on Lake Ontario. Offers of money for information were being made, but no specific reward was posted.
John P. Cahill, State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, said: "We're making an all-out effort to find these people and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. This was an act of savage brutality."
Killing a bird protected by the migratory bird law can result in a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in prison for each count, said Adam O'Hara, the special agent in charge of law enforcement for the Fish and Wildlife Service in the Northeast.
Mr. O'Hara said that evidence collected on the island, including more than 100 shell casings and some bird carcasses, was being sent to state pathology laboratories and a Federal forensic laboratory for investigating wildlife crimes in Ashland, Ore.
David J. Miller, the executive director of the New York chapter of the Audubon Society, said the shooting recalled the turn of the 20th century, when waterfowl and gulls were shot by the millions for sport and to supply feathers to the hat industry.
"This is a dark act that takes us back to that time," he said. He called for a swift investigation, and aggressive prosecution of those responsible.
"The message has to be strong that people really can't take the law into their own hands," Mr. Miller said.

HEADLINE: Joined in a Corporate Marriage, but Divided by Style and Vision

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
Long before Robert B. Catell and Dr. William J. Catacosinos parted company yesterday, the two strong-willed utility company executives had established themselves as men of such different vision and personality that their partnership at the helm of the Marketspan Corporation seemed destined for trouble.
Mr. Catell, 61, had been president of Brooklyn Union Gas since 1991 and its chairman since 1996. He is the jovial public face of a company that gives low-interest loans to struggling businesses, seed money to rehabilitate dilapidated buildings and a postage-paid return envelope with every gas bill. 
 Dr. Catacosinos, 68, was enveloped in an entirely different sort of glow during the 14 years he ran the Long Island Lighting Company.
His tenure was dogged by controversy over his frequent pay raises and by bitterness over the high electricity rates, the highest in the continental United States, paid by Long Island consumers. It is a measure of their deep enmity toward the aloof Dr. Catacosinos that Long Islanders still publicly scold him for not immediately returning home from vacation after Hurricane Gloria knocked out power lines -- in 1985.
"Many of us believe Lilco was an avaricious greedy utility that always put the interests of its shareholders ahead of those of its ratepayers," said Wayne Prospect, a former Suffolk County lawmaker who works with a citizens group opposed to the state-financed deal that broke up Lilco and created Marketspan out of some of its parts and Brooklyn Union.
"And Catacosinos," Mr. Prospect added bluntly, "was the architect of all that."
Mr. Catell evokes far different reviews. "He has no airs of the corporate titan sitting atop the great utility," said Kenneth Adams, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce.
Every summer, Mr. Catell is out in the sunshine at the annual chamber golf outing, part of the leading foursome with the borough's political elite. Once a year he returns to his Brooklyn alma mater, New Utrecht High School, and assumes the post of honorary assistant principal for the day.
"He's a Brooklyn guy," Mr. Adams said. "He knows everybody and everybody knows him. He has always been extremely visible and accessible."
Marketspan placed Mr. Catell and Dr. Catacosinos in a marriage of convenience that was not only short-lived but unsettled by their two very different visions of the company's future.
Mr. Catell, who served as chairman of the American Gas Association in 1994 and 1995, had already tried to steer Brooklyn Union toward a strategy of acquisitions of energy-related businesses, including distribution networks. He had said he envisioned building Marketspan into a diversified energy company to dominate the Northeast market.
During his brief term as Marketspan chairman, Dr. Catacosinos steered in a different direction that won praise from some stockholders. In meetings with Wall Street analysts and investors, he indicated that the company was on the block, available to outsiders for either a merger or acquisition.
While their corporate careers diverged sharply in matters of style and substance, the two men rose from similarly modest circumstances.
Dr. Catacosinos is the son of Greek immigrant parents who, he has said, impressed upon him the virtues of hard work and diligent study. He grew up in Washington Heights, earned a master's degree in business administration at New York University and then a Ph.D. in economics while working full time at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
By the time he joined Lilco, Dr. Catacosinos was a millionaire, thanks to the propitious sale of his start-up companies to competitors. He once attributed his success to what he called his "barracuda instinct."
There are echoes of that inspirational story -- minus the killer fish -- in the career of Mr. Catell. Born and educated in Brooklyn, he went to City College for undergraduate work and then earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering there. He joined Brooklyn Union in 1958 as a junior engineer, at first laying pipe in neighborhoods familiar to him from his childhood, and worked his way up the administrative ladder.
Once at the top of their respective utilities, the two men faced vastly different challenges that indelibly shaped their reputations.
Mr. Catell took over a well-established company with a community-friendly image. Its popular Cinderella program, which provides seed money to rehabilitate run-down buildings, had been in operation since the 1960's. Brooklyn Union rates were in line with gas rates elsewhere in the country. And, to its good fortune, the competing energy company in its service area, Consolidated Edison, had a reputation for poor customer service.
Dr. Catacosinos, on the other hand, inherited a company mired in debt from its partially built and wildly over-budget Shoreham nuclear power plant. Community groups were fiercely opposed to the plant ever opening and had as their ally Mario M. Cuomo, then the Governor. Shareholders were no happier with Lilco's stock price at rock bottom, largely because of Shoreham's troubles.
The new chairman got Lilco on its feet, but not without further cost to the utility's public image. He dumped Shoreham, but the deal with the state transferred to ratepayers the more than $4 billion cost of paying off the plant's debt. That guaranteed Long Island ratepayers the highest rates in the nation except for Hawaii.

HEADLINE: Goodwill Games Fail to Draw Crowd

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, N.Y., July 31

 BODY:
At the delicatessen across the street from the Nassau Coliseum, the Goodwill Games have been deemed a dud.
"Without getting too analytical, I don't think the games were promoted or marketed properly, and that's evident in the poor turnout," said Ralph Galdorisi, whose delicatessen windows have a view of the Coliseum and its vast parking lot, which has been noticeably underused since the games began on July 19. 
 Other business people, particularly sponsors or promoters, insist that the games, which end tomorrow, have been a success. They said they have been good for Long Island's image and its long-term prospects for attracting sporting events.
But many of the businesses located here on Hempstead Turnpike at the hub of the sporting events at the Goodwill Games had expected to be overwhelmed by people flocking to see more than 1,500 top athletes from 60 countries compete for gold and $5 million in prize money.
Three Nassau County sites -- Nassau Coliseum and the Mitchel Field Athletic Complex, both in Uniondale, and the new Goodwill Games Swimming and Diving Center at Eisenhower Park in neighboring East Meadow -- are being used for 9 of the 15 events. Six other events were held at sites in Manhattan and Staten Island and had similarly low turnouts.
The limited number of hotels in Nassau County and western Suffolk County were almost completely booked by the athletes, officials and employees of the Goodwill Games. But except for a few events such as diving, soccer and figure skating, there have been low ticket sales. Tickets cost between $24 and $48 for each event and up to $60 for final events.
Among those who chose to skip the games because of the high prices was Mary Ann Reardon, a librarian and archivist at Friends Academy in Locust Valley. She said she wanted to purchase tickets for her family and as a birthday gift for her husband. "But that's an awful lot of money for me, considering my family's other financial obligations, which include college tuition bills," Mrs. Reardon said. "When you start buying tickets at that price for the entire family, it adds up quickly."
Richard Finn, manager of public relations for the Goodwill Games, said that ticket prices were equal to those of most major sporting events in the New York metropolitan area. He said the games had sought to encourage family attendance by offering $5 tickets for children under 12. However, a ticket seller for Ticketmaster said today that he was unaware of the special $5 tickets.
Officials said they had initially projected the sale of 600,000 tickets for the games, but then reduced the estimate to 492,000. As of July 28, they said, 237,000 had been sold to the public, 20,000 given to sponsors and 80,000 distributed to charitable institutions.
Ted Turner, the founder of the games and vice chairman of Time Warner, the chief sponsor, recently stated that losses from the three previous Goodwill Games totaled $100 million.
The games get revenue from a variety of sources. The TBS Superstation, which is owned by Time Warner, is providing 45 hours of live prime time coverage. In addition, CBS has been scheduling 10 hours of coverage on weekends and HBO has been airing live coverage of boxing events.
Michael E. Lewellen, chief spokesman for the games, said this year's operating costs for the games were expected to be between $90 million and $100 million. He said it was too early to tell what this year's loss would be, but he said the games have already been a success for the children's charities that were promised contributions.
"We never expected to make a profit," Mr. Lewellen said. "We've met our goal of at least a million dollars each for UNICEF and the Boys and Girls Club of America, and we find ourselves in the best possible position yet of any of the games."
Michael Hollander, president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau, said, "As I see it, success is seeing Long Island every day on the Turner channel as the backdrop for the Goodwill Games."
Fred Parola, the Nassau County Comptroller, said the games were expected to add $2.5 million to the county's predicted sales tax revenues of $748 million for this year. "And if we hit that mark, it will be a welcome plus," he said.
Mr. Finn, meanwhile, cautioned against viewing the world from the window of a delicatessen or a single year's tax receipts.
"I don't think the impact of the games should be limited to just how much is pumped into the local economy and bars and restaurants," he said. "The fact is officials from around the world have seen Long Island and the great facilities here, and that should enable aggressive bidding for future national and international swim meets and track events. That's the legacy that will be left over by the games."

HEADLINE: Clinton Vows 'Complete and Truthful' Testimony

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
President Clinton declared today that he would testify "completely and truthfully" in the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation on Aug. 17 but said that until then he would have no public comment on the matter.
The President's brief remarks on the subject that has consumed Washington for the past week came as F.B.I. crime laboratory technicians began examining a navy blue cocktail dress that Ms. Lewinsky gave prosecutors on Wednesday. Lawyers say she told prosecutors that the dress contains a stain that could provide evidence of a sexual encounter with the President. 
 The President's testimony will be transmitted live to grand jurors on closed-circuit television, said a person with knowledge of the agreement. The arrangement met a central condition that Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, set in exchange for withdrawing a July 17 subpoena to compel the President's testimony.
Also today, Mr. Starr announced that he was taking an indefinite unpaid leave of absence from the Chicago law firm of Kirkland & Ellis to complete his investigation. Mr. Starr, a former solicitor general and Federal judge, had come under criticism for making nearly $1 million a year from the firm to represent such clients as the General Motors Corporation at the same time he is conducting a publicly funded investigation of the President.
Mr. Clinton, responding to a cacophony of shouted questions about the Lewinsky matter at a Rose Garden appearance today, held up both hands and said, "Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Mr. Clinton has said nothing since Ms. Lewinsky reached a deal with prosecutors on Tuesday giving her immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony about her relationship with the President.
"Everybody's got a question," the President said, smiling, after delivering a statement on the domestic economy and before departing for the Hamptons for a weekend of fund-raising and socializing. "Well, let me give you the answer to all of them."
He continued, "No one wants to get this matter behind us more than I do, except maybe all the rest of the American people. I am looking forward to the opportunity, in the next few days, of testifying. I will do so completely and truthfully. I am anxious to do it."
However, he added, "I hope you can understand why in the interim I can and should have no further comment on these matters. Thank you very much."
Mr. Clinton's personal lawyer, David E. Kendall, announced on Wednesday that he would provide testimony for grand jurors on Aug. 17, after months of resisting Mr. Starr's requests that he answer questions on the Lewinsky matter.
The President's lawyers and advisers had been deeply split over whether Mr. Clinton should subject himself to the risk of answering grand jury questions in an inquiry in which he is the potential target. But all agreed that Mr. Clinton should not speak publicly about the matter before giving his testimony, senior White House officials said.
Ms. Lewinsky spent much of the day with prosecutors from the independent counsel's office, who are continuing to prepare for her appearance before the grand jury. She is expected to meet with prosecutors over the weekend as well. No date has been set for her questioning.
Mr. Clinton's lawyers will spend the next two weeks assessing Mr. Starr's case against the President and trying to anticipate questions that Mr. Clinton might face. While Mr. Clinton plans to maintain an ordinary schedule of official activities over the next two weeks, he has set aside the entire weekend before the testimony for preparation.
The F.B.I. had not completed its initial examination of Ms. Lewinsky's dress by day's end, Angela D. Bell, a bureau spokeswoman, said. She said a determination of whether there was a stain containing semen or any other identifiable material would not be made until Monday at the earliest. And she said the information would be given to the independent counsel's office and not disclosed publicly.
If there is a semen stain, it would take "several weeks" to identify or eliminate any individual as the source, Ms. Bell said, although some experts on DNA testing said the matching could be done in a matter of days.
White House officials would not comment on whether Mr. Clinton would voluntarily supply saliva or blood samples for DNA matching.
Mr. Starr issued a statement late today announcing that he would drop his private law practice to devote full time to the Presidential investigation. White House officials and others have harshly criticized Mr. Starr for continuing to represent private clients while overseeing the independent counsel's office.
"Since my appointment, my duties as independent counsel have been my top priority," Mr. Starr said. "I have said that I would fulfill my obligations to my private clients, and I have done so. At this critical stage of our work, I am taking an unpaid leave of absence from my law firm until I complete my public duties."
Thomas Yannucci, the firm's managing partner, said Mr. Starr was currently in "no position" to represent private clients.
Mr. Yannucci said the indefinite leave was granted at Mr. Starr's request, with the expectation that he would return to work full time after the investigation was completed.
Told that some Clinton allies were spreading the word that the firm had nudged Mr. Starr out, or at least was glad to see him go, Mr. Yannucci said, "I'm not surprised, but that's completely false."
On Capitol Hill, Senator John Ashcroft, a conservative Missouri Republican and a possible Presidential candidate in 2000, said he would conduct hearings during the August recess on legal and constitutional questions arising from the investigation. Mr. Ashcroft said he would explore whether the President was subject to ordinary criminal prosecution while in office, or must first be impeached and convicted by Congress.

HEADLINE: Big Aid Bill Likely for Farmers Hurt by Drought and Rain

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Though most highly productive farm regions seem to be on the way to bumper crops, the drought in Texas and Oklahoma and the excess rain in the Upper Midwest are now expected to require an emergency aid package topping $1 billion.
Earlier this month, the Senate approved $500 million in disaster aid, about half of which would probably go to the Dakotas and Minnesota. With the drought growing worse in Texas, Oklahoma and parts of the Southeast, Congress is expected to increase the assistance before adjourning in October. 
 But on Thursday, Representative Larry Combest, Republican of Texas, said: "I think we're talking about substantially more. We're looking at at least twice that number and maybe more."
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told the House Agriculture Committee that the Agriculture Department would soon revise its estimate of the costs in the affected areas. Mr. Glickman said revision would come after the release of the Aug. 12 crop production figures, which rely on actual field surveys of crops to be harvested in the fall.
A Texas A&M University study has estimated more than $1.4 billion in direct losses to farmers because of the drought and $4.6 billion in overall economic loss. In Oklahoma, officials say the disaster could cost $2 billion in total losses.
That comes on top of repeated disasters in the Upper Midwest, where wet weather has spawned a wheat disease that has destroyed crops for several years in a row. In North Dakota, Mr. Glickman said farm income fell 92 percent in 1997 compared with the year before.
The House is expected to vote next week on a measure to permit farmers to receive on Oct. 1 all or part of $5.5 billion in transition payments. That money, which was scheduled to be paid next year, is intended to wean farmers from the subsidy system that was done away with in 1996 with passage of a farm law backed by Republicans. The Senate is expected to follow suit, and Mr. Glickman said the Administration supported the move.
Aside from the weather disasters, Mr. Glickman said the overall farm economy was in a tailspin that would cut income by $7.5 billion this year. Prices for corn, wheat, soybeans and other commodities are off sharply because exports have decreased because of the Asian financial crisis and huge crops have been produced worldwide.
Projected fall harvests here are again expected to be huge and farmers are taking on more debt, he said.
He said many producers will withstand the downturn because of the strong markets of the early 1990's and because production expenses actually dropped $1 billion this year because of low inflation, low interest rates and low oil prices.
In addition, unless weather patterns change markedly over the next few weeks, there will be big crops through the Corn Belt and other areas, bringing higher yields per acre that will soften the blow of lower prices.

HEADLINE: Eating Up the Summer;
With Tables Full, Restaurants Skip Traditional Break

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Just a few years ago -- or once upon a time, as the trend flies -- the high-end restaurants of Manhattan wouldn't have considered staying open all summer long.
As soon as their regular customers began to break a sweat, Le Bernardin, Lutece and their comrades in gastronomic tradition would begin to close their doors so their chefs and staffs could return to Europe for a month or so of recuperation on their native soil. After all, they knew that come September, everybody would return tanned and refreshed, kiss-kiss hello and live happily ever after. 
 But that was once upon a time. Now there is a new generation of restaurants, a new generation of chefs and an economically booming, improbably safe and increasingly clean New York City. In this hypercompetitive foodie climate, summer breaks -- "les vacances," as they are known in the trade -- have become a luxury only the most historically correct few feel they can afford.
For 17 years, when his restaurant was simply Le Cirque, Sirio Maccioni recalls, he would close in July.
"The important and rich people left after the last week in June, and the kind of tourists who came to New York had no interest in what we offered," he said. He smiled. Now his restaurant has been reinvented as Le Cirque 2000 and reopened in grand new premises in the New York Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue, and, he said: "We are open and we are very busy. New Yorkers may go away for a week, but they have to come back for business."
In fact, this summer, a lot of New Yorkers are making so much money that they cannot even think about going away for more than weekends at the beach or in the Berkshires. And they are jousting for tables with swarms of tourists bursting forth from overbooked hotels, armed with their strong currencies and their reviews printed from Web sites.
"Visitors from all over the world are now coming to New York with a list," said Daniel Boulud, chef and owner of Restaurant Daniel. "They absolutely must go to their favorites."
The result, said Diane Forley, executive chef at the restaurant Verbena, on Irving Place, is that "summer now is actually the height of our season."
If New York's top chefs are busier than ever this summer, though, it is not simply because their restaurants are mobbed. After all, what self-respecting chef is just a chef nowadays?
These entrepreneurs are building new restaurants, writing books, starring in television shows, opening cooking schools. They may be getting away, but it is generally for a day here and there. A working vacation. A vocational experience. A lecture turn. And of course, a book-signing or three.
"It would be crazy not to be open while the business is here," said Drew Nieporent, whose Montrachet, Nobu and TriBeCa Grill are booming and who is juggling the construction of three new restaurants (Nobu Next Door, Nobu in San Francisco and the new restaurant in the W New York hotel that replaced the Doral Inn).
Of course, a lot of less-fabulous restaurants never stopped for a long summer stretch in the first place. At the other end of the spectrum are the ever-fewer luxe places where the old ways are honored even now.
La Grenouille, on East 52d Street, closed last Saturday and more than 20 staff members returned to their native village, Gourin, in Brittany. The restaurant will not reopen until after Labor Day.
"We have always done this," explained Philippe Masson, the manager. "We work very hard in a difficult business, and if our employees did not take some real time off to refresh themselves, they would just run themselves down."
But La Cote Basque, the grande dame on West 55th Street, isn't closing at all this summer. Neither is Le Bernardin, that palace of poisson. Aureole used to close for three weeks during the summer. Not this year. The classic La Caravelle, accustomed to an August vacation, will be closed only Mondays and Sundays, and Lutece will close only Mondays.
"It is true that at the end of June some of the regular customers say, 'See you in September,' " said the restaurateur David Bouley, "but now they are being replaced by a strong international client base" at the 40-seat dining space in his Bouley Bakery in TriBeCa.
Mr. Maccioni agreed. "European people are telling you now that they like to come to New York just to eat -- and they never said that 20 years ago," he said. "The whole level has gone up, yet the price in New York is a bargain. In France the food in a great restaurant will cost $150 alone."
This state of affairs has produced a certain warm-weather inversion of the usual weekday-weekend rhythm. On weekends -- when everyone is rushing to get away to make up for the vacations they are not taking -- there are often good tables to be had. But weekdays can be as jammed as a Saturday night in winter.
"I'm going to be working here most of the summer," said John Raphael, a money manager for a Swiss company. He was making the best of his imprisonment the other day at Jean Georges, overlooking the beige umbrellas of the outdoor terrace on Central Park West and savoring slow-baked salmon in a tarragon-and-caper sabayon sauce.
"My friends and family members are taking shorter vacations," he added. "And with working couples, when one partner can get away, the other can't."
Not that all of the summer-stranded seem to mind terribly much. "All the psychiatrists are gone and the people talk to each other, so New York in the summer is delightful," said the actor Ron Silver, tucking into the braised veal kidneys at Le Cirque 2000. "Everyone seems to be around -- the place is mobbed."
There is competition for more than customers this summer. "If you close for a few weeks these days, you'll lose your wait staff," said Vincent Scotto, the chef who opened Fresco and presided over the kitchen there for four years. But instead of losing his staff this summer, Mr. Scotto is actually hiring one: preparing to open Scopa, a new restaurant celebrating upscale pasta and pizza.
This summer some restaurants are closing for nontraditional reasons. For the first time, Mr. Boulud is shuttering Daniel, for seven weeks.
But instead of taking a vacation, he is moving Daniel to East 65th Street, in the space formerly occupied by Le Cirque. At the same time, in the old space on East 76th Street, he is building the new Cafe Boulud. There, he and his sous chefs "will turn the restaurant into a cooking studio, as we train on the new menu and use the space to create a Cafe Boulud cookbook," he said.
Other restaurateurs who are definitely not taking a long break include the 64-year-old Mr. Maccioni, who is opening two restaurants at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., Le Cirque and Osteria del Circo. Similarly, the 43-year-old Mr. Nieporent said he would be "taking working vacations on Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket," where, of course, he has restaurants.
Since Butterfield 81 opened so recently to strong reviews in May, Tom Valenti, the 39-year-old executive chef, will be lucky to be able to take a day here or there at his house in upstate New York, near the Beaverkill River, one of the nation's great trout streams.
"I enjoy the meditative quality of it," he said of the angling. "It's so focused, and so quiet. You know -- the antithesis of a kitchen."
But these days it is the quest for the perfect wave that fills the soul of John Schenk, who opened the Monkey Bar and is now, at 43, the chef at Clementine. In July he has been so busy that he has been working the line six nights a week, visiting his summer rental in Napeague, near Montauk, when he can.
"This summer, it's surf or die," he said. "In surfing you get knocked down more than you stay up, just like cooking. The idea is to keep getting back up."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL BRIEFING;
Gay Issues a Problem For Illinois Democrat

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
Almost from the moment he won the Democratic nomination in this year's race for governor in Illinois, Representative Glenn Poshard, a downstate moderate, has been under pressure to move to the left on issues like gun control, abortion and gay rights. If he does not, party leaders say, he may not run well in the more liberal Chicago area to the north, which is where Illinois Democrats seeking statewide office tend to win or lose elections.
Worse, the party leaders warn, if Mr. Poshard remains fixed in the ideological middle -- his social conservatism is balanced by economic liberalism -- he risks the loss of some of his Democratic base to his Republican opponent, Secretary of State George H. Ryan. Mr. Ryan, also a moderate, supports gun controls and recently participated prominently in a gay-pride parade. 
 Mr. Poshard, who in the past has opposed same-sex marriage and expansion of anti-discrimination laws to protect homosexuals, skipped the parade, a decision roundly criticized by the relatively large and politically powerful Illinois gay community. State Representative Larry McKeon, the only openly gay member of the Illinois legislature, announced that he would not join other Democrats in endorsing Mr. Poshard -- just the kind of defection party leaders feared.
Now, with polls showing Mr. Ryan out front in the race by better than five points, Mr. Poshard seems to be moving toward repairing some of his fences on the left. His campaign manager, Josh Silverman, says Mr. Poshard plans to "open a dialogue" over the next few days with leaders of gay groups. Further, he has been discussing possible campaign strategies with Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who, as the first openly homosexual member of Congress, is probably the most powerful gay politician in the country.
"I told him that one early way to begin repairing the damage," Mr. Frank said, "would be to vote in favor of bills now before Congress that would extend and strengthen gay rights."
Gay leaders are skeptical that Mr. Poshard will moderate his views on the issue. But Rick Garcia, a gay Democrat who is the political director of the Illinois Federation for Human Rights, said the Congressman would deserve "high marks" should he open a meaningful dialogue.

DUSK
 By F. Sionil Jose.
 323 pp. New York:
 The Modern Library. Paper, $12.95. 
 JUST over a century ago, on June 12, 1898, at the bayside town of Cavite, a freshly minted generalissimo named Emilio Aguinaldo, then 29 years old, proclaimed the independence of the Philippines from three centuries of colonial rule by Spain. The month before, Rear Adm. George Dewey's squadron had destroyed the antiquated Spanish fleet in the Battle of Manila Bay. Aguinaldo's nationalist soldiers were already besieging the Spanish troops inside Manila in the climax of a three-year rebellion. After a visit from the rebels aboard his flagship, Dewey assured them that they could expect firm support from "the cradle of genuine liberty," the United States.
What ensued was something that no one could have foreseen -- not Dewey, who was anxious to go home to celebrate his victory, or Aguinaldo, now optimistically planning his new Government, or, least of all, President William McKinley, the small-town politician in the White House who had recently had trouble finding the Philippines on a map. After weeks of vacillating between the choices of alliance, protectorate and outright annexation, McKinley announced proudly that a prayerful night had given him God's approval for annexation of the Philippines. Inevitably, United States ground troops were mobilized in support of McKinley's deity.
America's first stumble into colonialism resulted in four years of grinding warfare with the disappointed revolutionaries before Aguinaldo's countrymen could be considered "subdued." The cost was a body count of 20,000 Philippine "insurrectionists," along with some 10,000 American soldiers killed, wounded or dead from disease. Over all, probably 200,000 Philippine civilians perished from famine, exposure and atrocities perpetrated by both sides.
For all its bad and brutal beginnings, American colonial tutelage had its good points. The "sentimental imperialists," as the historian Peter Stanley has aptly called them, brought with them education, health and public works programs. Guarantees of independence followed, climaxed by liberation from the Japanese in World War II. Rule from Washington also implanted in the Philippines a hopeless fascination with American mass culture, which came to cohabit with Spanish Catholicism, upper-crust elitism and Malay-Hispanic mores. As the old Philippine adage has it, revised after the recent two decades of brutal and venal dictatorship by Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda: "Three hundred years in a Spanish convent, 50 years of Hollywood and 20 years of 'his and hers.' "
So much for the outside view of the Philippines. In the novel "Dusk," F. Sionil Jose, a colorful author, editor, bookstore proprietor and all-round interpreter of modern Philippine culture, presents us with a belated education in how Filipinos view themselves. It is the last of his five-novel Rosales series -- best sellers in the Philippines -- but the first chronologically. Spanning roughly the past century, these books set out to tell the same kind of story that John Dos Passos told for Americans in "U.S.A."
Jose's work, however, is determinedly microhistory, played out on a small screen. Rosales, the town in central Luzon where the author grew up, is the center of the series. "Dusk," as Jose explains in his introduction, "is simply the story of a family, or rather of a peace-loving man who led his clan in its flight from the narrow coastal plain of the Ilocos in northern Luzon to the central plains. It is also a story of Spanish tyranny, and the Philippine response to it and to the American intrusion into our islands after the Spaniards left." He continues: "All too often, our history is adorned with heroes of high station; there is nothing written about the common people, the foot soldiers who die in the hundreds so that their generals may live."
The appeal of Jose's story lies in its simplicity. Forced off its land by the all-powerful Spanish administration, the family of Istak Samson loads its meager belongings in several carts and pushes its way into decent farmland and a new home. Istak finds himself a beautiful and compassionate wife and gains a reputation as a local healer, fortified by the literary Spanish and Latin taught him by his old priest-teacher, Father Jose.
Their journey is the book's subject, and it is told with such sympathy that the reader inescapably joins them. It ends sadly. After successfully evading the Spanish Guardia Civil, Istak reluctantly joins the revolutionaries and dies at the hands of American troops, on his way to deliver a message to Aguinaldo. The idyll is over. Istak's struggle to provide for his family is to be subsumed in a larger conflict.
Faithful to his own background, Jose has etched a black-and-white picture of poor farming families whose native courage and emerging sense of nationalism were ironically stiffened by the centuries-old faith given them by their Spanish oppressors. (Equally ironic was McKinley's announced motive for annexation: "To educate the Filipinos and to uplift and Christianize them," despite the fact that the people of the Philippines had been Christian a century or two before McKinley's Methodists got the idea.) The first martyrs to Philippine independence were native Filipino priests, executed by the Spanish administration.
The prophet of Philippine independence, Jose Rizal, executed by Spain in 1896, wanted only to provide his countrymen with a voice in Madrid's administration (taxation without representation, Americans might call it). Apolinario Mabini, the theoretician of the independence movement, borrowed heavily from the Enlightenment and the United States Constitution. He appears as a central character in Jose's novel, and his ideals give purpose to Istak's sacrificial death.
The story of Istak's difficult journey with his small clan from the Ilocos south to the coastal plain offers us an idea of the multitude of different peoples, speaking their own languages, who make up the modern Philippine nation. It was the late-19th-century struggle for independence that gave them a new sense of unity, as they fought against two kinds of imperialism. All too often, as the novel suggests, the bureaucrats and rich landowners -- the so-called illustrados -- were co-opted either by the Spanish or the later American occupiers. Even now, the gulf between rich and poor yawns wide and deep. Yet the sense of a native Philippine democracy has put down strong roots.
Despite the enormous amount of attention to multiculturalism in recent years, Filipinos have not received much notice. This is a pity. For their blend of European, American and Asian traditions, with all their inner conflicts, is about as close as one can come in East Asia to some kind of cultural fusion. Reading a book like Jose's in the centenary year of Philippine independence is good medicine -- for Americans, who may come to acknowledge the strong, persistent culture of a people once dismissed by William Howard Taft as "little brown brothers," and for the Filipinos themselves, who may learn that by going past the flamboyant politics of Manila's upper-crust establishment to give Istak's still neglected peasant people a fair deal would do much toward providing their country with the economy and polity that its old culture deserves.

FROM PLATO
 TO NATO
 The Idea of the West
 and Its Opponents.
 By David Gress.
 610 pp. New York:
 The Free Press. $28. 
 Where is the West? Even if the question is confined to America, the answer is not easy. Practically all parts of the United States except for those with their toes in the Atlantic have been included in "the West" at some stage. Zoom out for a global view and the question becomes almost nonsensical. The Western world includes a Japan-sized chunk of the Far East, among other anomalies. Global positioning satellites may nowadays guide your BMW home, but the West remains elusive. One achievement of "From Plato to NATO," by David Gress, a fellow of the Danish Institute of International Affairs, is to demonstrate that history can be as misleading as geography in finding it.
The story of the West used to be told as if it were a simple one. What Gress calls "the Grand Narrative" described "a synthesis of democracy, capitalism, science, human rights, religious pluralism, individual autonomy and the power of unfettered human reason" whose progress could be traced from its beginnings in Athens in the fourth century B.C. to its climax in 20th-century America. This narrative held sway in American higher education from around the 1920's to the mid-1960's.
Much of Gress's book is a retelling of that story, with the rough edges restored. On closer examination, the moral values of the ancient Greeks, for example, turn out to be rather more foreign to current ideas than some would have us believe. Hector's pride, for instance, is not easy to reconcile with what are taken to be Western ideals of virtue. Gress's account of the evolution of the idea of the West also has room for crucial elements that were often neglected, like the individualism and nationalism that the Germanic tribes -- formerly cast merely as invading barbarians -- brought to the feast of the Roman Empire.
As a historian, Gress is understandably more interested in historiography than some of his readers will be. Although the changing attitudes of German scholars toward Greece is indeed central to his story of how our concept of the West was formed, there will be those who want more history of the world and less history of history. It would be a pity if his sometimes tortuous historiographical arguments and difficult logic put off readers who will find here, if they persevere, an excellent account of Europe's complex civilization and its ideals.
Gress certainly believes that there is such a thing as a distinctively Western civilization. This comes out most clearly when he seeks to defend it against its recent opponents -- the post-modernists, ex-Marxists, muddled environmentalists and would-be communitarians who claim that 19th-century liberalism has conspicuously failed, that Enlightenment ideals are bankrupt and that Western technology is destroying the planet. These opponents of the values trumpeted by the Grand Narrative (who have been steadily growing in influence) are the targets of Gress's most vigorous and withering criticism.
He argues that the losses recently suffered by core Western values on the intellectual battlefield are partly the result of bad history. If we had a better idea of the roots of Western civilization, a more nuanced picture than the Grand Narrative provides, we could do a better job of defending it. Be that as it may, it would be hard to improve on the trenchant reasoning of Gress's penultimate chapter, where he lands resounding blows on the paradox of cultural subjectivism -- according to which all value systems are equally valuable, except the West's, which somehow manages to be objectively awful.
Among Gress's other well-found targets in this chapter are the confused post-modernism of Vaclav Havel, the meandering environmentalism of Al Gore and the briefly fashionable nostrum of "Asian values" -- of which one has heard little since last summer. Gress's defense here of rationality, science, technology and liberalism is, on its own, worth the price of the book.

A HOPE IN THE UNSEEN
 An American Odyssey From
 the Inner City to the Ivy League.
 By Ron Suskind.
 372 pp. New York:
 Broadway Books. $25. 
 EDUCATORS, reporters and more than a few Hollywood screenwriters have been telling, and retelling, the same story about American education for nearly half a century. Its elements -- in books like "Up the Down Staircase,"
"36 Children," "Death at an Early Age," "The Way It Spozed to Be," "Lives on the Boundary," "Small Victories," "Will My Name Be Shouted Out?" and, most recently, "On the Outside Looking In" -- are so familiar they've become cliches. Liberal teacher or reporter ventures into ghetto school, meets students resembling the sweathogs -- the charmingly delinquent, ethnically diverse, underachieving teen-agers depicted in the 1970's sitcom "Welcome Back, Kotter" -- and witnesses inspirational scenes of learning.
That this story bears repeating is a testament to how little the prospects of the nation's most impoverished students have changed since Brown v. Board of Education. But it's also indicative of the narrowness of the debate about education as a whole. To judge from these books, one would think that most classrooms are in terrible urban neighborhoods, when in fact a majority of American students -- including a majority of black students -- now live outside the city, where they attend public schools that their parents, at least according to polls, regard as good. Indeed, after reading Ron Suskind's extraordinary, formula-shattering book about Cedric Jennings, a poor black teen-ager at a blighted Washington high school who strives to attend the Ivy Leagues, one can't help concluding that we are no longer one country divided between black and white, but two nations even among blacks: the first increasingly middle-class and suburban, the second poor and disastrously isolated in our ghettos.
Almost everything about "A Hope in the Unseen" goes against type. Most books of its kind have the air of a travelogue; typically told in the first person, they are usually as much about the journey of the writer as they are about the students' experiences. By becoming a part of the narrative, the author -- who is almost invariably white -- operates as a kind of proxy for the race and class biases of the reader. Suskind, by contrast, is completely absent from his story. In a subversive twist on the genre, he allows Cedric to appeal directly to middle-class notions of merit. A nerdy, driven youth, whose grade-grubbing intensity would almost certainly annoy a laid-back teacher like Kotter, he is the very antithesis of a sweathog and is no different in his goals from many upper-class students in Greenwich, Conn.
Yet in the topsy-turvy world of the ghetto, his ambition exacts enormous costs. His single mother briefly goes on welfare to provide her son with the intellectual stimulation he needs before entering kindergarten. Even her steady Federal job can't keep the eviction notices at bay. Many nights Cedric must study without benefit of food, heat or electricity. Far from applauding these efforts, his father, a convicted drug dealer who spends most of the book in jail, thinks of his son as "a straight-A momma's boy who gets no respect from any of the kids."
In this sense, "A Hope in the Unseen" has more in common with memoirs of black aspiration such as Brent Staples's "Parallel Time" than with most of the literature of urban schooling. Although most education writers show greater sympathy for those left behind than for those who make it, Suskind suggests a far more troubling thesis: that at a ghetto school like Frank W. Ballou Senior High, a smart kid like Cedric may have it worse.
Cries of "nerdboy," "whitey" and "geek" rain down on him in the hallways. Gang members steal his books, mess with his hair and beat him up between classes. After one awards assembly, a student accosts him with a gun. Terrified, Cedric flees to the bathroom, but fails to report the incident for fear of retaliation. With the exception of a chemistry teacher who takes Cedric under his wing, adults at the school are hardly more encouraging. When a girl taunts him with sexual gibes, it's Cedric who gets ejected from the classroom; the principal describes him as "too proud" for his own good. Teachers seem to resent his brash and boastful intellectualism. Real self-esteem -- as opposed to the kind taught in courses -- is frowned on. Even Cedric's sole friend at Ballou, an obese girl who is as much a pariah as he is, scoffs at his dreams of attending an Ivy League school. "What kind of fool spends his life trying to go somewhere he ain't even seen?"
It's Cedric's profound belief "in the unseen" that sustains him. He and his mother are fervent members of a black Pentecostal church -- although even here the bishop warns him against trusting too much in his own abilities instead of in God. Nonetheless, mother and son pin their hopes on a summer school program for minority-group students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before Cedric's senior year. At first, he is thrilled to be among other smart black teen-agers and is amazed to discover that he, the "king of the Ballou nerds," has suddenly attained an "imprimatur of coolness" because of his ghetto background. Academically, however, he suffers a similar reversal. Although the top student at Ballou, he soon learns that his similarity to the "suburb-bred minority kids" who constitute most of the program is only skin deep. As the director concedes, "It would take two years of tutoring, not six weeks, to bring some of the inner cities' brightest up to a level where they might be accepted to M.I.T." Cedric returns to Ballou in despair.
Most "year in the life" books would end here, but Suskind relates all of the above in a stunningly economical 100 pages. Cedric remains almost irrationally determined to attend a brand-name school -- despite a combined S.A.T. score of just 960 (some 400 points below the average at most Ivy League schools). On a whim, he applies to Brown University for early acceptance and miraculously gets in. When Cedric and his mother arrive on campus, they spot "a tall, thin Caucasian girl with . . . a row of earrings and a shaved head." "Isn't that awful," his mother murmurs. "Must be chemotherapy." Cedric nods sympathetically. It's a comic moment of cultural confusion -- indicative of the greater academic and social disorientation he will initially suffer.
A trip through the bookstore leaves him dizzy with apprehension. Authors and subjects like Plath, Hemingway, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson sound only "vaguely familiar" or "draw a blank." He spots a biography of Winston Churchill. "Oh, God," he thinks, "I should know who he is," and tries to commit the name to memory. The point isn't that Cedric needs more rote learning, as "cultural literacy" is often misunderstood. Rather, he has no context in which to incorporate new information. In class, there are so many "references he doesn't understand -- he often feels like a foreigner." His failure is not a matter of effort or ability; he has simply never been exposed to much of the material.
Similarly, when assigned a research paper in his education course, he panics and turns in "an epic poem" about his own schooling; it's the kind of self-expressive exercise that typically invites raves from inner-city teachers. But Cedric's professor is not so patronizing. Although he praises Cedric's creativity, he insists that he master the analytical skills that he'll need to escape the ghetto. When Cedric aces a calculus midterm, his success is all the more sweet for being genuine.
Suskind underscores the crudeness of many discussions of diversity and identity without ever minimizing Cedric's very real struggles. College, Suskind rightly sees, is a time of experimentation and growth for just about everyone. The fierce antagonism that develops, for instance, between Cedric and Rob, his affluent white roommate, has as much to do with personal differences -- in music tastes (Cedric likes gospel and hip-hop; Rob, heavy metal), morals (Cedric avoids dating, dancing and drinking; Rob does all three) and style (Cedric is maniacally neat; Rob is a slob) -- as with weightier issues of intolerance.
Suskind also perceives the range among blacks at Brown. Many of Cedric's African-American classmates have spent years interacting with whites as some of the few minority-group students in prestigious private academies or in the tracked programs at top suburban schools. They yearn for black companionship and gravitate toward the black dorm, which serves as a cultural center. Cedric, by contrast, has spent his whole life among blacks and is more curious to mingle with whites. A subtler anxiety, however, underlies his attitude. "He was unnerved," Suskind writes, "by the brew of black coolness and youthful achievement" at Brown -- "a casual blend that almost mocks the brutal adolescent trade-offs he had to make to get here. He had dealt with this crowd somewhat at M.I.T., black kids . . . with bright futures who are as anxious to co-opt inner-city coolness as the white kids in the unit. The difference is that the black middle-class kids can really pull it off."
For many students like Cedric, the notion that anyone who works hard enough can escape the ghetto through education is an empty promise. The vast majority of Cedric's classmates at Ballou who do graduate either can't afford college or are so overwhelmed once they arrive that they drop out by the end of their freshman years. And what Cedric's success finally means, the reader can never know. For, in a mystifying decision, Suskind has chosen to write his book entirely from the point of view of a dozen people, much of it in internal monologues. Besides robbing his subjects of their voices and him of the opportunity to provide some badly needed background -- on affirmative action, the rise of Pentecostal churches or even the Jennings family finances (which the reader must piece together from scattered asides) -- the approach finally prevents him from ever accounting for his own impact on Cedric's life.
"A Hope in the Unseen" arose from a two-part series that Suskind wrote for The Wall Street Journal and that went on to win a Pulitzer Prize; the newspaper stories appeared before Cedric was accepted to Brown and attracted widespread attention. But the reader doesn't learn, until nearly halfway through the book, that a "Dr. Korb" happened to "read about Cedric" and began paying "for periodic tutoring and incidentals." Did his help improve Cedric's chances? Is it possible that Brown's admission officers read The Journal, too? And did it influence their decision to let him in?
Because Suskind can never break out of his internal monologues, he can't tell us. No one reading this book will doubt that Cedric deserves to go to Brown; if anything, his monumental efforts put to shame arguments against affirmative action. But one begins to fear that his ostensibly inspirational story may be more depressing than we know. For all Cedric's superhuman drive, it may be that the most crucial factor in his eventual success was dumb luck: that in 1994, a reporter named Ron Suskind took an interest in his story.

HOPE IN A JAR
 The Making of
 America's Beauty Culture.
 By Kathy Peiss.
 Illustrated. 334 pp. New York:
 Metropolitan Books/
 Henry Holt & Company. $25.
 
 VENUS ENVY
 A History of Cosmetic Surgery.
 By Elizabeth Haiken.
 Illustrated. 370 pp. Baltimore:

 What do women want to look like? Beautiful, youthful, desirable, unattainable. What will they do to get that way? More than 150 years ago, they dabbed their faces with the urine of little boys or rubbed their arms with lead-laced whitening solutions that sometimes killed them. Ninety years ago, they smoothed their wrinkles with paraffin injections, something that produced an unsexy side effect called "wax cancers." Some of them enlarged their breasts with paraffin; more recently, they went in for silicone implants, whose occasional leakage left some of them with far graver beauty defects than a flat chest. Although women once staunchly denied using even rouge, by the mid-1930's Vogue had declared the act of putting on lipstick one of the "gestures of the 20th century"; today, respectable suburban wives and daughters routinely resort to everything from nose jobs and face lifts to liposuction and rib removal, and no one raises a tweezed eyebrow.
Jonathan Swift once sourly imagined a painted Jezebel preparing for bed who
Seated on a three-legg'd Chair
Takes off her artificial Hair. . . .
Untwists a Wire; and from her Gums
A Set of Teeth completely comes.
But even Swift could not have foreseen the bone-crunching practices to which women -- and men -- willingly submit. When surgeons can turn men into women, women into feral apparitions from the isle of Dr. Moreau, and Michael Jackson into Diana Ross, the limits to which people will go in the name of beauty may exist, but it's hard to think what those limits might be.
Two excellent new books trace the evolution of self-image and beauty practices in this country. In "Hope in a Jar: The Making of America's Beauty Culture," Kathy Peiss looks at the subject from the outside in. In "Venus Envy: A History of Cosmetic Surgery," Elizabeth Haiken looks at the same subject from the inside out. Peiss's study, intrinsically more lighthearted, follows women as they move from the farm and drawing room to the mall and the boardroom. A professor of history at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, she documents their progress with a collection of quaint and deftly chosen vintage advertisements that show that while beauty ideals may change drastically, women's desire to embody them remains constant. In a Victorian illustration from 1881, mustachioed gents throng a bare-shouldered socialite, who leans forward alluringly, a cloud of frills cascading from her cinched-in waist. A young bystander wonders out loud: "Who is that lovely young creature on whom all the heavy swells in the room are dancing attendance?" An older man replies, "That lady is old enough to be your mother! . . . The wondrous preservation of her youth and beauty is due to that most extraordinary preparation: Laird's Bloom of Youth."
Some 60 years later, plump white arms were out, tawny fitness was in, and the world was at war. Ad men switched models and beauty products but relied on the same tactics, encouraging women to imitate the new svelte belle ideale with ads that showed a Venus in a work shirt, pausing mid-rivet to apply Tangee lipstick to her flawless mouth and to remind other war-effort women to do their bit "and a Little Bit More." Peiss acknowledges the popular view of make-up's detractors that "the act of beautifying, though it seems enticing and freely chosen, is really compulsory work, so narcissistic, time-consuming and absorbing as to limit women's achievements," but she does not share it.
Instead, she prefers to accentuate the positive, relating the sagas of such female groundbreakers as Annie Turnbo Malone and Madam C. J. Walker, two black women who turned home recipes for hair growing tonic into nationwide businesses; Elizabeth Arden and Helena Rubinstein, the rival immigrant glamour mavens who built cosmetic and salon empires and referred to each other spitefully as "that woman." At a time when nearly all businesses were run by men, these women and others turned femininity to advantage, identified a new market and successfully exploited it. Peiss gloats, "Women have used makeup . . . to announce their adult status, sexual allure, youthful spirit, political beliefs and even to proclaim their right to self-definition." For her, the lipsticked mouth is a red badge of courage.
Haiken, an assistant professor of history at the University of Tennessee, shows why women need that courage in "Venus Envy." Whereas Peiss showcases Vaseline-lens beauties and urbane cartoons, Haiken has a darker story to tell and she illustrates it with, for example, a two-page 1937 photo essay of a woman undergoing a nose job. One photo shows "the hump . . . being withdrawn through the nostril by means of a pair of clamps."
Americans are discontented with their appearance, Haiken finds, and many of the men and women who seek surgery are actually chasing ethnic anonymity and conformity. In a probing chapter called "The Michael Jackson Factor," she presents black, Asian and Jewish women who seek WASP noses and Playboy breasts. They are caught in the vexed immigrants' dilemma of struggling not only to keep up with the Joneses but to look like them, too. Cosmetic surgery became respectable only during the First World War, she explains, after courageous surgeons went to the trenches in Europe and tried to give young men back the faces that had been blown off under their helmets, faces that no longer had teeth or jaws. As one surgeon observed: "We know from a considerable experience the patient wants to be left as nearly normal in appearance as possible. He will undergo untold hardships to be restored to the normal. This rule has no exceptions."
The notion that an intact, healthy man or woman would seek surgery to correct a feature that was merely unbecoming elicited disapproval and even disgust, and a proliferation of dangerous quacks also kept "beauty doctors" in check and generated horror stories of cosmetic catastrophes. But by the early 1920's, regulatory and advisory boards existed for plastic surgery.
At the same time Alfred Adler's theories of the "inferiority complex" grabbed the public's imagination. Adler argued that people were plagued by psychological problems growing from feelings of inferiority, and before long Americans decided that a poor self-image was reason enough to submit to the scalpel. For working women, who believed their livelihoods depended on their good looks, cosmetic surgery was defended as a necessity, not a luxury. Indeed, five years ago studies emerged showing that attractive people receive higher wages and easier advancement than unattractive people in any profession, however exalted or humble, and to true believers plastic surgery seems as sensible a career step as computer classes or an Ivy League education.
Women and men are lining up for plastic surgery in record numbers, but as everyone knows, women far outnumber men, because they believe that not only their economic success but their romantic fortunes hang on the face and body they present to the world. To most, even the penalties of pain and potential mishap or exposure to ridicule are a small price to pay for the chance to remain in the game for an extra decade.
It's fun to glide on the candy-slick sheen of an Orlane lipstick with its sugar taste, to change hair color with the seasons, to paint your nails silver, to delight in the metallic impact of stiletto heels on hollow pavement -- just as it was fun 60 years ago for daring women to buy Hussy lipstick instead of Lady. But nothing is fun when it is done out of compulsion or fear, even if that fear is only the fear of not seeming to have fun.
OF all the expectations that have been placed upon American women, perhaps none is as cruel as the supposedly liberated one that currently prevails: that any woman who isn't beautiful isn't trying, that women should look as good naked as they do clothed and that they should do so into their 60's if they intend to keep their men. It is a tyranny more unrelenting than the wasp waist; a corset, after all, can be unlaced in the dark. The ideal modern body, however, has to pass the broad-daylight test -- a standard that requires unstinting exercise, near starvation and surgical upkeep. Even if ever larger numbers of women now may succeed in looking like vixens well into what once would have been their dotages, it is no wonder that as early as 1939 commentators in The Ladies' Home Journal were announcing, "There has never been a time when so many women have been discontented with their appearance."
Peiss, for all her optimism, might well agree. Like the girl in the folk tale who was happy until a traveler gave her a mirror that showed her she was homely, many American women would be better off if they didn't examine themselves so closely. The problem is, the girl in the story had the sense to return the mirror. American women carry theirs wherever they go -- in every jewel-like compact of pressed powder, in every glittering case of rouge. How, being a woman, can you not want to look? And how, being an American, can you not want to look better?

Never Let Me Down
 A Memoir.
 By Susan J. Miller.
 Holt, $22.50. 
 "Memory is a kind of accomplishment" -- or so Susan J. Miller quotes William Carlos Williams in the epigraph to her memoir about growing up with her jazz-loving, heroin-addicted father during the 1950's and 60's, the height of the Birdland years in New York. As a child, Miller was aware of her family's struggles with unemployment, poverty and rootlessness, yet she did not know -- until she was 21 years old, when her father confessed -- that the reason for these problems lay in his seven-year addiction to heroin. What makes "Never Let Me Down" so powerful is how Miller winds in and around her topic so that each pass through the family's early life is more revealing, while the emotional atmosphere gathers a ragged intensity. Miller's increased knowledge alters her grasp of the past, creating a sense of disorientation with which she struggled for years. Learning of her father's addiction also clarified for Miller, now in her mid-40's, her violent childhood attachment to her older brother, a relationship as troubled and complex as that with her father.

Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder
 The Woman Behind the Legend.
 By John E. Miller.
 Illustrated. 306 pp. Columbia:
 University of Missouri Press. $29.95. 
 Laura Ingalls Wilder died in 1957 at the age of 90, and in the succeeding decades entire libraries of fiction, memoirs, women's studies and regional history have appeared dealing with women's lives and the settling of the prairies. By and large those titles simply reinforce the affection generations of children and adult readers alike feel for Wilder's autobiographical accounts of growing up on the frontier in the 1870's and 80's, the beloved "Little House" books.
The availability of so much similar material makes the question posed by John E. Miller at the outset of his generous, spirited biography, "Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder: The Woman Behind the Legend," both fair and helpful. What happened, he asks, to the "young girl and adolescent named Laura" from the time she married at 18 to the age of 65, when "Little House in the Big Woods" was published? And how did Laura Elizabeth Ingalls Wilder, "this seemingly ordinary woman," find the resources and skill to produce a body of work that succeeding generations of Americans, as well as readers of more than 40 languages around the world, adore and take as a true account of one family and an entire aspect of American history?
Miller decides it was perseverance: "Her readers know how her family withstood the challenges of poverty, crop failures, blizzards, grasshoppers, prairie fires and other setbacks. Throughout her life, Wilder faced similar challenges: the loss of a child, her husband's physical disability, hardscrabble economic conditions, conflicts with her daughter, a patriarchal social environment and a long apprenticeship at the writing trade with little to show for it." But, Miller adds, this "ambitious woman" as a child had "received just enough feedback from adults to reinforce her feeling that somehow she was different."
He gives some credit to her sense of her own superiority, some to her experience writing for local papers and some, but probably not quite enough, to her remarkable daughter, Rose Wilder Lane.
Born when her mother was only 19, Rose left Mansfield, Mo., where her parents finally settled, as soon as she could. She worked her way to San Francisco, became a journalist, mixed with literati and lefties, traveled extensively in Europe (even settling in Albania in the 20's), wrote fiction and nonfiction under her own name (she was also a ghostwriter for Herbert Hoover and Lowell Thomas, among others) and went to Vietnam in 1965 at the age of 78. Her libertarian tracts, written later in her life, have come back into print and are in vogue these days with conservative groups.
The central figure in her life was unquestionably her mother. Rose's brief early marriage was a failure; her friendships were often combative. Indeed, her most successful interpersonal relationships were sustained by letter. In her extensive correspondence she spent a great deal of time complaining about her mother -- feeling responsible for her, resenting her. Her relationship with her "Mama Bess" was fraught. The title Rose's biographer, William Holtz, chose for his book, "The Ghost in the Little House" (1993), was also his thesis -- that Rose Wilder Lane, at great personal cost, was her mother's ghostwriter.
Miller perceives Rose's midlife and midcareer hysteria more clearly and has looked very closely at the manuscripts that Rose edited before they were submitted to Harper & Brothers. While it is not a universal truth that memoirs are fiction, though the best often read that way, it is true that the "Little House" books are novels, and that Laura Ingalls Wilder intended them to be.
The Missouri housewife with a frontier education and modest experience, beginning at 44, writing essays for The Mansfield Mirror and The Missouri Ruralist, "relied on the tools that fiction writers normally employ." She received first-class editing from her daughter, the lightest on the first book, "Little House in the Big Woods," the heaviest on the powerful later novel "The Long Winter," and together they polished and shaped remembered experience into fiction that endures.
Miller, a historian who teaches at South Dakota State University in Brookings, uses the resources his trade normally employs, the ones that citizens find numbingly dull until they are gracefully explicated: deed claims, local newspapers, the manuscript original of the 1880 census. That document described the 116 residents of De Smet, S.D., where Wilder lived as a teen-ager, precisely, and Miller sees that they were not just "disproportionately young and male." While there were approximately equal numbers of boys and girls, of those in their 20's there were 34 men and 16 women; of those in their 50's three men and no women. Most husbands were "between four and nine years older" than their wives.
Thus it was not so exceptional for 25-year-old Almanzo Wilder to court 15-year-old Laura Ingalls, fetching her home for the winter weekends from her teaching job at a one-room schoolhouse 12 miles away. Even so, when she wrote about it decades later she reduced the difference in their ages, lest her young readers think she had been a "child bride" when she married in 1885. Wilder never fully recovered from the diphtheria he suffered in 1888; he remains, in all accounts, a stoic, almost silent, limping figure for the rest of his long life.
In his conclusion, Miller understates the case carefully when he says: "The tangled relationship between mother and daughter was clearly crucial. . . . Without Rose's help and encouragement, there would have been no 'Laura Ingalls Wilder' as we know her today, only a sprightly, energetic Ozarks farm woman and sometime farm-newspaper writer known as 'Mrs. A. J. Wilder.' But then without her mother and the attentions that she lavished upon her daughter, there would have been no 'Rose Wilder Lane,' either." There's rich fodder for fiction in their story, too.

Fire Safety For Ships at Sea

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
UNLIKE the Titanic or the Andrea Doria, the Carnival cruise ship Ecstasy lost not a single passenger or crew member. But in its smaller way, the Ecstasy fire, which produced thick smoke that was on hundreds of television newscasts, will probably contribute to the evolution of marine safety.
The time line of progress on marine safety reads as a perfect counterpoint to tragedies afloat. After more than 1,000 people, mostly children, died on an excursion aboard the General Slocum, which caught fire in New York in 1904, requirements for lifesaving gear and fire equipment were tightened. When more than 1,500 died on the Titanic in 1912, lifeboat personnel were required to be certified, and an international conference was called to approve a Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea. The Andrea Doria-Stockholm crash in 1956, in which 52 died, brought requirements that hulls be divided by steel bulkheads. 
 With the Ecstasy, which was built with sprinklers, smoke inhalation in corridors caused the only injuries, and they were mild. (The investigators, at this writing, do not know if the sprinklers were going to be effective in the fire, or if the fireboats were essential. There were also complaints of confusion and delay in informing passengers of the fire and the procedures to follow.)
There were no sprinklers aboard Commodore Cruise Line's Universe Explorer, where five crew members died of smoke inhalation in a 1996 fire. That accident put the menace of smoke high on the list at the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates these events, and the Coast Guard, which controls ship safety for American vessels and provides the United States delegates to the negotiations on international maritime rules. There are many other ships without sprinklers, or even smoke alarms that go off on the spot. Sometimes they are installed then taken out -- in a laundry, for example -- because they go off too often.
Experts at the two Government agencies are pressing urgently for changes that insure better safety for cruise passengers, 80 percent of them Americans.
 
Ships Not Under U.S. Rules
Most passengers presume that United States standards are in force on ships that dock in Florida, Louisiana, California, Washington State or even New York. But the giant cruise ships, while they may be American owned, are all registered and taxed in foreign countries, and covered by those countries' regulations. The Coast Guard does inspect ships that dock in the United States, but only to verify that the vessel meets the standards of the Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, or Solas. There should be twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers, and life jackets for 125 percent of capacity. The Coast Guard also inspects cruise ships' food facilities and their hot tubs, under the direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In severe cases, either for overall safety or for bad kitchen conditions, the Coast Guard can keep a vessel from leaving an American port. But it is rare, and the stringent safety rules that govern inland ferries and riverboats do not apply.
The Ecstasy, built in 1991, is registered in Liberia. Her owner, Carnival, an American company, discussed in its 1997 annual report why it believes she is virtually exempt from United States taxes. Panama and the Bahamas also provide flags of convenience to shipowners who find it more economical to register outside the United States. In 1982, a Government report found that 74 percent of ships visiting United States ports were registered in the Bahamas, Liberia, Panama and Norway.
Only one United States ocean-going cruise ship remains, American Hawaii Cruises' Independence, and she is not subject to international rules because she sails in the Hawaiian islands.
Some ships that visit the United States are registered in countries with venerable seagoing traditions, Britain, Italy and Norway among them. But of Liberia, Barry Sweedler, head of the office of safety recommendations and accomplishments at the National Transportation Safety Board, said: "What kind of standards can it apply? Isn't it in the grip of civil war?"
 
 Sprinkler Exemptions Found
But just as mailing letters requires some international concords about doing business, moving in international waters implies some harmony on standards: signals, rights of way, communications and rescue obligations.
These basics are adopted by the International Maritime Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations set up in 1958, with headquarters in London. Its primary vehicle is Solas; the most recent version, adopted in 1974, has been amended several times. The rules, first designed to protect sailors, cover most aspects of life at sea, such as load limits for ships and how tonnages are measured. A passenger ship must be capable of being abandoned 30 minutes after a warning, for example, and lifeboats must be partly covered to protect the passengers.
Each country is responsible for certifying that ships bearing its flags meet the requirements of Solas. Each nation delegates the inspection task to a group called a classification society, which is paid by the nation's shipowners to do the work.
The Solas cruise ship safety rules are now a patchwork because the organization's delegates, representing national interests, are reluctant to tell ship owners to modify existing ships; they would rather lay down rules for new construction. Starting in 1994, for example, all new ships had to come out of the yard with sprinklers and smoke alarm systems. But long phase-in times were left for older ships.
The most recent date for retrofitting requirements was October 1997. Solas fire protection rules at that point were nominally applied to all ships built before October 1994. Mr. Sweedler said that his agency and the Coast Guard had gotten the impression that there would be "zero tolerance for noncompliance" with rules requiring sprinklers, fire detection systems and smoke alarms in all accommodations, including atriums, stairway enclosures and corridors, plus self-closing doors. (In the Ecstasy case, the 1997 rule was redundant, because Carnival had been building in sprinkler systems on all of its ships since 1982.)
But then, Mr. Sweedler said, American safety people began to discover that the 1997 rule was not watertight. They learned that 15 vessels, including the Universe Explorer, whose laundry room caught fire near Juneau on July 27, 1996, and the Vistafjord, which lost a crew member in a linen room fire April 7, 1997, had sought or received from their countries of registry what amounts to an exemption from the requirement for sprinklers on board.
The retrofitting rules permit older ships to postpone installation of sprinklers until 2005 or 2009 provided they were built of noncombustible materials and met other criteria. Owners get this exemption by asking their flag nations -- the Bahamas, Panama, Liberia -- to certify that the ship meets these criteria, called Method I. If the exemption is granted, all the Coast Guard can then do to protect passengers' safety is to verify that the Method I standards have been met.
The National Transportation Safety Board conducted a gruelingly detailed study of the Universe Explorer's failure to meet 30 of the Method I criteria under which it was claiming an exemption. In addition to the lack of sprinklers, for example, a bulkhead was found to be missing between the laundry room and other areas, and other repairs and replacements had been carried out with materials that did not meet Method I rules.
Fred Mayer, chief executive officer of Commodore Cruise Line in Miami, said that the line was not required by the rules to install sprinklers, but had a "moral duty" to do so. He said that this work would be done in January 1999, if the design and parts were on hand in time, or in May 1999. He said that his company relied on the certification of the Universe Explorer by its classification society, because it could not count each door and wall; the previous owner removed the laundry room bulkhead, he said. It has been replaced now, he added.
 
Is Your Cruise Ship Safe?
Mr. Sweedler said that detailed inquiries, like the one on the Universe Explorer, showed the impossibility of declaring all pre-1994 vessels fire-safe, either by virtue of sprinklers or by virtue of construction methods and materials. He recommends a tough road: that all potential passengers ask their travel agents if their intended vessel has sprinklers, everywhere, including the laundry room. The situation is too inconsistent to assess otherwise, as Carnival's forward-looking decision in 1982 to build in sprinklers demonstrates.
In addition, it is worth checking the brochure to learn the country of registry of the ship and the date it went to sea. Ships built before 1994 may have received exemption from the 1997 sprinkler requirement by claiming they conform to Method I specifications. The National Transportation Safety Board points out that continual modifications may have undone the validity of the claim, for instance, through use of flammable putty or insulation materials during a repair.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
In Bali, $3 Goes A Long Way

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE; DAISANN McLANE writes about music and culture.

 BODY:
I LEANED back lazily in my hammock and surveyed the panorama from my private veranda: coconut palms and mango trees in sizzling jungle greens, cascades of purple trumpet vines and pale-yellow frangipani, a tropical explosion of foliage that would have kept Gauguin working overtime for a month. While waiting for breakfast to arrive, I mulled over the day's options: A massage and body scrub? Shopping? My thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of a mug of industrial-strength, locally grown coffee and a big plate of juicy pineapple and papaya. It was all impossibly sweet and delicious, but for a frugal traveler there was something even sweeter about this cottage in the central hills of Bali: the price tag. It was $2.85 a night, breakfast and tax included, at the prevailing rate of 14,000 rupiah to the dollar.
Every so often the roulette wheels of economics and politics come to a stop in a configuration that produces a traveler's windfall. During the Asian monetary crisis that began last summer, Indonesia's rupiah fell by more than 70 percent against the dollar. In mid-May, demonstrations and riots tore through Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, and thousands of American citizens were evacuated. Soon both the United States State Department and the British Government had issued travel warnings on Indonesia. 
 However, when curiosity led me to search the Web site of Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (www.fco.gov.uk), I ran across this phrase: "The Embassy has at present no basis for advising against resumption of tourist visits to Bali." (Six weeks later, the State Department's public announcement on July 13 about the demonstrations stated: "Tourist areas in Bali have not been affected.")
Through the grapevine, I began to hear tempting stories of Bali bargains. Empty hotels had slashed room rates, and would negotiate downward at the reservations desk. One London newspaper reported that it cost only about $7 to rent a car with driver for a day.
I knew that culturally Bali was separate from the rest of Indonesia. A Hindu minority in that predominantly Islamic country, the Balinese have a complex, village-oriented culture that runs according to an intricate calendar of religious ceremonies, familial and ancestral obligations and auspicious occasions. There hadn't been any riots in Bali, even during the worst of Jakarta's unrest. So in mid-June I started looking for a cheap fare to Bali. Garuda, the Indonesian airline, had suspended service to the United States, so there were fewer seats. I didn't want to go through Jakarta, which ruled out Japan Airlines. I narrowed it down to Cathay Pacific, Singapore, and Malaysia Airlines, each of which offered roundtrips to Denpasar that ranged between $1,400 and $1,800 in economy -- pricey, for summer is when many air fares to Asia spike.
But consolidators offered substantial discounts. I purchased a round-trip ticket from Newark to Denpasar, via Dubai, for $1,150 on Malaysia, which allowed me to change my return date without additional charges (just in case) and offered the intriguing option of a free stopover in Kuala Lumpur.
Because I don't like to land in an unfamiliar place after a 24-hour trip without my first night's hotel reservation confirmed, I booked a room for a single rate of $75 at the Holiday Inn Resort Balihai at Kuta Beach, one of a long list of Bali hotels that offered discounts ranging from 25 to 50 percent on the Web site Bali Online at www.indo.com. Breakfast and a free transfer from nearby Ngurah Rai airport were included. From this side of the world it sounded like a terrific deal.
Little did I know that, once I got to Bali, the Holiday Inn would turn out to be the least remarkable value I'd find during my 10-day stay. The 200-room resort was fine: It had an impressive, huge thatched-roof reception area modeled on a Balinese bale, or town meeting hall. My room was pleasant and decent-sized, and had a balcony facing a large tastefully landscaped courtyard with a swimming pool. But it had a package-tour sameness about it -- was I in Fiji? Jamaica? Puerto Vallarta? Also, it was full, or so it seemed to me (actually, only 57 out of 200 rooms were occupied), with gregarious Australians on vacation packages. My first night at dinner, the boisterous table next to me suddenly burst into a loud chorus of "Yellow Submarine." I plotted my escape.
I decided, first of all, to get out of Kuta, the strip of beach hotels, shopping malls and tacky thatched-roof McDonald's in southern Bali. A few miles southeast was Nusa Dua, a more recently developed enclave of exclusive self-contained resorts, including the well-known Amanusa, one of a chain of super-luxe hotels. A short drive northeast of Kuta, Sanur also looked promising, with a selection of older, boutique hotels, and a huge Hyatt resort.
I thought I'd try a bit of haggling, and rang up the pricey Amanusa. "We have a no-discount policy," the reservations clerk sniffed. "Perhaps if you booked one of our $500 rooms we might be able to upgrade you to our $600 room." The Bali Hyatt in Sanur, though, was eager to deal. The Bali Online Web site had listed a discount single room there at $200, but over the phone the clerk instantly offered me the same room for $110. When I went over to look at the hotel -- a lush resort on 36 acres of immaculately groomed gardens -- the price dropped yet again, to $96, taxes and breakfast included. I said I'd think about it.
Meanwhile, I cast another feeler in the direction of the Tandjung Sari, an older, Indonesian-owned hotel with 26 cottages that came highly recommended by several guidebooks as an example of what Bali was like before the tourist boom. The Balinese manager giggled when I told her I was not happy in my Kuta hotel. "You will be happy here," she laughed, offering to slash the rack rate of the standard cottage by $75, to $127.
A welcoming gong resounded as my taxi pulled up the long driveway of the Tandjung Sari. Two Balinese men in sarongs guarded my luggage as I inspected my potential new home, the price of which abruptly dropped again, to $100. I was, indeed, happy -- the cottage, tucked into a wild tangle of vines and tropical trees, boasted a stone bathtub the size of a double bed, surrounded by glass walls. The bathroom extended beyond the walls, to a shower in an open-air garden filled with bougainvillea and stone temple statues. "For $27 more, you can have the ocean view," suggested the manager.
I was ecstatic. In my room brochure, I read that Tandjung had hosted artistic and illustrious travelers for more than 30 years -- Anais Nin had even written about the hotel in her diaries. It was still rife with character. At dinner in the open-air dining room, I was regaled with tales of the Maharajah of Jodhpur by an aging British aristocrat -- who insisted on picking up my check, an act of gallantry that I accepted since my portion of the bill came to all of $3. Meals in Bali, even at upscale restaurants, seldom amounted to more than $3 or $4 at the prevailing rates of exchange -- which were becoming more favorable every day.
I adored Tandjung, but I was growing ambivalent about the Bali outside. Far from an island paradise, it was turning out to be a constant hassle, an irritating hustle. The moment I stepped out of the hotel gates, the clamor began: "Madam! Transport? What is your program for today?" I'd stop to admire a roadside temple, and a guy on a motorcycle would pull up and wave a display case of cheap watches in my face.
The Balinese economy depends almost entirely on tourism, and with fewer tourists around, I was, understandably, a prize target. One morning I slipped out to the beach to admire the sunrise. The beach was deserted, the air cool, and I was happily enjoying the fabled Balinese "morning of the world," when, out of thin air, a small boy appeared at my elbow with an armful of carved frogs. I jumped.
Bali bursts with spiritual signifiers. Everywhere I looked there were temples, and even shopping malls were strewn with little offering packets of rice and coconut. But, as a tourist I found the way to spiritual Bali blocked by a wall of souvenirs, until I landed at the door of the Canti Dasa Ashram. Situated in the ramshackle beachside resort of Candidasa, a two-hour drive northeast of Sanur, the ashram is a community of about 24 young Balinese run by a formidable woman in her 70's, Ibu Bagoes Oka, who is a member of the district's royal family.
Ibu Oka, as she is called, took up the spiritual life some decades ago, turning her family's prime beachfront land, a peninsula poised between ocean and lagoon, into an ashram with guest cottages that welcomes visitors who have spiritual interests and accept the rules -- no smoking or alcohol -- for a minimum three nights' stay, at $20 a night including vegetarian meals.
It wasn't the cheapest place to stay in Candidasa (the nearby Ida Homestay had comfortable cottages for $3 a night), nor the most luxurious. The cottages have no fans (though they do have private bathrooms), and mine had an austere single wooden bed. But the ashram had location, location, location, and a serenity that is hard to find at any price.
EACH morning for four days, as the sun threw dappled pink light on the wild ocean lapping at the foot of my cottage porch, I decided I needed just a bit more time away from the marketplace of paradise. The vegetarian meals were delicious and my fellow guests, a securities trader from San Francisco and a schoolteacher and her daughter from Canberra, made for interesting company during lazy days of swimming, yoga classes and snorkeling excursions. (Ashrams are to the adult traveler what hostels are to the teen-ager, I've decided.) One day I hired a car and driver and spent a morning exploring the remarkable fountains and gardens of the nearby water palace of Tirta Gangga. The next day I boarded a fishing boat for a 30-minute ride to the "Blue Lagoon" reef ($4.50), and watched dolphins jump out of the sea 30 feet from starboard.
Soon I was ready to tackle the material world again. Ubud, in Bali's central hills, is the culture capital of the island -- a sort of tropical Santa Fe, brimming with painters, expat entrepreneurs and hippie dropouts. Despite the travel warning, Americans were everywhere in Ubud.
I met Beth, a teacher from Alaska, in a Balinese cooking class taught by an Australian emigre named Janet de Neefe. (Four hours of instruction plus lunch was about $6.) Beth, like other Americans I ran into, expressed misgivings about the enormous bargains that, thanks to the vagaries of global economics, Bali offered.
"I told my landlady that she had to raise the price of her guesthouse -- it was only $4 a night!" she exclaimed. "And I'm going to leave money here with a children's school before I go."
I found myself tipping often and generously, and rounding most of my bills upward. Still, the deeper I delved into Bali, the less I found myself spending, for I discovered that the things I liked best were to be found in the most remote spots. And the more I strayed from the tourist track, the lower the prices fell. By traveling three hours to the far eastern coast of Bali, I was able to stay in a huge two-story beachfront cottage with garden bathroom at the Good Karma Bungalows, which, except for its lack of telephones, offered most of the luxury amenities of Tandjung Sari for only $9 a night.
On a walk deep into the forest outside Ubud, I followed a path along a river, across a rice field, around a temple and came upon the Pugig Homestay, four two-story cottages tucked upon that Gauguin hillside overlooking a sacred Balinese bathing spot. Save for a French couple, the place was empty, and Nyoman, the manager, said that one of the cottages could be mine for $2.85 a night. Granted, it didn't have hot water or a fan, and the toilet was an Asian-style squat. But I've learned to love squat toilets, for they are practically a guarantee that you'll always be able to get a reservation.
I settled in, and the wheels started spinning. How much cash could I make by subletting my New York apartment at a profit? How many days would the money pay my bills at Pugig? A day passed, and then another. One day I watched a temple procession down the hill. Another day it rained. And one morning, finally, I wrenched myself from the hammock and cast myself out of paradise.
 
The bottom line in Bali, from $8 a day to $130
 
Logistics
I spent as much as $130 and as little as $8 a day in Bali for accommodations, meals, local transport and activities during my 10-day stay, calculated at 14,000 rupiahs to the dollar; the wide range reflects the fact that I was trawling for discounts at all levels of accommodation. My average daily expenditure worked out to around $50, but if you leave out my splurge at the Tandjung Sari Hotel, the average drops to around $25 a day -- a reasonable estimate of what it takes to travel very comfortably in Bali at the moment.
My round-trip ticket on Malaysia Airlines from Newark to Denpasar, via Dubai and Kuala Lumpur, cost $1,150 plus $60 tax from the Adventure Travel Network consolidators in San Francisco: (800) 467-4595.
The price of a car with driver in Bali is highly negotiable. The ashram staff referred me to Ketut Salin, based at the Kelapa Mas hotel in Candidasa, telephone and fax (62-363) 41947, who turned out to be a reliable and safe driver-guide. A half-day of touring the island in his air-conditioned Toyota van was around $5. Mr. Salin's nephew, Made, takes tourists out to Candidasa's Blue Lagoon reef in his fishing boat for $4.50; inquire at the same number.
 
Lodging
Prices quoted include a 21 percent tax and service charge that Indonesian hoteliers call the "plus-plus"; clarify whether it is included when you negotiate rates. Also, if a hotel offers you a rate in United States dollars, and you are paying by credit card, make sure you ask what rupiah conversion rate the hotel uses before agreeing to the price. (Credit card bills are charged in rupiahs.)
At Kuta Beach, the 200-room Holiday Inn Resort Balihai, Jalan Wana Segara 33, Tuban, (62-361) 753035; fax 754548, cost $75 a night, including breakfast.
At the Tandjung Sari Hotel, 41 Jalan Danau Tamblingan, Sanur, (62-361) 288441, fax 287930, my deluxe cottage was quoted at $127 a night with breakfast, but since the hotel calculated my credit card bill at a more favorable exchange rate, my actual cost was $114. (In late July, the hotel quoted a rate of $156.)
The Bali Hyatt, Box 392, Sanur, (62-361) 281 234, fax 287 693, is one of the island's most attractive large resorts, set in lush gardens on a private beach. The "superior garden room" I saw was discounted to $96.
The Canti Dasa Ashram, Candidasa, Karangasem, telephone and fax (62-363) 41108, offers (but does not require participation in) yoga classes and chanting-meditation ceremonies three times a day. Rates are $20 a day (three-day minimum), including three sumptuous vegetarian feasts, afternoon tea and snacks. No smoking or drinking.
The nearby Ida Homestay, Candidasa, Karangasem, telephone and fax (62-363) 41096, rents decent garden cottages with double beds and ceiling fans, for around $3 a night including breakfast.
In Ubud (actually Penestanan, a village 15 minutes' walk from the center of Ubud), my little two-story house at Pugig Homestay, (62-361) 974-362, had electricity, no fan, a squat toilet and cold shower, and a veranda with a drop-dead view of a river gorge -- for $2.85 with breakfast. If I were to return I'd try to reserve the main house for about $6 a night; it's larger, with a better bathroom, a fan and an even nicer view.
In eastern Bali, at the Good Karma Bungalows in Selang near Amed, Karangasem, my beachfront cottage cost $9 a night.
 
Places to Eat
Ubud is the place for fine dining, both European and Asian. My favorite spots were Cafe Wayan, Monkey Forest Road, Ubud, (62-361) 975447, where I paid about $3 for a tasty lunch of Thai chicken in green curry sauce, spring rolls, and a Bintang Indonesian beer, and Han Snel's Garden Restaurant, Jalan Kajeng, Ubud, (62-361) 975699, which serves, on a banana leaf, a delicious Indonesian-style rijstaffel, also around $3.
 
Activities
At Nur's Beauty Salon, Hanoman Street, Ubud, (62-361) 975 352, Balinese massages and other treatments are performed by young, somewhat inexperienced girls. The massage is followed by an herbal skin exfoliation and a soak in a tub strewn with blossoms ($4.50 for 90 minutes). Lovely, but it was no match for the skilled massage I got from Ni Ketut Suwite ($1.75), a middle-aged woman who can be found by asking along the main street of Candidasa.
Janet de Neefe holds Balinese cooking classes (about $6) three times a week in Ubud. More demonstration than hands-on, they're the prelude to a lunchtime feast. She also rents four very nice guest cottages for about $6 a night. Information: telephone and fax (62-361) 973282.

HEADLINE: An Analyst of Passion, and Paris

BYLINE: By LESLIE CAMHI; Leslie Camhi writes frequently about film, art and contemporary culture for The Village Voice.

 BODY:
BENOIT JACQUOT is not about to turn out autobiography. "I'm not interested in recounting my life through my films," the famously reticent French director said recently. "I'd rather they teach me something about my life."
His presence in his work is close to transparent: a finely tuned eye and intelligence, focused on the intricate, oblique entanglements of human beings. Inspired by the sensual, emotional immediacy of actors, he also partakes in his films of an analyst's measured distance and reserve. His characters, veiled in silence or adept in miscommunication, rarely say what they're thinking. And while Mr. Jacquot is not the product of a tell-all society, he also remains largely faithful to a city, Paris, and a set of psychological concerns that differentiate his work from recent French films set in the provinces. 
 Viewers can see Mr. Jacquot's analytical mind at work in "Seventh Heaven," a 1997 film that opened in New York on Friday. Subtle, cryptic and funny, it explores a modern triangle among a wife, her husband and her therapist. Mathilde, a young woman, neglects her job and suffers from frigidity, fainting spells and bouts of kleptomania. When an enigmatic hypnotist cures her of these ills, her husband, Nico, begins to shirk his work as a surgeon and his conjugal duties. A poignant survey of the shifting grounds of marital power, this comedy of the unconscious is also a compendium of Parisian neuroses and pleasures, from adultery to psychoanalysis.
Mr. Jacquot, 51, is as contradictory and recondite as his oeuvre. Tall and angular, with elegant manners, a foxlike face and a gaze that nails its object, in conversation he can seem at once surprisingly self-effacing and rather wearied by the limits of language. He has set two films (one recent, one to come) in the 18th century, and that age of enlightened libertinage probably appeals to him, for despite his crow's-feet, he reminds an interviewer of an oddly amiable Marquis de Sade -- fundamentally chilly but as mirthful as a schoolboy.
"A Parisian by birth and by existence," as he puts it, Mr. Jacquot grew up on the films of the French New Wave, assisted the great writer and director Marguerite Duras when he was in his early 20's and began his own career as the director of abstruse, rigidly stylized dramas amid the theoretical ferment of Paris in the 1970's. "I don't like my early films," he admitted. "I have a hard time seeing them and acknowledging them as my own. When I made my first film, 'The Musician Killer,' in 1975, it seemed like my last; while 15 years later, with 'The Disenchanted,' I felt that I was beginning my career anew."
That lyrical, deeply moving film, which was shown this spring at Film Forum in New York, stars Judith Godreche as a 17-year-old high school student who lives with her mysteriously paralyzed mother and her little brother in a once-grand apartment. The film traces her encounters over the course of three days with several men: her handsome, arrogant boyfriend; Chan, a Chinese friend and fellow student; Alphonse, an older writer whom she meets by chance, and "the uncle," a cultivated and insidious retired doctor who supports her impecunious household.
"The Disenchanted" moves across Paris with the exactitude of an anatomist palpating a body, revealing the city's lush little islands, afternoon dance clubs, high-rise workers' housing and gracious bourgeois apartments. It's also a remarkably tender vivisection that all but exposes the beating heart of a young woman.
"The relationship to Paris is extremely precise in all of Benoit's films," said Philippe Carcassonne, the prolific French producer who is Mr. Jacquot's frequent collaborator. "We are working right now on 'Pas de Scandale,' to be shot this fall. Benoit has already indicated the two or three avenues where we are to look for the main character's apartment."
Mr. Jacquot's later films have all focused on the mystery of women's identities and desires, set against the exigencies (material, social, psychological and physical) that circumscribe them. "Marianne" (1994), an adaptation of Marivaux's novel "La Vie de Marianne," stars Virginie Ledoyen as the 18th-century heroine of indeterminate origins who moves uncertainly through an often predatory world of servants, tradespeople and aristocrats.
Ms. Ledoyen also stars in "A Single Girl" (1995), which was well-received in the United States two years ago. Filmed for the most part in real time, it follows a young woman through an early hour of a gray Parisian morning, as she meets her unemployed boyfriend in a cafe, tells him she's pregnant and begins her first day of work as a room-service waitress, delivering breakfast in a four-star hotel. There she navigates a maze of bosses, co-workers and a multitude of strangers with whom she shares unwanted moments of intimacy; all the while, her secret is privately at work within her. This small, dazzling film tells almost no story; instead, it focuses with the intensity of a lover's gaze upon the riddle of another's existence.
The inspiration for "Seventh Heaven" was double. Mr. Jacquot wrote the script with Jerome Beaujour for Sandrine Kiberlain and Vincent Lindon, the two French stars who play the married couple, and who are, in fact, husband and wife. "I could only have made this film with a couple who live together," Mr. Jacquot said. "It's fiction, but it also has a documentary aspect, in the way that George Cukor's films play off the real-life couple of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy."
That the film has the lightness of a 1930's domestic comedy is all the more striking when one considers its second source of inspiration: Lacanian psychoanalysis. In 1974, Mr. Jacquot directed the only televised interview with Jacques Lacan, the highly celebrated and controversial Parisian psychoanalyst.
"I had read Lacan's work, and it moved me very deeply," Mr. Jacquot says. "Before him, psychoanalysts tended to write of the unconscious as if they themselves had none. For me, he was a brilliant model of someone who could be at once extremely rigorous and precise, and yet open to the effects of the unconscious."
"He also had a remarkable sense of comedy; he was extremely adept in the art of surprise," Mr. Jacquot continued. "And surprise is our only real proof of the unconscious."
It's an art that, as a director, Mr. Jacquot takes pains to cultivate. His preparatory work with actors is lengthy but oblique; he never rehearses, and all his films are shot using very few takes. "The films always spill over the idea I had of them," he said. "They lead me, together with the cast and crew, elsewhere. Otherwise, they're just illustration."
In relation to his work, he attempts to preserve something of the analyst's fertile silence and enigmatic power.
Ms. Kiberlain's troubling and touching performance as Mathilde in "Seventh Heaven" required her to feign fainting, hypnosis and (discretely) orgasm. "If there's a rapport between hypnosis and acting, it has to do with the sense of surrender," Ms. Kiberlain said. "When Benoit would tell me, now you faint, I didn't have the faintest idea of how to go about it. But you just let go, you fall. There has to be a great deal of confidence between actor and director for that to work."
Mr. Jacquot enjoys the reputation of a director who is highly respected by actors. Mr. Lindon concurs. "It's because he loves actors, listens to them, respects them, and because the actors in his films are always good," he said.
What is it about women that so interests Mr. Jacquot?
"I was born a man," Mr. Jacquot said, "and women are the part of humanity that is at once familiar and very, very strange to me. It's difficult for a man to ask the question, what is a man. It's as if the question just doesn't arise. Or as if we already know the response, and it's not necessarily amusing. But a woman can ask herself the question, what is a woman. I try to respond to that question with the female characters I invent and the actresses I film. And they always lead me to further questions."

Of the South and Its Imprint on Literature

BYLINE: By ARIEL SWARTLEY; Ariel Swartley writes frequently about popular and literary culture from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
TO drop the term "Southern writers" in a roomful of literati is to find oneself momentarily in possession of a staff as powerful as Moses'. Opinion sucks itself up into two formidably glittering walls, while faces turn, some alight in passionate defense, others with chins drawn in and hackles visibly raised. The dispute goes well beyond whether William Faulkner was the American Shakespeare or a suffocatingly long-winded chronicler of characters who were the same way themselves. It also goes beyond ideas about the region itself, though these are apt to cloud the issue.
Although not always acknowledged, traces of this divide are evident in "Tell About the South," a documentary on Southern literature from 1920 to the 1940's that interviews or profiles more than two dozen writers, black and white. (The first of what is planned as a three-part series, the film, written, directed and produced by Ross Spears, will be shown Thursday at 10 P.M. on PBS.) 
 Arms crossed and facing the documentary's cameras from the center of a striped sofa, the novelist and journalist Willie Morris describes an encounter he had in 1960 while a Rhodes scholar at Oxford with the poet Robert Frost. Noticing Mr. Morris's accent, Mr. Frost asked where he was from. "Mississippi?" the poet exploded on being told. "Hell, that's the worst state in the Union." Well, it had produced some fine writers, a shaken Mr. Morris allowed. "But can anyone there read them?" Mr. Frost returned.
At bottom, threading like a narrow spit of sand between the Red Sea waves of opinion lies the very notion of a regional literature, and the issues it raises are peculiarly American. Does the convening of so many disparate voices under a single banner enhance or diminish the individuals involved? Or, more fundamentally, are writers born or made? And if the answer is the latter, then what is responsible for their making: the landscapes of their youth, culture and traditions, or some central validating literary establishment? The questions become more urgent when the voices are drawn from a region as racially divided as the 20th-century American South.
In her influential 1956 essay "Place in Fiction," the Mississippi-born novelist Eudora Welty allowed that "it is both natural and sensible that the place where we have our roots should become the setting, the first and primary proving ground, of our fiction." At the same time she spurned the "regional" designation, calling it "a careless term, as well as a condescending one." Condescending, because it was a judgment passed by outsiders. But, in fact, the passing was a bit more complicated.
The song "Dixie" was written in New York by an Ohio native -- information that depending on your point of view illustrates either the transformative power of myth or a willingness to disregard inconvenient truths. Similarly, "Southern," as applied to writers, is an attribution that is open to interpretation. Edgar Allan Poe, reared and schooled in Virginia, left the South both literally and figuratively. Thomas Wolfe wrote most of his books in Brooklyn but his affiliation remains clear. The author of "Roots," Alex Haley, brought up in Alabama and Tennessee, remained, perhaps by virtue of his journalism, the consummate New Yorker.
Few regions have had critics as vituperative as the Baltimore journalist H. L. Mencken, who in 1917 wrote off the economically depressed world south of the Potomac as "a vast plain of mediocrity, stupidity and lethargy." And yet not even New England has been as successful as the South in promoting itself as the home ground of a distinctive literature. One might argue that New England sidestepped the need by presuming its tastes and standards to be those of the nation as a whole, a feat made easier by the powerful opinion makers that called the region home: Harvard, for instance, and Yale, and The Atlantic Monthly. The South, on the other hand, had considerable practice in making a virtue out of adversity.
"Tell About the South" focuses first on the Fugitive poets, including Allen Tate, John Crowe Ransom and Robert Penn Warren, who took their name from the literary magazine they founded at Vanderbilt University in Nashville in 1922. Young, gifted, white and relatively privileged (all three were Rhodes scholars) they turned "regional" into a badge of distinction. In addition to being poets, the Fugitives were articulate critics. From Vanderbilt, founded to be the South's answer to Harvard and liberally endowed by the railroad baron (Cornelius), their academic influence radiated outward, fueled by the 1930 publication of "I'll Take My Stand."
Subtitled "The South and the Agrarian Tradition," this essay collection provided a philosophical and political rationale for literature that drew its sustenance from the land and the farmer's virtue, cultivation, and was therefore a moral counterweight to empty technology, rootless modernity and other Northern contributions. By the 1960's and 70's, leading figures of the group were fugitive no longer, but well-placed members of the literary establishment, with professorships at Yale and Kenyon, books of criticism and prestigious awards. Last month's strong showing of white Southern writers (including relatively minor figures like Carson McCullers and Erskine Caldwell) on Modern Library's recent list of the century's best novels (as well as the complete absence of black women) is evidence of how powerfully certain sorts of Southerness have become identified with literariness per se.
An assumption within the agrarian tradition holds that art somehow follows the laws of the vegetable kingdom, flourishing in proportion to the depth and tenacity of its roots, springing up on hitherto barren ground from a God-strewn seed. In light of this assumption, the Fugitives were poets who just happened to come together, driven by their individual talents and not by anything as -- well -- sordid as the marketplace. And if such amateurism, however organically grown, sounds disingenuous in light of the Modern Library list, it's downright patronizing when it's applied to the blues.
That the compressed, ironic, extravagantly imagistic song lyrics that flourished across the black South from canebrake to back porch to back-street bordello were a legitimate and powerful poetics has been recognized, in print, for at least half a century. The oft-quoted legend (which "Tell About the South" repeats) of the Delta bluesman Robert Johnson receiving his talent through a pact with the Devil is a dramatic piece of myth making. But, like other arts, the blues flourished because, after World War I, there was a community, and technology, able to nourish them. Traveling tent shows aimed at exclusively black audiences crisscrossed the South, disseminating new musical styles and vividly topical lyrics.
Even Johnson, whose imagery generally inclines to the starkly rural (storms, lonesome roads, welcoming kitchens) could describe a woman as having "Elgin movements." More important, from 1920 on, as the phonograph came into popular use, blues were assiduously recorded and marketed to an increasingly far-flung black audience.
Today, too, the region that many modern black Southern writers identify with is one that's largely independent of geography. Rather, it is a region of shared experience. "I became aware of my need of Zora Neale Hurston's work some time before I knew her work existed," the novelist Alice Walker begins her foreword to Robert Hemenway's 1977 biography of Hurston, the Florida-born, Barnard-trained folklorist and novelist. The need Ms. Walker cites is specifically "accurate material on voodoo practices among rural Southern blacks of the 30's," material that Hurston returned to her hometown to collect and published in 1935 as "Mules and Men."
But Ms. Walker has in mind a deeper need as well. Whatever territory a writer chooses to call his own -- fertile or rock-strewn, inherited or mortgaged -- and however far it is from home, what's required is the imaginative certainty that it is indeed a place of promise. "Place," for both blacks and women, has been a double-edged word: not only the inspiring subsoil that Eudora Welty had in mind, with its dense specifics of sensation and history, but an assigned region of self-effacement and confinement that one is expected to know and keep to.
AS Ms. Walker testifies, Hurston's loping, brash and elegantly colloquial prose gave a new voice to commonplace details of Southern experience, a voice that was at once distinctive and literary, assuredly black and undeniably female. It was as if by embracing an actual place so entirely and fearlessly she was able to fly the metaphorical coop.
Perhaps the divine is the only literature that can come into being in a true wilderness, written in short commandments on stone tablets. The human writer requires assurance that his or her thoughts are worth voicing and that there is someone out there to receive them. It's not the region that inspires the varied voices in "Tell About the South." It's the communities they've found there.

Shared-Office Industry Expands to Meet Demand

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
KENNETH B. SCHWARTZ runs his K & M Advertising Specialities firm from a shared-service office in Freehold. Down the hall another office is being used by Aspect Telecommunications, an international company based in San Jose, Calif.
Their offices are among the 52 at the 13,893-square-foot Alliance Business Center in a 65,000-square-foot building on Route 9 in Freehold. The two companies, along with the others, share a receptionist, secretarial help and conference rooms, among other amenities. 
 Entrepreneurs like Mr. Schwartz have traditionally turned to shared-service offices, also known as executive suites, as a cost-effective and flexible alternative to renting conventional office space. But with increasing frequency they are being joined by large firms such as Aspect that need to set up satellite offices quickly and in many locations. Both want access to the latest available technology for telecommunications.
To meet those demands the shared-office industry is consolidating "to have the criticial mass to warrant the investment in sophisticated technology," said Kevin J. Danehy, a vice president at the Manhattan office of CB Richard Ellis, the national commercial brokerage.
Three of the industry's larger operators have recently expanded into New Jersey by acquiring regional or local operators, opening new centers or both. One is Alliance National, a privately held concern based in Manhattan that runs the Freehold center.
The others are OmniOffices, of Atlanta, an affiliate of Carr America, a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and Reckson Executive Centers, an affiliate of Reckson Realty Associates, based in Melville, L.I., which is also a REIT. Collectively, they operate 18 executive-suites complexes with a total of 840 offices in New Jersey.
The growth is not limited to big operators "whose expansion is expected to bring recognition to the entire industry," said Jeannine Windbigler, executive director of the Executive Suite Association, a trade group in Columbus, Ohio. Small firms that decline to be acquired by larger counterparts are also expanding and "will continue to have a place in the market because everyone requires different levels of technology," she said.
There are no exact statistics on office suites available. But estimates are that there are about 157,500 suites nationwide, and the pace of new shared-office openings is 15 to 20 percent greater than two years ago, according to the association, industry specialists and suite operators.
Typically, space and furnishings and such things as a shared conference room, reception area and receptionist and maintenance are included in the rent. Tenants pay extra for support services such as the shared secretary's time and sending materials on the shared fax. Though suites are generally small, ranging from 60 to 250 square feet, they offer flexible lease terms. The typical lease is for three months to a year.
Executive suites evolved in the late 60's from the secretarial services industry as its customers began demanding other amenities, such as meeting and conference rooms and eventually office space. They were, however, slow to catch on because of their early image as a makeshift for tenants who could not afford conventional office space.
But now that advances in technology have made it easier to conduct business, executive suites have become more appealing for large corporations whose space needs change more frequently because of downsizing or expansion.
And for new companies that have formed because of the current strong economy they are a way to satisfy modest space needs and minimize costs.
Those factors, along with New Jersey's healthy office market, have prompted large suite operators to invest in the state. As of the second quarter the 11-county northern and central New Jersey office market registered an overall vacancy rate of 8.9 percent, down from 11.6 percent a year ago, according to CB Richard Ellis.
That is benefiting the executive-suite industry. But shared offices will never overwhelm the conventional office market, said Mr. Danehy, the CB vice president said. He noted, however, that suites provide companies "speed to market, including the ability to plug into the latest technology," which is critical in an era of rapidly changing global markets.
Alliance National, along with the Freehold center, purchased two other centers in central New Jersey. One is in Bridgewater, the other in East Brunswick. Together they total 145 offices in 37,500 square feet of space.
THE New Jersey purchases are part of a nationwide expansion program for Alliance National, which in the last two years has grown from 14 centers to 88 centers with 5,600 offices in 27 markets. Corporate clients make up 63 percent of the company's customer base, up from less than 40 percent five years ago, David Beale, Alliance's president said, and added: "There is a growing demand from corporations to go to a single provider for their space needs."
That appealed to Aspect Telecommunications, which provides services and products to telephone customer-support operations, and is itself growing. In opening satellite offices in the emerging markets Aspect wants to enter quickly, executive suites are the most economical and flexible alternative, said James L. Hayden Jr., associate account manager at the Staubach Company of Dallas, which handles Aspect's real estate needs. Dealing with a single operator, he added, "provides consistency to the process and makes it even faster."
Alliance plans to double the number of its centers nationwide by 2000. That includes 12 more centers with 600 more suites in New Jersey, which is a viable market "because of the supply-demand imbalance in office space that exists in many areas" of the state, Mr. Beale said.
The Freehold center, like the company's others in New Jersey, is being equipped with high-tech wiring. Its 52 suites range in size from 95 to 252 square feet and rent for $600 to $1,875 a month. Support services range on average from $400 to $700 more a month; the technological amenities are expected to add a minimum of an additional $40.
Carr America, an office REIT based in Washington, D.C., purchased OmniOffices last August as its entry into the executive-suite market. The company did so because it sees suites as an extension to its conventional office business and, more important, as an opportunity to provide alternative offices to companies -- either expanding or downsizing -- that are looking for small blocks of space, said Karen Widmeyer, a spokeswoman.
Since then Carr, through its affiliate OminOffices, has acquired 107 executive-suite complexes in England and the United States with a total of 7,307 offices. Of that total 14 executive-suite centers with 741 offices are in New Jersey, the result of its acquisition earlier this year of two Headquarters Companies (known as HQ) franchises. High-tech wiring is being installed at the New Jersey centers, which continue to operate under the HQ banner.
"To be competitive you have to invest in a system that provides one-stop shopping and access to technology," said Thomas Carr, president of Carr America, adding that "we see New Jersey, with its proximity to Manhattan and good economy, as providing us with tremendous opportunities."
Typical of the company's New Jersey operations is its Red Bank center, comprising 8,700 square feet of space in a 100,000-square-foot building on Half Mile Road. The 29 suites range from 60 to 140 square feet in size and rent for $600 to $1,000 a month. Support services range on average from $300 to $600 a month; the cost for the technological amenities have not been set, but Internet access is expected to cost around $100 a month.
The company expects to open 1,700 new shared offices nationwide within the next six months.
Reckson Executive Centers, which has nine complexes with 500 offices, most of them on Long Island, entered New Jersey six months ago. Its parent, Reckson Realty Associates, had earlier acquired several office buildings in the state "where the overall market is healthy, providing us an opportunity to follow through with office suites," said Arnold M. Widder, president of Reckson Executive Centers.
Mr. Widder said that after the last wave of corporate downsizing national companies that sought out suites "found they were an economical way to operate." And, employees who "themselves were downsized formed new companies that also needed small blocks of space," he said, adding: "Suites serve as 'incubator' space and as companies grow any number of them can become tenants in Reckson office buildings."
The company's first New Jersey center comprises 45 suites in 15,000 square feet of space in Reckson Associates' 450,000-square-foot, three-building office complex off Executive Drive in West Orange. The suites, with 150 to 250 square feet of space, rent for $700 to $1,500 a month, with support services costing on average from $200 to $500 a month. Plans call for providing access to the latest in technology.
Mr. Widder said that by 2000 his company intended to open 100 centers, with at least 5,000 offices nationwide, some of them in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Spiffing Up Helena's Last Chance Gulch

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: HELENA, Mont.

 BODY:
ABANDONED since 1954 when the popularity of train travel was fading, the weed-choked Great Northern railyard in this historic capital city is the site of an ambitious $40 million project now under way at the north end of the city's downtown.
The complex, called the Great Northern Town Center, will include a 150-room hotel with 25,000 square feet for a convention center, the only one in this city of 40,000 residents; a bank; a 23,000-square-foot office building; up to 120 condominium and rental apartments; small shops; a 6,000-square-foot, three-story tented outdoor amphitheater and an enclosed carousel. Rubber grommets will be built into the streets and parking ramp to allow tents to be erected for farmer's' markets and other events. 
 The project has been a catalyst for many other changes on the city's moribund north end. Carroll College, a four-year Roman Catholic school that sits on a hill next to the old railyard, is building a new student union and a new science complex at a total cost of $10 million to complement existing structures and is replacing an existing stadium at a cost of $1 million. It also plans to reorient the campus to the east to face the new complex. A local television station is building a $2.5 million studio on the campus, a 100,000-square-foot Federal office building is to rise next to the town center and the city is to add more soccer and baseball fields to its outdoor sports complex.
Streets, sewers and other improvements for the town center are nearing completion and construction of the office building is under way. The entire project is expected to be done in three to five years.
"We're doing something communities everywhere ought to be doing, infilling where there's already infrastructure," said Alan Nicholson, president of Nicholson Inc., which is developing the project. "We hope people who would build on the edge of town will come here."
In Montana and throughout the West growth usually means strip development, with fast-food restaurants, car lots and big- box stores on the edges of town, a pattern that has led to rampant sprawl, the loss of farms and ranches and traffic congestion. The town-center developers hope to enhance the density of downtown and to draw some development back to within city limits.
Helena was born as a free-wheeling mining camp in 1864 when four prospectors stopped to look for "color" along a creek. It was their last chance to find gold before they headed back to the thriving goldfields at Alder Gulch, farther south in Montana. One of the men, Reginald Stanley, recounted in a letter how he felt as he washed some gravel. "Three or four little flat, smooth nuggets and some fine gold was the result; nuggets that made the pan ring when dropped into it -- and a very refreshing sound it was."
OTHER miners, many of them Civil War veterans, flocked to the rich diggings and a settlement of hastily constructed log cabins, tents and dugouts sprang up along "Last Chance Gulch," which is still the name of the city's main street. In less than a year there were 3,000 people living on the gulch and 45 stores, 14 saloons, 7 restaurants, and offices for 10 doctors and 16 lawyers.
Crime became a problem in the boom town, so a secret group of citizens, primarily Masons, formed a Vigilance Committee to summarily apprehend, try and hang bandits and other felons. Between 1865 and 1870 at least 13 men were hanged from a large pine tree by the committee, and a note was often pinned to the body warning others to mend their ways or suffer a similar fate. The heritage of the self-appointed posse is still celebrated with a parade down Last Chance Gulch every May.
In an evolution typical of mining towns, affluence led to permanent structures to replace wooden stores, saloons and hotels. And as the silver and gold mining industry grew, the wooden structures gave way to granite-and-brick office buildings, banks and retail businesses, all built on top of the now-buried creek where gold was originally found. Dozens of nuggets, gold dust and flakes taken from the area are on display in a museum in a Norwest bank downtown.
Historic photos from the 1880's show Helena as a bustling city, its streets lined with office buildings and crowded with carriages at a time when most of the West was still wilderness. At one time the city had more millionaires per capita than any city in the country.
But mining was dealt a blow by the Silver Panic of 1893 when the Federal Government removed silver price supports. The downtown stopped growing and then entered a slow decline and gambling and prostitution flourished. The last brothel, called Big Dorothy's, was raided and closed in 1973.
In the 1960's urban renewal came to Helena and more than 250 historic buildings, some of them architecturally noteworthy, were demolished. Some development filled in the gaps, but for a long time the downtown languished.
In recent years, however, Montana's economy has improved. The scenic downtown, which is nestled at the foot of timber-draped peaks and less than a 10-minute walk from the surrounding Helena National Forest's hiking trails, has recovered, with offices replacing some stores. Retail and office space downtown is in demand.
A large number of unusual downtown historic buildings still remain. The Great Northern Town Center, for example, is being built behind the Helena Civic Center, a huge building resembling an Islamic mosque with a prayer tower that was constructed by the Shriners in the 1920's.
There is some concern by merchants in the existing downtown that the new development could draw businesses away. "People are nervous," said Paul Reichert, executive director of the Downtown Helena Business Improvement District. "But I think it's positive. Basically it fills in an eyesore in the heart of our downtown. I hope people will see downtown as a larger entity."
THE town center will foster a pedestrian scale and incorporate traffic-calming features. Its main street, Great Northern Boulevard, is only 24 feet wide, instead of the more traditional 40 feet. The street has six-inch risers in some places to slow traffic.
The structures in the new development will echo the rest of this city's 19th-century downtown architecture. "All of the building lots are zero lot lines," said Mike Dowling, an architect with Dowling Tintinger in Helena who designed the town center. "You have to build your building to the lot line to encourage an urban fabric. No gaps. That's a historic concept that doesn't exist today."
To foster a sense of a traditional downtown and encourage owner occupancy, covenants require that first floors of all but the all-office building be retail businesses, second and third floors be for offices and fourth floors be for homes. The covenants also encourage the use of brick and stone instead of metal and glass and require slots for windows rather than walls of glass.
"They'll be modern buildings, but classical modern buildings," said Mr. Nicholson.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: KEW GARDENS;
On Alert for Concealed Candy

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIR 

 BODY:
People have become accustomed to having their bags searched at airports, courthouses, schools and even stadiums. Now, moviegoers in Kew Gardens Hills can add their local theater to the list.
Ticket takers at Main Street Cinemas are requiring patrons to open their knapsacks and pocketbooks so they can check for any "outside" candy, beverages or other food, items not allowed in the theater. 
 Among patrons who find the policy intrusive is Selma Moses, 64. When she took her 7-year-old grandson to see "Mulan" on July 12, Mrs. Moses was asked to unzip her macrame handbag. She protested, but said a manager told her the theater had the right to inspect her bag and if she refused he would refund her money.
"How could I disappoint this child?" she asked. So she acquiesced, revealing no contraband. But then she fumed through the entire movie. "What right is it of theirs to know what I've got in my pocketbook?"
Mrs. Moses is not alone in her indignation. Since The Queens Tribune reported the incident two weeks ago, it has received more than a dozen phone calls and nearly that many letters, said Jeremy Olshan, the managing editor. A Queens woman, Jean Chiffriller, wrote that after turning over her Kit Kat bar at the door, she has boycotted the theater.
Mark Serale, co-owner of the theater, on Main Street near 73d Avenue, defended his policy, begun in late 1996. He said it discourages people from sneaking in candy, beer, weapons and videocameras. But Mr. Searle admits it also bolsters concession sales at the movie house and its sister theater in Sunnyside. "I am not going to lie, part of it is economic," he said.
In a survey released last week, the city's Department of Consumer Affairs found a pattern of high movie concession markups; for example, a 6-ounce box of Twizzlers cost $1.25 at Pathmark supermarkets but an average of $2.47 at city theaters. (The survey found Main Street Cinemas comparatively inexpensive. They charge $4 for a large container of popcorn; the citywide average is $4.27.)
Defending his policy, Mr. Serale also said, "Some people think it's unfair, but if you go into some retail shops, they won't even let you bring a bag in. You've got to check it."
The policy is rare in the film business, though. While most large chains apparently ban or discourage outside food, Maryann Grasso, executive director of the National Association of Theater Owners, said she has never heard of a theater prying into someone's parcels. Mark Pascucci, a spokesman for Sony/Loews Cineplex Entertainment, said, "If somebody walks in with a pizza, yes, we would ask them to put it aside and return it to them when the show is over." But, "searching people's bags and patting them down is contrary to the mood we want to establish." RICHARD WEIR

HEADLINE: COLLEGE & MONEY;
Students Abroad Find A Wealth of Choices, And Even Bargains

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

 BODY:
A generation ago, American collegians going abroad were typically well-bred women with rich or indulgent parents, students whose commitment to mastering the pluperfect sometimes wavered before the myriad enticements of Paris or Madrid.
While distractions remain, foreign study these days is a far different proposition. No longer confined largely to language courses, study abroad offers a vast array of places and subjects from which to choose. 
 And students have no need for investment-banker lineage. In fact, they may save money by spending a semester or two abroad -- perhaps as much as 50 percent off the cost of a private American college, which can range from $20,000 to more than $30,000 a year.
"I don't know any country that has colleges as expensive as here," said Paulo Sotero Marques, a Brazilian journalist who lives in Washington and has three college-age children.
Nissa Petersen spent the 1997-1998 academic year studying sociology at University College in Cork, Ireland. The cost, including housing and one-way air fare but not meals, came to $15,200 -- not inexpensive but significantly less than the $20,000 or so she would have paid to Salem College in Winston-Salem, N.C., where she was enrolled back home.
"I was pleasantly surprised," said Virginia Petersen, Nissa's mother. "I thought it would end up costing more." For her part, Nissa Petersen said the savings gave her the sense "that I wasn't gallivanting around at my parents' expense."
Heidi Janes, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., who spent her freshman year at Reed College in Portland, Ore., heads off this month to Capital Normal University in China. She needed to stretch her resources, since her parents had set aside a specified amount for her education. She looked to China for a bargain year expected to cost $7,500, including room and board, far less than the $28,000 she would have paid to stay in Portland. "She believed she had to do something like this to be able to graduate from Reed," Heidi's mother, Elizabeth, said.
Adding to the possible savings is the fact that students can sometimes apply their financial aid to foreign studies. While state aid and grants and scholarships from the home college cannot always be applied, Federal aid like Stafford loans and Pell grants can; in fact, it's a requirement.
But no matter how much less a foreign program appears to cost, students need to check whether they still have to pay their school at home the full domestic tuition. Among the increasing number that do are Wesleyan and Columbia Universities, Swarthmore College, the University of Pennsylvania and, beginning in the 2000-2001 academic year, Smith College.
Some institutions are "shutting the doors," said William Hoffa, a foreign-study consultant in Amherst, Mass. "The new compact is, 'You owe us eight semesters worth of tuition, regardless.' "
Students do tend to remain enrolled in a college or university at home while studying abroad, and American schools generally grant full credit for their foreign study. But because methods of evaluation vary widely by country, grades are normally disregarded in calculating grade-point averages.
More than 80 percent of students enrolling in foreign-study programs do so through their own schools or other American colleges. They can also apply on their own directly to foreign universities, taking a route that is becoming somewhat more popular, largely because it is the least expensive option. But undergraduates don't always have this choice. Some colleges will not let their students go independently and still have the work blessed with home-school credit.
With hundreds of foreign-study programs, finding the right one often involves one of the two dominant placement bureaus that have made a business of linking American students with appropriate courses in foreign institutions. One is the Institute for Study Abroad at Butler University in Indianapolis; the other is Beaver College in Glenside, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. The broker, who takes care of all arrangements and continuing supervision, is paid a fee that varies by place and situation and is built into the total cost quoted.
Students seeking the widest options may want to consult one or more of the standard references published by the
Institute of International Education in New York (Web site: www.iie.org). These include "Academic Year Abroad" ($44.95), "Vacation Study Abroad" ($39.95) and "Financial Resources for International Study" ($39.95). A free pamphlet called "Basic Facts on Study Abroad" is also available. All can be ordered by writing to I.I.E. Books, P.O. Box 371, Annapolis Junction, Md. 20701; by calling (800) 445-0443, or by connecting to the institute's on-line catalogue (www.iiebooks.org). Another useful reference is "Peterson's Study Abroad" ($29.95), from Peterson's, P.O. Box 2123, Princeton, N.J. 08543; (800) 338-3282 (www.petersons.com).
Of course, students study abroad for reasons that transcend finances: to expand their cultural horizons, and their resume. The following choices meet those criteria, but also are regarded as good value.
 
Britain and Ireland
Studying in foreign countries is not a guaranteed bargain. London and other major cities in Western Europe can be expensive. But Britain is still the most popular choice for Americans, attracting more than 25 percent of those going abroad, and it offers a wealth of programs.
Beaver College, which places the most American students in Britain, deals with 28 universities there, including University College London, known for its economics department ($19,900 for the full year, including housing but not meals). City University in London offers a popular program in which students attend classes two days a week and intern three days a week in places like the London Zoo and Parliament ($18,000 a year, including housing but not meals).
Beaver also places students in Ireland. University College Galway exerts the strongest pull on Americans, especially those of Irish descent, because of the sizable Irish-speaking community and its idyllic, west-country bayside location. (The cost is $8,700 for the fall semester, $15,200 for a full year, including lodging and one-way air fare but not meals.) Other highly regarded places are University College in Cork, which specializes in Irish studies and music, and the Institute of Public Administration, where students work as unpaid aides to members of Parliament.
Beaver College Center for Education Abroad, 450 South Easton Road, Glenside, Pa. 19038; (888) 232-8379 (www. beaver.edu/cea/).
Rutgers University has a junior-year program for study at one of 10 English and Scottish universities that students are assigned to after they are accepted into the program. Students from other colleges and universities get secondary consideration. Costs range from $14,280 a year for New Jersey residents to attend the Universities of Bristol and Sussex to a high of $21,370 for students from other states who attend University College London. The prices do not include room, board or air fare.
The other universities are those of Exeter, Manchester, Reading, York, Glasgow and St. Andrews and City University in London.

Germany
Germany has some of the biggest potential bargains because all its institutions of higher education are government-financed. Under an increasingly rare policy, as more countries end or sharply limit subsidies for noncitizens, foreigners are not charged tuition.
As might be expected, however, this policy has led to an emphasis on one-for-one exchanges between American and German students, making arrangements more difficult. A good source of information on scholarships, visas and other foreign-study matters is the New York office of the German Academic Exchange Service, 950 Third Ave., New York 10022; (212) 758-3223 (www.daad.org).
One seasoned American operator, the Institute for the International Education of Students in Chicago, has setup its own programs instead of brokering students. One is in Berlin ($9,000 a semester, $16,200 for a full year, including lodging but not meals), and two are in Freiburg. One Freiburg program, on the European Union, costs $8,400 for the semester, including lodging but not meals.
Institute for the International Education of Students, 223 WestOhio St., Chicago, Ill. 60610; (800) 995-2300 (www.iesabroad.org).
The University of Maryland University College runs sizable German programs, mostly for the military, but it also offers one in Schwabisch Gmund for civilians planning careers in international business. This English-language curriculum costs $11,000 a year for Marylanders and $16,000 for nonresidents, including room and board.
U.M.U.C. International Programs, University Boulevard at Adelphi Road, College Park, Md. 20742; (301) 985-7442 (www. umuc.edu/internat/germany.html).
 
Italy
Florence, not Rome, is the most popular Italian destination for American students, with Georgetown University, Smith College and Sarah Lawrence College offering programs of some renown. But the program that educators usually mention first is run by Syracuse University, which for more than 30 years has been a sizable presence with its own campus in this arts capital, a virtual museum without walls. Art history and architecture are the chief subjects of study for the American contingent -- 200 strong last semester.
This program is unlikely to be a money-saver, though, because Syracuse charges the same amount, about $13,000 a semester, that students pay at its campus in New York State. The price includes housing, some meals and one-way air fare. Students who join the program from higher-priced universities might find Florence cheaper than, say, Yale or Princeton, but even as a financial wash, the sunny seat of the Medicis is hard to resist.

Central and South America
The University of Costa Rica attracts students interested in the rain forest and other environmental subjects; a brochure mentions the country's 800 varieties of butterflies. The university has become such a magnet for foreigners that some students have complained about a lack of connection to the local populace.
The University of Kansas sponsors a highly regarded program that costs only $5,300 a semester, $4,300 for those enrolled at the Kansas school. This price covers everything but transportation and includes intense Spanish-language study.
Office of Study Abroad, University of Kansas, 108W Lippincott, Lawrence, Kan. 66045; (785) 864-3742 (www.ukans.edu/osa/).
The University of Illinois leads an American consortium that expects to place 70 students in one or more of three top institutions in Buenos Aires this fall. The three are the University of Buenos Aires, still a center of political ferment but not as strike-prone as it used to be; the Catholic University of Salvador, and Torcuato Di Tella University, which has rigorous economics and business programs.
"This isn't a fun-in-the-sun type of program," said Joan Solaun, foreign-study director at the University of Illinois, noting that the program requires two weeks of orientation at an Andes retreat. Tuition, room and board come to $7,985 a semester.
Study Abroad, University of Illinois, 115 International Studies Building, 910 South Fifth St., Champaign, Ill. 61820; (217) 333-6322 (www.uiuc.edu/providers/ ips/sao/).
 
The Middle East
Israel offers many choices for foreign students. Its five principal universities have formed a consortium to coordinate efforts, but each maintains individual admissions requirements and sets its own price, although costs for each are around $10,000 a year for tuition and housing. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University are the most popular choices of American students. Bar-Ilan University, in a Tel Aviv suburb, concentrates on Jewish heritage; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba offers a desert experience, and the University of Haifa exploits its location in a cosmopolitan port city and center for high technology.

An intriguing new Arab-studies program is being offered this fall in Sana, capital of newly unified Yemen in the southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula, along ancient trade routes for spices and luxury goods. The 10-week program consists of Arabic and two other courses: one on the country's 5,000-year history, the other on its current political science. Study of Arabic is recommended before starting the program, but it is not required. Registration is through Portland State University in Oregon, which has more than 30 years of experience in the Middle East. The Yemeni program costs $5,500, which covers tuition, lodging and at least one meal a day.

Australia
Sydney, host to the Olympic Games in 2000, is becoming a highly popular destination for American students. In size and breadth of curricula, institutions like the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales are similar to state-financed universities in the United States. The cost is $11,500 to $12,000 a semester, including housing and air fare, but not meals. The first semester runs from February to June and the second from July to November.
A student must take a full course load to qualify for a student visa, and a guidebook cautions that foreign students are sometimes "surprised at the workload required of them."
Butler is the main broker for Australian study. But students can save money by enrolling directly at, say, the University of Sydney, paying about $6,675 a semester for tuition, room and meals.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Strike Force;
The Relentless March Of Labor's True Foe

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
THE 54-day General Motors strike erupted over local issues, like the auto maker's push to speed up work at a plant in Flint, Mich., but the strike shared a theme with walkouts as far away as Denmark and South Korea.
Underlying these strikes and others is labor's push to resist what many economists say is an irresistible force: globalization, which opens markets to fierce competition. Globalization has pushed G.M. and other companies to reduce costs, and has created downward pressures on wages in wealthy countries. It has pushed companies to downsize, transfer jobs overseas and press their workers to produce more. 
 It was G.M.'s effort to take many of these steps -- to speed up production and to transfer work to low-wage Mexican factories -- that precipitated the strike, which was settled last Tuesday after paralyzing production and idling 190,000 workers.
Labor leaders say they are trying to slow -- and possibly even tame -- globalization, to make it less hostile to workers, and limit, for example, the exportation of jobs. But many economists say unions can neither slow nor stop globalization, a trend in which the economies of the world are growing ever closer and competition keener.
"I think they're fighting history," said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based research group. "It's partly a doomed effort to preserve an old way of life that's not preservable."
Also, the G.M. strike and other anti-globalization actions may backfire by provoking companies to accelerate plans to export jobs so they can minimize their dealings with truculent unions.
The G.M. strike can backfire in other ways. With the dealers complaining that their lots are depleted, sales of G.M. cars are expected to fall, and the consequent loss in market share will pressure the auto maker to close more plants and lay off more workers.
Some Wall Street analysts predict that G.M., frustrated by the union's resistance to cost-cutting measures at individual plants, will simply close several plants altogether to slash costs.
Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said unions were often short-sighted in fighting efforts, like G.M.'s, to cut costs in the face of global competition. "General Motors management has to do what it's doing, as painful as it is, and bite the bullet now," Mr. Josten said. "If they don't do that now, G.M.'s market share will diminish. It will become increasing less competitive and ultimately there will be fewer G.M. employees due to layoffs."
But labor unions are stepping up their battle against globalization. In California, the nation's largest apparel union has protested Guess's decision to move jeans production to Mexico.
In South Korea, workers staged a rash of strikes, angry that foreign pressure to open markets and to stop subsidizing industry is undermining their job security. In Denmark two months ago, 500,000 workers struck after employers resisted demands for six weeks of vacation, saying they could not afford it because of foreign competition.
 
Shaping History
 Labor leaders acknowledge it is impossible to halt globalization, saying their goal is to transform it into a less harmful force.
"Trade unions are trying to shape history, not reverse it," said David A. Smith, director of public policy for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
"We're not going to put the globalization genie back in the battle," Mr. Smith said. "Whether it's workers in Flint or workers in Seoul, people are wrestling with the question of, 'How are we in this moment of epochal change going to make this work for working people?' "
The unions argue that corporations gain too many of the benefits of untamed globalization, fattening profits while squeezing wages and encouraging downsizing. And they say they are fighting for all workers, not just for union members.
"History will show you that wherever there have been strong trade unions, there has been a fairer distribution of the wealth created," said Bill Jordan, general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, a coalition of unions from 141 countries.
Many economists say globalization is boosting not just corporations but the world at large by helping hold down prices, by pressuring industry to increase efficiency and by making more inexpensive products available to consumers.
And, economists point out, globalization sometimes helps push wages up, not down. Boeing and Microsoft, for example, can pay high salaries partly because of the immense foreign demand for their products.
Still, concerned that globalization could prove the great downward leveler of wages, union leaders often state that their goal is "upward leveling" -- to improve wages and working conditions abroad.
Last November, when American unions pressured Congress to shelve legislation to extend free trade to other nations, labor was often branded as protectionist.
But unions defended themselves, saying they would go along with the legislation as long as new trade agreements guaranteed labor and environmental rights.
"If you raise labor standards in low-wage countries, that's good for them and it's good for us," said Frank Borgers, a professor of labor relations at the University of Massachusetts. "It would slow the exodus of jobs."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Incredible Shrinking Banker

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
IT'S mind-boggling to consider what $1 trillion is worth. It makes up the total gross domestic product of Britain. It could buy the majority of California's seven million single-family homes and condominiums. It is also the value of all announced merger-and-acquisition activity in the United States this year.
On average, there have been 29 deals a day. You can't turn on the television without hearing some executive extol the benefits of the latest strategic combination. But one thing seems missing: Where are the investment bankers who are brokering all these mergers? 
 Gone are the 1980's, when self-described "masters of the universe" hired publicists to make sure that Fortune and The Wall Street Journal touted their feats. These days, if you ask a merger professional to name a larger-than-life personality in the field -- someone on the order of Bruce Wasserstein, the creative takeover strategist renowned for courting the press, or Robert F. Greenhill, the Morgan Stanley deal maker who later became chairman and chief executive of Smith Barney -- the telephone line nearly goes dead. "I can't think of anyone," one lawyer said. "That's tough," a banking executive said.
In the 1990's, publicity is out and modesty is in. The flamboyant power brokers of a decade ago have been supplanted by the likes of Gene T. Sykes, a Goldman, Sachs & Company partner whom you probably have never heard of but has been involved in 4 of the top 15 deals this year. Or Thomas C. King, the Salomon Smith Barney banker who was chief strategist for Worldcom when it outmaneuvered British Telecommunications with a $37 billion bid for MCI Communications last year.
"I don't need this," Mr. King said one afternoon in June, fretting about a press interview. Colleagues could interpret it as grandstanding to bolster his own career, he complained. It might antagonize his bosses, who value teamwork. And clients don't like press hounds. "Anyone who thinks they are a one-man show in M.& A., you don't want as a banker," Mr. King said. "There are more issues than any one man can deal with."
With the volume of mergers and acquisitions climbing ever higher, his is a common sentiment on Wall Street. And as the taste for mergers has changed, the investment banker's style has shifted with it. Investment banks have transformed themselves from deal-making and deal-breaking factories -- which companies hired to shield themselves from the likes of Carl C. Icahn or Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts -- into institutions where the patina of a brand name attracts business for a multitude of services offered to clients.
What has emerged is the 90's banker -- an expert in his client's industry who values teamwork over public aggrandizement and takes a backseat to the companies and corporate executives he represents.
In part, the bankers are playing the role of trusted adviser because companies are doing the swashbuckling themselves. For all the deals being forged, fewer companies, on a percentage basis, are enlisting the help of investment bankers. Of the 11,119 domestic deals announced last year, about 80 percent were negotiated without a banker on either side, up from 59 percent in 1988, according to the Securities Data Company, a research firm in Newark.
As one might guess, the bulk of the transactions are at the smaller end of the spectrum, deals valued at less than $250 million. And there is still a bonanza of work to go around because the number of deals has increased threefold. But executives at large companies have taken to negotiating their own terms, too, like Sanford I. Weill of Travelers Group, who talked directly to Citicorp's chief executive, John S. Reed, when those companies decided to merge last spring.
That is because today's deals are more likely to be friendly; the raging bull market has made corporate stock a currency that acquirers dole out generously and few targets are inclined to turn down. As a result, the brash strategist who fended off cash-toting raiders in the 80's is passe. "This is not a period where bombast counts," said Joseph H. Flom, a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who was a pioneer in offering legal advice about takeovers.
It is still possible to identify pre-eminent deal makers. But instead of a list of bold strategists who conjure up deals and then sell companies on their virtues, the lineup is full of smart tacticians who help executives weigh the companies that will be their best long-term partners. An examination of this year's biggest deals and interviews with dozens of merger professionals -- and the executives who hire them -- produced a list of four bankers who are widely recognized as at the top of their field. As the merger activity of 1998 might suggest, these are the bankers who dominate deal-making in the financial services, technology and telecommunications industries. (Profiles, page 8.)
In the past, deal makers were a tightknit group of heavy hitters who dined in stylish restaurants after days of pounding the conference room table. It was hard to find an empty bar stool at Harry's at Hanover Square, a favorite Wall Street hangout, where traders buzzed about the latest takeover battle. There was no E-mail, so breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Manhattan's East Side was a must for bankers hoping to swap gossip.
Now, bankers' numbers have swelled and they are wired -- literally. Voice mail and E-mail are favored ways to communicate with colleagues, especially with the global merger wave forcing more bankers onto airplanes to visit clients. Teams in New York now work with specialists in Europe and Asia. As a result, bankers are less clubby, and their frenetic pace is more grueling than glamorous.
One thing hasn't changed. Deal-making is still very much the boys' club it was 10 years ago. Few women have emerged into prominence, although more are showing up at the table, like Jill Greenthal, the lead media and telecommunications banker at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, who represented Tele-Communications Inc. in the negotiations that led to its deal to be acquired by AT&T for $36 billion.
And don't mistake bankers' public humility for an ego deficit. In that regard, they are still very much like their predecessors. "The difference between you and me is you observe history, I make it," one deal maker told a reporter, in a nod to his own self-importance. The difference is that such behavior is largely kept behind closed doors. "If you are perceived as a publicity hog," warned Joseph R. Perella, head of the global investment banking arm of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, "you will be ostracized here."
Bankers today are all too cognizant of the antics of their 1980's counterparts, some of whose reputations crashed along with the market in 1987, and a few of whom went to jail for insider trading. With the kind of salaries and bonuses that bankers are raking in -- anywhere from $150,000 for a first-year associate to $3 million to $5 million for a seasoned professional -- no one wants to be a reminder of those gluttonous days. Especially now, industry executives say, because most bankers earn even more than Wall Street types did a decade ago.
"Clients recognize that they are paying big fees, but they would be offended if they saw it flaunted," said one banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 'If you look at compensation, most of the people we work for, our clients, don't earn what we earn."
 
Bringing Insight to the Table
It's a late afternoon in July, and Scott D. Sullivan, the chief financial officer of Worldcom, is describing one of his worst encounters with a banker. "He had every company in the industry in his pitchbook," Mr. Sullivan groaned, ticking off a few of the 100 companies the banker was promoting as potential merger partners. Ten minutes into the pitch, Mr. Sullivan realized that his visitor had not studied Worldcom's business plan. He quickly showed him the door.
"It was like throwing 10 strands of spaghetti at the wall and seeing what would stick," he said of the banker's proposals. "They discredit themselves when they do that, and I have a long memory."
It was a different game a decade ago, when serving up a friendly partner was enough to get you hired. Then, buyout firms borrowed money, with help from the likes of the junk-bond merchant Drexel Burnham Lambert, to buy companies in distress. The most valuable bankers fended off those unwelcome advances, either through clever financing or finding a "white knight" to save a company from a predator's clutches. But now that only 1 of every 200 deals is hostile -- a tenth of the proportion in the late 1980's -- those skills are out of favor.
"You begin to ask yourself, 'What does an investment banker bring?' " said Steve Stetz, corporate vice president for mergers and acquisitions at the Monsanto Corporation, which agreed earlier this year to merge with American Home Products in a $34.4 billion deal. "It's certainly not valuation skills. We can do that. It's clearly not negotiating skills."
The answer: Bankers can offer detailed knowledge of an industry's players and share insight about what corporate strategy will prevail in the years ahead. That is why Merrill Lynch recently hired Alan J. Biloski, who has a Ph.D. in chemistry and worked in Merck's research department, to join its team of pharmaceutical deal makers.
"In the 80's, M.& A. advisers were mainly execution specialists, called in by the client to get a deal done," said Jack Levy, head of global mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch. "Now a key part of our value-added is getting with the client at a far earlier stage to assist in their forward strategic thinking."
Many corporate executives grew up in the merger era, and so they are more familiar with deals than their predecessors were. For instance, Peter Currie, chief administrative officer of Netscape Communications, worked in media and telecommunications M.& A. at Morgan Stanley. William M. Wicker left his job as co-head of the energy mergers team at Credit Suisse First Boston to head up the corporate development group at Texaco.
"It's not like you are going to open your pitchbook and they are going to say, 'We never thought of that,' " said Mr. King, of Salomon Smith Barney. "You have to show the clever structure. You have to have a tax angle to get their attention. Or you need some special color about what the seller is thinking."
That is the kind of advice that companies are happy to pay for. But as mergers become an almost universal path to growth for companies, increasing numbers of them, like Bay's rival Cisco Systems, are choosing to do without expensive advice. Since 1993, Cisco has made 24 acquisitions without a banker.
Credit that to Mike Volpi, Cisco's vice president of business development. Before joining the company in 1994, Mr. Volpi, 31, worked as a mechanical engineer at Hewlett-Packard; he also earned bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering and then an M.B.A. from Stanford University.
"We know our strategy better than any investment banker," Mr. Volpi said. Twenty-five people report to him, including a former investment banker for BancAmerica Robertson Stephens and a former analyst for Morgan Stanley. Mr. Volpi relies on a network of venture capitalists for ideas, as well as on tips from Cisco's vast sales force. He also tracks the efforts of 200 entrepreneurs for potential acquisitions.
Cisco usually buys companies valued at $50 million to $300 million that are willing to accept its stock as payment -- all of which keeps deals simpler, Mr. Volpi said. New recruits to his department are teamed with more experienced staffers, and once they have a few purchases in their portfolio, they get their own small deal to work on. "I teach them how to do acquisitions," he said. "The way to learn is through experience."
 
One-Stop Shopping
So does that mean bankers are irrelevant? Hardly. But to remain profitable, investment banks have had to become bigger, broader institutions, selling advice alongside other products.
McClatchy Newspapers' recent acquisition of Cowles Media is a good example of the one-stop shopping trend. First, McClatchy was advised by a team in the media group of Salomon Smith Barney, including a banker with experience running a British cable and telephone company. Salomon also underwrote a $1.3 billion loan to finance the transaction. When the deal closed, McClatchy announced that it sold the Cowles book and magazine properties it didn't want, a deal also brokered by Salomon. Lastly, the bankers set up the road show in which management toured the country to sell the deal to investors.
"One-stop shopping is more acceptable to corporate clients today than it used to be," said Brian D. Finn, the former co-head of mergers and acquisitions for Credit Suisse First Boston who now works at Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. "They used to be more skeptical and less trusting of investment bankers. But clients recognize now it is more efficient."
As a result, the key business strategy for investment banks has been to build a brand. When the bank itself possesses the star quality, it isn't so beholden to the whims of individual celebrities who can take a book of business with them if they defect.
The First Boston Group learned that lesson firsthand. Mr. Perella and Mr. Wasserstein were among Wall Street's highest-profile deal makers when they worked at the firm, involved in the takeover battle between the Bendix Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation and the war for control of Conoco. So when they announced in 1988 that they were leaving to start their own venture, it was a blow to First Boston. Bankers defected. Competitors sympathized, then poached clients. Only recently has the bank, now Credit Suisse First Boston, re-emerged as a competitor to watch.
Mr. Perella, for his part, left Mr. Wasserstein for the comfort of Morgan Stanley. And Mr. Wasserstein still heads Wasserstein Perella, although it hasn't recovered the glory of its early days. In a further indication of how times have changed, the once voluble Mr. Wasserstein did not return phone calls requesting an interview for this article.
Some firms are clearly thriving in the new environment. Merrill Lynch, for instance, which ranked seventh in merger activity as little as a decade ago, clocked in at No. 1 last year. But Lazard Freres & Company, which depends on rainmakers with long-term relationships to bring in business, has seen little growth in its market share in deals, according to Securities Data.
 
Personalities and Platforms
Of course, many bankers who made headlines in the 1980's can still be found on Wall Street. Mr. Greenhill, the former Morgan Stanley banker, started his own shop in 1996 and was involved in this year's merger between Compaq Computer and Digital Equipment. Felix G. Rohatyn, of Lazard fame, was still making deals on the Street until last year, when he left to become Ambassador to France.
The closest thing to a media darling that investment banking has spawned in this generation is Frank P. Quattrone, the flamboyant technology maven who in 1996 defected with a team from Morgan Stanley to establish a high-technology unit for Deutsche Bank in Silicon Valley and just recently moved to Credit Suisse First Boston.
Mr. Quattrone uses his personality almost as a calling card, a tool to remind clients that he's there. "At the end of the day, clients are people," he said. "If you come across as a down-to-earth guy with a sense of your own being, they like that."
It is even more essential in the competitive world of high-technology banking. Silicon Valley has a distinct culture, and bankers often play to that -- keeping offices on tony Sand Hill Road, spending weekends in the Napa Valley, calling on venture capitalists as often as companies.
"You need to understand the community you are going to serve," he said.
But even Mr. Quattrone nods to the notion that the institution -- the likes of Goldman or Morgan Stanley, or his new firm -- is necessary to land the account.
"If you can combine the personality with the platform, than maybe you have the best of both worlds," he said.
In such a world you can only wonder how bankers will evolve in the 21st century. If the market continues its current pace, they could look a lot like they do now, only a little more weary.
But if stocks crash and 80's-style corporate raiders decide that companies are ripe for takeover, the profile could change. Then, corporations will need defensive strategists to help fend off predators. And executives will be back on television, this time explaining why they shouldn't be bought. Corporate America will need a new style of deal maker. And those larger-than-life masters of the universe may roam Wall Street yet again.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Are Small-Cap Stocks Ready for a Rally?

BYLINE: By ANNE TERGESEN

 BODY:
JUST as baseball fans often look at a batter who is in a slump and say, "He's due," many analysts who follow small-capitalization stocks are saying they are ready to rise.
The bull market has largely been a blue-chip phenomenon, with stocks of small companies -- those with market values of less than $1 billion -- sometimes languishing far behind. And since late April, the gap between large and small has become a gulf: The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index of big-company stocks has fallen by less than 1 percent while the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks has fallen 14.6 percent. 
 Still, analysts say, a long-term investor with a stomach for the gyrations of small-cap stocks may find that now is a good time to think small. They argue that once the impact of Asia's financial crisis on American corporate earnings becomes clearer -- Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman, Sachs market guru, said she expected that to happen in "the next few months" -- the stage will be set for small caps to outperform their larger peers, which are more exposed to foreign markets.
Since the second quarter of 1997, small companies on average have posted superior earnings gains, and that trend is expected to continue at least for the rest of the year, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates.
And small caps are cheaper relative to large stocks than they have been since the market downturn of 1990, said Satya Pradhuman, director of small-cap research at Merrill Lynch.
L. Keith Mullins, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said, "I would buy some now, because small caps are very difficult to buy when the tide turns." Indeed, with trading volumes slim, prices tend to rocket when demand rises.
But before jumping into the market, consider this: Because small companies are less experienced, less diversified and less analyzed than blue chips, they are riskier investments. Moreover, limited liquidity can make it very difficult to pull out, should disaster strike.
If you can tolerate the risk, should you be looking at for value or growth stocks in the small-cap arena? Two factors suggest the former. First, value stocks tend to offer greater protection during selloffs -- something to worry about, given the market's overall high valuations and recent volatility. Second, small-cap value stocks have achieved twice the cumulative return of their growth-stock counterparts from 1979 through June 30 of this year, according to Frank Russell & Company, a financial consulting firm in Tacoma, Wash.
Following are some small-cap holdings of 5 of the 10 best small-cap value managers, ranked according to their funds' five-year records by Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
A YOUNG REIT -- The top-performing fund, Weitz Hickory, is not restricted to the small-cap market, but the fund's manager, Richard F. Lawson, says that is where the bargains are these days. Specifically, Mr. Lawson likes Novastar Financial, a real estate investment trust in Westwood, Kan., that he says has "two strikes against it" because, as a mortgage REIT and a subprime mortgage lender, it is in two areas now out of favor with investors. But with an experienced management team as well as more conservative accounting standards and lower taxes and costs than rivals, it should be selling for more than its current eight times 1999 earnings estimates of $2.13 a share, Mr. Lawson said.
Because Novastar, just one and a half years old, is still in a start-up phase, costs are likely to fall and earnings are likely to climb, he said. And what is the fair value of the stock, now at $16.3125? At least $30, said Mr. Lawson, who is so confident that he has poured 4.1 percent of his fund's assets of more than $300 million into the company, which has a market capitalization of just $150 million.
A COMPUTER'S PICK -- One of the top 10 holdings of the Barr Rosenberg U.S. Small Cap fund is First Citizens Bankshares, a regional bank in Raleigh, N.C., that is trading at $100.25 a share, or 16 times trailing 12-month earnings. First Citizens, whose market capitalization recently reached $1 billion, was picked by Barr Rosenberg's computer models, which look for small companies trading for less than they are worth, predict which companies are likely to post higher-than-expected profits over the year and reject those on which the market has soured.
Ultimately, the model compiles a portfolio that mimics the sector weightings and risk profile of the Russell 2000, but with a lower average price-to-earnings ratio, said Floyd Coleman, the portfolio manager. The fund, with 730 stocks, closed to new investors in February.
A CHOICE IN CHIPS -- Bob Perkins now has about 15 percent of his Berger Small Cap Value fund in an unlikely place: semiconductor, communication and other growth stocks that have fallen so far they now resemble value-style investments. One pick is Speedfam International, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment in Chandler, Ariz.
The company, which accounts for 2 percent of the fund's $220 million portfolio, is trading at $16.875, or 24 times earnings estimates for 1999. More important to Mr. Perkins, Speedfam offers various protections: cash on hand equivalent to $9 a share, profits and a debt-free balance sheet.
Mr. Perkins said that the Asian crisis had beaten down many stocks in this sector, but that he was confident that the turmoil would subside. As a result, he expects the company to trade at up to 20 times the $2 a share he thinks it can earn in 2000.
RIPE FOR GAINS -- In contrast, William B. Gerlach, co-manager of the $1 billion MAS Small Cap Value Portfolio, offers a more classic value-style investment: Fresh Del Monte Produce, the banana-and-pineapple producer and distributor. At $18.75, the stock trades at 11 times its consensus earnings estimate for 1998, a multiple lower than the company's projected average annualized profit growth of 15 percent this year and next.
By comparison, the rival Dole Food trades at 16 times its 1998 earnings estimates. But Dole's earnings expectations have been lowered, while estimates for Fresh Del Monte have been raised for both this year and next. And Mr. Gerlach expects further upward revisions in light of Fresh Del Monte's announcement on July 22, that it had agreed to acquire the IAT Group, a company that would add other fruits and vegetables to Fresh Del Monte's product line. Given Dole's price-to-earnings ratio, Fresh Del Monte is worth about $23, he added.
CLEANED AND PRESSED -- These days, Peter Larson, manager of the $320 million Galaxy Small Cap Value fund, is bullish on Unifirst of Wilmington, Mass., a renter of uniforms for delivery people, mechanics and others. At $26.1666, the stock trades for about 14 times 1999 earnings estimates, less than half the multiple of 37 for the industry leader, Cintas. With forecasts of 15.6 percent earnings growth in 1999, fueled by small acquisitions, minor price increases and a new, more efficient distribution center, Unifirst could hit $35 by year-end, Mr. Larson said. Industry consolidation may also help the stock, which makes up 1.1 percent of Mr. Larson's portfolio.
Of course, there is no guarantee that either these stocks or small caps in general will take off. Skeptics note that although a positive climate has existed for small caps for some time, the market has not yet rallied. Still, history suggests that patient investors will be rewarded. According to Ibbotson Associates, the research firm in Chicago, small caps have earned compound annual returns of 12.7 percent since 1926, versus 11 percent for S.& P. 500 stocks. That may sound like a minor difference, but over time, it adds up: $1 invested in big stocks 72 years ago is now worth $1,828; the same investment in small stocks would have grown to $5,520.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Contagion Effect;
A Guide to the Modern Domino Theory

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN another era, the domino theory was used to justify why America was risking lives in Southeast Asia and other battlefields of the cold war. Lose one country to Communism, and others would fall. Historians will long argue whether the theory was right, or a politically convenient fiction. But few were willing to gamble on finding out, until the threshold of national pain became too great in the rice paddies of Vietnam.
For a year now the domino theory has been making a comeback, this time paired with the newest buzzword in foreign policy: Contagion. The general idea is the same -- if one country's economy is permitted to implode, it could start an uncontrollable set of events around the world -- even if it has less to do with guns and Communists than with currency reserves and the psychology of panicked investors. "The financial domino theory has actually proven more accurate than the national security domino theory," Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, mused in his office last week. "Vietnam fell and other countries didn't. But you saw what happened after Thailand," the ground zero of the Asian meltdown. 
 The result is a significant shift in the way some in Washington look at how the world is woven together. Before the Mexican peso crisis in late 1994, only economists talked about "financial contagion." Now it is the throwaway phrase of dozens of daily headlines. Like any fast-spreading disease, it now comes in many varieties: There is market contagion, export contagion, yen contagion, and now even reverse contagion, which is akin to giving the flu to children and then catching it from them all over again.
Diplomats who were comfortable with the old cold war dominoes now stuff their speeches with speculation about contagion's political impact. Last week Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright cautioned that the political impact was just beginning to be felt. "Misery," she warned in Australia, which is reeling from Asia's troubles, "can give rise to mistrust among nations."
And the Clinton Administration, like the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations during Vietnam, is using the fear of falling dominoes to get Congress to finance a policy of containment. On Friday President Clinton used the latest evidence of a slowdown in the American economy -- 1.4 percent growth in the second quarter, down from 5.5 percent -- to bolster his arguments that Congress should pony up $18 billion more for the International Monetary Fund. The I.M.F. cites the anxieties about "systemic contagion" in the world's major economies to explain why it has led rescue efforts totaling roughly $150 billion in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and the riskiest bailout of all, Russia. (And that excludes this summer's coming attractions: Ukraine, Pakistan and perhaps Malaysia.)
But how many of the world's problems can contagion really explain? Can a banking crisis in rich, mismanaged Japan really explain the flight of investors from broke, mismanaged Russia? Why should a stampede of investors out of a small nation like Thailand cause absolutely nothing for two months and then lead to a stampede in neighboring Indonesia and then faraway emerging markets from South Africa to Brazil? And since it was not exactly a well-kept secret that Southeast Asia is a hotbed of cronyism, corruption and weak banks, how could some of the world's savviest investors suddenly conclude that this a fatal flaw, one that sent them racing to pull out their money?
The answer is that sometimes the fall of the fiscal dominoes makes perfect sense. Except when it doesn't.
The most straightforward strain of economic contagion is as old as international trade, and these days farmers in North Dakota and miners in Australia can tell you all about it. Asia's slowdown has cut deeply into its consumption of all kinds of commodities. It took a while to ripple through the world economy, but now it has hit full force. American exports, which drove economic growth for so long, have fallen off a cliff. Moreover, the resulting commodities glut has depressed prices for everyone. And the price declines have wreaked havoc elsewhere. Russia's biggest problem is that it can't convince its people to pay taxes, but its second-biggest problem is the decline in oil prices that has cut into its most important source of hard currency.
But there are other, more complex channels of contagion, like the currency devaluations that have sent Asia reeling. More than ever, countries compete with each other the same way companies do: South Korea and Japan, for example, both produce computer chips and cars. And when one country's currency falls, those products are suddenly available in the United States and elsewhere at sale prices. That tempts other countries to let the value of their currencies fall.
 
Vicious Cycle
 That can quickly turn into a vicious, competitive cycle, which is one reason the United States is pleading with China and Russia not to devalue their currencies. "If China devalues, Southeast Asia is back in the fire," says one senior I.M.F. official. "And if Russia devalues, that's it for the Ukraine."
Investors, of course, don't stand around watching. They play a critical role in fueling the fires, or tamping them out. And this is where the markets and the politics get so intertwined that it is impossible to tell where domestic economic policy stops and diplomacy begins.
 
Getting Sicker
Last Thursday, for example, The New York Times reported that American officials and outside experts now believe Japan's banks may have upwards of $1 trillion in bad debts. Traders began to sell the yen, and kept selling after the new Japanese finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, made comments about his economic plans that sounded wobbly to investors around the world. Earlier in the week, Russian officials, fresh from their latest I.M.F. bailout, sounded marginally less serious about implementing the reforms they promised in return for the world's money. Investors hit the sell button.
This is where the market contagion kicks in. If Japan is getting sicker, doesn't that mean its time to sell currencies elsewhere in Asia, where everything depends on how fast Japan recovers? And other investors, sitting in their offices in New York or at a home computer in Berlin, may simply decide that they didn't know as much about some of these countries as they thought they did. Rather than examine the differences between Thailand and Indonesia they succumb to the natural reaction to pack up their cash and get out of every emerging market. Technology has made that cheaper and easier to do than ever, so infections spread faster than ever.
This phenomenon is not limited to new investors. "We were astounded to discover how little some very large investors knew about Korea," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said a few months ago. Once burned, he noted, they looked for similar symptoms elsewhere and found them all over the globe. That's when those dominoes start falling.
"The only way to describe this is rational panic," said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist who has studied the causes of contagion. "Even if you think that conditions are fundamentally sound in a country, if everyone else is headed out the door, it makes sense for you to head out, too, because someone is going to be left holding the bag."
Mr. Sachs and others have been studying the question of how to identify countries that could easily fall prey to contagion. He and others are increasingly focused on the ratio of a country's short-term debts to its foreign currency reserves. If the debt soars out of line with the reserves, it can lead to panic. But the I.M.F. is hesitant to blow the whistle on countries that appear headed for trouble, for fear of causing a crisis.
 
Picking Up the Dominoes
 So countries are looking for other solutions. Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive of the world's most free-market city, Hong Kong, startled President Clinton's delegation during its visit last month when he talked about whether Asian countries should control the flow of capital into and out of the region. No one in Asia talked that way when $400 billion poured in between 1990 and 1996. But then it all left at once.
All that money is not going to flow back any time soon. Investors hate uncertainty. Eventually, bargain hunters sense that the bottom has been hit and money is once again trickling back into Thailand and Korea. But as anyone who has played with dominoes knows, knocking them over takes a lot less time than setting them up.

HEADLINE: The Millennium Bug Looms

 BODY:
Fear of chaos in the world's computer systems in the year 2000 may be hard for most people to take seriously. The temptation is to assume that since technicians created the problem, technicians can solve it. But with only 516 days until the fateful turnover, it is clear that the United States is not moving fast enough to fix its computers or prepare for significant disruptions. Instead of addressing a potential crisis, many leaders in business and government are complacent, declining to act for fear of lawsuits or engaging in political fights. Their lack of attention could be crippling. 
 The so-called millennium bug arises from chips and software coded to mark the years with only two digits. If not adjusted by Jan. 1, 2000, myriad systems will "roll over like the odometer on an old Chevy," as Wired magazine put it, effectively thinking they had just jumped back to the year 1900. No one is sure what will happen. The breakdowns could be minor, or they could disable everything from air traffic control systems to financial networks, power grids, hospitals and home appliances. Some economists warn of a global recession.
It makes sense to prepare for the worst. The Federal Government has made progress but is far behind in upgrading air traffic systems, Medicare, the Pentagon and other sectors. In addition, a petty budget dispute between the House and Senate has blocked $3 billion in emergency funds to speed up the process. A major problem is that even if the Federal Government is in perfect shape, its systems could become impaired by interacting with state and local governments, where potential problems are rampant. Similarly, big businesses could fix their own systems only to have them break down by contact with noncompliant customers, clients and suppliers at home and overseas. The Securities and Exchange Commission is actively monitoring efforts to root out problems throughout the financial industry, but much more needs to be done.
President Clinton has belatedly stepped up the Federal campaign to increase public awareness by establishing a Council on Year 2000 Conversion, but he and Al Gore, the First Technophile, should do even more. They and sympathetic members of Congress should win passage of legislation to encourage companies to share information with one another, disclose problems to the public and move more aggressively to correct them. At present, many businesses are afraid to act out of fear that any corrective efforts that fell short would simply invite lawsuits charging that they knew their systems were flawed.
If the millennium bug problem were simply a matter of software, it would be bad enough. But experts say the most dangerous aspect of the problem is that so many systems -- from missiles to natural-gas pipelines to hospital equipment -- rely on billions of tiny chips embedded where they would have to be found by engineers and reprogrammed or replaced. Congress should consider tax incentives or subsidies to encourage businesses to identify vulnerabilities and recruit professionals, including retired people.
It may well be that all these problems can be managed. But experts recommend that employees ask their bosses about what is being done to get ready. If the answer is that there is nothing to worry about, it is time to start worrying. It will cost billions to fix potential problems. But that is nothing compared to what it will cost if the fears of many experts prove correct.

In the Census Battle, It's Politics vs. Logic

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR years, Thomas P. O'Neill's famous dictum that all politics is local has been gospel in this capital, believed in the soul, repeated early and often. But Tip O'Neill hadn't seen this year's fight over statistical sampling to augment the 2000 Census and to account for those who are generally missed by traditional head-counting methods.
As if defying the laws of politics -- and some might even say logic -- the pitched battle over what seems an arcane subject has not been marked by the regional divisions that normally define fights over how to count the country's population. 
 Instead, the current imbroglio has been a purely partisan affair, so much so that some of the principals seem to be putting party loyalty above the interests of their state or region. Republicans are fighting -- and Democrats are staunchly supporting -- the Census Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling even though there is evidence that the states that will be helped the most by sampling will be the strongholds of their own party.
"I do not understand the Republican opposition to sampling," said David Bositis, a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, who is studying the impact of the use of sampling on the census. "The states that would be hurt the most are much more Democratic than the states that are Republican."
 
Head Counts and Estimates
 The proposed methodology is straightforward. The Census Bureau plans to count at least 90 percent of all households in every census tract -- neighborhoods of roughly 1,700 dwellings. The results of that large "sample" will be used to estimate the number and characteristics of the people in the remaining 10 percent. To provide a quality check, statisticians will compare their estimates with the result of a national survey of 750,000 households.
But if the method seems clearcut, the lineups for and against sampling seem bizarre.
If the 1990 census had been adjusted using sampling methods, Georgia's population would have been boosted by about 300,000. Some demographers feel the same result would probably happen in 2000. Yet sampling is opposed by all the members of the state's Republican delegation, including Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has filed suit in Federal court to have the Census Bureau's plans declared unconstitutional.
A 1997 study by the Congressional Research Service suggests that if the Census Bureau does not use sampling in 2000, Mississippi could lose a Congressional seat. Yet, the technique is vigorously opposed by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi. "No one is served well by having some computer in Washington guess how many people live in Buckatunna, Mississippi," Mr. Lott's spokesman said.
Democratic proponents of sampling exhibit their own incongruities. A study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies indicates that some of the states with the most to lose from sampling are Ohio, Michigan, Massachusetts and Missouri. But some of the staunchest proponents of the method are people like Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the house minority leader, and Representative Thomas C. Sawyer of Ohio.
"I do think that everybody on both sides of the aisle ought to look closer at what sampling might do to their respective states," said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a sampling opponent who was the ranking Republican on the House committee that oversaw the 1990 census. "Some people favor sampling. But, if their numbers go up a little bit because of sampling, and the numbers go up substantially in other states, they may lose."
 
Fighting Yesterday's War
 An explanation for the positions might be that politicians, like generals, are fighting an old war. Like many issues where race is involved -- and it is minorities who are disproportionately undercounted -- the assumption is that it is a problem of blacks in northern cities.
In fact, the 1990 census showed that the undercount was becoming more an issue for the Sun Belt, a sign of how the South and West are being transformed by the influx of Latino immigrants.
"There was a real change from where the undercount was in 1990 from where it was in 1980," said Paula Duggan, a senior policy analyst for the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research center for Northern lawmakers.
But ignorance of the country's demographic shifts is not the whole answer for the sharp partisanship that characterizes the current debate over sampling.
After the 1990 census many Sun Belt lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, were well aware of how their states would be short-changed in the allocation of Federal funds. They pleaded with the Bush Administration to adjust the population count upward based on numbers that had been derived through sampling.
Republicans now argue that they merely want a more accurate count when the data are used for disbursing Federal funds. But, they say, the use of sampling to apportion seats in the House and draw Congressional districts is illegal and could be manipulated for partisan advantage.
"You're allocating representation in Congress, where there are always winners and losers, which is much more fundamental than money," said Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who opposes sampling.
Indeed, the current political dynamic may be pushing both parties toward positions on sampling that may be against their own regional or state interests.
Because such a large proportion of those who are missed by traditional counting methods are minorities, some analysts say, the Democratic Party, whose statewide and national candidates depend on black and Hispanic voters, have little or no choice but to support sampling.
"Could you imagine what would happen if the Democrats said we don't care if there is a black undercount or a Hispanic undercount?" Mr. Bositis said.
And with the Republicans holding a thin majority of 11 seats in the House, there may be a palpable fear that anything, including sampling, might cause them to lose power. After all, holding onto the chairmanship of a Congressional committee that decides which Federal programs are financed is probably more politically compelling than getting a few million additional dollars through funding formulas based on population counts.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: "Voting the Party Line Against Local Interests"
The Census Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to adjust population counts has run into a partisan barrier that at times defies regional interests. Broadly, Republicans are fighting the move and Democrats are supporting it; that can create an apparent conflict when a particular Republican politician represents a region that would benefit from the change, and vice versa.
 
WINNERS
States whose population count would grow if sampling were used, but whose Republican representatives oppose it.
 
FLORIDA -- Senator Connie Mack and House Republicans.
GEORGIA -- House speaker Newt Gingrich has filed a suit claiming any adjustment is unconstitutional.
MISSISSIPPI -- Senate majority leader Trent Lott.
TEXAS -- Senator Phil Gramm and House Majority leader Dick Armey.
 
LOSERS
States whose population count would probably shrink, but whose Democratic representatives would still vote for the adjustment.
 
ILLINOIS -- Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.
MASSACHUSETTS -- Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
MICHIGAN -- House Minority Whip David E. Bonior.
OHIO -- Senator John Glenn and Representive Thomas C. Sawyer, one of the main proponents of the move.

There's Something About Bill

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Here is a consumer tip I never thought I'd find in The New York Times:
"If semen is found on the dress, prosecutors would then probably seek a saliva or blood sample from the President to determine if the DNA matched," read the lead story on Friday about President Clinton's travails. "Such a stain would retain DNA material for many years, unless the dress had been cleaned with detergents, said experts in DNA testing. Dry cleaning alone would not remove it, nor would storage under poor conditions, they said." 
 Hints from Heloise meets White House coverage. Forget money laundering. Now it's just laundering.
With "There's Something About Mary" and "BASEketball," we are in the era of gross-out movies, celebrating the disgusting, breaking taboos on private parts, precious bodily fluids and puerile sex jokes.
With Monica Lewinsky, Ken Starr and Bill Clinton, we are in the era of gross-out politics. Even in a scandal that has set new records for crudeness, the return of the infamous "love dress," as the tabloids call it, represents a grotesque turn.
What kind of girl saves such a trophy, much less sends it to her mother for safekeeping? One TV commentator dubbed it "the 90's version of a corsage."
There have been many surreal moments, but surely this one broke new ground. President Clinton coming out to the Rose Garden and trying to brag about the rosy economy, when he knew the reporters were waiting to pounce with only one question: "Would you voluntarily give a DNA sample in advance, sir?"
This week was a bizarre convergence of many unsavory elements of our society: the Clinton case merging with the O. J. case. Here was Barry Scheck back talking about DNA testing. Here was self-styled "citizen-journalist" Matt Drudge reporting that when Linda Tripp told Lucianne Goldberg about the dress, the hard-boiled literary agent consulted with one of her authors, Mark Fuhrman, about how a semen stain on a garment could be obtained for testing. (A Q-tip, dipped in water.) With the fate of the republic hanging on a navy blue cocktail dress, here was Bill Clinton jetting off to the Hamptons to visit the homes of Steven Spielberg and Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger for an orgy of fund-raising and celebrity in a gross-out synergy of Hollywood and Washington.
Although we do not like to admit it, America seems addicted to scraping the bottom of the barrel. We're getting cruder, more self-involved and more over-the-top by the minute. Phil Donahue devolves to Jerry Springer. Woody Allen devolves to the Farrelly brothers and "South Park" guys. Helen Gurley Brown devolves to Elizabeth Wurtzel.
The merger of entertainment and politics that began with John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan reached a sour fruition with Bill Clinton. He campaigned and governed using lowbrow forums of popular entertainment, answering questions about boxers or briefs. And now the lowbrow culture he cultivated has engulfed his Presidency and, most likely, his legacy.
"Bill Clinton's place in history will be as the President who worried about his place in history," says The New Republic's literary editor, Leon Wieseltier.
Just as movie and television comedy is permeated with the ill-mannered, self-indulgent mentality of adolescent boys, Mr. Clinton has reversed the usual pattern of the Presidency, switching from a paternal model to an adolescent model. He expects us to clean up, ignore or forgive his messes.
It is easy to feel sorry for the likable and boyish President. Leaders should have some zone of privacy. And Mr. Clinton's tormenters are all so creepy, opportunistic and partisan.
Despite what the public thinks, most journalists I know are not panting after this story. Like the public, most of us find it disgusting and wish it would go away. No matter how many heartfelt speeches Linda Tripp gives about being at one with them, Americans are never going to forgive her illicitly taping a friend. And they are never going to approve of the salacious, relentless route Mr. Starr has taken in his pursuit of Mr. Clinton's scalp.
But the jam Mr. Clinton finds himself in is a direct result of his lack of discipline, his refusal to take responsibility and his willingness to lie, cover up, use loyal aides or smear talkative ex-girlfriends when all other means of escape seem blocked.
You might call it a vast gross-out conspiracy.

STRIKES
G.M. and U.A.W. Settle
 
After nearly eight weeks that are expected to cost General Motors $3 billion in after-tax losses, the auto maker and the United Automobile Workers union settled strikes at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich. The strikes had shut down G.M. assembly plants across North America, rippled through to suppliers, pushed hundreds of thousands of workers into temporary unemployment and slowed the nation's economic growth. One worker, Matthew Purzycki, and his wife, Amy, embraced in joy at the settlement. But it is less labor peace than rapprochement -- it does not directly address issues that the union had declared were driving the strike, like G.M.'s push to open new factories overseas or its effort to shrink its American work force through attrition. Still, the two sides agreed to meet regularly in an effort to avert future strikes. 

THE ECONOMY
Creeping Wage Inflation
 
In one of the tightest peacetime labor markets in memory, wage inflation is rising. But it is creeping, not galloping. The Labor Department's employment cost index -- a broad gauge that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other policy makers -- rose 0.9 percent this spring, slightly more than the winter's 0.7 percent increase. . . . The gross domestic product increased at a modest 1.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. The slackening after a 5.5 percent rate in the first three months was attributed to losing trade with crisis-ridden Asian nations and to the prolonged G.M. strike. . . . Sales of new homes climbed 3.8 percent in June, to an annual rate of 935,000 units, the fastest pace since record-keeping began in 1963, the Commerce Department said.
 
MARKETS
Stocks Are Battered
 
Stock prices snapped out of their slump toward the end of the week, as the Dow Jones industrial average climbed back above 9,000 on Thursday in heavy trading. It ended the week at 9,0TK.TK, up TK.TK, but still about 300 points below its high of 9,337.97, set on July 17. Among the big winners were technology stocks. . . . Despite the market's recent choppy conditions, new and additional issues of stock so far this year are running high, Securities Data reported. Some 600 common-stock deals in the first seven months of 1998 brought in domestic proceeds of about $66.7 billion, surpassed only by the $69.6 billion of offerings in the comparable period of 1996.
 
PEOPLE
Former Fed Chief Dies
 
William McChesney Martin Jr., who steered an independent course during 19 years as chairman of the Federal Reserve, died at 91. He had won the respect of five Administrations, from that of Harry S. Truman to Richard M. Nixon. . . . Walter A. Forbes, chairman of the beleaguered Cendant Corporation, a direct marketer and franchiser, resigned. The board immediately elected Henry R. Silverman, the company's chief executive, to the additional post of chairman. . . . Ron Carey, the Teamster president who once seemed destined to clean up one of the nation's largest but most corrupt unions, was expelled from the union by a court-appointed review board. It said he failed to stop an illegal scheme that siphoned more than $750,000 in union money into his 1996 re-election campaign.
 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
The Merger Frenzy
 
Bell Atlantic, which dominates local telephone business from Maine to Virginia, agreed to acquire the GTE Corporation, the nation's largest independent local and long-distance company, for $52.9 billion in stock. But stock traders made the deal look more like the pin that burst the telecommunications stock bubble than a megamerger. Most telephone stocks declined, and investors who had bought GTE shares hoping that they would rise in a takeover saw their price slide, too. GTE ended the week at $ TK.TK, down $ TK from Monday's close of $55.75, while Bell Atlantic fell TK.TK cents to $ TK.TK (Article, page 4). . . . AT&T and British Telecommunications agreed to merge most of their international operations into a jointly owned company that would have $10 billion in revenue.
 
OTHER DEALS
Multinational Multimedia
 
The French Government agreed to sell 30 percent of its money-losing Thomson Multimedia, one of Europe's largest consumer electronics makers, to four companies including Microsoft, which is expected to expand its push into delivering Internet services via television. The other buyers are the DirecTV unit of Hughes Electronics, NEC of Japan and Alcatel Alsthom of France. . . . American International Group said it would invest $1.35 billion in the Blackstone Group, a private New York merchant bank. . . . Paul Allen, the billionaire investor, agreed to buy more than 90 percent of Charter Communications, the nation's 10th-largest cable operator, for $4.5 billion. . . . Swiss Reinsurance agreed to acquire Life Re for $1.8 billion cash.
 
SOFTWARE
Letter Bomb by E-Mail?
 
Popular E-mail programs from Microsoft and Netscape Communications have a serious security flaw that could permit a malicious person to send a virus-laden message that could crash a computer and destroy or even steal data when an attachment was opened. Although there is no evidence yet of any virus that exploits this vulnerability, security tests have shown that the flaw exists in three popular E-mail programs, used by perhaps tens of millions of people around the world: Microsoft's Outlook Express and Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail. The flaw is said to result from programmers' use of the programming languages C and C++.
 
JAPAN
The Red Ink Thickens
 
Japan's banking crisis is far worse than Tokyo has publicly acknowledged, American officials and private financial experts have concluded, with bad debts approaching roughly $1 trillion, or nearly twice the official estimate. Japanese banks have used accounting tricks to hide unpaid debts, the foreign experts said. Former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who has been a fixture in American-Japanese relations for four decades, agreed to become Finance Minister, thus landing in the center of the financial storm. The new estimates suggest that bailing out the Japanese banks could cost Japanese taxpayers far more than the $214 billion that Tokyo has set aside.
 
SUMMER MADNESS
The Roar of the Crowd
 
Hoping for one of the 500 free pairs of jeans being offered, hundreds of people swarmed a new Old Navy store in the heart of Chicago's loop on Thursday, clogging streets and creating a street festival-type atmosphere during the midday rush hour until three police officers on horseback herded them to the sidewalk. "This is all just for a store opening," one officer said. "Unbelievable." . . . . Unbelievable? He should have seen the crowds in Connecticut, above. But there the stakes were higher: $292 million in a Powerball lottery. Thousands of out-of-state ticket buyers swarmed into elegant Greenwich, creating a spectacle that local residents found decidedly declasse.

HEADLINE: Storm Clouds of Asia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
The economic news out of Washington for the last three years has been relentlessly good: a steady stream of arrows moving upward that have buoyed the economy, inspired investors small and large, kept billions of dollars pouring into the stock market and sustained the approval ratings of a President whose noneconomic troubles seem to have no end.
So it was no surprise that the White House was eager to put the best possible spin on a vital statistic that came out today: 1.4 percent growth in the second quarter, a long, long drop from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of the year. 
 The number was better than many economists had expected. But it was also the first clear sign that America's economy is fragile and that Asia's troubles -- which America kept at bay for so long -- are finally arriving on these shores.
The figure may be just a quirk, and with the strike at General Motors over, it seems unlikely that America is headed into a downturn. But the magnitude of the drop-off and the very real possibility that Asia's troubles will grow far worse before they get better are bringing about a quiet reassessment of the economic and political possibilities for the rest of President Clinton's term.
A range of assumptions underpinning daily debate in Washington -- from the size of long-awaited Government surpluses to the prospects of shoring up Social Security -- are based on the optimistic view that the next few years will look much like the last few. And President Clinton's high approval rating, which hovers at 68 percent even as he prepares to be questioned about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, is widely presumed to depend on continued, strong economic growth.
"Our Monica problems may be bad," one senior White House official said late this week, "but imagine how bad they would be in a down economy."
The Administration, noting that consumers are still spending and America's economic fundamentals look better than virtually any other nation's, says it remains optimistic.
"I still think the most likely scenario is solid growth and low inflation," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in an interview today. But he noted that "Asia is clearly having an impact."
For example, farm exports to Asia are down 35 percent, and the prices of all commodities are sinking as demand across the Pacific shrinks. That has created an economic oddity in the United States: The pain in Thailand and Tokyo is being felt far worse in Iowa and South Dakota than it is in American cities.
"This was the wake-up call," Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist at Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said today. Mr. Sung's parsing of the numbers suggested that the Asian crisis took two percentage points off America's economic growth in the second quarter, far more than experts estimated it would a year ago.
Asia was not the only factor in the fall: the G.M. strike cut into American output, and so did a huge overhang in the inventory of goods produced early in the year. But the strike is over and the inventories -- everything from cars to raw materials -- have been used up. That leaves Asia as the largest single storm cloud hanging offshore. The problem is that it is getting closer.
"There are two scenarios," said Kenneth Courtis, the chief Asian economist for Deutsche Bank. "If Japan turns its economy around, that puts a floor under the rest of Asia, and we skirt away from disaster. If not, well who knows where it will end?"
That explains why President Clinton, appearing at a Rose Garden news conference today, where he was eager to make news that had nothing to do with Ms. Lewinsky, spent as much time talking about the future of Japan's economy as he did about the future of America's.
"It is going to be very, very difficult for Asia to recover unless its leading economy, Japan, leads the way," Mr. Clinton said after sketching out the turmoil's effect on American farmers and renewing his call for Congress to increase the United States' commitment to the International Monetary Fund by $18 billion.
To soothe Japanese officials embittered by a constant stream of criticism from Washington, he talked about America's longstanding "partnership" with Japan. But his top aides, including Mr. Rubin and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, spent much of the week warning Japanese officials publicly that they are running out of time.
What Mr. Clinton did not say was that almost every internal prediction inside his Administration suggests that the Asian crisis will get worse before it gets better. Nine of 13 major economies in Asia are already in recession or depression. While there are signs of hope in Thailand and Korea, where the currencies have begun to recover and interest rates have fallen considerably, the contagion has also spread beyond the Pacific -- engulfing Russia and South Africa -- and China acknowledges, too, that it is slowing down fast.
The concern about Asia is not simply that it will continue to depress American exports, or that it will create more political problems here by adding $40 billion to $50 billion to the United States trade deficit. The bigger fear is that if American consumer spending cools off, either because Americans begin to lose their confidence in the future or a stock market drop makes them feel suddenly poorer, there is no cushion for the shock. With the dollar hitting highs and many major trading partners in recession, American companies will not be able to export much of what they can no longer sell here.
"We have this Jekyll and Hyde economy," Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics in Boston, said today. "There is tremendous weakness on the international side and tremendous strength on the domestic side. That doesn't leave a lot of room for error."
The "error" everyone fears is an eventual downturn in the stock market. Consider this statistic: In 1990, the amount of net worth of households tied up in the stock market was roughly $3 trillion, Mr. Sung said. Earlier this year, it was about $13 trillion, including $2.6 trillion pumped in over the last year.
This has created what economists call a "wealth effect." As the market rises, families feel better about spending. A stock market plunge could easily lead consumers to pull in their horns. That is exactly what Japanese consumers began doing seven years ago, and no one has been able to persuade them to begin to spend again.

HEADLINE: A Dynamo Redefines Turks' Role In the World

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, July 31

 BODY:
A messenger recently visited the ambassadors of Latin American countries in Ankara and handed each of them something they had never seen before: an invitation to meet with the Foreign Minister and discuss ways to improve relations between Turkey and Latin America.
Soon afterward the Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem, summoned Turkey's ambassadors in Africa home to lay plans for a new diplomatic offensive on that continent. 
 These sessions had to be wedged between Mr. Cem's frenetic foreign travels, which have taken him to more than 30 countries in his first year in office. He has visited the United States and almost every European country, and is planning trips to lands from Argentina and Canada to India and Iran.
One measure of his success is the stream of foreign dignitaries visiting Turkey. The President of Romania and the Prime Ministers of Spain and Italy have been here in recent days, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is expected soon.
For most of this decade Turkish foreign policy has been weak and vacillating, reflecting the instability of Turkish Governments and Turkey's inability to find a new role to replace its cold-war position as a front-line NATO state bordering the Soviet Union. Foreign ministers have changed so often that some have barely had time to furnish their offices, much less develop cogent strategies. Mr. Cem's immediate predecessor, Tansu Ciller, was so uninterested in the job that she often went weeks at a time without even appearing at the Foreign Ministry.
Against this background, Mr. Cem's energy and sweeping new visions have come as an unexpected but welcome dose of adrenaline.
"I am trying to change the scope of our foreign policy," Mr. Cem (pronounced jem) said in an interview, speaking colloquial English as smoke curled from his pipe. "We no longer perceive ourselves as a country on the outer periphery of Europe. Of course we are part of Europe. But now we see ourselves as a pivotal country in the emerging geography of Eurasia.
"Enormous amounts of oil and gas are beginning to flow out of the Caspian basin. China is emerging as an economic giant. Goods will soon be moving in huge volumes around this region. You only have to look at a map, and to understand the size of the Turkish economy, to realize that we are in a very new and very important position."
Last December, Turkey suffered a humiliating setback when the European Union refused to consider its application for membership. But while some Turks reacted with anger and frustration, Mr. Cem calmly asserted that Turkey had many other places to turn.
Some of his initiatives have required delicate balancing acts. Turkey has cemented strong ties with Israel, for example, but has also made new overtures to Iran, Syria and Iraq.
In other areas, notably in relations with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus, he has not been able to make any substantial progress.
When traveling in what he calls "the new Eurasian geography," Mr. Cem uses an approach that was anathema to his predecessors. He portrays himself as the representative not only of a 75-year-old republic, but also of the long Ottoman political tradition.
"Turkey has for years had a foreign policy in which the historical factor did not exist," he said. "We are bringing that factor back into play, and when I go to places like Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia, Azerbaijan and central Asia, I see that it brings a very positive response.
"Even in Jerusalem I was told very proudly that the walls of the old city were built by a Turkish sultan. People are aware of the history they share with us."
Mr. Cem, 58, is a member of the Democratic Left party, led by Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit. He studied political science in Switzerland and has spent much of his career as a journalist, including a spell as director of the state-run Turkish television network. Photography is his private passion.
"He's the most intellectually interesting and thoughtful Foreign Minister Turkey has had in some time," a European ambassador said. "When you talk to him you see his eyebrow curl, and you have the feeling that he's really thinking things through. Unfortunately he runs into a wall in some countries because of Turkey's human rights problems. I also have the feeling that he has to take a tough line on Greece and Cyprus in order to have the freedom to shape policy in other areas."
"In his heart he's pro-Western, pro-European, modern and liberal-minded," the ambassador said. "That isn't true for everyone in his party or everyone in his Government."

HEADLINE: Cool to U.S., Caribbean Hails Castro All the More Warmly

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Underlining the failure of American efforts to isolate Cuba diplomatically, Fidel Castro has embarked on a triumphant tour of the English-speaking Caribbean, which is scheduled to bring him on Sunday to this tiny island nation where United States troops expelled Cuban forces nearly 15 years ago.
All visible traces of that conflict, the only time American and Cuban forces have ever directly confronted each other, are gone now. So too, at least in theory, is the cold war, which for a few days in October 1983 made this verdant country of barely 100,000 people a bloody battleground. 
 But when Mr. Castro lands here at Point Salines airport, which was partly built by Cuban workers and which for that reason was condemned by the Reagan Administration as a base for Castro-ite subversion, an old struggle will be resuming on different terms. Though no longer seeking to challenge the United States militarily, Cuba is once again actively jockeying for influence in the region, to the delight of ministates unhappy about Washington's attitude.
The trip is part of a Cuban campaign to strengthen trade and political ties with its smaller neighbors since the collapse of the Soviet bloc. But the warming relations also reflect English-speaking Caribbean leaders' growing impatience with what they see as Washington's lack of interest in their development and rigidity toward Mr. Castro.
"We are implacably opposed to the economic blockade of Cuba, which is morally wrong," the Prime Minister of Jamaica, P. J. Patterson, said at a rally this week in Montego Bay at which Mr. Castro was presented with the keys to the city. The blockade, Mr. Patterson said, "constitutes a threat to the sovereignty of other states." He also said he found it lamentable that "shadows of cold war hostilities continue to haunt us in this hemisphere."
Since early 1997, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada and leaders from Barbados, Dominica, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines have visited Havana. But the pace of the regional renewal of relations has intensified since Pope John Paul II visited Cuba in January and urged the world to "open itself" to Cuba, and vice versa.
At a summit meeting of the 16-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom, in St. Lucia last month, leaders of English-speaking island nations made it clear that they wanted to invite Cuba to join their trade bloc, whether the United States likes it or not. In June, Caribbean nations led a successful effort to give Cuba observer status with the Lome Group, an international body whose members, as former colonies, are granted preferential trade treatment in European markets.
In interviews, American officials seem largely indifferent to the region's strengthened political ties with Cuba, contending that it is a "failed model" no longer representing a security threat to the Caribbean or the United States. But they also acknowledge that there is little they can do to prevent the relationship from deepening without damaging larger American interests, notably securing cooperation in the struggle against drug trafficking.
If only for their own protection, small Caribbean nations prefer to engage Cuba rather than to ignore or isolate it. They see Cuba, with its 11 million people, as a strong competitor for the tourist dollar and -- looking ahead to a more open post-Castro era -- a potential rival for foreign investment.
"I think about Cuba a lot," said Vishnu Ramlogan, director of the Tourism and Industrial Development Company of Trinidad and Tobago, an official agency. (Mr. Castro is not visiting Trinidad.)
"The emergence of Cuba makes them a strong competitive force and an important player in the region, in both tourism and industry."
During the trip, Mr. Castro has sought to calm such concerns about his intentions. In a speech in Jamaica, he said Cuba sought the "strengthening of links" and the "sharing of experiences" with its Caribbean neighbors, in order to develop "multidestinational aspects of our main tourist resources."
Indeed, Mr. Castro's itinerary during a six-day swing appears intended to maximize his opportunities to play the role of avuncular and benevolent regional elder statesman. On his first stop, Jamaica, he visited the tomb of a former Prime Minister, Michael Manley, who pursued a policy of friendship toward Cuba in the 1970's that alarmed and alienated the United States. He even paid tribute to a Jamaican child who recently won a spelling bee in the United States.
In Barbados, Mr. Castro took part today in ceremonies marking Emancipation Day, a holiday throughout the Caribbean that commemorates Britain's abolition of slavery in the region in the 1830's. He also dedicated a memorial to the 73 people killed when terrorists blew up a Cuban airliner shortly after it took off from the Barbados airport in October 1976, a notorious episode attributed to Cuban exile groups.
During the two days he will spend in Grenada, his most controversial stop, Mr. Castro will dedicate a plaque at Point Salines airport, honoring the contribution of Cuban "internationalists." He is also scheduled to meet the mother of Maurice Bishop, the pro-Cuban former Prime Minister whose killing during an October 1983 coup attempt, led by dissident members of his own party, sparked the American invasion of the island.
Later this month, Mr. Castro will travel to the Dominican Republic, which resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba earlier this year after 37 years, to take part in a regional conference. Capping a year of unusual diplomatic activity, Mr. Castro is also to visit Portugal and South Africa before the end of 1998.
But there is much more than mere political symbolism involved in Cuba's rapprochement with the English-speaking Caribbean. Despite severe economic problems of its own, including fuel and power shortages, drought and a lack of foreign exchange, Cuba has begun a major effort to provide economic and other assistance to its neighbors.
Cuban officials say that more than 200 Cuban doctors, teachers, sports coaches, engineers and other technicians are working in Caribbean nations. In addition, about 250 students from Caribbean countries have been granted full scholarships to study at Cuban universities.
In Grenada, Cuban engineers are helping design a new national stadium, and some Grenadians have been flown to Cuba for medical care. To help St. Kitts and Nevis recover from a hurricane, Cuba sent farmers there seeds and tons of fertilizer.
The Cuban effort helps fill a large gap left by a diminished American profile in the region. American aid to the Caribbean fell nearly 90 percent between 1985 and 1995, to $26 million from $226 million, and the United States Agency for International Development has closed its regional office in Barbados.
"We have a lot of needs and we have not been getting support," Mr. Mitchell, the Prime Minister of Grenada, said in an interview here after returning from his visit to Cuba last year. "Our traditional friends have indicated that the days of grants, aid and soft loans are gone. We cannot understand this. People know we are in trouble, and we need help."
The Clinton Administration has also stirred resentment among its Caribbean allies by pressing the World Trade Organization to end an arrangement that guaranteed Caribbean bananas preferential access to European markets. As a result, the United States' political and economic leverage throughout the region has weakened, and Cuba's is growing.
"The young people are on my back," Mr. Mitchell explained. "They voted for me, and if it were not for them, I would not be in power today. People want their lives improved, they want health care, they want jobs, they want opportunity, and I can't deliver. But I have to deliver for them and I am willing to accept help from anyone, so long as it is done on our terms and does not interfere with our independence and sovereignty."

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials, in Indonesia, Warn Rulers to Respect Rights

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Aug. 1

 BODY:
With American officials warning that Indonesia is on the verge of economic and social collapse, a Clinton Administration delegation led by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen called on Indonesia's new President and military commanders today to honor their pledge to end human rights abuses and show restraint if Government opponents take to the streets again.
Mr. Cohen is the highest-ranking American official to visit Indonesia since President Suharto was forced to resign last May after 32 years in power. He said that the country, the world's fourth most populous, was in the midst of a crisis and that he had urged its leaders to move quickly "toward a democratic form of government." 
 The Defense Secretary described his meetings here with President B. J. Habibie, Mr. Suharto's former Vice President and his successor, and Gen. Wiranto, the military commander, as "very open, very candid." He said he was encouraged by their response. Mr. Habibie, he said, "indicated his strong commitment to place human rights at a very high level of concern and his commitment to the people of Indonesia."
More than 1,200 people were killed in May in the rioting that led to President Suharto's resignation.
The end of the Suharto era did not halt the staggering economic slide of Indonesia, which now faces its worst economic crisis in decades. An estimated 100 million people -- about half of the population -- are expected to sink below the poverty line by the end of the year. The crisis has wiped out 30 years of impressive economic growth. Malnutrition is widespread and growing.
Administration officials say that Mr. Cohen and senior American military commanders were sent to Indonesia this week in hopes that such a high-level visit would impress the country's military. As the strongest Government institution in Indonesia, it may hold the key to the future of this sprawling archipelago nation.
Ties in recent years between American and Indonesian military commanders have been close -- far too close, according to rights groups in Indonesia.
The Pentagon has been embarrassed by reports that an elite American-trained Indonesian military unit was responsible for some of the killings in May, as well as the kidnappings of democracy activists who have still not been found.
The special forces unit, known as Kopassus, was led at the time of the riots by Lieut. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of Mr. Suharto who is known to be especially close to his American military counterparts. General Prabowo has since been demoted by General Wiranto, his military rival.
Mr. Cohen held a news conference at the Defense Ministry after meeting here with General Wiranto (who like many Indonesians uses only one name). The Defense Secretary said he had urged the Indonesian commander to press forward with investigations of the military's responsibility for the recent violence.
"I do know that the Indonesian Government has a number of investigations under way in terms of any abuses of human rights," Mr. Cohen said. "It's important that such investigations be carried out openly, honestly, with integrity. And if that is done, it will enjoy the support of the Indonesian people and the commendation of the world community."
The United States suspended most of its ties to the Indonesian military as a result of the uprising in May. Yet despite the allegations that American-trained troops might have been responsible for some of the worst of the violence, Mr. Cohen said the United States hoped to "build upon a military relationship in the future."
He added, "We would not be resuming our normal military-to-military relations at this time; hopefully in the coming months that can be a reality."
Other American officials here said the Defense Department had determined that even if American-trained soldiers had committed some of the murders, the United States should continue to work with the military, to maintain influence over what happens next. Indonesia is considered important to American economic and strategic interests in Asia.
One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that "we want to find out whether American-trained forces were involved, but we don't begin from the proposition that even if they were, that somehow means that the training programs were wrong." He said it was "wrong to damn the whole program simply" because of the actions of a fraction of its graduates.
Mr. Cohen said today that the Indonesian military decision to withdraw some combat troops from East Timor was also "very encouraging."
President Habibie has vowed to find ways of providing greater autonomy to East Timor, the former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed in 1976. The disputed territory has been the scene of fierce fighting between the Indonesian military and separatists, and troops have repeatedly been accused of rights abuses.
Last week the Indonesian Army began the withdrawal of 1,000 fighters from East Timor in what it said was a gesture of good will. Its force of soldiers and police officers there numbers about 11,000.
Mr. Cohen welcomed the move today. "I think there have been some encouraging signs as far as a willingness to try to resolve the tensions and the friction over East Timor," he said.

HEADLINE: Mainers Say Hello Headsets, Farewell Chicken Plucking

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG

DATELINE: BELFAST, Me.

 BODY:
The tide used to blush red with chicken blood here and when it ebbed, leave watermarks written in feathers. Flurries of down sometimes whitened Main Street, as if left by a town pillow-fight. Pleasure boats shunned the harbor, fearing the slimy fat that would coat their hulls. And summer visitors, not used to the smell, held their noses as they passed from odor to odor: the poultry plants, the sewage plant, the fish plant.
Such are residents' unaffectionate memories of Belfast a decade or two ago, when the economy of this sloping-to-the-sea city of 6,500 residents was dominated by poultry processing, one of the heavy, messy industries Maine has been known for through much of the century. 
 But now, Belfast is becoming the poster town for the quick-spreading change taking place as the state -- long famed for its textile mills, paper plants and shoe factories -- makes a belated entry into the post-industrial age. In what Gov. Angus King advertises as the most striking transformation of a Maine town by higher-tech industry, Belfast's rubber-boot jobs -- most lost when plants closed -- are being more than replaced by telephone-headset jobs, of the sort that have turned other states, like Nebraska and Wyoming, into headset hot spots.
"We're not chicken pluckers anymore; we're telecommunicators," said Gail Berry, a 49-year-old Belfast native and former hairstylist.
Ms. Berry works for MBNA, the largest independent credit-card lender in the world. So do 1,500 other people in the mall-like building the company opened here in 1996, handling calls from credit-card users or would-be users, and their numbers are expected to swell by 2,000 more. Across Maine, such call centers have become the state's largest new industry in the last decade, creating more than 10,000 jobs.
Call centers are "the sort of post-industrial analogue to the mill economy," said Charles Colgan, an economist at the University of Southern Maine. "In a way, they have replaced the textile and apparel and shoe mills in the sense that they employ moderately skilled people, a large number of them, at a lower cost than you would employ those same people in a larger urban setting, and at a much lower cost for the land and buildings."
That mill analogy may help to explain what seems at first a psychological mystery to outsiders: the lack of unanimous rejoicing over the call centers.
After all, a company like MBNA has created thousands of nonpolluting jobs where they were much needed; the jobs offer health insurance and other benefits and pay not badly for hereabouts, beginning at an average first-year salary and bonuses of $25,000; employees work in seas of cubicles in airy, climate-controlled rooms. On top of all that, the company has given millions in charity to local hospitals, libraries and schools.
And yet, ask people in Belfast about MBNA and the feelings they express are often decidedly mixed. Their appreciation of the jobs and the philanthropy is swirled with unease and skepticism over an arrival of such size, with so much money, and with a powerful corporate culture of slogans, performance incentives, suburban-looking design and even jacket-and-tie dressing much more familiar in, say, Connecticut than in rural Maine.
"I don't hate it," said Ryan Brown, tending bar one recent night at Bruno's & Rico's Pub, a shabby-cozy, bear-cave of a town bar. "It's just that, would you rather live and die on your own time cutting sardines or would you rather be bought and paid for and owned by MBNA?"
"At least," countered Mike Reynolds, who runs the laundry next door, when you work for MBNA, "you don't smell like fish when you get out of work."
And at least people have work. Maine has lagged about two years behind the national recovery from the recession of the late 1980's, and though it has replaced all the jobs it had lost and begun expanding, it still has northern pockets where unemployment reaches 10 percent.
Belfast particularly hit the skids in the 1980's, as its shoe and poultry factories closed, and the fine old shipbuilding city gained a reputation as a druggy, dead-end spot.
By the mid-1980's, said Jay Davis, deputy editor of the weekly Maine Times, the seedlings of the city's turnaround were being planted, and outside grants came in to put in an industrial park, fix up the downtown and create a waterfront park. A new civic energy was growing among the town's disparate groups of old-time Maine families, former hippies and transplanted retirees, he said.
But there was no great influx of jobs until 1993, when MBNA, seeking to base a branch of the company in New England, brought several hundred jobs to nearby Camden, attracted in part by summertime ties the company's president, Charles M. Cawley, had to the seaside area.
And as for MBNA's arrival in Belfast in 1996, said Mr. Davis, who is co-writing a town history, "It's the biggest thing to happen to Belfast since the poultry industry in the 1950's by far."
He, too, sees the call center as an improved, 21st-century version of a mill or factory. "It's trying to do what the shoe factory did, too, which is to make money for its owners and shareholders," Mr. Davis said. "And that's what it's there for, and when it stops doing that, it's not going to be there, just like the shoe factory wasn't here anymore."
Governor King sounds less skeptical when he paints his picture of the new, improved Maine. In an interview, he spoke about the magnetism that Maine's quality of life -- its low crime and rocky beauty (he did not mention its winters) -- is exerting on high-tech workers.
The two top industries in the state remain tourism and manufacturing, with an emphasis on paper and shipbuilding. But already, Mr. King said, biotechnology, at $350 million in gross annual revenue, is a bigger money-maker for Maine than lobstering and potato farming combined.
Yet Mr. Colgan, the economist, said Maine's high-technology sector had failed to achieve the critical mass needed to take off. And the call centers, he said, should be seen mainly as great employment lifts for particular rural regions, like Belfast's Waldo County, known as one of the poorest counties in New England.
Already, MBNA has opened a call center that is likely to employ up to 200 people in Presque Isle in far-northern Aroostook County; ICT Group, another call-center company, has opened centers in the last year in inland Oxford and Pittsfield, and the Sitel Corporation has moved into remote Limestone, in distant Aroostook. L. L. Bean, known as the grandfather of Maine telephone business, is also thriving, and call centers are becoming so common that they are known to poach one another's workers in some Maine spots.
Although MBNA may not define Maine's economic future, it certainly seems likely to define much of Belfast's, at least for the near term.
"We're here and we love it here," said David Spartin, vice chairman and spokesman for MBNA, which by last year was the eighth-largest private employer in the state, with well over 3,000 workers.
That size and power disturb some people here. "My beef is that they're too big for this area, much too big," said Doug Hufnagel, a local columnist who has been one of the few residents to air doubts about MBNA in public. He has printed up scenic postcards depicting a Hollywood-like sign and satirically declaring "Welcome to Cawleywood," a reference to Mr. Cawley of MBNA.
Mr. Hufnagel's criticisms bespeak a broader culture clash: MBNA has struck many here as profligate in its willingness to tear down structures or undo decor that seems perfectly fine. Its new money can strike those used to old-money summer people as brash, and even the very business it is in -- credit -- contradicts the Maine emphasis on thrift.
Still, Mr. Hufnagel backtracked. "I don't know -- it's jobs," he said. "For a lot of people it's better than McDonald's or the chicken factory."
Some people say MBNA seems just about like heaven, and applications outnumber jobs 10 to 1, company officials say.
Before coming to work at MBNA two years ago, Lisa Ripley, 31, worked mainly at near-minimum-wage jobs in a local seafood-smoking factory and at a leather tannery. There were seasonal layoffs and little chance of advancement. Now, she said, her family is so proud of her work as a customer advocate ("You know that number on the back of your credit card? That's me.") that her grandmother insists on broadcasting that she is an MBNA "manager," even though she is not.
"I think the biggest difference between my family and me is they still get up in the morning and go to their job," Ms. Ripley said. "I get up in the morning looking forward to another day in my career."

HEADLINE: Indians Proudly Revive a Tradition of Running

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SHIPROCK, N.M.

 BODY:
Against a backdrop of junked cars and sagging trailers, a long line of young Navajos set off one recent morning, running toward the East, running toward the rising sun.
"When the sun comes up, the gods come up, so we run to greet the gods in the morning," Kelly Upshaw, a Navajo from Fort Defiance, Ariz., said as she unwound from the run, pacing about a high school track here. "That is how my parents taught me." 
 A 20-year-old college junior, she came home to the giant Navajo Nation reservation this summer to help teach running clinics organized by Wings of America, a youth program for Indians based in Santa Fe, N.M., which is leading a running renaissance in Indian country.
"Running has its roots in the spiritual tradition," said William E. Channing, the group's president. "Running increases pride, self-esteem, cultural identity. It brings people together in a healthy life style."
Since before recorded time, American Indians ran -- for trade, for communication and for the spiritual belief that a runner creates a living cord between the earth and the sky. This tradition carried over into the 20th century when, in the 1912 Olympics, Jim Thorpe, a Sac and Fox, won gold medals in the decathlon and the pentathlon and Louis Tewanima, a Hopi, won a silver medal in the 10,000 meters.
But in recent decades, the American Indian running tradition has faltered. As the Indians' fleet-of-foot styles of life have ceded to the sedentary, health indicators for Indians have plummeted.
Here on the Navajo Nation, home to one-fifth of America's one million Indians living on reservations, one-quarter of the population has diabetes, a condition not detected here a half century ago. About one-quarter of Navajo young people are obese.
"Two generations ago, people were more active physically, growing their own food, chopping their own firewood, herding their sheep," said Dr. Chris Percy, director of Shiprock's community heath services.
On the social level, the Navajo Nation has 45 percent unemployment, high rates of drug and alcohol abuse, a teen-age suicide rate that is 3 times the national average, and a murder rate that is 4.5 times the national average. With half the reservation population under 21 years old and gangs proliferating, Navajo elders are desperate to steer the younger generation toward self-discipline and attainment of goals.
Becki Wells, 23, a Blackfoot Indian who hopes to run the 1,500 meters in the 2000 Olympics, believes she is a role model to Navajo girls who are flocking to the 17 Wings clinics on the reservation this summer.
"You can go with the alcohol and sex -- or you can go with the running," she tells teen-agers. "If you are serious about high school athletics, you are less likely to go out drinking every weekend, you are less likely to get pregnant and more likely to go to college."
The revival of running among Indians is easily seen here in Shiprock, one of the Navajos' largest towns. At Shiprock High School, which was built within view of the town's 7,200-foot-high namesake butte, running teams for boys and girls draw about one-fifth of the 500 students eligible for school sports.
Reynalda Harry, a 15-year-old Navajo, said that running builds pride at her school, Newcomb High School. "We are lifting up the school, showing people we are not just a low-class high school," she said.
Wings is successfully tapping American Indians' dormant running talent. Every year since Wings was founded in 1988, the group has sent teams of boys and girls in the 14-to-19 age group to the National Cross Country Championships sponsored by USA Track and Field. Wings teams have finished first 9 times out of a possible 20 times.
Although Wings clinics have been held on 60 reservations, from the Penobscot in Maine to the Jicarilla Apache in New Mexico, the strongest runners often come from the Southwest, in part because of high-altitude training.
"We get calls every week from Indian communities around the country, but there is not a huge percentage we can help without more money," Mr. Channing said. The organization's largest corporate sponsor is Nike, which this year covers almost one-quarter of Wings's $250,000 budget, and about $70,000 in shorts, shoes, shirts, caps and bags.
The impact of running on self-esteem could be seen tattooed on the right arm of Tim Martin, a Navajo running instructor who prefers his tribe's traditional name, Dine. Leaving behind high school friends in dead-end jobs, the 24-year-old Wings runner is completing his college education this year and sporting a tattoo on his shoulder. Under a green-blue spear is printed: Dine-Warrior.
"When I go out, I want people to know I am Navajo," he said. "It drives me to run harder."

HEADLINE: As the Old-Line Anglican Churches Wilt, Those in Africa Flower Profusely

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR

DATELINE: CANTERBURY, England, Aug. 1

 BODY:
As the world's Anglican bishops are gathered in this historic cathedral city for their once-a-decade meeting, the Lambeth Conference, a major trend can be discerned among the lists of those invited to attend.
For the first time since these conferences began 130 years ago, the bishops who are heads of dioceses in the Church of England, the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Churches of Canada and Australia -- which historically sent missionaries abroad -- are outnumbered by their counterparts from the Anglican churches of Africa and Asia -- the continents to which so many of those missionaries were sent. 
 It is a sign of something larger, say some bishops and academic experts who study religious trends, that among the 37 churches that make up the Anglican Communion (and within other branches of Christianity as well), the center of gravity is gradually shifting toward the Southern Hemisphere. The faith there is growing rapidly, while many churches in North America and Europe increase slowly or even decline.
Within Anglicanism, "the growth takes place mostly in the south, in the developing churches," said Bishop Simon Chiwanga, a leading prelate at the conference, who is head of the Diocese of Mpwapwa, in east central Tanzania.
When his diocese was created out of a larger church jurisdiction in 1991, it contained 93,000 members of the Church of the Province of Tanzania, the Anglican church there. But since then, he said, his flock has increased to about 120,000 -- a figure greater than the number of Episcopalians in New York City and northern New Jersey combined.
Unlike Congressional districts in the United States, church dioceses are not devised to be roughly equal in population. But an expansion in their number within a particular church typically signifies membership growth. In addition, an increase in the number of bishops from a particular region means a rise in that region's influence within a larger religious organization, like the Anglican Communion.
Officials here said the churches represented at the last Lambeth Conference, in 1988, comprised about 500 dioceses, while this year the number is nearly 600, with the difference coming largely from among the African churches. The Tanzanian church sent bishops from 12 dioceses in 1988. It currently has 16 dioceses. Ten years ago, the Church of the Province of Nigeria had 26 dioceses; now it has 61.
In keeping with their increased numbers, the bishops from Africa and Asia have helped set the tone of discussions at this year's conference, which might be described as economically liberal and socially conservative.
The conference, for example, has expressed deep concern over foreign debts carried by developing nations, declaring that these impose a financial burden that keep poor countries mired in poverty.
At the same time, some African bishops have sided with church conservatives against any attempt by liberal bishops from the United States and Europe to adopt a more welcoming stance toward homosexuals in the church.
In all, about 800 bishops are attending the conference, some of them assistant bishops and others suffragan bishops, or bishops-elect.
The three-week gathering, a purely consultative affair that ends on Aug. 9, is being held at the University of Kent, a complex of modern beige-colored buildings atop a hill with a sweeping view of Canterbury's skyline and its massive cathedral.
This city -- popularly associated with Chaucer's pilgrims and their goal, the shrine to Thomas a Beckett -- is the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual leader of the Church of England, an independent religious body since King Henry VIII broke with Rome in the 1530's. Within the Anglican Communion, the Archbishop, the Most Rev. George L. Carey, lacks the power and prestige of a pope, but does possess a degree of mystical authority as a "unifying symbol" for the various Anglican churches.
As late as 1978, a majority of the world's Anglican population lived in Britain, said David B. Barrett, a professor at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Va., who is editor of the World Christian Encyclopedia, a huge compendium of statistics about churches around the globe. But today, he estimated, the British constitute only about 35 percent of 73 million Anglicans worldwide.
Dr. Barrett distributed a pamphlet to the bishops at the conference, projecting that by the year 2000, Anglicans would number 31.6 million in Africa and 6.1 million in Asia. By contrast, the Church of England estimates its current baptized membership at 26 million.
"The point is," Dr. Barrett said, the Anglican population is increasing in Africa and Asia "while in Britain, it's declining very slightly." He added that similar growth patterns prevail among Roman Catholics, Baptists, Methodists and Pentecostals and many independent churches.
According to Vatican statistics, between 1976 and 1995, the Roman Catholic population in Africa more than doubled to 107 million, while Catholics in Asia increased by 90 percent, to 101 million. Europe's Catholic population grew by less than 10 percent, to 288 million, according to those statistics.
To a degree, those changes have been reflected in the College of Cardinals, the body that chooses the popes. In the 20 years since the election of Pope John Paul II, the proportion of European cardinals in the college has declined from 50 percent to 46 percent, while the cardinals from Africa, Asia and Latin America, taken together, have risen from 36 percent to 41 percent of the total, according to figures in an analysis of the college by the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine "America."
For some years now, Vatican-watchers have included cardinals from outside Europe on their short lists of possible candidates for the next pope. Recently, a similar idea was raised, albeit obliquely, about the next Archbishop of Canterbury.
Among the documents available for study here at the Lambeth Conference is one known as "The Virginia Report," a consideration of the nature of the Anglican Communion, written by theologians and church leaders. Among the questions it raises is, "Does an Archbishop of Canterbury necessarily have to be a member of the Church of England?"
Those who have studied the phenomenon of church growth in developing nations, whether church leaders or academics, offer a variety of reasons for it. The churches, they say, are benefiting from general population growth trends, the desire for people migrating to cities for a sense of community, the attraction of church-run school and hospital systems, and the comfort of services that practice forms of spiritual healing.
But Archbishop Khotso Makhulu of Botswana, another leading figure at the conference, said many Christian churches had grown as they had adopted African forms of worship, incorporating music and dance into their liturgies. "The church in many areas is moving away from staid and bland expressions of Christianity," he said.
"A big day in the past would have been pretty well a Solemn High Mass Western-style, with Gregorian chant and plainsong," he said. "Now what is happening is musicologists are coming to the fore, writing African hymns."
The result, he added, is rooted in local cultural expression: "It's an affirmation of who I am before my God and the world."

HEADLINE: THE BOATING REPORT;
Entering Kenwood Cup With a New Perspective on Life

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
Driving across the Golden Gate Bridge recently on his way to work, Paul Cayard gave way to idle reflection. He was an hour behind schedule at his San Francisco office. And, trying as he is to begin an America's Cup campaign, each of his calendar hours looks more like a week of commitments. Not a good time to be running late.
"I knew I was late," the 39-year-old yachtsman said recently. "But I was thinking, 'I'm not in a hurry.' A year ago, I would have been completely stressed out. But the Whitbread race has put everything in perspective. Alone in the Southern Ocean, the way we were, there were those moments where you are really scared. And that really makes an impression on you." 
 The adrenaline-charged reports that Cayard sent by satellite from the 60-foot EF Language are history. Regarded at its finish last May as a stunning victory for a team of mostly round-the-buoy sailors, the achievement by the EF crew in the Whitbread Round the World Race was a personal triumph for Cayard.
But now it is back to rounding orange buoys instead of eerie white icebergs. And the next event on the list is the 11th biennial Kenwood Cup, which is expected to begin tomorrow off Honolulu.
To get back into day-racing, Cayard has agreed to sail as tactician on Illbruck-Pinta, a One Design 48 being chartered for the Hawaii series by an aspiring around-the-world team from Germany. The Germans are so committed to the next equivalent of the Whitbread in 2001-2002, which will be called the Volvo Ocean Race, that they purchased EF Language and EF Education, both former Whitbread competitors -- for training purposes. In charge of Illbruck-Pinta will be John Kostecki of San Francisco, the regular Illbruck skipper who also happens to have signed on with Cayard to participate in his America One 1999-2000 America's Cup campaign.
"It's John's program," Cayard said about the Illbruck. "I've got a huge load on my shoulders with America One, and I want to limit my responsibilities in other areas."
Cayard is struggling to find the $20 million or more in corporate sponsorship that he and most of the other 15 cup challengers are still seeking. In addition, Cayard has lost several key members of his team to competing syndicates.
The first defection came last year when Laurent Esquier, Cayard's veteran cup manager, took a job with Prada, the Italian challenger. Last spring, Steve Erickson, a longtime friend and sailing cohort in the Whitbread Round the World Race, also took a position with Prada. Then last week, Kimo Worthington left America One. Worthington is expected to sign on with Young America, the New York Yacht Club team.
For Kostecki, a vital member of the America One effort and still loyal to Cayard, sailing with his America's Cup boss is a two-way street.
"Obviously, adding Paul Cayard to our Illbruck-Pinta crew is a nice bonus for the Kenwood Cup," Kostecki said recently.
The 12-day Kenwood series includes eight day races: four ocean triangles and four windward-leeward courses of about 10-12 nautical miles each. On Friday is a 150-mile middle-distance race from Honolulu to Maui, and on Aug. 11, a 376-mile race from Oahu to Maui and back.
America's Cup teams are revving up their intensity now, with many sailors choosing to hone their skills in the Kenwood Cup. Also scheduled to race off Hawaii is Peter Gilmour, the intense but amicable skipper from Australia who has signed on with the Japanese Nippon team.
Also competing is John Kolius, helmsman for the 1D48 Abracadaba and skipper for the Aloha Racing Team of Hawaii, and Dawn Riley, the Detroit sailor who plans to campaign the America True boat in the 1999-2000 America's Cup races.
Six of the One Design 48 yachts have been transported to Hawaii for the regatta. Their presence is being felt by Ken Morrison, Kenwood's race director for the last 20 years. Since its inception as the Clipper Cup in 1978, the biennial regatta has featured team racing based on handicap rules for differently designed boats.
But that mix is eroding, as is over-all participation. A weak Asian economy this year has reduced the number of handicap entries from Japan, Australia and New Zealand. In 1982, there were a record 82 boats; now there are about 30.
Of those, the six 1D48 yachts are not competing in the long-distance race because of a tight shipping schedule. That leaves 24 boats to sail the last and most important race.
"We have to look very closely at the proliferation of One Design 48's," Morrison said about realistic prospects for a greater one-design fleet in the Kenwood Cup 2000.

HEADLINE: A Top M.B.A. Is a Hot Ticket as Salaries Climb

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The 1990's were supposed to be lean years for graduates of the nation's top business schools. Overpriced, overabundant and caricatured in movies like "Working Girl," M.B.A.'s were destined for the same fate as junk bonds and Manhattan real estate -- or so business school deans and business journalists predicted at the start of the decade.
Seven fat years later, M.B.A.'s have never been more numerous -- or more in demand. At schools in the top tier, variously defined as the top 5, 10 or 25, recruiting by companies has turned cutthroat. The typical University of Chicago graduate turns down so many job offers that the dean's main worry has become "dealing with all the disappointed companies." And the salaries of M.B.A.'s have climbed even faster in the 1990's than in the so-called Decade of Greed. The first-year pay packages of Stanford graduates, for example, have soared 62 percent after inflation in the 1990's, compared with 21 percent for the 1980's. 
 The ferocious competition for top M.B.A.'s reflects the best economy since the 1960's, specifically a surge in businesses that advise companies on new products, acquisitions or overseas expansion. It also reflects the long-term shift of pay and opportunity in today's service economy toward those with knowledge and ideas. More than anything, though, it is a sign of the extraordinary degree to which the term M.B.A. has become synonymous with raw business talent.
"You're trying to find the best people you can, and business schools happen to be accumulating them," said William Matassoni, a partner for communications at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, which expects to hire more than 400 M.B.A.'s this year. "So you go there."
The median offer this year for a new Stanford M.B.A., for example, was $120,000, more than double the first-year salary at the peak of the 80's, and more than five times the 1978 figure. Inflation has been 142 percent over that period.
And Stanford does not boast graduates with the highest earnings. East Coast schools whose graduates are more likely to wind up in high-cost, high-pay cities like New York and Boston report even loftier starting pay. Half the graduates of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania received offers of more than $133,000 this year.
At the top 25 schools, the best compensation packages offered to new M.B.A.'s are well above $200,000. Small wonder that more of the best and the brightest are headed to business school instead of law school. A graduate of New York University Law School who joins a leading firm will make $91,000 a year, not precisely peanuts but nearly $30,000 less than a counterpart from the university's Stern School of Business. At Stanford, law school and business school graduates were neck and neck in starting pay in 1978 and in 1988, but the school's new M.B.A.'s are making 50 percent more than its law graduates this year.
What makes the pay all the more noteworthy is that an M.B.A. has become something of a commodity. In 1965, fewer than 10,000 were granted. As recently as 1977, the nation was producing 48,000 M.B.A.'s a year -- a figure sufficiently alarming to prompt Lawrence Fouraker, the dean of the Harvard Business School, to predict a collapse in starting salaries. Since then, the number has risen to 94,000, almost two and a half times the number of law degrees.
The sheer volume of M.B.A.'s is deceptive, though. The graduating classes of elite schools have grown little. The explosion has happened among the more than 600 programs that do not make it into the top 25 nationally ranked schools.
Two-thirds of the degrees are awarded to part-timers who stay on the job, who tend to be subsidized by their employers and who are looking to change career tracks or move into middle management. More than a fifth are getting degrees to start businesses, according to a recent survey by the Graduate Management Admission Council.
Starting salaries for the mass of M.B.A.'s have hardly climbed into the stratosphere. This year, the typical M.B.A. with some experience will earn almost $60,000, compared with $25,000 in 1980, or the equivalent of $49,000 in today's dollars.
At the high end, M.B.A. pay packages are also swelling from a clutch of extras. A typical offer from an investment bank consists of a $75,000 salary, a $25,000 "stub year bonus" for the rest of 1998, and $30,000 in signing and moving money. Other companies lure recruits with second-year tuition, "settling in" allowances and other goodies like forgivable loans. High-technology companies and venture capital firms give stock options and equity stakes.
"Consulting pays better in cash," says Mark D. Homan, 30, a graduate of the Kellogg School at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who will receive stock options at Cisco Systems, the networking giant. "But if you hit the right high-tech company, you can make more money."
The risk, not to mention the workload, is often commensurate with the rewards. The typical tenure on first jobs in consulting, investment banking and some of the faster-growing high-technology fields is less than three years. "The salary number doesn't tell the whole story," said Robert Hamada, dean of the business school at the University of Chicago. "How many fall off the ladder? How many work 80 hours a week?"
Mainly, companies are looking for something that is notoriously difficult, and thus expensive, to identify: raw business talent.
It has never been tougher to get into a top school. Applications have soared since the early 1990's by as much as 25 percent at Harvard and 89 percent at Wharton. To fill a class of 383, Stanford sifted through 6,336 applications.
Today's M.B.A.'s don't just test better; they are road-tested. In the 1970's and 80's, employers complained that M.B.A.'s lacked the experience or wisdom to handle mid level management jobs. "We're not talking about wet-behind-the-ears youngsters," says Karen Dowd of Brecker & Merryman, a human resources consulting company. "Now M.B.A.'s are 30 years old, have a minimum of four years' work experience. Thirty percent are married."
Christian Barry, 31, and a graduate of Northwestern's Kellogg school, is exactly the kind of seasoned recruit that McKinsey & Company favors. After earning a bachelor's degree in operations research and industrial engineering from Cornell, Mr. Barry spent six years as a lieutenant in the Navy's nuclear submarine fleet. Four-month stretches at sea demonstrated that he has a capacity for teamwork and personal sacrifice. An internship at Marakon Associates, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn., suggested that he knows what to expect from a consultant's peripatetic life.
And M.B.A.'s from top schools have made an enormous financial commitment. Tuition at these business programs is $25,000 a year for two years, five times the average for state schools. The biggest expense, though, is lost earnings.
Consider Catie McCreary, 33, a University of Chicago graduate who received a fistful of offers from manufacturers and consulting firms. Like more and more new M.B.A.'s, Ms. McCreary walked away from a fast-track job, hers in the booming fresh vegetable packaging business that paid in the high five figures.
"My father almost had a heart attack," she said, "but my decision was based on what I wanted five, 10 years out." While her friends were buying houses, Ms. McCreary poured the $50,000 she had saved into tuition. Thanks to that nest egg, she graduated with just $30,000 in student loans.
Snaring the best M.B.A.'s is just as vital for some businesses, like consulting and investment banking, as attracting customers or capital for other enterprises. Consulting, a field with annual growth in the double digits, sucks up a third of the graduates of top schools like Wharton.
"You don't take someone out to develop a business strategy for a global organization that doesn't have an M.B.A. from a top school," said Jeanie Mabie, head of recruiting for Price Waterhouse Coopers, the accounting and consulting firm. Price Waterhouse hired nearly 250 M.B.A.'s from 25 top schools this year. Consultants at such concerns start at $125,000 and can double or triple that by their third year.
The prospects are causing some to change careers. Mike Lynch, 33, an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago, joined the Boston Consulting Group in March. A tenured professor in audiology and speech at Purdue University, he figured that he could apply the same analytical and communications skills that won him tenure and research grants to better effect.
Within a year or two, he expects to be making three times what he was at Purdue -- and seeing more of the world than West Lafayette, Ind.
Of course, the M.B.A. boom won't last forever. After the stock market crash of 1987 and during the slow economic growth of the early 1990's, job offers shriveled and starting salaries flattened out. For now, though, M.B.A.'s get to write their own ticket. When trying to decide between competing job offers, Mr. Barry created what he calls a "discounted happiness flow model" on his computer. He assigned a weight of just 7 percent to compensation, 15 percent to "interesting co-workers" and 12 percent to location, among other criteria. "The market is so good," he says, "that you can afford to ask: What do I want?"

HEADLINE: Public Schools See Enrollment Slowing Down

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
After seven years of galloping growth, enrollment in the New York City public school system has suddenly begun to slow down, puzzling demographers but bringing relief to school officials, who for years have had to accommodate swelling numbers of children in cramped and aging schools.
Projections show that this year, enrollment will rise by 3,000 to 4,000 students, roughly one-fifth of the average increase of 19,000 over the last seven years. 
 What accounts for the slowdown -- and whether it will continue -- is a mystery, though Board of Education officials cite two main factors: fewer babies being born as baby boomers reach the end of their childbearing years, and more children leaving the city schools, some in favor of nearby suburbs, others to return to their home countries.
Demographers hired by the Board of Education say the slowdown may also signal a decline in immigration to the city, though other experts dispute that theory.
Because predicting school enrollment is an inexact science, educators warn that even if the increase in overall enrollment slows to a trickle, some neighborhood schools will remain overcrowded, and a few will continue to see rapid growth. Still, with the economy booming and city coffers flush, the trend, if it continues, could offer school officials the first opportunity in years to repair crumbling buildings, erect new ones and reduce class sizes.
"It would have been a backbreaking task to improve schools and at the same time accommodate more students," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and planning at the Wagner School of Public Affairs at New York University. "A leveling off in growth isn't a reason to slow down, but you have breathing space. It's a good opportunity to catch up."
Over the years, school enrollment -- because it is based not only on birth rates but on far-flung wars and crises that draw immigrants to the city -- has fluctuated wildly.
It grew sharply at the turn of the century with heavy immigration from Europe, and again in the 1960's when baby boomers reached the schoolhouse door, peaking in 1971 at 1.1 million children. In the early 1980's, it dipped below 920,000, and the school system sold several buildings, only to see major increases beginning in 1990 as the children of baby boomers and a new wave of immigrants from Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia started school. Today, nearly one of every two school-age children in the city is born to an immigrant parent.
The most recent shift became apparent last fall when, defying official projections, total enrollment grew by only 8,300 to about 1,084,000 children -- a sharp contrast with the last seven years, when the school population rose an average of 19,000 children annually. All the while, the overall New York City population has remained steady.
Most of the growth in enrollment is occurring in Queens, but Board of Education officials were not able to say which grade levels were growing the fastest.
By 2002, the numbers are expected to flatten out. Then, in what seems unthinkable at the moment, the school population is expected to start shrinking.
Nationally, public school enrollment is not expected to flatten until 2007. And New York City school officials said they had not expected city enrollment to drop until several years into the next century either.
"We were not looking at it tapering off now," said Chiara Coletti, a board spokeswoman. "This is certainly a surprise."
It is also, in many ways, a blessing.
For years, children in the city's most crowded school districts have been squeezed into coat rooms, spread out in hallways and packed into temporary trailers, while city officials bickered over the extent of overcrowding and how many new schools should be built. Meanwhile, the School Construction Authority had its budget slashed and, instead of building new schools, spent its resources leasing empty warehouses for classrooms -- often at exorbitant prices -- and repairing crumbling schools. Neither proved adequate.
Now, the slowdown in enrollment growth is likely to raise new questions about where and how to spend city construction dollars. Should the city take advantage of this demographic shift to repair the oldest and worst buildings, speed up new construction, or continue to erect trailers in schoolyards? Should it seek to change community school district lines to shift students from more crowded districts to less crowded ones? And how will the system accommodate today's elementary school children when they begin to crowd into high schools in the next few years?
Some education officials say the slowdown in enrollment growth should not be used to justify delaying school construction and repairs.
"You can't say to a child entering elementary school, 'We are terribly sorry, but you're going to spend the next six years in a trailer,' " said Harold O. Levy, a member of the State Board of Regents who documented the deterioration of city school buildings two years ago. "At the turn of the century, New York City built hundreds of schools. No one said sooner or later the enrollment is going to go down. You're forced to ask the question: why is this wave of immigrants being treated differently?"
This fall, even with the slowdown in enrollment growth and 16,000 new seats -- primarily in trailers and leased buildings -- the schools will still exceed their capacity by 65,000 students, according to Board of Education figures. The worst problems are in 10 of the city's 32 community school districts -- including Washington Heights, the city's Dominican hub; the northwest swath of the Bronx and central Queens.
Moreover, as today's elementary school students move up, the high school population is also expected to grow, forcing school officials to add space in high schools and the extras that older students need -- including expensive items like science labs and gymnasiums.
Finally, new state laws require schools to offer prekindergarten classes starting this fall and reduce class sizes in the early grades in the fall of 1999. With slowing enrollment growth, those mandates may become less difficult to carry out in certain neighborhoods.
"If, in fact, we see a leveling off or a decline in the next couple of years, we can think about managing capacity in those particular districts," said Patricia Zedalis, director of school facilities for the Board of Education. But, she said, "whether we grow by 3,000 or 20,000, we need to know where we are growing."
Demographers say that a crucial factor in the slowing rate of growth is the declining number of births in the city in recent years. After a steady increase through the 1980's, the number of babies born in New York City reached a peak in 1990 and then began to taper off, as the last of the baby boomers began to reach the end of their childbearing years.
George and Eunice Grier, a husband-and-wife team of demographers hired by the Board of Education, offer a second explanation for the slowdown in enrollment growth: they see in it the first signs of a decline in immigration to the city.
In fact, it is virtually impossible to determine to what extent shifts in the school population are the result of immigration, since the board does not track what portion of its total student body was born outside the United States or born here to immigrant parents. It does, however, know the number of newly admitted students who are foreign-born, and its figures show such admissions have dipped slightly in the last couple of years, to 42,245 in the 1996-97 school year, for instance, from 45,750 students in 1994-95.
The number of new immigrants in the student body -- children who have been in this country for less than three years -- has also decreased in the last few years. According to an annual Emergency Immigrant Census conducted by the board, the number of new immigrants fell to 112,000 earlier this year from roughly 138,000 in the 1992-93 school year.
Demographers with the City Planning Department say they have not seen a downturn in the number of newcomers to New York recently, and they say they are cautious not to read too much into the school enrollment figures. "We haven't seen a big movement," said Joseph Salvo, the department's chief demographer.
There is little dispute about a third explanation offered for the downturn in school enrollment growth: many more students seem to be leaving the city's public schools. In the 1996-97 school year, 44,600 students left, compared with 40,600 the year before and 38,800 the previous year. According to board figures for the most recent year, nearly 4,500 moved to New Jersey and 4,800 to Florida.
Like children moving to other states, the number of students who returned to their home countries grew considerably over the last two years: 2,800 students, for instance, returned to the Dominican Republic in 1996, compared with 1,800 the year before, while 744 went back to Mexico in 1996, compared with 487 the year before. School officials who work with immigrant students say it is not unusual for immigrant parents to send their children back home when they reach the troublesome years of adolescence, but did not know whether the increase would turn out to be a long-term trend.
The exodus from the city schools, others said, could signal a growing dissatisfaction with the system, especially among middle-class parents -- both immigrant and native-born -- who can afford to take their children elsewhere as the students remaining in the city's public schools become poorer and poorer; last year, more than 80 percent of elementary and middle school students had family incomes low enough to qualify for free lunches, compared with 72 percent in 1990, Professor Tobier said.
"Crime has gone down, but there's a lot more concern about schools than before," he said. "New York's public schools have taken their lumps."
Nevertheless, some neighborhood school districts continue to see such an influx of new students that they have had to ship them to old warehouses and old government buildings, pack them into trailers parked in the schoolyard and vans idling on busy streets.
District 10 in the northwest Bronx has nearly half a dozen schools with no room for arriving kindergartners; they are bused to less crowded schools nearby. This year, the district is likely to have 6,500 more children than it can properly accommodate -- a reflection, said Lois Harr, a Bedford Park mother of two public school children, of years of neglect and poor planning.
"They may think the trend is slowing down, but we are still needing to catch up from the past 10 years trend," said Ms. Harr, who is also on the board of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition. "This slowdown is nice, but you can't even say it gives us any room to breathe -- not in District 10."

Planes With a Past
Long ago when aviation was young and eager to please, passengers could sleep stretched out in a berth, rather than twisted like a pretzel in their seats. Some planes even had small lounge areas where drinks were served.
The 1942 Sikorsky VS-44A Flying Boat, just put on permanent display at the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks has no lounge, but the 16 passengers it carried across the Atlantic on overnight flights had humane sleeping accommodations. Available mostly to the well-heeled, it was the transportation of choice of Humphrey Bogart and Eleanor Roosevelt, among others. 
 After World War II, Maureen O'Hara and her husband bought it for their island-hopping Antilles Airboat Flying Service in the Virgin Islands. About 10 years ago a group of volunteers sponsored by the Sikorsky Aircraft Division of United Technologies undertook its restoration.
The plane was built at Sikorsky in Stratford, and it joins about 80 aircraft to be seen at the museum. The collection includes airline and small air service planes, helicopters, stunt planes and planes from both World Wars. The latest is a military attack plane from the Gulf War.
The museum, which is next to Bradley International Airport, is open from 10 to 5 seven days a week. Admission is $6.50 for adults, $3.50 for children. The number for more information is (860) 623-3305.
 
Detailed Ceramics
James Christensen's minutely detailed, whimsically conceived and utterly realistic paintings fairly burst from the canvas, but his three-dimensional ceramics are even more vivid. Plump, rosy-cheeked fairy tale figures of kings and commoners, children, lovers, hausfraus, cats and chimney-sweeps populate fanciful turreted buildings out of a Grimm storybook. All the detail in "The Lute Player," for one, is crammed into a height of 9.5 inches.
The pieces sell for about $200 to $450, and will be on display at the Greenwich Workshop Gallery, 1657 Post Road in Fairfield, Tuesday through next Saturday from 10 to 5:30. The number is (203) 255-4613 for more information.
 
Remembering Robeson
"Paul Robeson," now playing at the Hutensky Theater in Hartford, celebrates the centennial of the birth of one of America's most extraordinary citizens, a birthright that proved to be a heavy burden. As controversial as he was distinguished in the fields of athletics, music, drama and law, Robeson spent most of his adult life in Europe to escape the racial prejudice that inhibited his development here.
Raphael Nash Thompson portrays Robeson in the Theater Works production of a play, written by Phillip Hayes Dean and first produced on Broadway in 1978 with James Earl Jones in the title role.
It will run through Sept. 6, with performances scheduled on Tuesday through Saturday at 8 and Sunday at 2:30. Ticket prices are $20, $25, and $30. The theater is at 233 Pearl Street. The number is (860) 527-7838 for reservations or more information.
 
Art Outdoors in Mystic
Forty-one years ago the Mystic Outdoor Art Festival was started by Irving Berlin's cousin, Milton Baline, and a group of art lovers, patterned after the Washington Square Arts Festival in Manhattan.
Today it draws some 50,000 people a year who stroll along two miles of downtown Mystic where exhibits featuring oils, watercolors, photography, sculpture and a variety of crafts by more than 300 artists.
The festival will be in progress next Saturday and Sunday from 10 to 7. Musical events on Saturday include the Mystic Highland Pipers, the John Moore Jazz Ensemble, Bea Ambach African Drumming and the Glorybound guitar-bass duo. The Rivergods and the Society for the Preservation of Barbershop Quartets in America will entertain on Sunday.
A children's Art Park will operate both days, offering cartooning, toy boat building, board games, juggling and face-painting, and food will be available for purchase.
Mystic, originally called Missi-tuk, meaning great tidal river in the Pequot language, has many additional attractions, including old sea captain's homes, one of the oldest drawbridges in the country, the Olde Mistick Shopping Village, the Mystic Pizza Parlor featured in the 1984 film and, of course, Mystic Seaport. The number for more information is (860) 572-9578.
 
Touring Solar Homes
A solar home tour taking place on Saturday from noon to 5 P.M. in Northwestern Connecticut has some unusual lessons to teach in energy efficiency and economical comfort.
Self-guided with a map, the tour includes two homes in Norfolk -- a modular cape of 1,290 square feet that gets most of its heat and electricity from the sun, and an Adirondack-style camp built for the Yale School of Forestry in 1941 within a 6,800 acre forest. Its cabins use the sun for energy and hot water.
In Lakeville a modern house that is underground uses the earth as an insulator, and in Salisbury a 2,500-square-foot Scandinavian-inspired house has Swedish low-flush toilets, a Finnish masonry fireplace that uses only one and one-half cords of wood in an average winter and other conservation technologies.
The tour is sponsored by the nonprofit People's Action for Clean Energy Inc., based in Canton. Tickets and a map cost $12 and may be obtained by calling (860) 693-4813.
 
Art Indoors in Kent
Joy Brown's sculptures and the paintings of William Oberst and Suzanne Howes-Stevens provide a rewarding exhibition on view through Aug. 30 at the Bachelier-Cardonsky Gallery on Main Street in Kent.
Mr. Oberst's technical skill as a classical painter underlies his contemporary take on his subjects, influenced by a degree in philosophy. His figures almost seem to speak to each other and his canvasses are often six feet tall.
Ms. Brown has created a signature style of figure sculpture -- balloon-like, airy creatures, large but not fat, moon-faced and charming in black and red stoneware that she fires in a Japanese kiln.
Two paintings by Ms. Howes-Stevens, called "Transformations" and "Seekers," are grounded in Greek mythology and imbedded with old maps, conveying a sense of timelessness. The gallery is open on Friday through Sunday from 11 to 5. The number is (860) 927-3129 for more information.
 
Church Fair in Ridgefield
St. Stephen's Church in Ridgefield will once again hold one of the longest-running church fairs in the region. Its Nutmeg Festival will be 92 years old when it takes place on Saturday from 10 to 4 on the grounds at 351 Main Street.
In addition to raffling off a 1998 Volkswagen Beetle, the fair will offer furniture, bric-a-brac, antiques, fine art, books, records, jewelry, crafts, home-baked pies, cakes and cookies, and fresh produce from local growers.
Food booths will supply Caribbean, Greek, New England country and Southern-style cooking. Visitors will be entertained by the Jackson Pike Skifflers, can tee off at the new miniature golf course, and there will be pony rides and games for children. Admission is free. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Spending More for Open Space

BYLINE: By ROBERT DUBROW 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT'S per capita spending on open space acquisitions has lagged behind that of other Northeast states. That is changing as a result of legislation proposed by Gov. John G. Rowland and passed in May by the General Assembly.
Mr. Rowland announced in January a 25-year plan to increase the amount of Connecticut land to be conserved as open space by more than 210,000 acres, bringing such land to 21 percent of the state's total acreage. 
 Some 10 percent would be state-owned, a goal mandated last year by the General Assembly. The Governor proposed spending $166 million in bond funds over the next five years for land purchases by the state and to assist municipalities, land conservation organizations, and water companies in open space acquisitions.
But the funding is only assured for this fiscal year, which began July 1.
"We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape the way Connecticut's landscape is going to look," said David Leff, the Department of Environmental Protection's assistant commissioner for environmental conservation.
The program under which the department acquires land for the state, called the Recreation and Natural Heritage Trust, has been authorized to spend $19.5 million in bond money during this fiscal year. Municipalities and land conservation organizations can participate in these purchases, but the state retains ownership.
David Sutherland, of the Connecticut chapter of the Nature Conservancy, said that his organization has participated in several acquisitions. "In each case it was a plot of land that was important for our mission to preserve habitats for rare plant and animal species," he said. "We could assist the department in acquiring it, but neither of us had to put all the money in."
In June, the D.E.P. joined with the Nature Conservancy, the town of Weston and a local coalition in an agreement to purchase Trout Brook Valley, a 668-acre tract of land being sold by the Bridgeport Hydraulic water company. This deal ended a bitter dispute between conservationists and a developer over the fate of the land. The state will contribute $6 million from the Recreation and Natural Heritage Trust. A new D.E.P. grant program for municipalities, land conservation organizations and water companies to acquire land for open space and watershed protection received $10 million in bond funds this year.
"Properties that don't rise to the level of statewide or regional importance may be important locally," said Mr. Leff, "and this will provide an opportunity for municipalities and others to purchase those properties. We want to build a network of open space throughout the state, regardless of ownership."
Land acquired under this program must be preserved in perpetuity, predominantly in its natural condition. Development for recreational purposes, including golf courses, tennis courts, ball fields and swimming pools, is prohibited.
Depending on the type of buyer and the type of property, the amount of the grants will range from 40 percent to 65 percent of the fair market value of the land. "We anticipate a lot of applications for that money," Mr. Sutherland said. "We expect that the program is going to be drastically over-subscribed."
Oxford is one town that plans to apply. In May, voters passed a referendum to buy 517 acres from the Birmingham Utilities water company for $3.2 million, with the understanding that the town can apply for state funds to aid in the purchase.
A former Oxford First Selectman, Kate Cosgrove, said she hoped that this application would be more successful than the town's effort several years ago to get the state to use Recreation and Natural Heritage Trust money to purchase a tract of privately owned land abutting Lake Zoar. "We had to go through the Bond Commission," she said. "It was such a rigmarole that we lost the property. It was bought by a developer." While the developer is donating a substantial portion of the land to the town and the Oxford Land Trust, homes are being built on the waterfront property.
Experiences such as Oxford's prompted a major change in the law aimed at smoothing the land acquisition process. Under the old law, Mr. Leff explained, "every parcel that the department purchased, whether it was a quarter acre or 500 acres, had to be approved by the State Bond Commission. Landowners have reasons why they want to move quickly, why they want some assurance that the deal is definitely going to go through. That restricted our ability to move quickly."
Now the Bond Commission is required to approve the issuance of funds for open space in two equal lump sum installments each fiscal year. The D.E.P. will have the authority to spend this money without getting approval for each individual purchase. "It will make a huge difference," said Charles Reed, director of the department's division of land acquisition and management.
The other significant changes in the open space law pertain to the rules by which water companies are permitted to sell what is regarded as surplus land outside the watersheds of active drinking water supplies, such as Trout Brook Valley.
"Water companies plan to sell over 3,000 acres of pristine tracts of open space in Fairfield, New Haven, and Litchfield counties over the next three years," said Curt Johnson, staff attorney for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment. "The legislature has given towns and land trusts tools to begin transforming this threat into an open space opportunity."
The new legislation gives the state, towns, and land conservation organizations first crack at buying water company land during a 90-day exclusive negotiation period before the land can be placed on the open market.
The substantial open space funding now available makes such purchases possible, said Carolyn Hughes of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment. "A lot of these properties are very expensive," she said. "It would be very difficult for a town or a nonprofit to pull together that kind of funding on its own."
The new legislation also authorizes the Department of Public Utility Control to allocate up to 100 percent of the economic benefits of a water company land sale to the shareholders, as opposed to the rate-payers, if 100 percent of the land is sold for open space or recreation. This allows utilities to "get more profit to their shareholders if they sell for conservation purposes," said Ms. Hughes.
While financing is assured for only the first year of the 25-year open space plan, Mr. Sutherland of the Nature Conservancy said he was optimistic. "Every indication I have is that the Governor, other candidates and the General Assembly will continue funding in the future," he said.
Others are not so sure. The First Selectman of Orange, Robert Sousa, whose town has recently been involved in the acquisition of two open space properties, without help from the state, criticized the state for having been absent from this issue in recent years. "I'm cautiously optimistic that the state will be a partner," he said, "but the jury is still out about how serious they are."
To provide steady, long-term funding, said Mr. Leff, the assistant commissioner, "the department has to choose wisely and move efficiently in buying land, and the public has to support it. The people who believe that open space is important have to let their elected representatives know that this is important to them.
"They've got to talk it up with their friends and neighbors, even their children, because children who are not even born yet are going to be voters by the time this program reaches its conclusion."

HEADLINE: Job of Film Liaison Restored

BYLINE: By TODD SHAPERA 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WHEN the phone rang in Iris Stevens's county office in White Plains recently, a Hollywood location scout was inquiring about shooting parts of a film on the life of Ruben (Hurricane) Carter in Westchester, with other scenes set for Toronto. The producers wanted to know about nightclubs with black clientele. She will explore possible sites in New Rochelle.
The same afternoon, a television commercial producer for the on-line distributor CDnow called in search of large sites. Ms. Stevens ticked off Playland, the Purchase College Performing Arts Center and Roosevelt Stadium in Yonkers. 
 Within the next two days other scouting queries included a Paramount call regarding a new film, tentatively called "Sleepy Hollow." Then New Line Productions was looking for a campus to shoot "Lost Souls" with Winona Ryder. And HBO was exploring sites for a Susan Sarandon feature, "Earthly Possessions."
Although such filming benefits the local economy, until last month Westchester did not have an office, or person, dedicated to fielding those requests and trying to convert them into done deals.
Three years ago, the administration of Andrew P. O'Rourke disbanded the Westchester Film Bureau as part of a move to downsize and privatize economic development. Ms. Stevens, who held the bureau's No. 2 position as location director from 1993 to 1995, was reassigned to handle job training contracts in the county's Office of Employment and Training. Production companies were left to navigate for themselves among the county's towns; many went elsewhere.
Now, County Executive Andrew J. Spano has restored the liaison position, believing that becoming aggressive in attracting and accommodating film companies makes economic development sense. He tapped Iris Stevens for the role. "We have nearly everything in this county," Ms. Stevens said. "The diversity of locations makes us very desirable." Echoing that point is Joseph Zolfo, the location manager for an upcoming Hallmark remake of Hitchcock's "Rear Window" for television. "Westchester has some pretty beautiful and amazing locations," he said. "There are historic preservation sites, museums, performing arts centers, old mansions and quaint river towns."
Ms. Stevens would add rock quarries, dams, a power plant, bridges, a mine, 35 parks and shoreline on the Hudson and Long Island Sound.
In early June, when scouting locations for "Rear Window," Mr. Zolfo contacted Ms. Stevens. He was seeking two old warehouses that face each other. (The film's protagonist, who is being played by Christopher Reeve, looks out of his apartment window and sees suspicious behavior in the facing apartment.) Mr. Zolfo said Ms. Stevens steered him to a Yonkers site that was ideal for the production. The Yonkers location was chosen largely to accommodate Mr. Reeve. The production company signed a three-month, $24,000 lease for 25,000 square feet at Yonkers Industrial Park with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said Allen Morrison, a Port Authority spokesman. The rate was below market value to encourage filming, he said.
The film is also being shot at the Burke Rehabilitation Hospital in White Plains, where Mr. Reeve goes for therapy.
Beyond bringing stars and glamour to the area, films like "Rear Window" bring considerable revenue. Even if the small budget film is far from "Titanic" proportions, expenditures in Westchester throughout the "Rear Window" project are expected to exceed $1 million, said Steven Haft, the executive producer of "Rear Window." Mr. Zolfo said that six weeks of preproduction work alone, to build sets, has led to local purchases and rentals of supplies and equipment. In addition, he said a number of workers were hired, including plumbers, electricians and a locksmith. And the construction crew of more than 50 workers a day eats its meals locally.
During the earlier period, Ms. Stevens said film and related productions brought the county $5.4 million in economic benefits in fiscal year 1994-95. (New York City claimed $829 million in direct film expenditures in 1996.) Mr. Spano, who remembers being captivated by the shooting of Milos Forman's 1981 film "Ragtime" in Mount Kisco, said that besides providing immediate economic benefits the productions enhance the county's image.
This point is echoed by Maren Rudolph, a spokeswoman for Vintage Hudson Valley. The organization has 11 architecturally or historically significant inns, including the Castle in Tarrytown. Ms. Rudolph said she welcomes the more active film effort as being "an added boost for the region's growing tourism."
The logistics of filming in the county are complicated by the many jurisdictions, which have different permit regulations and fees. Some villages and towns like Croton-on-Hudson and Cortlandt assess no fees or low fees, whereas some municipalities discourage filming with high assessments. Pleasantville charges $1,500 just to submit a permit application and an additional $750 a day for filming on public property and $500 a day for private property. Scarsdale says fees are determined on a case-by-case basis.
"No one has ever filmed in Scarsdale," Ms. Stevens said. Even the producer Rob Reiner, a graduate of Scarsdale High School, was rebuffed. By contrast, Mr. Zolfo said, obtaining a permit from Yonkers was a simple process and the city had been very helpful.
Ms. Stevens said she hoped her one-person office would help productions cut through red tape and create the kind of film-friendly environment New York City's Office for Film, Theater and Broadcasting provides. That office's Web site lists 14 staff members. They are often assisted by about the same number of interns.
Filming in Westchester dates back to silent-era "Tarzan" productions starring Elmo Lincoln. They were shot on the vine-covered banks of the Croton River. A partial list of more recent films with some parts shot in the county includes "Wall Street," "Radio Days," "Goodbye, Columbus," "The Preacher's Wife" and "Age of Innocence." St. Barnabas Church in Irvington was one of the settings in the 1997 Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt film "The Devil's Own."
On July 8 and 9, Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro spent two days at Ward Pound Ridge and John Jay Homestead in Katonah for the Warner Brothers film "Analyze This."
Iris Stevens's path to the film industry did not follow a likely script. While raising three children in Croton in the 1960's and 70's, she became involved with environmental issues and eventually served on a county commission in the administration of Alfred B. DelBello. The county's film position became available in 1993, at a time when her marriage had dissolved and she was looking for work.
Ms. Stevens said she values the close relationship she often develops with film crews. A few years ago, this helped her through diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. "The Juror" kept me alive, she said, adding, "The crew filled my hospital room and home with flowers and put a fax machine in my house so I could work from my bed." She returned to the set nine days after surgery and credits the movie with being a godsend.
Now a formidable challenge in rebuilding the county's position in the film industry is fierce, new competition from New Jersey, which, Ms. Stevens said, is aggressively luring productions.
As part of Mr. Spano's vision, the county is discussing with developers the possibility of building a full-scale sound stage, which would provide all services related to the production of a feature film, he said in a recent interview. He said he believes this would appeal not only to out-of-town crews but also to residents involved in the film industry who might like to work close to home.
In the meantime, Ms. Stevens is planning a Web site featuring photographs of attractive county locations, and she is about to produce an updated version of a 1994 resource book for location managers entitled "Filming in Westchester County." It offers details about regulations, fees and contacts for each of the county's municipalities.
Moreover, signaling a commitment to local talent, in her first week on the job, Ms. Stevens attended a monthly meeting of the 914 Film and Video Salon, a networking organization of professionals. Bob Curtis, who founded the group, said he was encouraged by Ms. Stevens's plans to publish a guide containing the names of local production professionals, including tradespeople, technicians and producers.
Ms. Stevens told the group, "The greatest pleasure I get is when someone calls and says, 'We are going to film in Westchester, and we are going to hire locally.' "

Votes Taken On Land, Gambling And Drugs

BYLINE: By KIRSTY SUCATO 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
State lawmakers returned from summer recess last week to consider several bills that required action by Aug. 3 if they were to be presented to voters as ballot questions in November. Besides acting on those bills, which propose amendments to the state Constitution, the legislature took up dozens of other measures. Here are some of the highlights:
OPEN SPACE -- A bill that would ask voters whether the state should borrow $1 billion over the next 10 years to preserve 1 million acres of open space passed both houses of the Legislature on Thursday. The bill would dedicate $98 million a year in state sales tax revenue for the next 30 years to back the bonds, which would be used to buy the development rights to half of the state's remaining undeveloped land, as well as purchase land outright. The measure replaced a proposal by Governor Whitman to raise the money by levying a two-cent-a-gallon increase in the state's gasoline tax. Environmental groups and conservationists hailed the plan as providing New Jersey's first stable source of financing for open space acquisition. 
 GREEN ACRES -- A bill that would ask voters whether they would support a $295 million bond issue to pay for preservation of open space and the restoration of historic sites, among other things, was approved by an Assembly committee on Monday. The money would act as a bridge until the proposed dedication of sales tax revenue would take effect on July 1, 1999, said Senator Robert E. Littell, a Republican of Franklin, who co-sponsored the bill. The bill, which was passed by the Senate on June 29, goes to the full Assembly.
The amount includes $120 million for recreation and conservation, $50 million for the preservation of farmland, $35 million for cultural arts centers, $20 million to preserve historic buildings, $15 million to restore lakes and streams, and, for the first time, $10 million to plant and care for shade trees. The remaining $45 million would go to various other programs. New Jersey voters have approved nine similar referendums in the past 37 years.
CASINO NIGHTS -- Social clubs that have liquor licenses could offer "simulated gambling" to help raise money for charities under a bill approved by the Senate on Thursday. Under current law, a club cannot hold such games of chance as roulette and blackjack, even if no money changes hands as long as it is licensed to sell alcohol. The measure, which now heads to the Assembly for consideration, was designed to make it easier to hold fund-raising events, said its sponsor, Senator C. Louis Bassano, a Republican of Union.
DRUG USE -- Workers who are dismissed for using illegal drugs on the job would lose unemployment benefits under a bill approved by the Senate on Thursday. Under current law, only workers who are dismissed for criminal offenses can lose benefits. The bill now goes to the Assembly.
PENALTIES -- The Assembly on Thursday approved a bill that would increase the penalty for resisting arrest from a disorderly persons offense to a crime of the fourth degree, which carries a fine of up to $10,000 and up to 18 months in prison; the penalty had been a fine of up to $1,000 and up to 6 months in jail. If the person threatens the officer, the penalty would jump to up to $15,000 and three to five years in prison.
SOLID WASTE -- A bill that would ask voters to forgive about $118 million in state loans made to counties to pay for incinerators and other waste disposal facilities was approved by both houses on Thursday. Counties owe an estimated $1 billion to $1.7 billion for systems they were required to build under the state's old waste flow laws, which required trash to be disposed of inside county borders.
ELDER CARE -- A measure that would create a legislative task force to study the care of the elderly was approved by the Assembly on Thursday. Under the resolution, a 13-member Assembly task force would begin holding hearings this fall to gather information about the needs of senior citizens. In 30 years, about one in four New Jerseyans will be over 65. Currently, one in seven state residents is over 65, said the measure's co-sponsor, Assemblywoman Rose M. Heck, a Republican of Lodi.
HOV LANES -- Calling the high-occupancy vehicle lanes on Routes 80 and 287 a failure, members of the Assembly on Thursday introduced resolutions that would require the state Department of Transportation to study the effectiveness of the carpool lanes and to reduce the number of hours for which restrictions are in place. Under current regulations, vehicles using HOV lanes must have at least two occupants between 6 A.M. and 9 A.M. and from 3 P.M. to 7 P.M. Under the proposals, the hours would go into effect at 7:30 A.M., rather than 6 A.M., and at 5 P.M., rather than 3 P.M. A second proposal calls for a six-month study to determine if the lanes actually cause traffic congestion. The study could pave the way for lawmakers to seek permission from the Federal Government to dismantle the HOV lanes.

President Clinton has named the Hudson one of 14 American Heritage Rivers. Begun by Mr. Clinton in September, the American Heritage Rivers program has three objectives: the protection of natural resources and the environment, economic revitalization and historic and cultural preservation.
The Hudson River received an overwhelming number of nominations from public officials, among them Gov. George E. Pataki, and private interest groups. Nominations were judged on the natural, economic, agricultural, scenic, historic, cultural or recreational resources of the river, which make it distinctive; effectiveness with which the community has defined a plan of action to put into effect the American Heritage River designation and the strength and diversity of community support. 
 Other rivers named are the Connecticut, the Cuyahoga in Ohio, the Detroit, the Hanalei in Hawaii, the New in North Carolina, the Potomac in Maryland, the St. Johns in Florida, the Upper and Lower Mississippi, the Upper Susquehanna and Lackawanna in Pennsylvania, the Willamette in Oregon, the Rio Grande in Texas and the Blackstone and Woonasquatucket in Massachusetts.

 BODY:
PETER KWAN spends three nights a week at his bachelor pad in Murray Hill, and the other four nights at his mother's apartment in Chinatown, where he keeps his old room even though he moved out years ago. On one of his days off, he visits his father in a nursing home in the West Village.
"It's a dual life to be the good son and have your own life," said Mr. Kwan, 34, who manages a carpet store in midtown. "Sometimes I don't sleep, but obviously it's the right thing to do." 
 Mr. Kwan shuttles between homes to hold together a tight-knit family that no longer lives in the same place. Like many Asian immigrants in New York City, he has redefined his ideas about family in the face of changing socioeconomic realities.
In Asian cultures, the extended family traditionally provided an economic and social base -- as well as a roof -- for its members. Children cared for their parents at home, just as their parents and grandparents did. This sense of filial duty remains strong in many Asian families, handed down from immigrants to those born in the United States.
But today, many younger Asians say it is no longer practical -- or desirable -- to care for their parents while holding down full-time jobs and raising their own children in apartments with limited space. Many older Asians, meanwhile, say they want to enjoy their last years without feeling obliged to cook, baby-sit and adjust their lives around their children's families.
"When old people live with young people, they have different opinions," said Mok Fung, 92, a Hong Kong immigrant who left his daughter's family in Kew Gardens, Queens, several years ago for a housing project for the elderly on the Lower East Side. "I move so slowly, they say you block my way. When I put on Chinese ointment, they don't like it. They say it smells. Before, I used to think if you don't live with them, you're no good. But now the world changes."
In recent years, hundreds of older Chinese, Japanese and other Asians in the city have left their families for nursing homes, assisted-living programs and Government-subsidized retirement buildings. "Culture-wise, it is a big difference," said Yvonne Jones, director of admissions at the Isabella Geriatric Center in Washington Heights. "You never saw Japanese in nursing homes. You never saw Chinese. The nursing home was the last resort."
For Jimmy Lou, 76, the Village Nursing Home in the West Village has been his "second home" for eight years. Pictures of his wife and daughter, who live in New Jersey, decorate his room, and he keeps photographs of his 4-month-old granddaughter on his nightstand. "I'd love to be closer to my family, but I'd be too much for them," said Mr. Lou, a Chinese-American who is confined to a wheelchair.
Experts say that what makes the experiences of Asians different from those of other immigrant groups in New York City is the large proportion of parents reaching old age at the same time, and the fact that many elderly Asians still live with their adult children.
Asians are the fastest growing racial or ethnic group among people 65 and older in New York City, according to census figures. Many came here as students and young workers after 1965, when changes in immigration laws lifted restrictions on Asians, said Ronald Takaki, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of "Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans" (Penguin USA, 1990). "Think of it as a bump composed of young Asians in their 20's and 30's moving through time," he said. Now, "they're all getting older."
David S. Chen, executive director of the Chinese-American Planning Council in Chinatown, said more Asian families were looking for alternative ways to care for older parents. "The cultural tradition is to try to stay with the family, but the reality of that is getting harder," he said. "The burden on the individual families is tremendous."
Although many younger Asians say family is important, they are finding it difficult to live up to the tradition of the extended household. Some say privately that they resent having to rearrange their lives around their parents at home. They say they are expected to spend nights and weekends with their parents, rather than with friends, and to defer to their choices in music, food and television shows.
"Basically, I don't have a life," said one 32-year-old Chinese woman, an office manager for a consulting firm, who still lives with her parents on the Lower East Side and who would speak only on condition of anonymity. "I go to work, I come home, I spend my weekend doing things with my parents. When do I have time for myself?"
Others say they worry about supporting their aging parents while trying to start their own careers and families. Jennifer Choi, 27, a social worker from Bayside, Queens, said she plans to give money to her parents when they retire. "I have to think about my family and how I divide that money among not just my husband and children, but also my parents," said Ms. Choi, who is helping to organize a conference for Korean-American women that will include a workshop on investing for parents.
Feeling bound by cultural expectations, many younger Asians say they worry quietly, or commiserate with each other behind closed doors. "There's still a feeling that if I can't take care of my parents, then somehow I'm less Chinese," said Mr. Chen, whose parents live with his brother. But that is slowly changing, he said. "It's becoming more acceptable to not live together."
Lari Nguyen, 38, an interior designer, said she agonized for months before relocating her parents to an apartment a few blocks from her two-bedroom home in Flushing. She used to whisper to her two children at night, she said, because her parents went to bed early in the next room. Her husband, a lawyer who is of Anglo-European descent, had trouble communicating with her parents, who spoke Vietnamese.
"My parents always told me that I had to take care of them when I got older," said Ms. Nguyen, who emigrated with them from Vietnam in 1975. "It was hard to move them away, but I think it's the best for everyone. They have their privacy, and we have ours. And we still eat together every night."
 
Sometimes Parents Decide It's Time To Move Out
In other Asian families, though, the parents make the first move to leave the extended household. Mon Lam, 83, an immigrant from Hong Kong, said she and her husband became entangled in their son's marital problems when they all lived together. Her husband, she said, constantly argued with her daughter-in-law.
"The old tradition is the daughter-in-law must obey, but now it's different," Ms. Lam said. "I wanted to move out. It's not that my son didn't want to live with me or they kicked me out. They treated me pretty good, so they're not bad kids."
So many older Asians want to move out on their own in Sunset Park that Paul Mak, the president of the Brooklyn Chinese-American Association, said he regularly gets requests for what he calls a "boarding house for seniors."
"We don't have the resources for that, but they keep asking," Mr. Mak said. Last year, he said, he helped 8,000 elderly Asians apply for Government-subsidized apartments. Only 45 received them.
Mr. Mak said older Asians often feel obligated to do household chores for their children's families. "They would rather stay on their own than work as slaves for their kids 12 to 14 hours a day," he said. "But while you're still inside the house, it would be difficult to do nothing."
Mr. Fung said he felt as if he had won the lottery after moving into Hong Ning Housing for the Elderly on the Lower East Side, a 155-unit building with a steady waiting list of 100 people. In the last three years, 200 people have requested applications.
Mr. Fung pays one-third of his monthly income from Government benefits -- less than $500 -- to rent a one-bedroom apartment. He walks in the downstairs garden, plays mah-jongg and reads Chinese newspapers in the community room. "I have my own room, heat and hot water," he said. "My family, they have their own space. If they have time, they come to visit."
For older Asians who cannot live on their own, nursing homes and other care centers are an alternative to extended families.
At the Anna Erika Assisted Living Program on Staten Island, the staff not only speaks four Chinese dialects, but also serves oxtail soup and lo mein at mealtime. There are 160 Asian residents, compared with 125 a year ago. "It's like stepping into Chinatown," said Elliot Markowitz, the program's executive administrator.
The Village Nursing Home has hired four Chinese-speaking workers in the last year because more Chinese people are moving in. Of nearly 200 residents, 26 are Asian, compared with 10 in 1995, a staff member said.
The Isabella Geriatric Center has started a staff exchange program with Japanese health care workers, hooked up Japanese-language cable television, and given tours of the nursing home to dozens of Japanese tourists. In the last year, the number of Japanese residents has increased to 10 from 2, out of a total of 705.
The number of Asians in nursing and retirement homes in the city is relatively small. But before the 1980's, Asians were rarely seen at all in most of those homes, social workers said. And many older Asians still expect their children to take care of them.
"Where we came from, there's no such thing as a nursing home," said Betty Lee, 63, a Sunset Park resident who emigrated from Taishan, China, after World War II. "You have to rely on your own children and your close relatives to help you."
The Asian tradition of relying on family was reinforced in the United States by years of social discrimination. Before the 1964 Federal civil rights laws, many privately owned or locally funded nursing homes refused to take in minorities, Professor Takaki said, and few, if any, such places existed that served mainly Asians.
"It would be a historical mistake to just give the cultural explanation," Professor Takaki said. "Asians were segregated from white society. It forced them to become self-reliant and take care of their own parents."
In later years, Federal housing subsidies and Government benefits for the elderly opened the door to a variety of living options for Asians. And for many families, extended households have given way under the daily pressures of American life.
"It is that double-edged sword of American life," said Eric Liu, author of "The Accidental Asian: Notes of a Native Speaker," (Random House, 1998). "Living in this country allows so much more freedom for independent self-expression but at the same time can attenuate connections that hold families together."
The experiences of Asian families today are similar to those of Italians, Jews and Poles between the 1940's and 1960's, said Mary Waters, a sociologist at Harvard University, who is studying second-generation Asian immigrants in New York City.
"People come from farming and peasant backgrounds where the norm is the extended family living together," Professor Waters said. "The individualism of American life -- and the way it is set up -- is that people move in nuclear families." In the classic immigrant model, Professor Waters said, extended families start off together but separate as they become successful and adopt American values.
 
Children on Tatami Mats, Or Piled Into Bunk Beds
In the city, where living space is usually tight, extended families typically cram into two- or three-bedroom apartments because larger places are scarce and unaffordable. A grandparent may share a room with a grandchild. Children may sleep on tatami mats on the floor.
"Asian households are the most overcrowded, even if the extended family is changing," said Jessica Lee, executive director of the Coalition for Asian-American Children and Families.
A 1996 Census Bureau survey of New York City showed that 18.3 percent of Asian households had more than one person in each room, a standard measure of overcrowding, compared with 14.1 percent of Hispanic households, 9.6 percent of black households and 6.3 percent of white households.
Lai Yee Cheng, 41, a seamstress from Hong Kong, moved in with her in-laws in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, after she got married 15 years ago. Four children later, she is still there. Ms. Cheng and her husband, who works as a cook in a restaurant, share one room, while her in-laws take another. The children, ranging in age from 7 to 13, pile into bunk beds in the third bedroom.
"We're family people so we have to look after them," Ms. Cheng said of her in-laws. "I hope that when I get very old, my children do that for me, too."
But Li Aggarwala, 40, an engineer from Malaysia, waited until he moved into a brownstone in Borough Park, Brooklyn, before he sent for his mother. He and his wife, a secretary, live on one floor, and his mother stays on another. "Where we were before, there was no place for my mother," he said. "It's important for our family to stay together, but we also need our space."
For some Asians, the extended family is no longer practical because no one can stay home with older parents or relatives who need constant care and attention. Mari Sakaji, director of Japanese-American Social Services Inc., said that in the last few years, she had received a growing number of calls each year from working couples trying to place parents in nursing homes.
"Within our community, it's getting harder to find families that are trying to take care of them at home," she said. "Most of the time, they live separately."
Woon Yin Mui, 64, and her two sisters, who all work in a garment factory in Chinatown, sent their 92-year-old mother to the Village Nursing Home after she fractured her hip. "The idea of living together is good because you can have closer relationships," she said. "I want to do it, but I don't have the ability. We have to work, and nobody's home."
Every day, Ms. Mui visits her mother, Pak Chung Chun, bringing a bag full of sweet sesame rolls, salty dumplings and fermented eggs. But the delicacies go home with Ms. Mui because her mother cannot eat them. Ms. Chun has difficulty swallowing, so she drinks meals from a baby bottle.
"I feel guilty," said Ms. Mui, who emigrated from Hong Kong in 1972. "When I was younger, I had to work very hard to make a living. I didn't have a chance to take my mother to a restaurant and buy good food for her. Now I have time but it's too late. She can't eat anything. It's too late."
 
Breakfast With Dad: Dim Sum and Hash Browns
Peter Kwan sipped morning coffee with his father, Kam Sau Kwan, in a sunny corner of the community room at the Village Nursing Home. A bag of fragrant dim sum sat on the table between them.
"When he lived at home, my father went out every morning in Chinatown," he said. "He used to sit in the tea house for hours. He met friends and ate dim sum. It was a set routine."
Now the dim sum has become a routine of a different sort. Every Thursday, Mr. Kwan carries shrimp dumplings and roast pork buns to his father. Sometimes he brings McDonald's hash browns for himself.
The older Mr. Kwan, who was a steam presser in a garment factory, moved to the nursing home five years ago after he became paralyzed and lost part of his memory from meningitis. "No matter how much you want to," his son said, "you can't spend 24 hours a day taking care of him."
The father nodded his head though he did not understand the English words. After a while, he turned his wheelchair toward the window and lit a Marlboro. He pulled off his Giants baseball cap, a gift from his son, and looked off in the distance.
Mr. Kwan said he still hopes to bring his father home. But in the meantime, the Kwans lead separate lives. Every year, Mr. Kwan offers to give up his apartment for a house in the suburbs where his mother, a retired seamstress, could live with him, and perhaps his father, too. But every year, he said, his mother turns him down.
"I don't want to live in a house -- I love the city -- but whatever mom wants, she gets," Mr. Kwan said. His parents, he said, came to the United States to give him a better life. "You're grateful," he said, "and you want to take care of them."

HEADLINE: Lives;
The Real Deal

BYLINE: By Adam Liptak; Adam Liptak is a lawyer at The Times.

 BODY:
We played poker every week for seven years, in apartments outfitted with round tables, green felt and nice chips. The core half-dozen of us, men and women both, lived in Manhattan, with good jobs and no kids.
It started as a goof, the way some people go bowling. For the first year or two we kept cheat sheets on the table to remind us of whether a flush beats a straight. Later on, we were sending away to Las Vegas for books on strategy. 
 The stakes increased over time, and by the end it wasn't too unusual to win or lose $100 in a night. But if you were any kind of player it more or less evened out. It wasn't about the money, anyway, not really. It was about winning, and the monstrous ambition we tried to hide at work blossomed at the table. Our careers colored the way we approached the cards.
David, a musician, comedy writer and schemer, was convinced that every big pot was his meal ticket, and he pursued them recklessly. Bursting with vulgar humor, epic self-involvement and the odd ditty, he approached the game with deep engagement, because he was entirely convinced he would win. He bad-mouthed all the lawyers at the table pitilessly and on principle. He loudly envied anyone doing better than he did that night or making more money than he did in life.
Jed, an entertainment lawyer, was distracted, jokey, always on the phone. He was there for company, for gossip and maybe for connections. Jed became steadily more successful, and we started to hear about Sundance and Cannes, equity stakes and executive-producer titles. He started to show up with clients in tow.
Jed was cheerfully aware of his superficial appreciation of poker. On hearing another player's measured and complicated reasoning for folding a strong hand in the face of a decent shot at half the pot, Jed promptly called the bet. "I'm in," he said, "because I have plenty of chips left." He wanted to be in the game, in the deal, and he hoped the economics would sort themselves out later.
George, whom we'd nicknamed the Ox, was a tax lawyer and raconteur who spun out intricate high-stakes games and endless sagas about his adventures with his college buddies at Amherst. He solicited romantic advice and lost methodically.
Lots of people came once and decided, sensibly, that we weren't for them. More often, we decided not to invite them back. They were too slow on the uptake, or too deliberate in their play, or too amateurish, or too cheap, or too rich to care. Or they were clients of Jed's, who were always hopeless. They expected us to bend the rules for them, because they were new or because they had just lost $20 in a misunderstanding about how to declare low. They left at 9:30 because they'd lost all they could lose. These were people we could do without.
We heard stories about games more genteel than ours, games that would rusticate even regular players for bad behavior. My favorite concerned a guy banished for two years for excessive gloating. I wouldn't have lasted half an hour in that game.
We were reckless gamblers, most of us, appreciative of the well-executed small plays but exultant at winning the big pot on luck and nerve.
That's not the right way to play, according to the books. They tell you to play tight, to "throw that trash away," that is, when you get bad cards early. Ted played the right way. He folded almost everything, and when he stayed in we all got out of his way. You can eke out a small edge doing this, but without joy.
Ted was a risk arbitrageur on Wall Street, making bets on which mergers would close, playing the spreads. Ted played cards the way he invested in deals: analytically, squeezing out the nickels. He tired of the game before any of us, and he left his job not long after.
Toward the end, we let a bunch of placid, cool artists and other downtown types join our game. They were much nicer than we were, solicitous even, which is odd in a game that calls for a killer instinct. They'd let the new guy who messed up have his twenty back.
The game collapsed not too long after that. It had been built on noise and confrontation, and without these the game became a little rote. We had by now learned what there was to know about the other selves we brought to the poker table.
Our not-always-attractive work personas were amplified for poker night, and for years this seemed liberating. By the end, though, this weekly exhilaration had grown hollow and unsatisfying.
In the civilized quiet, our bluster had turned out to be a sort of bluff, and it had been called.

HEADLINE: Strong Market Tempts Mitchell-Lama Owners To Leave Program

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
IT took a year and a half before her name was reached on the waiting list, but Peggy Goldsmith finally landed an apartment in 1989 in the middle-income Ruppert Towers development on Third Avenue at 90th Street.
A relocation counselor for corporate employees, she had been living for three years in a newly completed luxury building on York Avenue. But the rent was going up to $1,550 a month, which was too high for her. 
 The Ruppert rent for a 19th-floor, one-bedroom was $920.84, and her income -- below the maximum of $77,350 under the formula used in middle-income developments to determine eligibility, but higher than the minimum of about $36,000 -- made her eligible for it. The rent has remained at $920.84 ever since.
Older tenants are paying less for a similar apartment, and newer tenants are paying no more, unless they are on a higher floor or have a better view. Some tenants pay a surcharge based on income, but all pay less than what market rents have become for comparable vacant apartments on the Upper East Side.
"My own apartment would rent for at least $2,000 on the open market," said Ms. Goldsmith.
The prospect that these apartments may in fact be subject to market rents in the not too distant future -- for current as well as new tenants -- has the residents of Ruppert Towers and its companion project across the street, Yorkville Towers, alarmed. The owner has applied to buy out of the governmental program under which Ruppert Yorkville was built, and the rents, in contrast to those in middle-income projects in the city that have "gone private" in the past, will be unregulated once the buyout is complete.
Ruppert Yorkville Towers, on the two large blocks between 90th and 92d Streets, from Third to Second Avenue, was built in the early 70's under the middle-income housing production program known as Mitchell-Lama, in honor of the two deceased state legislators who sponsored it in the 50's, Senator MacNeil Mitchell, a Manhattan Republican, and Assemblyman Alfred A. Lama, a Brooklyn Democrat. The development has 1,258 apartments, 52,500 square feet of retail and office space and parking for 492 cars.
The Mitchell-Lama legislation allows the rental owner, or, in the case of co-ops, the co-op corporation, the option, 20 years after the building has been completed, of paying off the longterm bonds that financed construction and starting to pay full taxes. In the 1980's, a number of Mitchell-Lama projects across the state decided to do this. Some rentals that went private later converted to co-op or condominium status.
In the early 90's, in a weaker rental market and a difficult mortgage market, buyouts subsided. But with the strengthening of the market, they have resumed within the last few months, especially in locations with strong housing demand.
Both New York State and New York City operate Mitchell-Lama programs. Although the state's program is statewide, many of its projects are in the city. The state has generated 117 projects in the city, with 76,500 apartments, with the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal as the supervising agency. Sixteen of these projects, with 11,200 apartments, all rentals, have bought out of the program since its inception.
Most recently, the 373-unit co-op known as Rivercross, on Roosevelt Island, has filed an application with the state agency to withdraw.
Under the city's program, 153 developments with over 62,000 apartments have been built. There have been 11 completed buyouts -- nine rentals and two co-ops -- totaling 2,400 apartments. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development is the supervising agency.
In addition to the buyout application for Ruppert Yorkville, similar applications are pending at the agency for the 168-unit Cooper Gramercy Plaza apartments, at Second Avenue and 23d Street, and for the Kew Gardens Hills garden apartments, with 1,265 units, near Queens College.
The Westgate development on West 97th Street, between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues, completed its buyout from the state program in April. The apartments went into the rent-stabilization system at the existing rent level after the buyout, and vacancies, as they occur, are rerented at levels permitted under the rent-stabilization system.
"They're turning it into a luxury rental," said Judith Ennes, head of the tenants' association. "I have no problem with enhanced services, but all this comes at a cost for us." Tenants can no longer go directly to their cars in the garage; valet service must bring the cars to the entrance, she said. And laundering in the remodeled laundry room is more expensive.
But at Ruppert Yorkville, as at Cooper Gramercy, the rents will be unregulated after the buyout.
Under the state Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974, Mitchell-Lama buildings completed before Jan. 1, 1974, are subject to rent stabilization when they leave the program, if they are in a community that has adopted stabilization. Those completed later are not. Ruppert Towers received a temporary certificate of occupancy in August 1974, the management says, and Yorkville Towers received it in February 1975. Cooper Gramercy was completed in 1976.
Will tenants, therefore, be faced with an abrupt demand from the owner for a market rent once the city housing agency authorizes the buyout, as it appears compelled to do under the law? Will the many tenants paying as little as $400 to $700 for an apartment -- about 20 percent of the building, the management says -- be faced with rents two or three times that amount once their leases expire?
Not immediately, said Fred DeMatteis, the 75-year-old principal in the DeMatteis Organization of Uniondale, L.I., which built Ruppert Yorkville. A plan will be developed to raise rents in stages, he said. Robert Seavey, principal in the Seavey Organization, which built and manages Cooper Gramercy, also said that higher rents for existing tenants would have to be phased in gradually.
"It was always our plan to get of the program out at some time," said Mr. DeMatteis, who said that Ruppert Yorkville would be a longterm family investment.
But Lila Dyas, president of the Ruppert Yorkville Tenants Association, said that a market-rate development might ultimately endanger the social and economic integration that was a goal of the city, tenants and developer as well when Ruppert Yorkville was built. The development is in an urban renewal area, and government has invested both in land acquisition and site improvements, including a public park.
"It's a community, not just another luxury building," Ms. Dyas said. "If there are luxury rents most of the tenants will not be able to live there. Where will they go?"
Galvanized into action by notification of the buyout plan, the Ruppert Yorkville Tenants Association hired Stuart M. Saft, a lawyer who is also chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives, to represent it. Mr. Saft said he did not believe that DeMatteis had the right under existing agreements with the city to buy out of the program at the present time.
He also said that he was prepared to negotiate with the ownership. "I am happy to negotiate anything as long as the tenants are protected," he said. Some of the substantial operating reserves that the property has accumulated will have to be spent for what he said have been deferred building improvements.
Representing the DeMatteis Organization and the Seavey Organization is Albert A. Walsh , who was head of the Housing and Development Administration, predecessor to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay in the 60's, and is also a former chairman of the New York City Housing Authority.
The form that any phase-in of rent increases might take is of considerable interest to housing specialists. Some suggested that in addition to a general phase-in over perhaps three or four years to a level at or near market rent, it might be possible to soften the year-to-year impact of rent increases on moderate-income tenants. The city would have to participate, perhaps by agreeing to phase in new property taxes, and/or by agreeing to let the ownership set aside a portion of any remaining reserve funds, which are normally turned back to the city after a buyout, for a subsidy pool.
One possible approach to protecting tenants, according to Louis Winnick, the longtime New York City housing economist, might be to guarantee those with incomes below a certain threshold, for a limited number of years, rent increases no higher than the rent-stabilization guidelines formula would allow. The difference between their rent payments and the actual phase-in rent for their apartment could be subsidized from building reserves.
"There can be a formula that protects the most vulnerable people for a limited number of years, but you can't eliminate pain altogether," Mr. Winnick said.
At Cooper Gramercy, however, reserves are minimal, Mr. Walsh reported. Current rents there average $600 for a one-bedroom and $750 to $800 for a two-bedroom.
Under the Mitchell-Lama program, rents are established on the basis of the amount of revenue needed to cover operating costs, limited property taxes, mortgage debt, building reserves, and return on equity, which has usually been 6 percent. The tenant pays a proportionate share of the buildingwide rent. This contrasts with the system in many subsidized low-income projects, in which the tenant pays only a fixed percentage of income as rent, and the Federal Government pays the remainder of the rent required for fiscal stability.
In re-rentals, there is usually no vacancy allowance. Incoming tenants typically pay the same rent that the departed tenant paid. When rents must rise to meet rising costs, the owner applies to the supervising agency for a buildingwide increase. The increase is apportioned to apartments on the basis of size.
IN 1996, for example, a 25 percent rent increase spread out over two years was granted by the city for the Kew Gardens Hills development in Queens. Two Trees Development Company, of Brooklyn, the owner, has applied for a buyout. The development will become rent-stabilized once it is approved.
There are income limits on eligibility for Mitchell-Lama apartments. The applicant's income cannot exceed seven times the annual rent if the household has three or fewer members, or eight times the annual rent if there are four members or more.
A family of three or fewer earning as much as $75,600 a year would be eligible for a one-bedroom apartment renting for $900 a month, or $10,800 a year. The typical incoming tenant pays about 15 to 17 percent of annual income as rent, managers say, which often makes Mitchell-Lama housing a good rental deal in its location. Waiting lists normally run from five to 10 years across the city.
At Ruppert Yorkville the waiting list is four years. The management, a DeMatteis entity called R.Y. Management Company, last applied for a rent increase in 1980. The increase was granted a year later, and the development was also granted, as of 1982, the unusual right to raise the rent after the first vacancy -- but not after subsequent vacancies -- for incoming tenants to a level based on 1982 market rents.
A similar system had been used to assist the Waterside Mitchell-Lama development on the East River at 25th Street, whose three phases were completed between 1973 and 1975, and which was threatened with longterm fiscal problems. City officials agreed with the owner that a higher rent schedule was needed, but rather than raise rents for tenants in place, they agreed to the system of higher vacancy rents. In subsequent buildingwide rent-increase orders in the 90's, new vacancy increases have been reauthorized.
The rental income that the one-time vacancy increases have provided at Ruppert Yorkville, supplemented over the last two years by surcharges paid by tenants whose incomes exceed the rent-to-income ratios for new arrivals, have been sufficient to cover costs and provide the limited return on investment that the program allows.
Another unusual factor at Ruppert Yorkville -- as at Waterside -- is that it is only in the last two years that tenants have been required to file income and household composition affidavits annually. They pay surcharges roughly equivalent to the percentage by which their income exceeds the maximum allowed under the admission formula. But whatever their income is, the rent cannot be more than 50 percent over the base rent.
The system of rent surcharges for over-income tenants is used in Mitchell-Lama developments generally. But in some of those that were completed in the 70's, surcharges were initially waived, because it was thought that it would have weakened rather than strengthened building finances to force tenants to pay them. The over-income tenants might well have moved out.
Robert J. Klehammer, vice president of R.Y. Management, said that, after Waterside, Ruppert Yorkville probably has the highest average rents of any Mitchell-Lama -- $725 for a studio, $925 for a one-bedroom, $1,340 for a two-bedroom and $1,700 for a three-bedroom, including gas and electricity. Mr. Klehammer also said that the operating reserve that would be available to return to the city after a buyout would probably be about $10 million.
The property is in the midst of a $9 million improvement program, he said, which has already brought in new boilers to produce hot water, and new roofs, and is replacing all the elevators and most of the sidewalks.
"After we leave the program the owner is planning to spend money to upgrade the lobby, with a new valet service and doorman and concierge service," he said.
He also said that 20 percent of the tenants pay the rent surcharge without reporting their income on the annual affidavits, and that among those who do report their incomes, 8 percent report them as over $100,000 a year. This suggests that close to a third of the tenants are paying no more than 15 percent of their income for rent, he said.
ACCORDING to brokers, unregulated one-bedroom apartments comparable to those at Ruppert Yorkville in the neighborhood rent for $2,000 to $2,200 a month, and two-bedrooms for $2,500 to $2,800. At the Whitney, a 200-unit co-op at 200 East 90th Street, Cheryl Bassin, a broker working for Charles H. Greenthal, the managing agent, said that if one-bedrooms were rented out, they would rent for $2,000 to $2,300 a month, and two-bedrooms would go for $2,800 to $3,000.
The Ruppert Yorkville buildings pay about $1.5 million a year in property taxes; as a private development they will probably pay about $6.5 million a year, Mr. Klehammer said. The property has $52 million outstanding on its mortgage, which will have to be repaid to the city along with the excess reserves.
"Uncertainty is already forcing some people to move," said Conrad Eberstein, an original tenant who is vice president of the tenants' association, "and if there is a significant disruption of the rent, a lot of people are going to have to move out of the city."
The Seavey Organization, the builder-owner of Cooper Gramercy Plaza on Second Avenue and 23d Street, is one of the city's major Mitchell-Lama developers. It has built six of them, with about 1,000 apartments. It has not previously applied for a buyout.
Cooper Gramercy has had an inadequate rent structure from the start, Mr. Seavey said, and it has been a struggle to operate it effectively.
Phyllis Seavey, Mr. Seavey's wife, a lawyer who has overseen the management of the Seavey buildings for 20 years, said that Cooper Gramercy was now operating in the black. But it is still not producing the income needed to make major needed plaza and roof repairs, she said.
Mrs. Seavey made it clear that building finances are not the only reason for the buyout decision. "The cumulative effect of the over-regulation that the building has been subjected to is discouraging," she said. She indicated a desire for greater flexibility in tenant selection and building management than has been possible under Mitchell-Lama rules.
The Westgate apartments, on West 97th Street, are owned by a partnership in which the Koeppel family, whose investments in Manhattan and Long Island real estate go back four generations, are the principals. The general partners are Adolph Koeppel, a lawyer based in Mineola, L.I., and H. Ralph Taylor, a retired official who once ran the Federal urban renewal program. There are three side-by-side buildings with 427 apartments, completed in 1968.
Among other changes since the buyout, security has been strengthened and Manhattan Parking has taken over the operation of the garage. William W. Koeppel, who manages the property, said that only two apartments, both one-bedrooms, have become available since the buyout. They got new kitchens, baths and wood flooring and rented out at the permissible rents for vacancies under the stabilization system. They rented for $1,100 and $1,200 a month. "Without stabilization the apartments would have rented for $1,600 to $1,700 a month," Mr. Koeppel said.
The buyout process under the Mitchell-Lama program usually takes nine months to a year, officials say. It will therefore be December at the earliest before the applications for Ruppert Yorkville or Cooper Gramcery can be approved.

HEADLINE: Superbugs

BYLINE: By Sheryl Gay Stolberg; Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports on medicine and health policy for The New York Times.

 BODY:
There was nothing out of the ordinary about the slender glass tubes of blood that arrived in Sharon S. Rotun's laboratory late in the afternoon of March 20, 1998. A pale, stocky woman with the impatient manner of someone who is overworked and underpaid, Rotun was the microbiology supervisor at United Hospital Medical Center, a small community hospital in the working-class town of Port Chester, N.Y., just north of Manhattan in Westchester County. The two blood cultures were among roughly a dozen sent to the lab that day. Whoever ordered the testing was evidently in a hurry, Rotun recalls, because he or she hadn't even bothered to scribble the usual instructions on the accompanying slip.
The blood belonged to a 79-year-old Westchester County man, a retired New York City narcotics detective who had been admitted to the hospital earlier that day. For the past year and a half, the detective's kidneys had been failing him, a condition that required him to undergo dialysis three times a week. On most days, he tolerated the tedious procedure with a smile. But on the morning of March 20, the retired detective awoke in an unusually sour mood. 
 "He didn't want to eat; he didn't want to get dressed; he didn't want to get washed," said his daughter, Carole, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that she be identified only by her first name and that her father not be identified at all. She got him dressed, quickly served him
breakfast and, despite his protests, sent him to the local dialysis center. "You have to go,"' the daughter told him. "You have no choice."
The old man was feverish, short of breath and so disoriented he could barely speak by the time the kidney specialist, Dr. Sam Natarajan, saw him. Natarajan immediately suspected staphylococcus aureas, a bacteria that frequently causes illness among dialysis patients, who become infected when the microbes enter the bloodstream along their intravenous lines. The doctor performed just enough dialysis to clear the fluid backed up in his patient's lungs -- a "dry cleaning," in the argot of renal disease -- and then called an ambulance to take the man to the hospital. Twelve hours later, the patient was dead.
In what turned out to be the final hours of his life, the ailing detective was hooked up to an intravenous drip of vancomycin, a powerful antibiotic that has been the ultimate weapon against staph for the last three decades. Doctors regard vancomycin as the drug of last resort, the medicine they rely on to kill germs that are too vicious to respond to anything else. Normally, vancomycin begins attacking staph in the bloodstream immediately. "We call vancomycin 'the big gun,"' Rotun says. Which is why, when she first examined the lab results from the dead detective, she did not believe what she saw.
A staph infection was indeed flourishing in the detective's blood when he died. But not just any strain of staph. This was a rare and unusually dangerous germ, a supermicrobe that infectious-disease experts have been dreading for years. It goes by the name of VISA, for Vancomycin Intermediate-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureas, and it represents the bacterial world's most potent counterattack against antibiotics.
As soon as the results of the detective's blood tests came in, Rotun posted signs all over her laboratory, instructing her subordinates not to give out any information. The last thing the hospital needed, she thought, was a swarm of reporters generating panic over a killer superbug that could be spreading through the hospital's corridors. Not even Carole, the detective's daughter, was told. Instead, Rotun repeated the lab tests. Then, when she had convinced herself there was no mistake, she picked up the phone and called her longtime colleague and friend, Ginny McMath, United Hospital's infection control officer.
"I hope you're sitting down,"' Rotun told McMath. "I think we have the first VISA in New York State."
In recent years, it has become fashionable in the media to warn of the exotic new infectious diseases percolating in faraway lands. The gruesome Ebola virus, which swept through Zaire three years ago, has captured the public imagination in books and on film. But while Hollywood has been busy making scary movies, infectious-disease experts know that the bigger danger is in our own backyard: garden variety germs that for decades have been so easily felled by antibiotics that most people, including some scientists, naively assumed they were no longer a threat.
For the past decade, however, scientists at the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and all over the world have been sounding alarm bells about the growth of antibiotic resistance, a problem that has been fueled by patients who demand antibiotics for every bout of the sniffles and by doctors who give in to such demands. The list of dangerously virulent drug-resistant microbes is growing all the time: streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes pneumonia, childhood ear infections and meningitis; mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea.
But none are as frightening to medical experts as the VISA strains of staph. Within the past 18 months, the C.D.C. has documented the first four cases ever, the most recent being that of the New York detective. Their emergence is an ominous harbinger of what Dr. Stuart B. Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts, calls "the worst thing that could happen in clinical infectious disease."
One reason for concern is that staph is a particularly common and robust organism; it lives on the skin and in the nostrils of otherwise healthy people as part of what scientists call the "natural flora," where it is relatively harmless. But if it gains access to the body through scrapes, cuts or surgical incisions, as it often does, it can cause a range of ailments, from pus-oozing cuts to sepsis, an often lethal infection of the bloodstream. Children who scrape their knees are susceptible to staph, as are housewives who cut their hands in the kitchen or anybody else with an open wound. Should VISA strains become common, simple cuts and scrapes could become mortal wounds.
To complicate matters, hospitals are already breeding grounds for a host of dangerous bugs. Each year, nearly 90,000 patients in the United States die of a hospital-acquired infection, and many of those cases are theoretically treatable with antibiotics. Staph is often the culprit, picking on vulnerable patients like the elderly, the immunocompromised and those undergoing surgery. The emergence of an untreatable strain of staph would put virtually any healthy person at risk, and could turn a bad situation into a disastrous one. As Levy says, "Right now, we are still in most cases able to use vancomycin. Now let's say we lose vancomycin. Where are the deaths going to go? They're going to go up. This number could double."
Now that these bugs are figuring out ways to evade the very miracle drugs that have always worked so well against them, there is little on the horizon to keep the virulent new supergerms in check. Joshua Lederberg, a Rockefeller University professor who is widely regarded as one of the nation's leading authorities on infectious disease, warns that far too little attention is being paid to the threat of drug-resistant germs. "The odds of Ebola breaking out are quite low, but the stakes are very high," Lederberg says. "With antibiotic resistance, the odds are certain and the stakes are just as high. It is happening right under our noses."
And it is happening at a particularly precarious moment, when many hospitals are cutting back on services as they struggle to survive the changing economics of health care. United Hospital in Port Chester, for example, reflecting national trends, plans to "outsource" Rotun's lab. Meanwhile, drug manufacturers, which in the early 1980's all but abandoned development of new antibiotics on the theory that they were no longer needed, find themselves behind the curve; they are hustling to invent new treatments and put them on pharmacy shelves. And that is why the emergence of the vancomycin-resistant strains is viewed as such a worrisome public health threat. The next generation of new antimicrobials is, by the industry's own estimate, at least several years away, creating a dangerous window in which the virulent new microbes might be able to spread unchecked. If that happens, modern medicine might revert to the days before penicillin, when sore throats could become fatal and patients who walked into the hospital for routine surgery might be carried out in coffins.
"If we have no antibiotics, it reopens the whole question of intrusive surgical procedures and vastly changes the calculus of their safety," Lederberg says. In the pre-penicillin era, people occasionally died while having their appendixes removed -- not because the surgery itself was dangerous but because germs crept into the patients' incisions, causing infections that spread to the bloodstream and raged out of control. "Those days," Lederberg says, "have a chance of coming back if the drugs we have been relying on just stop working."
To trace the evolution of the new superbugs, experts inevitably look back to the introduction of penicillin in 1943. If ever there was a miracle of modern medicine, it was penicillin, the first drug that could quell a wide range of microbial invaders without harming the body. "It was as if Prometheus had stolen fire from the gods," Levy, the Tufts University professor, wrote in his 1992 book "The Antiobiotic Paradox." "The applications of this wonder drug seemed all but limitless."
For its ability to kill bacteria, penicillin was dubbed an "antibiotic." It was available at first without a prescription, and consumers gobbled it up like candy. (Even with prescriptions, "the cult of the antibiotic," as Alexander Tomasz, chief of the microbiology laboratory at Rockefeller University, calls it, continues today.)
But amid the initial euphoria, penicillin's discoverer, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming, urged caution; in a 1945 interview with The New York Times, Fleming warned that misuse of penicillin could lead to the propagation of mutant forms of bacteria that would resist the new miracle drug. Before long, Levy writes, Fleming's predictions came true; an estimated 14 percent of the staphylococcus strains isolated from patients in a London hospital had developed resistance to penicillin by 1946, just three years after the miracle drug was introduced.
In the three decades following the introduction of penicillin, new microbe-killers were discovered, tested and approved for marketing at a phenomenal pace. Streptomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin -- all became staples of the American medicine cabinet. Germs like staphylococcus aureas had never before seemed so vulnerable; by the 1970's, the common wisdom was that the battle of the bugs versus the drugs was over. With more than 100 antibiotics on the pharmacy shelves, the Government de-emphasized bacterial research and the drug industry, sensing a saturated market, shifted resources elsewhere. Bacteriology was passe.
Perhaps no drug is as emblematic of this hubris as Ziracin, a member of a new class of antibiotics called everninomicins. Everninomicins were discovered by scientists at the Schering-Plough Research Institute in the 1960's. From 1979 to 1984, company researchers worked with these antimicrobials, hoping to develop a medicine that could combat staph aureas and other similar microbes. But the effort was abandoned as unnecessary on the theory that no bug could beat vancomyin. "Of course," says Dr. Jean-Jacques Garaud, the company's director of clinical research, "that was pretty arrogant thinking. The bacteria were more creative."
In a report released in May, the Institute of Medicine complained that no nation, including the United States, has an adequate system for monitoring the emergence of these drug-resistant germs. It found that despite public education campaigns to persuade doctors not to prescribe unnecessary drugs, they still do: 20 to 50 percent of the 145 million prescriptions given each year to outpatients are unnecessary, the report found, as are 25 to 45 percent of the 190 million annual doses of antibiotics delivered in the hospital.
In the microbial world, where only the fittest survive, some germs inevitably stumble upon genetic mutations that protect them from the drugs. In the presence of antibiotics, the weak germs -- those that lack these mutations -- die off, leaving only the strong ones to survive and proliferate. The more antibiotics are used and misused, the more these drug-resistant bugs will spread. Moreover, as Lederberg showed decades ago in work that won a Nobel Prize, bacteria essentially talk to one another, exchanging genes -- including drug-resistant genes -- back and forth.
The net effect of this activity is clear: many germs are becoming resistant not only to one drug but to six and seven at a time. The story of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is by now well known. Less familiar is this fact, reported by the Institute of Medicine: more than 90 percent of staph aureas strains are now resistant to penicillin and a wide variety of other antibiotics, including methicillin, the drug that is next to last in the line of defense, before vancomycin. These are not statistics of mere academic interest. In New York City alone, methicillin-resistant staph infections killed 1,409 people in 1995. That is precisely 200 more people than were murdered in the city that year.
As resistance to each antibiotic continued to develop in the mid-1980's, infectious disease experts have been waiting and watching for the last domino to fall: the emergence of staph strains that are resistant to vancomycin.
Perhaps the most wakeful watcher has been Fred C. Tenover, chief of the C.D.C.'s Nosocomial Pathogens Laboratory Branch, the national reference laboratory for hospital-acquired, or nosocomial, infections. Tenover has been anticipating the appearance of vancomycin-resistant staph for years.
In his cinder-block warren of laboratories on the third floor of the disease control centers' headquarters in Atlanta, Tenover analyzes novel microbes sent by scientists from all over the globe. His specialty is antibiotic resistance; if a patient anywhere in the United States has a persistent infection that does not seem to respond to drugs, the bacteria will be packed up in special sealed shipping tubes and sent overnight to Tenover, who can test its susceptibility to a host of different medicines and call the doctor with treatment advice in two to four days.
On Dec. 16, 1996, Tenover received a tip by electronic mail that a Japanese doctor had detected the world's first VISA. "At first, I was skeptical," says the C.D.C. scientist, whose lab had received numerous cultures over the last year purporting to be the long-dreaded VISA strain. "We tested all of them," Tenover says, but none of them had ever been true.
But the scientist who had isolated this strain was Dr. Keiichi Hiramatsu of Juntendo University in Tokyo, one of the most respected bacterial geneticists in Japan. The case, Tenover learned in a subsequent E-mail exchange with Hiramatsu, involved a 4-month old boy who had undergone surgery in May 1996 and developed a staph aureas infection that was resistant to methicillin. His doctors then tried vancomycin, but it didn't work. Hiramatsu tested the bug, classified it as a VISA and sent it to the C.D.C. for verification.
The bug arrived in Atlanta on Jan. 29, 1997. To confirm Hiramatsu's results, Tenover tried to grow the bacteria in a series of tiny test tubes of nutrient-rich solution, each containing a different concentration of vancomycin. The goal was to determine the smallest amount of drug necessary to kill the germ; microbiologists call this level the minimum inhibitory concentration, an important measure of a bacterial strain's virulence. Most staph bugs are wiped out by .25 to .5 micrograms of vancomycin per milliliter of solution.
But at those concentrations, the Japanese bug kept growing; the minimum knockout punch of vancomycin, both Tenover and Hiramatsu discovered, was a whopping 8 micrograms per milliliter -- in other words, 16 to 32 times the normal amount of vancomycin necessary to destroy staph aureas. "This," Tenover mused to himself, "is very new."
By the time Tenover and Hiramatsu published their findings in the July 11, 1997, issue of the C.D.C.'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, another patient, this one in Michigan, had come down with a similar vancomycin-resistant bug. The following month, a third case emerged in New Jersey. Then came the Port Chester strain. Each time, the minimum inhibitory concentration was the same: 8. Authorities in France and England have since reported several more cases, although Tenover has not confirmed them.
Experts have long believed that staph aureas would remain at least partly susceptible to vancomycin until the minimum inhibitory concentration reached a level of 32. That, at least, was the theory. Now that doctors have seen these superbugs in practice, Tenover thinks the figure may need to be adjusted downward. "It could be," he said, "that 8 is as high as an organism needs to go to cause a treatment failure." In other words, full resistance may already be here.
There is no evidence that the four documented VISA strains are linked to one another, although the spread of these bugs, Tenover says, is only a matter of time. That each occurred in highly industrialized, medically advanced nations is probably no accident; while drug-resistant organisms are cropping up all over the world, the problem has been aggravated by countries like the United States where antibiotics are widely used. But antibiotic resistance is a global and social problem. Even if an individual scrupulously follows antibiotic regimens and uses them sparingly, he or she is still vulnerable to resistant strains that have emerged anywhere in the world. And with air travel and international commerce shrinking the global village, no place is safe. "These are international problems," Tomasz says. "The next wave of bugs is just a few days away."
The patients in Japan, Michigan and New Jersey were fortunate; they were treated intensively with a combination of other antibiotics and all survived. The New York detective died of pneumonia and the staph infection, according to the doctor who treated him in the hospital, although the underlying kidney disease was a contributing factor.
Complete resistance looms on the horizon. "Before the end of the decade," says Levy, "we will have fully resistant staph aureas." He does not need to point out that the end of the decade is less than 18 months away.
Drug companies are now pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into new antibiotics; as of 1996, the last time the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America surveyed its members, there were 27 new microbe-killers in the development pipeline.
"The war is not won, as everybody knows," says Richard Colonno, the chief of drug discovery for the infectious diseases division of Bristol-Myers Squibb. "Clearly, the research excitement is now more on the bacterial side." In part, that is a response to the urgent need for new drugs. But it has just as much to do, Colonno says, with the revolution in molecular biology. Now scientists can map the genetic blueprints of bacteria, and those maps provide clues to the weak spots of the bugs.
Colonno's mission at Bristol-Myers, and the mission of countless other drug-company scientists around the nation and the world, is to create an entirely new antibiotic, one that employs different mechanisms to kill microbes than the ones already on the market. Simply adding new drugs to the existing antibiotic arsenal is not good enough; so many different germs have figured out ways to avoid so many different drugs that a whole new class of pharmaceutical agent is needed. "It is the only way," Colonno says, "that we are going to get out of the resistance dilemma." And so the race is on.
The most promising candidates seem to be linezolid from Pharmacia & Upjohn and the once-abandoned Schering-Plough drug, Ziracin. In the early 1990's, the company picked up the project again and Ziracin is now in the late stages of human testing. But bringing a new class of antibiotics to market will take time; even these front-runners are not expected to reach pharmacy shelves until at least the year 2000 or 2001.
In the meantime, it may be left to an experimental drug called Synercid, from the French firm Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, to fill in the gap. Synercid, which is on the verge of receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration, is the first injectible form of a class of antibiotics called streptogramins that are being used in animals but not humans. It was not developed to combat vancomycin-resistant staph, but Tenover, the C.D.C. expert, has tested it against VISA strains in the laboratory and says it seems to work.
But Synercid has its limitations, says Levy. "It has been used in a different form already in animals," he says, "so resistance is already out there. The question is how long it will take before resistance compromises its use."
Perhaps the greatest obstacle to breaking the cyle of resistance may be economic rather than scientific. Drug companies, which are in business to make money, might be expected to market these new antibiotics aggressively, trying to persuade doctors to prescibe them as often as possible. But such rampant prescribing practices create the same problem all over again. Officials at the F.D.A. are wrestling with precisely this paradox. We have to balance drug development with drug use, says Dr. Dianne Murphy, director of one of the F.D.A.'s offices of drug evaluation. And that is a very difficult balance.
As the race to find new drugs proceeds, supermicrobes like the one that infected the New York detective will undoubtedly continue to flourish, leaving a trail of nervous public health officials and grieving families in their wake.
Three days after the former detective died, mourners gathered at a stately stone church in the town of Harrison. On that same day, with utmost secrecy, officials at United Hospital were frantically trying to determine where the vancomycin-resistant staph bug came from and, more important, whether the germ had spread. The unenviable job of getting to the bottom of those questions fell to Ginny McMath, the hospital's infection control official. The name of the detective was familiar to her; she remembered him from a previous admission in January, when he was treated for a staph infection that was resistant to methicillin. He was given vancomycin for several weeks, but the episode earned him an entry into a red loose-leaf binder where McMath carefully catalogues every instance of a drug-resistant strain at the hospital. The case fell under the worrisome category of M.R.S.A. -- methicillin resistant staph aureas.
When Sharon Rotun called with news of the detective's blood tests, McMath was alarmed but not altogether surprised; a 79-year-old man with a history of kidney disease and methicillin-resistant staph, she knew, was the optimal candidate for a VISA strain. "It's sort of like the natural experiment that we would do in the laboratory," explains Tenover, the C.D.C. expert, "except that in this case, the patient is the Petri dish."
McMath immediately began to track down everyone who had contact with the detective in the days before he died. Working with Natarajan, the kidney specialist, she identified 44 people -- dialysis workers, doctors, nurses and family members -- who might have been exposed to the deadly microbe. Each had their nostrils and, in some cases, their hands cultured to see if they were "colonized" with the bug.
Making the notifications was a delicate task. The cause of the detective's death had not been made public, and Natarajan and McMath were careful not to reveal too much. "There's a fear that people won't want to come here," McMath said. It was left to Natarajan to call the detective's family. "I told them that he had a staph infection, but there was a peculiarity and we wanted to see if anybody else had the same type of infection," he said. "I didn't want to cause them any panic."
That instinct -- not to cause panic -- is an understandable one, experts say, but it can also lead to public health problems of its own. Suppressing information about a potentially deadly germ might lead people who have been exposed to it not to take the testing seriously; indeed, Carole's daughter declined at first to be cultured, thinking it was unnecessary.
On April 24, one month to the day after the detective's funeral, Carole was driving to work when she heard a report over the car radio that an elderly dialysis patient in Port Chester had died of a rare staph infection. Her father was not identified, but it did not take much to put two and two together. "I didn't realize how serious a bacteria it was until I heard it on the radio," she said. "It really upset me that they were not more forthcoming."
As it turned out, 14 of the 44 people who were tested were carrying staph aureas. Of the 14, 2 -- a doctor and a patient -- harbored a germ that was resistant to methicillin. Genetic typing conducted by Tenover's lab, however, found that none of these bugs were identical to the one that infected Carole's father. It was an encouraging sign; the deadly bug, it seems, is buried with the detective.
Meanwhile, McMath's investigation, supervised by both state health officials and the C.D.C., quickly established that neither the hospital nor the dialysis center was a problem; Dr. David Ackman, who directs the state's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control, said infection control practices were meticulous at both. Even so, Ackman said: "We were very concerned. We wanted to make sure that there weren't other people carrying this around."
Ackman and other infectious-disease experts no longer view these episodes as isolated incidents; they are more like bullets that are becoming increasingly difficult to dodge. "We were lucky," says Tenover, who has no trouble spinning out scenarios for the near future that are far worse. "The next time it may be somebody who is on an open hospital ward, or maybe they have been in the hospital for several weeks, or been a lot of places before their infection is recognized. Or it might be someone in a nursing home that can spread it among 80 patients, in which case we are going to have a big job on our hands."

 BODY:
In december 1997, a man with the wonderfully aztec and spanish name Cuauhtemoc Cardenas became the Mayor of Mexico City and initiated a series of reforms, one of which, the most delicate of all, took place in plain view. It was an earnest municipal campaign to clear the unlicensed sidewalk vendors from the downtown zone around Mexico City's central plaza, the Zocalo. Sidewalk vending in that particular neighborhood is an ancient custom. In Aztec times, when Mexico City already figured as one of the world's largest cities, a market stood on that very spot, near the Main Temple on one side of the plaza. And the vendors have never disappeared. Photographs from the 19th century show what the vendors look like today: a lone person, often a woman, squatting by a tiny carpet on the sidewalk, displaying a pathetic handful of goods for sale.
Sidewalk vending, when times are good, can offer a useful way for a hard-strapped person to earn a few honest pesos. But times have not been good. Mexico City's population, always enormous, hasin recent years swollen to 8.5 million in the Federal District (where Cardenas is mayor), plus another 10 million outside the district lines. 
 Then, in 1994, the entire country underwent a series of disasters. There were Zapatista guerrillas in the southern state of Chiapas. There were narco-traffickers in the north. There was a peso crisis, which produced an economic depression. There were assassinations and money scandals at the loftiest levels of the federal Government.
In Mexico City, a vague, shapeless social collapse was under way. The number of holdups, rapes and murders became truly terrifying, not just in the poor neighborhoods. And sidewalk vending around the Zocalo grew to proportions that no one had ever seen, and took on sinister colors.
What was the origin of those many disasters? In Cardenas's view, it lies in Mexico's political system and especially in its ruling party, the PRI (pronounced pree, from the Spanish initials for Institutional Revolutionary Party). The PRI is like nothing the United States has ever known. It is a political party, run by ordinary politicians, but it is also a mass organization, spread across a vast geography of business groups, trade unions, storefront service centers and poor people's associations, all of them linked in underground networks of "corruption and complicities," in Cardenas's description.
The party has known how to stay in power for almost 70 years -- either by winning popular support, or by winning fixed elections, or (when not even a fixed election will do) by violent repression. Cardenas was a PRI man himself in the past. But 10 years ago, having lost his faith, he left the party and set out to overthrow it. For a long time he seemed to get nowhere at all. Then last year's elections turned out to be amazingly free, and even fair, apart from the PRI-controlled television and press coverage and a few old-fashioned irregularities in the southern states. Cardenas, as the new Mayor, found himself occupying Mexico's second most visible office, after the presidency.
His Party of the Democratic Revolution captured the city council, plus a number of other offices around the country. A second opposition party -- a right-wing movement, in contrast to Cardenas's left-wing movement -- likewise advanced, mostly in the north. Mexico held its breath. Everyone understood that, in spite of the elections, the PRI remained the country's dominant political organization. In Mexico, presidents rule like kings, and the PRI still controls the presidency, in the person of Ernesto Zedillo, who has held the office since 1994. But in the year 2000, there will be a new election for President.
Short of some awful new development, that election, too, will probably be free -- possibly even fair, more or less. Cardenas, if he does well as Mayor, will be a strong candidate. Already there are polling statistics that show him to be the front-runner -- though other opposition candidates have stepped forward. And, with Cardenas in City Hall, suddenly it became obvious that, like so many other authoritarian countries during the last revolutionary decade, Mexico, too, might be plunging at last into democracy and modern life -- a thrilling thing to watch, but also slightly alarming.
It has to be said that in his first months in office, out of nervousness or bad luck, Cardenas has not in fact done especially well. He made a series of early appointments that turned out to be ill advised and had to be withdrawn. His chief of staff made wild and unjustified accusations against the PRI (instead of sober and accurate accusations, which would have been wild enough), and had to resign. The new Mayor did take some useful steps -- he tried to shore up the leaky water system, initiated a reform of the police (many of whom are criminals themselves), ordered an end to bribes (though bribery has always been how things get done). Yet none of that attracted any attention. Then he sent the police into the downtown streets to arrest a few sidewalk vendors and confiscate their paltry merchandise.
In mid-April of this year, some scuffling broke out between vendors and police. In response, a committee of shopkeepers decided to add pressure of their own by calling on their fellow shopkeepers to close their stores to protest against the sidewalk vendors and encourage the Mayor in his campaign. It was not much of a demonstration, by the standards of the Zocalo -- where, on the day of the shopkeepers' protest, hundreds of Indians continued a months-long marathon sit-in on behalf of the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, and hundreds of other people persisted in a similar marathon in the name of Pancho Villa for the right to squat on city-owned land, and still others kept up a months-long picket line against the labor policies of the Zocalo's famous National Pawnshop. The shopkeepers' demonstration, by humble contrast, was intended to last a single lunch hour, and failed even at that.
A mere handful closed their doors and faithfully attended their committee's rally, on Calle Corregidora, the street running behind the National Palace. Still, a group of journalists came out to report on the latest protest, and 23 police officers arrived to keep the peace, should the peace have needed keeping. Then a mob of 400 thugs came running down the street and tore
the shopkeepers' tiny demonstration to shreds. The television news that night showed enraged young toughs racing into a store and hurling things. It was a full-scale riot, except that riots tend to be spontaneous, and in the days after the mob attack on Calle Corregidora, no one believed that anything spontaneous had occurred.
I went tramping around after Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the next few days, just to see how he was going to respond to that first, violent challenge to his administration. I could see that people reacted powerfully to him. He toured an elevated section of a new metro line under construction, and a group of men in the street below rooted him on by chanting his first name: "Kwow-TAY-mock! Kwow-TAY-mock!" He sat with me in the booth of a middle-class restaurant, talking about Nafta (he supports it, with grave reservations), immigration (he thinks the United States and Mexico have failed to discuss it adequately) and military interventions (he thinks every country is capable of solving its own problems and ought to be left alone, especially by the United States). And, as he chatted and sipped his coffee, diners got up from their tables to shake his hand and introduce their children -- a steady trickle of excited voters, thrilled at the historic opportunity to be in physical contact with their hero.
Exactly what quality in him set off those responses was hard to see. He cut the ribbon on a new orphanage, listened to 10-year-olds deliver orations that must have been written by the teachers' union, visited the city council -- and, in each of those settings, he seemed grave and tranquil, but also melancholy beyond words, as if never once in his 64 years has he enjoyed a cheerful moment. Iron weights seemed to pull the sides of his mouth down toward his chin. His oratory followed a rhythmic pattern that emphasized every eighth or ninth syllable, which, after a few minutes, got to be grating. In my hearing he never did say anything memorable. At City Hall, when he got up to leave a meeting, the reporters mobbed him so tightly as to pin his arms, and thrust their plastic tape recorders at his melancholy face, and called out questions about street vendors. And like a bored sheriff announcing the day's eviction, he replied that Mexico City has an ordinance against sidewalk vending downtown, and the law must be respected.
He was more voluble with me, if only for the purpose of making an abstract point. "The first step that has to be taken in Mexico," he said, as one person after another hurried to our table to eye their new Mayor or pump his hand, "is to re-establish, to recover, a state of law. To make the law prevail over any other interests. To make the authorities respect the law, and make everyone respect it." He was always courteous. But he was never warm. He visited a welfare center for what the Mexicans call indigenous people, meaning the Indians. And when the speeches were over, he found himself for a brief instant alone on the sidewalk with a short, squat woman, dressed in a white skirt and yellow apron, with a gray-and-white rebozo and bright colored ribbons tied to her black braid -- the costume of the Mazahua people. Almost pleading, she said, "Can't you find a kindness for the sidewalk vendors who are indigenous?"
The Mayor gazed down at her and said, for her ears alone, "The law must be respected" -- and added not a word of reassurance.
Only what did that mean -- to respect the law? It meant daily police raids. I joined one of those. Some 90 police officers gathered in front of the tumbledown cathedral in the Zocalo -- the Public Transit inspectors in T-shirts, the Judicial Police in blue uniforms, the police grenadiers (some of them women) in helmets and shields, plus a couple of officials from the city administration. The column divided in two, and my own group went marching past the picket line at the National Pawnshop, down Calle Tacuba, where a few dozen police officers went charging into a building and up the stairs, past the warrens of offices and work-shops, looking for hidden stashes of vendor merchandise.
We came upon a few racks of clothes, which were deemed suspicious, and the police laboriously hauled these racks down to the sidewalk and loaded them on trucks, which wended slowly behind us. We looked like a Roman legion, marching by in our armor with a train of looted merchandise following in the rear. The crowds on the street pretended not to notice us. And when the police operation ended for the day, I went wandering by myself back through the district we had just raided and discovered that hordes of vendors had flooded the sidewalk and clothes racks were lining the street, and the hawkers were shouting "Bargain!" -- as if the Mayor had initiated no policy at all and our Roman legion had never existed.
According to government figures, there are precisely 97,951 sidewalk vendors in Mexico City's Federal District. If you wander into the streets behind the National Palace, though, 97,951 vendors are plainly at work on every block. That part of Mexico City is amazing to see. You are never very far from the 16th and 17th centuries there. On quite a few buildings the plaster facades have chipped away, and you can observe exactly how the buildings were made -- the quarried stone foundations, the uncut rocks on the first floor, adobe on the second: the construction techniques of centuries ago.
Some of those buildings were Spanish palaces in their time, and the ancient wooden portals, the upstairs balconies and the classical pilasters are still intact. Here and there you stumble on a church in the 18th-century Baroque style, its every stone inch carved in some mad design or other, half Spanish and half Aztec. Because of the venerable age of those buildings, though, and because Mexico City is sinking into its own subsoil (the water system is draining off the underground water supply), and because of earthquakes now and then, the walls and windows and doorways in that district have tended over the years to shed, ever so gracefully, their right angles.
The entire district illustrates Balzac's observation that buildings, as they age, take on human qualities. You get the impression that a given edifice in front of you is a Castilian gentleman with a sunken nose, and across the way stands his elegant friend, who appears to be distinctly Arabic, but has unfortunately gone blind with age (as you can tell from the broken panes on the second floor, behind the iron balustrade). Directly behind the National Palace stands the austere Old Temple of Santa Teresa, except that, after too many years of standing up, the temple has decided to sit down. And all of those buildings, even the most aristocratic, except for the churches, have long ago had to abandon their finer pretensions in favor of the humblest of commercial occupations -- a sad end for such distinguished and elderly creatures.
The commercial activities follow the geographic logic of any great city. On Calle de la Santisima you find a set of stores devoted to retailing the products of Oaxaca, and on Calle Corregidora you find the plumbing district, together with the hardware district and the kitchen-appliance district. The biggest district of all, with centers on Calle Mixcalco and elsewhere, is devoted to textiles and garments -- street-level stores and upstairs factories, staffed here and there by Lebanese and even by a handful of Syrian Jews, chatting in Arabic by telephone. And throughout those several commercial zones, in luxuriant growths, like some awful weed that has exploded into obscene fecundity, you find the sidewalk vendors.
The vendors lay down their little carpets and offer their wares in no visible order -- wooden handicrafts, toy airplanes, ladies' purses, tape cassettes, foods, shriveled oranges waiting to be squeezed into juice, electric plugs, pink plastic dinosaurs, embroidered blouses, double-A batteries. The Volkswagen taxis can barely push their way up the street -- those same taxis that are driven, notoriously, by muggers and gangsters (in the first four months of 1998 alone, more than 650 tourists were assaulted by Mexico City's taxi drivers). Pedicabs from the Zocalo find themselves blocked completely, and the young drivers rise up on their pedals to peer over the crowd and grimace in frustration.
The alarm-clock vendors keep their bells eternally ringing, and the music-tape vendors blare out mariachi and merengue tunes. Hefty women dressed in smocks of blue, pink or yellow, with checkered aprons, mind their merchandise with a jealous eye, stuffing their coins in some inner pocket or purse and haggling over prices. Men shout out their goods in a penetrating nasal tone. And everywhere you see the young thugs simmering in the doorways (the streets behind the National Palace have the highest crime rates in the city), and the prostitutes standing guard in front of grim hotels with broken windows, and a sea of people surging in all directions.
The chaos is overwhelming. I studied the savvy reports in La Jornada and some of the other papers, though, and I listened to my helpful friends and colleagues from the City Hall press room, and I kept walking around the district, buying trinkets and talking to the vendors and chatting with the police. And at last it dawned on me that, instead of chaos, I was seeing in those downtown streets two distinct commercial systems at work. There was the formal commercial system of the stores, where people pay taxes and follow the laws, or at least would, if Mexico City were a law-abiding place. And there is the commercial system of the sidewalk vendors, who get their merchandise from God knows where, and pay no taxes, not even theoretically, and stand wholly outside the law. In all of Mexico, a full half of the work force is said to be engaged in what is called the informal economy -- the smuggled, the stolen, the illegal and the merely extralegal, a gigantic invisible economic empire. And in the teeming streets behind the capital city's main plaza the invisible economy's national retail center stretches before you.
On those streets, chaos, to borrow a phrase from Carlos Monsivais, is the perfection of order. For in the zone behind the Zocalo, not one thing is out of place, if you know what you are looking at. Every square foot of commercially viable pavement has been carefully parceled out, as if through a system of lease agreements, by a series of vendor guilds. The guilds are patriotic and populist organizations with grandiose names like the Benito Juarez Association of Small Merchants, Semistationary, Unsalaried, and the Guadalupe Duarte Unifying Front for Commerce in the Mexican Republic. They defend the impoverished sidewalk merchants. They cry out against injustice.
But mostly these guilds are business associations, of the kind that make offers you can't refuse. They have the reputation of using musclemen from their own organizations, or else huge street gangs called the 10, the Stubborn and the Panamanians to enforce their offers. The police figure in the system, too -- one street gang more, with the snappiest uniforms. And at the head of the vendor guilds and their enforcement mechanisms stand a series of feared and fearsome bosses -- who, through some peculiarity of Latin American tradition, tend to be women.
On Calle Corregidora the ruling guild is called the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced. The vendors on that street might make $5 or $10 in the course of a long day, yet out of that pathetic income have to pay a dollar or more to the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced, just for the right to spread their carpets across the pavement. There is resentment over these daily payments. And there is fear of getting beaten by the musclemen. Some of the vendors were reluctant to talk to me. Then I met a man who had spent 16 years selling ladies' undergarments in front of a hardware store on Calle Corregidora and had nothing but praise for the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced. The organization's secretary general, Silvia Sanchez Rico, stands up for the vendors, he told me, against the new government of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. But when the underwear vendor had concluded his speech, and I asked if I could cite his name, he regretfully declined. He was concerned, he told me, that the person on whom he had just heaped so many generous adjectives, Secretary General Sanchez, might find his remarks inadequate -- might even be displeased.
Some people figured that Silvia Sanchez had ordered the mob attack on the shopkeepers' demonstration, in order to block Cardenas's vendor campaign. In an interview with one of the papers, she defended herself gamely by suggesting that if she ever did order a mob attack, it would never be on her own terrain, so as not to bring discredit on herself. In her account, the attack must have been ordered by a rival from one of the other vendor guilds, intent on making her look thuggish and violent -- which is a theory that other people, knowledgeable about the downtown streets, regarded as plausible.
I found her office near a tiny square called the Plaza Roldan, which is only a few blocks from the Zocalo, but might as well be in a country village. A yellow building on the corner slumps like a sack of coffee beans. Through its open portals you see barrels and baskets full of gleaming chilies, dried tamarinds, chickpeas, lentils, sunflower seeds and rice. And across the street stands the headquarters of the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced -- a modest building, recognizable at once by the bold and cheerful sign on the awning, spelling out, in the red, white and green of Mexico's flag, the letters "PRI."
Secretary General Sanchez turned out to be a pretty woman, though as wide as she is tall, 41 years old, dressed in a tiger-skin patterned skirt and gold jewelry, with a necklace of glittering stones. The secretary generalship is hers by maternal inheritance, she told me. Her mother opened a lemon stand half a century ago and built up the organization. By now the membership, according to several people, extends to a full 10,000 vendors (meaning the guild must take in something like $4 million a year simply in dues, apart from any commissions that derive from buying and selling). The mother used to amble through the neighborhood, and people would cry out, "Godmother!" It was because, the daughter explained, the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced is a kindly guild, not a violent one. The guild pays its members' police fines, helps the sick and buries the dead. It is a guild of people who recognize, as the secretary general said, that "our ancestors were women of sorrow, who bore sorrow on their shoulders, who knew how to struggle."
The office is dominated by an impressive bronze bust of Secretary General Sanchez's mother. In a corner stands a shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe. And there is a remarkable collection of photographs, arrayed on two walls, showing mother and daughter posing next to what seems like every powerful leader of the Government of Mexico and the PRI during the last 30 years, unto President Zedillo. It is a patriotic display.
"We are Mexicans!" the secretary general told me. She shared none of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas's aversion to demagogic slogans. Her vendor guild is part of the PRI's empire of poor people's organizations, and the populist and nationalist rhetoric of the PRI spills instinctually from her lips. As for Cardenas himself, she told me that she wished for respectful relations, even if he came from -- and now she tried to recall the name of the mayor's Party of the Democratic Revolution. But she couldn't bring it to mind, as if he had sprung from political regions far too marginal and obscure for any reasonable person to recall. "We all have the right to get ahead," she told me -- meaning, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas does not have the right to get in our way.
I enjoyed my interview with the secretary general of the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced -- I enjoyed meeting, at last, an orator full of vim -- but I must say, as I went back into the streets and pushed my way among the swarm of vendors and tiny carpets, it did occur to me that social problems in Mexico City have a depth and augustness that you don't find everywhere. I was struck, as sooner or later everyone is in Mexico, by the fact that nothing is what it seems. Even a problem as straightforward as clearing out the sidewalk vendors can turn out to be hopelessly clogged with strange institutions and ancient habits. I came away thinking that, to know whether Cardenas's sidewalk-vendor policies (or any of his policies, or the struggle for democracy itself) are likely to get very far, you would need a keen sense of Mexico's history and social structures and customs. You would need a keen sense even to know who is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the melancholy sphinx. Yet Mexico's history and social structures and customs are famously veiled and difficult to interpret.
Three days before the vendor riot, the poet octavio paz died. The death was regarded as a national tragedy, mourned with a passion that would be inconceivable in a country like the United States, where many more people read books, and literature is much less esteemed. Paz's wavy hair and double chin were everywhere in the week that followed -- on the cover of every magazine and newspaper, and on television. He was celebrated for his poetry, his Nobel Prize, his essays on art and literature, his political analyses, his protest against the massacre of students in Mexico City in 1968 -- but, most of all, for his insights into the Mexican soul.
Even the city council, from under its pile of urban calamities, devoted a session to celebrating the dead poet, with Cardenas perched in the seat of honor and a military band braying the national anthem from the upstairs gallery. I had read some of Paz, and had liked what I read, by and large. But when the ceremony ended, I discovered that, by a happy circumstance, the city council and Mexico City's secondhand bookstore district occupy the same busy street, and, with a few purchases up and down the block, I found myself in a position to like Octavio Paz at much greater length.
The key thing with Paz, I have discovered, is to read his poems in chronological order, beginning in the 1930's and advancing into the late 1950's, when he reached his height. Reading him in that way, you see that, for all the surrealist fireworks in his poetry (the night is always flashing green, and 10 different movies seem to be playing at once), he tells a simple story from one poem to the next. It is the story of a man who feels trapped in a maze of his own self-consciousness -- almost as if he were two men, not one. The man in these poems walks down a city street, unable to break out of his own thoughts, listening to the footsteps of another man, who turns out to be himself. He wishes he could get himself to stop playing those dialectical little mind-games. He can't. Who am I? he wonders. The earth around him is parched and full of stones, and the sun is brutal. He flees into a drowsy insomnia, not quite asleep, not quite awake.
Through half-shut eyes, he begins to notice that some of those arid stones surrounding him are the ruins of ancient temples. He begins to feel that he himself is an ancient soul, and that ancient times and modern times coexist. He feels a rush of passion and lucidity -- feels in his own pulse the rhythm of those carved-stone Mayan calendars, where the rays of a giant sun go beaming murderously in all directions. Paz can get fairly frenzied when he gets into that mood, banging his tom-tom and chanting his chants. And the Mexico that he describes looks a good deal like the troubled man in those poems -- a Mexico uncomfortable in its own skin; unsure about its identity; conscious of having an ancient past, but unable to get that past clearly into focus, except now and then through accidents of imagination; a Mexico suffused with stony grandeur, and with puzzlement; a Mexico that feels itself to be two Mexicos at once, ancient and modern.
Could that be right? You could easily dismiss Paz's description as a poet's fantasy. Yet eventually you do begin to notice that in Mexico there are two magnificent sources of cultural inspiration instead of one, and the two sources are all entangled, without having entirely merged. There is a luxuriously aristocratic high culture, whose roots lead back to imperial Spain and to Jesuit savants and the Catholic orders. And there is a weirdly vivid folk culture, whose roots lead back to the Indian empires and to scary religions that long ago disappeared. The mixing of those two inspirations makes for a fantastic richness in Mexican life, which you can see anywhere you set your eyes, from the loftiest of high arts to the humblest of peddler carts, with their intense blue and red painted designs. But then again, if you look at the economy and the social structures, you see that same twoness, only this time without anything positive to be said about it.
For in Mexico there has always been an economy of the rich, whose distant origins reach back to the modernizing impulses of Europe; and an economy of the poor, whose distant origins reach back to the medieval part of what the Spaniards brought to Mexico, and to the old Indian cultures. There are modern and efficient farms for the rich, and traditional communal lands for the poor; modern merchandising for the rich, run by rent-paying and tax-paying shopkeepers, and traditional market-vending for the poor. And each sector of that fatefully split economy obeys its own customs and cannot comprehend the other sector, except as an enemy -- exactly as in the streets behind the Zocalo, where the shopkeepers and the vendor mafias represent rival economies and not just two social classes within a single economy.
In Paz's interpretation, the riddle of Mexican history has always been to bring those two Mexicos together in the name of something grander than either. In Spanish colonial times, the Catholic Church tried to do exactly that -- and succeeded, in the realm of the spirit. In the 19th century the Mexican liberals tried again -- and they, too, succeeded, in the realm of unenforceable political rights. But the first effort to succeed on any more substantial terrain came about only with the Revolution of 1910 -- and even then, civil wars and hard decades had to come and go before a great hero stepped forward and knew what to do. That event, the historic turn in Mexico's sense of itself, took place in 1934, the year of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas's birth, when his father, General Lazaro Cardenas, became President of the Republic. Lazaro Cardenas tried to bestow on all of Mexico the same mestizo quality, Indian and Spanish, that he had already bestowed on his son's name.
He took the communal lands of the Indians and the peasants, and tried to modernize them. He nationalized the American oil companies. He took the party that would eventually be called the PRI and made it an organization for everyone, from the most powerful of generals to the poorest of the poor -- a mass party for a single-party state (though in Lazaro Cardenas's system there was always room for opposition parties, too, so long as the opposition agreed never to win any elections). He was a forward-looking socialist, and, at the same time, an old-fashioned feudal strongman. And everything he did worked well enough -- not just during the years of his own presidency, from 1934 to 1940, but for the next few decades. Industry grew. Poverty diminished. The arts blossomed. In the riddle of Mexican history, Lazaro Cardenas was the solution -- the man who showed how two might become one, with benefit for all.
Who is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, then? He is the heir to the solution to the riddle of the history of Mexico. He is the son of the man who rescued Mexico from the stony solitude that Paz describes in his poems. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas does not have to be eloquent. His first name (which is that of the last Aztec emperor) and last name (which is that of the greatest of all Mexican Presidents) are already a poem. The downward turn of his lips speaks for centuries of suffering without his saying a word. He has only to let himself be seen for millions of Mexicans to remember the hope for a better future that was brought to them by his father.
The single most passionate sentence that I have found in Cuauhtemoc's writings and published interviews is this, from an essay about Lazaro Cardenas, which came out just last year: "I want, now, to remember him above all as a father, as first and foremost my father, even beyond the appreciation and admiration I have for the patriot, for the revolutionary, for the expropriator of oil, for the opponent of war, for the loving husband, for the leader of the agrarian reform, for the extremely affectionate father-in-law and grandfather, for the champion of the indigenous people, for the lover of trees and nature, for the creative cattleman, for the man who was untiring, visionary, generous and good." And so the son's heart beats for the father, and every step taken by the son is lighted by the father's torch.
Cuauhtemoc rose easily in his father's party -- he received government contracts as a young civil engineer, then government appointments; he became senator, under secretary of forests and governor of the state of Michoacan in the 1980's, in each case, through top-down nomination by the PRI leaders. Yet the son's destiny was to notice ever more clearly, as the years rolled on, that his father's intentions were not being realized. The PRI did not become the party of all the people. On the contrary, in 1968 the students in Mexico City demonstrated for more democracy, and the PRI called out the army and staged a horrific massacre, which drove the universities and whole portions of the educated middle class into the fractured ranks of the Marxist left. The communal lands never did prosper, except in a few cases.
Beginning in the 1980's, the economy as a whole began to falter, especially for the poor. And finally, in 1988, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, alone among the famous names of the PRI, astonished the country by bolting his father's party. He joined up with a raggedy coalition of left-wing mini-organizations -- the hot little groups that had come out of the student rebellion of 20 years earlier, together with a democratic-minded remnant of the old Communist Party. In the first of his races against the PRI, he ran for President as the candidate of the left-wing coalition. He lost that election -- either because he actually won, and the PRI vote-counters committed a fraud through a purported computer crash, or because he lost fair and square, and the PRI vote-counters committed a fraud anyway, just to be sure. Carlos Salinas, the PRI candidate, became President. And the sweetly comfortable life that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas had led until that moment came to an end.
He devoted the next few years to shaping the left-wing coalition into his Party of the Democratic Revolution. He brought in the Maoists, the Trotskyists, and some of the ex-Communists, and he managed to merge them with the oil workers of Veracruz and other bits and pieces of his father's old coalition from the 1930's, though he never could bring in some of the intellectuals of the moderate left. But the new party had its troubles. President Salinas orchestrated a propaganda campaign against Cardenas, who was made to look like a wild-eyed radical. Meanwhile another kind of campaign, surging from the grass roots, without central direction, went after Cardenas's supporters.
It was a campaign of murder -- which has gone mostly unpunished in Mexico and is virtually unknown in the United States. The murders began even before the 1988 election, and gathered momentum afterward. According to the estimates that Cardenas gave me, some 300 supporters of his party were killed during the six years of the Salinas presidency, followed by another 200 in the years since then. (These are figures that Joel Solomon, research director of the Americas for Human Rights Watch, regards as conceivable. "Being a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution has been very dangerous," he says.) Most of the victims were peasants, killed one or two or three at a time in the endless violence of the countryside, where political murders barely cause a stir, even within the party that has endured the losses. Cardenas himself seems to know very little about these people, though I pressed him about it. But the killings wore his party down and had the additional perverse effect of draping a flag of violence over the entire project of overthrowing the PRI. The next presidential election took place in 1994, and Cardenas ran again, this time against Salinas's political heir, Zedillo, and against a candidate from the right-wing National Action Party.
This time Cardenas was trounced, even without a computer crash. Yet even as the presidential campaign proceeded, and the Salinas administration completed its term, and the new Zedillo administration got under way -- even as the PRI demonstrated one more time its smooth efficiency at staying in office -- the calamities of 1994 began to unfold. There were the Zapatistas and the peso and the crime wave in Mexico City, and all the rest, which made the PRI look ever uglier. And Cuauhtemoc Cardenas quietly added one more element to his political appeal. He had always presented himself as his father's heir -- as the man who would always defend the ancient communal lands and never privatize the oil industry. But in the mid-90's the democratic wave that had already washed halfway across the earth finally began to reach Mexico, and Cardenas was able to present himself as the exponent of the most up-to-date ideas about democracy, too.
You could wonder about the gap between those two impulses, his democratic modernizing idea and his nostalgic left-wing populism. The democratic reformer in him was the champion of strict adherence to law, equally for everyone; and the left-winger and populist in him was the champion of all kinds of disparate causes with an uncertain relation to law -- the cause of the Zapatistas and their armed rebellion, for instance (though he urged the Zapatistas to become a civic organization). In order to square these contradictory impulses, he needed what every left-winger is looking for in Latin America today and has not yet found: a new political program, some novel and convincing way to stand for a better future without seeming to stand for the failures of the past. But no such formula was at hand. So he proceeded like an old-fashioned coalition-builder, and added his new modernizing appeal to his old nostalgic appeal, and subtracted nothing, and didn't trouble himself too much about contradicting himself. That was good enough, pragmatically speaking. His popularity increased, and with it, his ability to withstand persecution.
It may be that, in those years, democratic ideas began to spread even into the PRI, at least into its higher reaches. President Zedillo began to speak in a more democratic language, doubtless out of a recognition that, in changing times, there have to be new methods of staying in power. Maybe Nafta contributed to the new mood, at least to the extent of making Zedillo and his colleagues leery of offending the United States with any more ham-handed computer crashes. In Cardenas's estimation, a fear of the American response did, in fact, keep the PRI honest during the elections of 1997. Just now the campaign to restore their own popularity has pushed the PRI leaders to adopt a system of primary elections within their own party -- an unheard-of development in what was always a top-down authoritarian machine. And the system that has governed Mexico for most of this century -- Lazaro Cardenas's system, the system that was supposed to turn the two Mexicos into one, and didn't -- became, for the first time, vulnerable to overthrow, democratically.
What does it all add up to, now that Cardenas has spent a good six months in City Hall battling the PRI and its sidewalk vendors and defending his father's populism and making laconic statements about respect for law? I put that question to Cardenas's leading national rival outside of the PRI -- Vicente Fox, the Governor of Guanajuato, who is already running for President as a candidate of the right-wing National Action Party. Fox spoke of Cardenas, from across the ideological divide, with a good deal more respect than he granted to any of the leaders of the PRI. "I recognize him fully as being one of the great contributors to democracy in Mexico," Fox said, though he hastened to credit his own party too.
But from Fox's point of view, Cardenas has nothing more to offer. "He has no project, he has no talent, he has no vision beyond looking backward. If we Mexicans let him have the country, the country will have to go back to 1930 -- back to the communal lands, back to populism, back to the domination of a strong state, and back to the old socialist policy of taking away from some to give to others." That was the raillery of a political opponent, and shouldn't be taken too seriously, except as a challenge to Cardenas to define his new-style leftism more precisely.
How can Cardenas offer any such definition, though? Now that he is Mayor, his own actions have to speak on his behalf. Yet the actions, his municipal reforms, seem lost in inertia. Possibly that is because Mexico City's problems would overwhelm any mayor, or possibly it is because the PRI has outmaneuvered him, with its army of storefront organizers and vendor mafias and party-run trade unions. But the problem may also be that Cardenas and his Party of the Democratic Revolution are befuddled by their own mix of populism and legalist severity, and simply don't know what to do, apart from trying to rip up the corrupt old institutions of the PRI.
To present himself as the new solution to the riddle of Mexican history must be Cardenas's dearest dream. Some of his closest advisers do present him that way. But Cardenas turns out to be the man in Octavio Paz's poems, wandering in his own labyrinth of solitude. He is a man who is loved by many, but cannot explain to the many why they love him or where he intends to take them. A man who inspires people, but also deflates them. A man of hope, who leaves his admirers in a fatalist mood. You could almost conclude -- if your expectations of Cardenas were very high, and if you wanted to see Mexico undergo a full-scale revolution, which might be a good idea -- that, at this early stage, he is failing.
But then, if you did look for a revolution, what would be a reasonable standard for measuring its success? On the day after Cardenas's electoral triumph last year, Octavio Paz published a political commentary called "The New Epoch" in La Reforma. It was the last article Paz saw into print before lapsing into the final phase of his illness. Paz, in his later years, tended to sympathize with President Zedillo, though not in any formal or rigid way. He sympathized with him, mostly because he worried about disorder, and because he thought that Zedillo had chosen a suitably moderate pace of reform (and perhaps, too, because Paz was vain, and enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the powerful and receiving his share of favors). In any case, Paz did not admire Cardenas. And once the returns had come in and Cardenas had been elected Mayor, the poet worried.
He worried that, in the days to come, Cardenas and his triumphant allies were going to act like left-wing sectarians, and the leaders and rank-and-filers of the defeated PRI were going to undermine the democracy that had brought about their own defeat, and all hell was going to break loose. Paz asked everyone to reflect on the experiences of a democratic President in 1910, whose administration ended in civil war. And he soberly advised everyone in the Mexico of 1998, winners and losers alike, to behave with a civic spirit and a lowered temper.
Today it's easy to see the realism in Paz's fears. The mob attack on Calle Corregidora showed that, in Mexico City, the old PRI institutions are fully capable of turning violent if they feel challenged. In Chiapas, the standoff between the forces of the PRI and the Zapatista guerrillas has gotten more murderous, during the last few months. Things could perfectly well get worse in Mexico. And yet, on a national scale, things have not gotten worse.
Instead, Mexico appears to be easing itself, one dainty toe at a time, into democratic waters. It ought to be obvious that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, more than President Zedillo, deserves the credit -- even if Zedillo has had the wisdom to refrain from committing any gruesome enormities when elections have gone against his own party. It was Cardenas who shook up the political system back in 1988 by turning against the PRI and making his own race for president. It was Cardenas who endured the years of insults and violence that came after 1988, and refused to be discouraged, and kept on running for office. And it was Cardenas who, by getting elected Mayor, demonstrated to ordinary Mexicans that power can alternate from one party to another, not just in faraway states near the American border but in the capital city, without leading the country into civil war or political violence. Isn't that a revolution -- at least the first step toward a revolution, in the field of party politics?
Paz was right to call for a civic spirit and a lowered temper. Cardenas, in his half year in office, has delivered exactly that -- no more, and no less. The revolution, in its first step, turns out to be evolution -- halting, uninspired and partial. And yet in the history of Mexico, there has never been a more democratic moment.

 BODY:
In december 1997, a man with the wonderfully aztec and spanish name Cuauhtemoc Cardenas became the Mayor of Mexico City and initiated a series of reforms, one of which, the most delicate of all, took place in plain view. It was an earnest municipal campaign to clear the unlicensed sidewalk vendors from the downtown zone around Mexico City's central plaza, the Zocalo. Sidewalk vending in that particular neighborhood is an ancient custom. In Aztec times, when Mexico City already figured as one of the world's largest cities, a market stood on that very spot, near the Main Temple on one side of the plaza. And the vendors have never disappeared. Photographs from the 19th century show what the vendors look like today: a lone person, often a woman, squatting by a tiny carpet on the sidewalk, displaying a pathetic handful of goods for sale.
Sidewalk vending, when times are good, can offer a useful way for a hard-strapped person to earn a few honest pesos. But times have not been good. Mexico City's population, always enormous, hasin recent years swollen to 8.5 million in the Federal District (where Cardenas is mayor), plus another 10 million outside the district lines. 
 Then, in 1994, the entire country underwent a series of disasters. There were Zapatista guerrillas in the southern state of Chiapas. There were narco-traffickers in the north. There was a peso crisis, which produced an economic depression. There were assassinations and money scandals at the loftiest levels of the federal Government.
In Mexico City, a vague, shapeless social collapse was under way. The number of holdups, rapes and murders became truly terrifying, not just in the poor neighborhoods. And sidewalk vending around the Zocalo grew to proportions that no one had ever seen, and took on sinister colors.
What was the origin of those many disasters? In Cardenas's view, it lies in Mexico's political system and especially in its ruling party, the PRI (pronounced pree, from the Spanish initials for Institutional Revolutionary Party). The PRI is like nothing the United States has ever known. It is a political party, run by ordinary politicians, but it is also a mass organization, spread across a vast geography of business groups, trade unions, storefront service centers and poor people's associations, all of them linked in underground networks of "corruption and complicities," in Cardenas's description.
The party has known how to stay in power for almost 70 years -- either by winning popular support, or by winning fixed elections, or (when not even a fixed election will do) by violent repression. Cardenas was a PRI man himself in the past. But 10 years ago, having lost his faith, he left the party and set out to overthrow it. For a long time he seemed to get nowhere at all. Then last year's elections turned out to be amazingly free, and even fair, apart from the PRI-controlled television and press coverage and a few old-fashioned irregularities in the southern states. Cardenas, as the new Mayor, found himself occupying Mexico's second most visible office, after the presidency.
His Party of the Democratic Revolution captured the city council, plus a number of other offices around the country. A second opposition party -- a right-wing movement, in contrast to Cardenas's left-wing movement -- likewise advanced, mostly in the north. Mexico held its breath. Everyone understood that, in spite of the elections, the PRI remained the country's dominant political organization. In Mexico, presidents rule like kings, and the PRI still controls the presidency, in the person of Ernesto Zedillo, who has held the office since 1994. But in the year 2000, there will be a new election for President.
Short of some awful new development, that election, too, will probably be free -- possibly even fair, more or less. Cardenas, if he does well as Mayor, will be a strong candidate. Already there are polling statistics that show him to be the front-runner -- though other opposition candidates have stepped forward. And, with Cardenas in City Hall, suddenly it became obvious that, like so many other authoritarian countries during the last revolutionary decade, Mexico, too, might be plunging at last into democracy and modern life -- a thrilling thing to watch, but also slightly alarming.
It has to be said that in his first months in office, out of nervousness or bad luck, Cardenas has not in fact done especially well. He made a series of early appointments that turned out to be ill advised and had to be withdrawn. His chief of staff made wild and unjustified accusations against the PRI (instead of sober and accurate accusations, which would have been wild enough), and had to resign. The new Mayor did take some useful steps -- he tried to shore up the leaky water system, initiated a reform of the police (many of whom are criminals themselves), ordered an end to bribes (though bribery has always been how things get done). Yet none of that attracted any attention. Then he sent the police into the downtown streets to arrest a few sidewalk vendors and confiscate their paltry merchandise.
In mid-April of this year, some scuffling broke out between vendors and police. In response, a committee of shopkeepers decided to add pressure of their own by calling on their fellow shopkeepers to close their stores to protest against the sidewalk vendors and encourage the Mayor in his campaign. It was not much of a demonstration, by the standards of the Zocalo -- where, on the day of the shopkeepers' protest, hundreds of Indians continued a months-long marathon sit-in on behalf of the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, and hundreds of other people persisted in a similar marathon in the name of Pancho Villa for the right to squat on city-owned land, and still others kept up a months-long picket line against the labor policies of the Zocalo's famous National Pawnshop. The shopkeepers' demonstration, by humble contrast, was intended to last a single lunch hour, and failed even at that.
A mere handful closed their doors and faithfully attended their committee's rally, on Calle Corregidora, the street running behind the National Palace. Still, a group of journalists came out to report on the latest protest, and 23 police officers arrived to keep the peace, should the peace have needed keeping. Then a mob of 400 thugs came running down the street and tore the shopkeepers' tiny demonstration to shreds. The television news that night showed enraged young toughs racing into a store and hurling things. It was a full-scale riot, except that riots tend to be spontaneous, and in the days after the mob attack on Calle Corregidora, no one believed that anything spontaneous had occurred.
I went tramping around after Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the next few days, just to see how he was going to respond to that first, violent challenge to his administration. I could see that people reacted powerfully to him. He toured an elevated section of a new metro line under construction, and a group of men in the street below rooted him on by chanting his first name: "Kwow-TAY-mock! Kwow-TAY-mock!" He sat with me in the booth of a middle-class restaurant, talking about Nafta (he supports it, with grave reservations), immigration (he thinks the United States and Mexico have failed to discuss it adequately) and military interventions (he thinks every country is capable of solving its own problems and ought to be left alone, especially by the United States). And, as he chatted and sipped his coffee, diners got up from their tables to shake his hand and introduce their children -- a steady trickle of excited voters, thrilled at the historic opportunity to be in physical contact with their hero.
Exactly what quality in him set off those responses was hard to see. He cut the ribbon on a new orphanage, listened to 10-year-olds deliver orations that must have been written by the teachers' union, visited the city council -- and, in each of those settings, he seemed grave and tranquil, but also melancholy beyond words, as if never once in his 64 years has he enjoyed a cheerful moment. Iron weights seemed to pull the sides of his mouth down toward his chin. His oratory followed a rhythmic pattern that emphasized every eighth or ninth syllable, which, after a few minutes, got to be grating. In my hearing he never did say anything memorable. At City Hall, when he got up to leave a meeting, the reporters mobbed him so tightly as to pin his arms, and thrust their plastic tape recorders at his melancholy face, and called out questions about street vendors. And like a bored sheriff announcing the day's eviction, he replied that Mexico City has an ordinance against sidewalk vending downtown, and the law must be respected.
He was more voluble with me, if only for the purpose of making an abstract point. "The first step that has to be taken in Mexico," he said, as one person after another hurried to our table to eye their new Mayor or pump his hand, "is to re-establish, to recover, a state of law. To make the law prevail over any other interests. To make the authorities respect the law, and make everyone respect it." He was always courteous. But he was never warm. He visited a welfare center for what the Mexicans call indigenous people, meaning the Indians. And when the speeches were over, he found himself for a brief instant alone on the sidewalk with a short, squat woman, dressed in a white skirt and yellow apron, with a gray-and-white rebozo and bright colored ribbons tied to her black braid -- the costume of the Mazahua people. Almost pleading, she said, "Can't you find a kindness for the sidewalk vendors who are indigenous?"
The Mayor gazed down at her and said, for her ears alone, "The law must be respected" -- and added not a word of reassurance.
Only what did that mean -- to respect the law? It meant daily police raids. I joined one of those. Some 90 police officers gathered in front of the tumbledown cathedral in the Zocalo -- the Public Transit inspectors in T-shirts, the Judicial Police in blue uniforms, the police grenadiers (some of them women) in helmets and shields, plus a couple of officials from the city administration. The column divided in two, and my own group went marching past the picket line at the National Pawnshop, down Calle Tacuba, where a few dozen police officers went charging into a building and up the stairs, past the warrens of offices and work-shops, looking for hidden stashes of vendor merchandise.
We came upon a few racks of clothes, which were deemed suspicious, and the police laboriously hauled these racks down to the sidewalk and loaded them on trucks, which wended slowly behind us. We looked like a Roman legion, marching by in our armor with a train of looted merchandise following in the rear. The crowds on the street pretended not to notice us. And when the police operation ended for the day, I went wandering by myself back through the district we had just raided and discovered that hordes of vendors had flooded the sidewalk and clothes racks were lining the street, and the hawkers were shouting "Bargain!" -- as if the Mayor had initiated no policy at all and our Roman legion had never existed.
According to government figures, there are precisely 97,951 sidewalk vendors in Mexico City's Federal District. If you wander into the streets behind the National Palace, though, 97,951 vendors are plainly at work on every block. That part of Mexico City is amazing to see. You are never very far from the 16th and 17th centuries there. On quite a few buildings the plaster facades have chipped away, and you can observe exactly how the buildings were made -- the quarried stone foundations, the uncut rocks on the first floor, adobe on the second: the construction techniques of centuries ago.
Some of those buildings were Spanish palaces in their time, and the ancient wooden portals, the upstairs balconies and the classical pilasters are still intact. Here and there you stumble on a church in the 18th-century Baroque style, its every stone inch carved in some mad design or other, half Spanish and half Aztec. Because of the venerable age of those buildings, though, and because Mexico City is sinking into its own subsoil (the water system is draining off the underground water supply), and because of earthquakes now and then, the walls and windows and doorways in that district have tended over the years to shed, ever so gracefully, their right angles.
The entire district illustrates Balzac's observation that buildings, as they age, take on human qualities. You get the impression that a given edifice in front of you is a Castilian gentleman with a sunken nose, and across the way stands his elegant friend, who appears to be distinctly Arabic, but has unfortunately gone blind with age (as you can tell from the broken panes on the second floor, behind the iron balustrade). Directly behind the National Palace stands the austere Old Temple of Santa Teresa, except that, after too many years of standing up, the temple has decided to sit down. And all of those buildings, even the most aristocratic, except for the churches, have long ago had to abandon their finer pretensions in favor of the humblest of commercial occupations -- a sad end for such distinguished and elderly creatures.
The commercial activities follow the geographic logic of any great city. On Calle de la Santisima you find a set of stores devoted to retailing the products of Oaxaca, and on Calle Corregidora you find the plumbing district, together with the hardware district and the kitchen-appliance district. The biggest district of all, with centers on Calle Mixcalco and elsewhere, is devoted to textiles and garments -- street-level stores and upstairs factories, staffed here and there by Lebanese and even by a handful of Syrian Jews, chatting in Arabic by telephone. And throughout those several commercial zones, in luxuriant growths, like some awful weed that has exploded into obscene fecundity, you find the sidewalk vendors.
The vendors lay down their little carpets and offer their wares in no visible order -- wooden handicrafts, toy airplanes, ladies' purses, tape cassettes, foods, shriveled oranges waiting to be squeezed into juice, electric plugs, pink plastic dinosaurs, embroidered blouses, double-A batteries. The Volkswagen taxis can barely push their way up the street -- those same taxis that are driven, notoriously, by muggers and gangsters (in the first four months of 1998 alone, more than 650 tourists were assaulted by Mexico City's taxi drivers). Pedicabs from the Zocalo find themselves blocked completely, and the young drivers rise up on their pedals to peer over the crowd and grimace in frustration.
The alarm-clock vendors keep their bells eternally ringing, and the music-tape vendors blare out mariachi and merengue tunes. Hefty women dressed in smocks of blue, pink or yellow, with checkered aprons, mind their merchandise with a jealous eye, stuffing their coins in some inner pocket or purse and haggling over prices. Men shout out their goods in a penetrating nasal tone. And everywhere you see the young thugs simmering in the doorways (the streets behind the National Palace have the highest crime rates in the city), and the prostitutes standing guard in front of grim hotels with broken windows, and a sea of people surging in all directions.
The chaos is overwhelming. I studied the savvy reports in La Jornada and some of the other papers, though, and I listened to my helpful friends and colleagues from the City Hall press room, and I kept walking around the district, buying trinkets and talking to the vendors and chatting with the police. And at last it dawned on me that, instead of chaos, I was seeing in those downtown streets two distinct commercial systems at work. There was the formal commercial system of the stores, where people pay taxes and follow the laws, or at least would, if Mexico City were a law-abiding place. And there is the commercial system of the sidewalk vendors, who get their merchandise from God knows where, and pay no taxes, not even theoretically, and stand wholly outside the law. In all of Mexico, a full half of the work force is said to be engaged in what is called the informal economy -- the smuggled, the stolen, the illegal and the merely extralegal, a gigantic invisible economic empire. And in the teeming streets behind the capital city's main plaza the invisible economy's national retail center stretches before you.
On those streets, chaos, to borrow a phrase from Carlos Monsivais, is the perfection of order. For in the zone behind the Zocalo, not one thing is out of place, if you know what you are looking at. Every square foot of commercially viable pavement has been carefully parceled out, as if through a system of lease agreements, by a series of vendor guilds. The guilds are patriotic and populist organizations with grandiose names like the Benito Juarez Association of Small Merchants, Semistationary, Unsalaried, and the Guadalupe Duarte Unifying Front for Commerce in the Mexican Republic. They defend the impoverished sidewalk merchants. They cry out against injustice.
But mostly these guilds are business associations, of the kind that make offers you can't refuse. They have the reputation of using musclemen from their own organizations, or else huge street gangs called the 10, the Stubborn and the Panamanians to enforce their offers. The police figure in the system, too -- one street gang more, with the snappiest uniforms. And at the head of the vendor guilds and their enforcement mechanisms stand a series of feared and fearsome bosses -- who, through some peculiarity of Latin American tradition, tend to be women.
On Calle Corregidora the ruling guild is called the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced. The vendors on that street might make $5 or $10 in the course of a long day, yet out of that pathetic income have to pay a dollar or more to the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced, just for the right to spread their carpets across the pavement. There is resentment over these daily payments. And there is fear of getting beaten by the musclemen. Some of the vendors were reluctant to talk to me. Then I met a man who had spent 16 years selling ladies' undergarments in front of a hardware store on Calle Corregidora and had nothing but praise for the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced. The organization's secretary general, Silvia Sanchez Rico, stands up for the vendors, he told me, against the new government of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. But when the underwear vendor had concluded his speech, and I asked if I could cite his name, he regretfully declined. He was concerned, he told me, that the person on whom he had just heaped so many generous adjectives, Secretary General Sanchez, might find his remarks inadequate -- might even be displeased.
Some people figured that Silvia Sanchez had ordered the mob attack on the shopkeepers' demonstration, in order to block Cardenas's vendor campaign. In an interview with one of the papers, she defended herself gamely by suggesting that if she ever did order a mob attack, it would never be on her own terrain, so as not to bring discredit on herself. In her account, the attack must have been ordered by a rival from one of the other vendor guilds, intent on making her look thuggish and violent -- which is a theory that other people, knowledgeable about the downtown streets, regarded as plausible.
I found her office near a tiny square called the Plaza Roldan, which is only a few blocks from the Zocalo, but might as well be in a country village. A yellow building on the corner slumps like a sack of coffee beans. Through its open portals you see barrels and baskets full of gleaming chilies, dried tamarinds, chickpeas, lentils, sunflower seeds and rice. And across the street stands the headquarters of the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced -- a modest building, recognizable at once by the bold and cheerful sign on the awning, spelling out, in the red, white and green of Mexico's flag, the letters "PRI."
Secretary General Sanchez turned out to be a pretty woman, though as wide as she is tall, 41 years old, dressed in a tiger-skin patterned skirt and gold jewelry, with a necklace of glittering stones. The secretary generalship is hers by maternal inheritance, she told me. Her mother opened a lemon stand half a century ago and built up the organization. By now the membership, according to several people, extends to a full 10,000 vendors (meaning the guild must take in something like $4 million a year simply in dues, apart from any commissions that derive from buying and selling). The mother used to amble through the neighborhood, and people would cry out, "Godmother!" It was because, the daughter explained, the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced is a kindly guild, not a violent one. The guild pays its members' police fines, helps the sick and buries the dead. It is a guild of people who recognize, as the secretary general said, that "our ancestors were women of sorrow, who bore sorrow on their shoulders, who knew how to struggle."
The office is dominated by an impressive bronze bust of Secretary General Sanchez's mother. In a corner stands a shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe. And there is a remarkable collection of photographs, arrayed on two walls, showing mother and daughter posing next to what seems like every powerful leader of the Government of Mexico and the PRI during the last 30 years, unto President Zedillo. It is a patriotic display.
"We are Mexicans!" the secretary general told me. She shared none of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas's aversion to demagogic slogans. Her vendor guild is part of the PRI's empire of poor people's organizations, and the populist and nationalist rhetoric of the PRI spills instinctually from her lips. As for Cardenas himself, she told me that she wished for respectful relations, even if he came from -- and now she tried to recall the name of the mayor's Party of the Democratic Revolution. But she couldn't bring it to mind, as if he had sprung from political regions far too marginal and obscure for any reasonable person to recall. "We all have the right to get ahead," she told me -- meaning, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas does not have the right to get in our way.
I enjoyed my interview with the secretary general of the Civic Union of Sidewalk Vendors of the Old Merced -- I enjoyed meeting, at last, an orator full of vim -- but I must say, as I went back into the streets and pushed my way among the swarm of vendors and tiny carpets, it did occur to me that social problems in Mexico City have a depth and augustness that you don't find everywhere. I was struck, as sooner or later everyone is in Mexico, by the fact that nothing is what it seems. Even a problem as straightforward as clearing out the sidewalk vendors can turn out to be hopelessly clogged with strange institutions and ancient habits. I came away thinking that, to know whether Cardenas's sidewalk-vendor policies (or any of his policies, or the struggle for democracy itself) are likely to get very far, you would need a keen sense of Mexico's history and social structures and customs. You would need a keen sense even to know who is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the melancholy sphinx. Yet Mexico's history and social structures and customs are famously veiled and difficult to interpret.
Three days before the vendor riot, the poet octavio paz died. The death was regarded as a national tragedy, mourned with a passion that would be inconceivable in a country like the United States, where many more people read books, and literature is much less esteemed. Paz's wavy hair and double chin were everywhere in the week that followed -- on the cover of every magazine and newspaper, and on television. He was celebrated for his poetry, his Nobel Prize, his essays on art and literature, his political analyses, his protest against the massacre of students in Mexico City in 1968 -- but, most of all, for his insights into the Mexican soul.
Even the city council, from under its pile of urban calamities, devoted a session to celebrating the dead poet, with Cardenas perched in the seat of honor and a military band braying the national anthem from the upstairs gallery. I had read some of Paz, and had liked what I read, by and large. But when the ceremony ended, I discovered that, by a happy circumstance, the city council and Mexico City's secondhand bookstore district occupy the same busy street, and, with a few purchases up and down the block, I found myself in a position to like Octavio Paz at much greater length.
The key thing with Paz, I have discovered, is to read his poems in chronological order, beginning in the 1930's and advancing into the late 1950's, when he reached his height. Reading him in that way, you see that, for all the surrealist fireworks in his poetry (the night is always flashing green, and 10 different movies seem to be playing at once), he tells a simple story from one poem to the next. It is the story of a man who feels trapped in a maze of his own self-consciousness -- almost as if he were two men, not one. The man in these poems walks down a city street, unable to break out of his own thoughts, listening to the footsteps of another man, who turns out to be himself. He wishes he could get himself to stop playing those dialectical little mind-games. He can't. Who am I? he wonders. The earth around him is parched and full of stones, and the sun is brutal. He flees into a drowsy insomnia, not quite asleep, not quite awake.
Through half-shut eyes, he begins to notice that some of those arid stones surrounding him are the ruins of ancient temples. He begins to feel that he himself is an ancient soul, and that ancient times and modern times coexist. He feels a rush of passion and lucidity -- feels in his own pulse the rhythm of those carved-stone Mayan calendars, where the rays of a giant sun go beaming murderously in all directions. Paz can get fairly frenzied when he gets into that mood, banging his tom-tom and chanting his chants. And the Mexico that he describes looks a good deal like the troubled man in those poems -- a Mexico uncomfortable in its own skin; unsure about its identity; conscious of having an ancient past, but unable to get that past clearly into focus, except now and then through accidents of imagination; a Mexico suffused with stony grandeur, and with puzzlement; a Mexico that feels itself to be two Mexicos at once, ancient and modern.
Could that be right? You could easily dismiss Paz's description as a poet's fantasy. Yet eventually you do begin to notice that in Mexico there are two magnificent sources of cultural inspiration instead of one, and the two sources are all entangled, without having entirely merged. There is a luxuriously aristocratic high culture, whose roots lead back to imperial Spain and to Jesuit savants and the Catholic orders. And there is a weirdly vivid folk culture, whose roots lead back to the Indian empires and to scary religions that long ago disappeared. The mixing of those two inspirations makes for a fantastic richness in Mexican life, which you can see anywhere you set your eyes, from the loftiest of high arts to the humblest of peddler carts, with their intense blue and red painted designs. But then again, if you look at the economy and the social structures, you see that same twoness, only this time without anything positive to be said about it.
For in Mexico there has always been an economy of the rich, whose distant origins reach back to the modernizing impulses of Europe; and an economy of the poor, whose distant origins reach back to the medieval part of what the Spaniards brought to Mexico, and to the old Indian cultures. There are modern and efficient farms for the rich, and traditional communal lands for the poor; modern merchandising for the rich, run by rent-paying and tax-paying shopkeepers, and traditional market-vending for the poor. And each sector of that fatefully split economy obeys its own customs and cannot comprehend the other sector, except as an enemy -- exactly as in the streets behind the Zocalo, where the shopkeepers and the vendor mafias represent rival economies and not just two social classes within a single economy.
In Paz's interpretation, the riddle of Mexican history has always been to bring those two Mexicos together in the name of something grander than either. In Spanish colonial times, the Catholic Church tried to do exactly that -- and succeeded, in the realm of the spirit. In the 19th century the Mexican liberals tried again -- and they, too, succeeded, in the realm of unenforceable political rights. But the first effort to succeed on any more substantial terrain came about only with the Revolution of 1910 -- and even then, civil wars and hard decades had to come and go before a great hero stepped forward and knew what to do. That event, the historic turn in Mexico's sense of itself, took place in 1934, the year of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas's birth, when his father, General Lazaro Cardenas, became President of the Republic. Lazaro Cardenas tried to bestow on all of Mexico the same mestizo quality, Indian and Spanish, that he had already bestowed on his son's name.
He took the communal lands of the Indians and the peasants, and tried to modernize them. He nationalized the American oil companies. He took the party that would eventually be called the PRI and made it an organization for everyone, from the most powerful of generals to the poorest of the poor -- a mass party for a single-party state (though in Lazaro Cardenas's system there was always room for opposition parties, too, so long as the opposition agreed never to win any elections). He was a forward-looking socialist, and, at the same time, an old-fashioned feudal strongman. And everything he did worked well enough -- not just during the years of his own presidency, from 1934 to 1940, but for the next few decades. Industry grew. Poverty diminished. The arts blossomed. In the riddle of Mexican history, Lazaro Cardenas was the solution -- the man who showed how two might become one, with benefit for all.
Who is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, then? He is the heir to the solution to the riddle of the history of Mexico. He is the son of the man who rescued Mexico from the stony solitude that Paz describes in his poems. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas does not have to be eloquent. His first name (which is that of the last Aztec emperor) and last name (which is that of the greatest of all Mexican Presidents) are already a poem. The downward turn of his lips speaks for centuries of suffering without his saying a word. He has only to let himself be seen for millions of Mexicans to remember the hope for a better future that was brought to them by his father.
The single most passionate sentence that I have found in Cuauhtemoc's writings and published interviews is this, from an essay about Lazaro Cardenas, which came out just last year: "I want, now, to remember him above all as a father, as first and foremost my father, even beyond the appreciation and admiration I have for the patriot, for the revolutionary, for the expropriator of oil, for the opponent of war, for the loving husband, for the leader of the agrarian reform, for the extremely affectionate father-in-law and grandfather, for the champion of the indigenous people, for the lover of trees and nature, for the creative cattleman, for the man who was untiring, visionary, generous and good." And so the son's heart beats for the father, and every step taken by the son is lighted by the father's torch.
Cuauhtemoc rose easily in his father's party -- he received government contracts as a young civil engineer, then government appointments; he became senator, under secretary of forests and governor of the state of Michoacan in the 1980's, in each case, through top-down nomination by the PRI leaders. Yet the son's destiny was to notice ever more clearly, as the years rolled on, that his father's intentions were not being realized. The PRI did not become the party of all the people. On the contrary, in 1968 the students in Mexico City demonstrated for more democracy, and the PRI called out the army and staged a horrific massacre, which drove the universities and whole portions of the educated middle class into the fractured ranks of the Marxist left. The communal lands never did prosper, except in a few cases.
Beginning in the 1980's, the economy as a whole began to falter, especially for the poor. And finally, in 1988, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, alone among the famous names of the PRI, astonished the country by bolting his father's party. He joined up with a raggedy coalition of left-wing mini-organizations -- the hot little groups that had come out of the student rebellion of 20 years earlier, together with a democratic-minded remnant of the old Communist Party. In the first of his races against the PRI, he ran for President as the candidate of the left-wing coalition. He lost that election -- either because he actually won, and the PRI vote-counters committed a fraud through a purported computer crash, or because he lost fair and square, and the PRI vote-counters committed a fraud anyway, just to be sure. Carlos Salinas, the PRI candidate, became President. And the sweetly comfortable life that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas had led until that moment came to an end.
He devoted the next few years to shaping the left-wing coalition into his Party of the Democratic Revolution. He brought in the Maoists, the Trotskyists, and some of the ex-Communists, and he managed to merge them with the oil workers of Veracruz and other bits and pieces of his father's old coalition from the 1930's, though he never could bring in some of the intellectuals of the moderate left. But the new party had its troubles. President Salinas orchestrated a propaganda campaign against Cardenas, who was made to look like a wild-eyed radical. Meanwhile another kind of campaign, surging from the grass roots, without central direction, went after Cardenas's supporters.
It was a campaign of murder -- which has gone mostly unpunished in Mexico and is virtually unknown in the United States. The murders began even before the 1988 election, and gathered momentum afterward. According to the estimates that Cardenas gave me, some 300 supporters of his party were killed during the six years of the Salinas presidency, followed by another 200 in the years since then. (These are figures that Joel Solomon, research director of the Americas for Human Rights Watch, regards as conceivable. "Being a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution has been very dangerous," he says.) Most of the victims were peasants, killed one or two or three at a time in the endless violence of the countryside, where political murders barely cause a stir, even within the party that has endured the losses. Cardenas himself seems to know very little about these people, though I pressed him about it. But the killings wore his party down and had the additional perverse effect of draping a flag of violence over the entire project of overthrowing the PRI. The next presidential election took place in 1994, and Cardenas ran again, this time against Salinas's political heir, Zedillo, and against a candidate from the right-wing National Action Party.
This time Cardenas was trounced, even without a computer crash. Yet even as the presidential campaign proceeded, and the Salinas administration completed its term, and the new Zedillo administration got under way -- even as the PRI demonstrated one more time its smooth efficiency at staying in office -- the calamities of 1994 began to unfold. There were the Zapatistas and the peso and the crime wave in Mexico City, and all the rest, which made the PRI look ever uglier. And Cuauhtemoc Cardenas quietly added one more element to his political appeal. He had always presented himself as his father's heir -- as the man who would always defend the ancient communal lands and never privatize the oil industry. But in the mid-90's the democratic wave that had already washed halfway across the earth finally began to reach Mexico, and Cardenas was able to present himself as the exponent of the most up-to-date ideas about democracy, too.
You could wonder about the gap between those two impulses, his democratic modernizing idea and his nostalgic left-wing populism. The democratic reformer in him was the champion of strict adherence to law, equally for everyone; and the left-winger and populist in him was the champion of all kinds of disparate causes with an uncertain relation to law -- the cause of the Zapatistas and their armed rebellion, for instance (though he urged the Zapatistas to become a civic organization). In order to square these contradictory impulses, he needed what every left-winger is looking for in Latin America today and has not yet found: a new political program, some novel and convincing way to stand for a better future without seeming to stand for the failures of the past. But no such formula was at hand. So he proceeded like an old-fashioned coalition-builder, and added his new modernizing appeal to his old nostalgic appeal, and subtracted nothing, and didn't trouble himself too much about contradicting himself. That was good enough, pragmatically speaking. His popularity increased, and with it, his ability to withstand persecution.
It may be that, in those years, democratic ideas began to spread even into the PRI, at least into its higher reaches. President Zedillo began to speak in a more democratic language, doubtless out of a recognition that, in changing times, there have to be new methods of staying in power. Maybe Nafta contributed to the new mood, at least to the extent of making Zedillo and his colleagues leery of offending the United States with any more ham-handed computer crashes. In Cardenas's estimation, a fear of the American response did, in fact, keep the PRI honest during the elections of 1997. Just now the campaign to restore their own popularity has pushed the PRI leaders to adopt a system of primary elections within their own party -- an unheard-of development in what was always a top-down authoritarian machine. And the system that has governed Mexico for most of this century -- Lazaro Cardenas's system, the system that was supposed to turn the two Mexicos into one, and didn't -- became, for the first time, vulnerable to overthrow, democratically.
What does it all add up to, now that Cardenas has spent a good six months in City Hall battling the PRI and its sidewalk vendors and defending his father's populism and making laconic statements about respect for law? I put that question to Cardenas's leading national rival outside of the PRI -- Vicente Fox, the Governor of Guanajuato, who is already running for President as a candidate of the right-wing National Action Party. Fox spoke of Cardenas, from across the ideological divide, with a good deal more respect than he granted to any of the leaders of the PRI. "I recognize him fully as being one of the great contributors to democracy in Mexico," Fox said, though he hastened to credit his own party too.
But from Fox's point of view, Cardenas has nothing more to offer. "He has no project, he has no talent, he has no vision beyond looking backward. If we Mexicans let him have the country, the country will have to go back to 1930 -- back to the communal lands, back to populism, back to the domination of a strong state, and back to the old socialist policy of taking away from some to give to others." That was the raillery of a political opponent, and shouldn't be taken too seriously, except as a challenge to Cardenas to define his new-style leftism more precisely.
How can Cardenas offer any such definition, though? Now that he is Mayor, his own actions have to speak on his behalf. Yet the actions, his municipal reforms, seem lost in inertia. Possibly that is because Mexico City's problems would overwhelm any mayor, or possibly it is because the PRI has outmaneuvered him, with its army of storefront organizers and vendor mafias and party-run trade unions. But the problem may also be that Cardenas and his Party of the Democratic Revolution are befuddled by their own mix of populism and legalist severity, and simply don't know what to do, apart from trying to rip up the corrupt old institutions of the PRI.
To present himself as the new solution to the riddle of Mexican history must be Cardenas's dearest dream. Some of his closest advisers do present him that way. But Cardenas turns out to be the man in Octavio Paz's poems, wandering in his own labyrinth of solitude. He is a man who is loved by many, but cannot explain to the many why they love him or where he intends to take them. A man who inspires people, but also deflates them. A man of hope, who leaves his admirers in a fatalist mood. You could almost conclude -- if your expectations of Cardenas were very high, and if you wanted to see Mexico undergo a full-scale revolution, which might be a good idea -- that, at this early stage, he is failing.
But then, if you did look for a revolution, what would be a reasonable standard for measuring its success? On the day after Cardenas's electoral triumph last year, Octavio Paz published a political commentary called "The New Epoch" in La Reforma. It was the last article Paz saw into print before lapsing into the final phase of his illness. Paz, in his later years, tended to sympathize with President Zedillo, though not in any formal or rigid way. He sympathized with him, mostly because he worried about disorder, and because he thought that Zedillo had chosen a suitably moderate pace of reform (and perhaps, too, because Paz was vain, and enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the powerful and receiving his share of favors). In any case, Paz did not admire Cardenas. And once the returns had come in and Cardenas had been elected Mayor, the poet worried.
He worried that, in the days to come, Cardenas and his triumphant allies were going to act like left-wing sectarians, and the leaders and rank-and-filers of the defeated PRI were going to undermine the democracy that had brought about their own defeat, and all hell was going to break loose. Paz asked everyone to reflect on the experiences of a democratic President in 1910, whose administration ended in civil war. And he soberly advised everyone in the Mexico of 1998, winners and losers alike, to behave with a civic spirit and a lowered temper.
Today it's easy to see the realism in Paz's fears. The mob attack on Calle Corregidora showed that, in Mexico City, the old PRI institutions are fully capable of turning violent if they feel challenged. In Chiapas, the standoff between the forces of the PRI and the Zapatista guerrillas has gotten more murderous, during the last few months. Things could perfectly well get worse in Mexico. And yet, on a national scale, things have not gotten worse.
Instead, Mexico appears to be easing itself, one dainty toe at a time, into democratic waters. It ought to be obvious that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, more than President Zedillo, deserves the credit -- even if Zedillo has had the wisdom to refrain from committing any gruesome enormities when elections have gone against his own party. It was Cardenas who shook up the political system back in 1988 by turning against the PRI and making his own race for president. It was Cardenas who endured the years of insults and violence that came after 1988, and refused to be discouraged, and kept on running for office. And it was Cardenas who, by getting elected Mayor, demonstrated to ordinary Mexicans that power can alternate from one party to another, not just in faraway states near the American border but in the capital city, without leading the country into civil war or political violence. Isn't that a revolution -- at least the first step toward a revolution, in the field of party politics?
Paz was right to call for a civic spirit and a lowered temper. Cardenas, in his half year in office, has delivered exactly that -- no more, and no less. The revolution, in its first step, turns out to be evolution -- halting, uninspired and partial. And yet in the history of Mexico, there has never been a more democratic moment.

 BODY:
We played poker every week for seven years, in apartments outfitted with round tables, green felt and nice chips. The core half-dozen of us, men and women both, lived in Manhattan, with good jobs and no kids.
It started as a goof, the way some people go bowling. For the first year or two we kept cheat sheets on the table to remind us of whether a flush beats a straight. Later on, we were sending away to Las Vegas for books on strategy. 
 The stakes increased over time, and by the end it wasn't too unusual to win or lose $100 in a night. But if you were any kind of player it more or less evened out. It wasn't about the money, anyway, not really. It was about winning, and the monstrous ambition we tried to hide at work blossomed at the table. Our careers colored the way we approached the cards.
David, a musician, comedy writer and schemer, was convinced that every big pot was his meal ticket, and he pursued them recklessly. Bursting with vulgar humor, epic self-involvement and the odd ditty, he approached the game with deep engagement, because he was entirely convinced he would win. He bad-mouthed all the lawyers at the table pitilessly and on principle. He loudly envied anyone doing better than he did that night or making more money than he did in life.
Jed, an entertainment lawyer, was distracted, jokey, always on the phone. He was there for company, for gossip and maybe for connections. Jed became steadily more successful, and we started to hear about Sundance and Cannes, equity stakes and executive-producer titles. He started to show up with clients in tow.
Jed was cheerfully aware of his superficial appreciation of poker. On hearing another player's measured and complicated reasoning for folding a strong hand in the face of a decent shot at half the pot, Jed promptly called the bet. "I'm in," he said, "because I have plenty of chips left." He wanted to be in the game, in the deal, and he hoped the economics would sort themselves out later.
George, whom we'd nicknamed the Ox, was a tax lawyer and raconteur who spun out intricate high-stakes games and endless sagas about his adventures with his college buddies at Amherst. He solicited romantic advice and lost methodically.
Lots of people came once and decided, sensibly, that we weren't for them. More often, we decided not to invite them back. They were too slow on the uptake, or too deliberate in their play, or too amateurish, or too cheap, or too rich to care. Or they were clients of Jed's, who were always hopeless. They expected us to bend the rules for them, because they were new or because they had just lost $20 in a misunderstanding about how to declare low. They left at 9:30 because they'd lost all they could lose. These were people we could do without.
We heard stories about games more genteel than ours, games that would rusticate even regular players for bad behavior. My favorite concerned a guy banished for two years for excessive gloating. I wouldn't have lasted half an hour in that game.
We were reckless gamblers, most of us, appreciative of the well-executed small plays but exultant at winning the big pot on luck and nerve.
That's not the right way to play, according to the books. They tell you to play tight, to "throw that trash away," that is, when you get bad cards early. Ted played the right way. He folded almost everything, and when he stayed in we all got out of his way. You can eke out a small edge doing this, but without joy.
Ted was a risk arbitrageur on Wall Street, making bets on which mergers would close, playing the spreads. Ted played cards the way he invested in deals: analytically, squeezing out the nickels. He tired of the game before any of us, and he left his job not long after.
Toward the end, we let a bunch of placid, cool artists and other downtown types join our game. They were much nicer than we were, solicitous even, which is odd in a game that calls for a killer instinct. They'd let the new guy who messed up have his twenty back.
The game collapsed not too long after that. It had been built on noise and confrontation, and without these the game became a little rote. We had by now learned what there was to know about the other selves we brought to the poker table.
Our not-always-attractive work personas were amplified for poker night, and for years this seemed liberating. By the end, though, this weekly exhilaration had grown hollow and unsatisfying.
In the civilized quiet, our bluster had turned out to be a sort of bluff, and it had been called.

HEADLINE: Superbugs

BYLINE: By Sheryl Gay Stolberg; Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports on medicine and health policy for The New York Times.

 BODY:
There was nothing out of the ordinary about the slender glass tubes of blood that arrived in Sharon S. Rotun's laboratory late in the afternoon of March 20, 1998. A pale, stocky woman with the impatient manner of someone who is overworked and underpaid, Rotun was the microbiology supervisor at United Hospital Medical Center, a small community hospital in the working-class town of Port Chester, N.Y., just north of Manhattan in Westchester County. The two blood cultures were among roughly a dozen sent to the lab that day. Whoever ordered the testing was evidently in a hurry, Rotun recalls, because he or she hadn't even bothered to scribble the usual instructions on the accompanying slip.
The blood belonged to a 79-year-old Westchester County man, a retired New York City narcotics detective who had been admitted to the hospital earlier that day. For the past year and a half, the detective's kidneys had been failing him, a condition that required him to undergo dialysis three times a week. On most days, he tolerated the tedious procedure with a smile. But on the morning of March 20, the retired detective awoke in an unusually sour mood. 
 "He didn't want to eat; he didn't want to get dressed; he didn't want to get washed," said his daughter, Carole, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that she be identified only by her first name and that her father not be identified at all. She got him dressed, quickly served him breakfast and, despite his protests, sent him to the local dialysis center. "You have to go,"' the daughter told him. "You have no choice."
The old man was feverish, short of breath and so disoriented he could barely speak by the time the kidney specialist, Dr. Sam Natarajan, saw him. Natarajan immediately suspected staphylococcus aureas, a bacteria that frequently causes illness among dialysis patients, who become infected when the microbes enter the bloodstream along their intravenous lines. The doctor performed just enough dialysis to clear the fluid backed up in his patient's lungs -- a "dry cleaning," in the argot of renal disease -- and then called an ambulance to take the man to the hospital. Twelve hours later, the patient was dead.
In what turned out to be the final hours of his life, the ailing detective was hooked up to an intravenous drip of vancomycin, a powerful antibiotic that has been the ultimate weapon against staph for the last three decades. Doctors regard vancomycin as the drug of last resort, the medicine they rely on to kill germs that are too vicious to respond to anything else. Normally, vancomycin begins attacking staph in the bloodstream immediately. "We call vancomycin 'the big gun,"' Rotun says. Which is why, when she first examined the lab results from the dead detective, she did not believe what she saw.
A staph infection was indeed flourishing in the detective's blood when he died. But not just any strain of staph. This was a rare and unusually dangerous germ, a supermicrobe that infectious-disease experts have been dreading for years. It goes by the name of VISA, for Vancomycin Intermediate-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureas, and it represents the bacterial world's most potent counterattack against antibiotics.
As soon as the results of the detective's blood tests came in, Rotun posted signs all over her laboratory, instructing her subordinates not to give out any information. The last thing the hospital needed, she thought, was a swarm of reporters generating panic over a killer superbug that could be spreading through the hospital's corridors. Not even Carole, the detective's daughter, was told. Instead, Rotun repeated the lab tests. Then, when she had convinced herself there was no mistake, she picked up the phone and called her longtime colleague and friend, Ginny McMath, United Hospital's infection control officer.
"I hope you're sitting down,"' Rotun told McMath. "I think we have the first VISA in New York State."
In recent years, it has become fashionable in the media to warn of the exotic new infectious diseases percolating in faraway lands. The gruesome Ebola virus, which swept through Zaire three years ago, has captured the public imagination in books and on film. But while Hollywood has been busy making scary movies, infectious-disease experts know that the bigger danger is in our own backyard: garden variety germs that for decades have been so easily felled by antibiotics that most people, including some scientists, naively assumed they were no longer a threat.
For the past decade, however, scientists at the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and all over the world have been sounding alarm bells about the growth of antibiotic resistance, a problem that has been fueled by patients who demand antibiotics for every bout of the sniffles and by doctors who give in to such demands. The list of dangerously virulent drug-resistant microbes is growing all the time: streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes pneumonia, childhood ear infections and meningitis; mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea.
But none are as frightening to medical experts as the VISA strains of staph. Within the past 18 months, the C.D.C. has documented the first four cases ever, the most recent being that of the New York detective. Their emergence is an ominous harbinger of what Dr. Stuart B. Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts, calls "the worst thing that could happen in clinical infectious disease."
One reason for concern is that staph is a particularly common and robust organism; it lives on the skin and in the nostrils of otherwise healthy people as part of what scientists call the "natural flora," where it is relatively harmless. But if it gains access to the body through scrapes, cuts or surgical incisions, as it often does, it can cause a range of ailments, from pus-oozing cuts to sepsis, an often lethal infection of the bloodstream. Children who scrape their knees are susceptible to staph, as are housewives who cut their hands in the kitchen or anybody else with an open wound. Should VISA strains become common, simple cuts and scrapes could become mortal wounds.
To complicate matters, hospitals are already breeding grounds for a host of dangerous bugs. Each year, nearly 90,000 patients in the United States die of a hospital-acquired infection, and many of those cases are theoretically treatable with antibiotics. Staph is often the culprit, picking on vulnerable patients like the elderly, the immunocompromised and those undergoing surgery. The emergence of an untreatable strain of staph would put virtually any healthy person at risk, and could turn a bad situation into a disastrous one. As Levy says, "Right now, we are still in most cases able to use vancomycin. Now let's say we lose vancomycin. Where are the deaths going to go? They're going to go up. This number could double."
Now that these bugs are figuring out ways to evade the very miracle drugs that have always worked so well against them, there is little on the horizon to keep the virulent new supergerms in check. Joshua Lederberg, a Rockefeller University professor who is widely regarded as one of the nation's leading authorities on infectious disease, warns that far too little attention is being paid to the threat of drug-resistant germs. "The odds of Ebola breaking out are quite low, but the stakes are very high," Lederberg says. "With antibiotic resistance, the odds are certain and the stakes are just as high. It is happening right under our noses."
And it is happening at a particularly precarious moment, when many hospitals are cutting back on services as they struggle to survive the changing economics of health care. United Hospital in Port Chester, for example, reflecting national trends, plans to "outsource" Rotun's lab. Meanwhile, drug manufacturers, which in the early 1980's all but abandoned development of new antibiotics on the theory that they were no longer needed, find themselves behind the curve; they are hustling to invent new treatments and put them on pharmacy shelves. And that is why the emergence of the vancomycin-resistant strains is viewed as such a worrisome public health threat. The next generation of new antimicrobials is, by the industry's own estimate, at least several years away, creating a dangerous window in which the virulent new microbes might be able to spread unchecked. If that happens, modern medicine might revert to the days before penicillin, when sore throats could become fatal and patients who walked into the hospital for routine surgery might be carried out in coffins.
"If we have no antibiotics, it reopens the whole question of intrusive surgical procedures and vastly changes the calculus of their safety," Lederberg says. In the pre-penicillin era, people occasionally died while having their appendixes removed -- not because the surgery itself was dangerous but because germs crept into the patients' incisions, causing infections that spread to the bloodstream and raged out of control. "Those days," Lederberg says, "have a chance of coming back if the drugs we have been relying on just stop working."
To trace the evolution of the new superbugs, experts inevitably look back to the introduction of penicillin in 1943. If ever there was a miracle of modern medicine, it was penicillin, the first drug that could quell a wide range of microbial invaders without harming the body. "It was as if Prometheus had stolen fire from the gods," Levy, the Tufts University professor, wrote in his 1992 book "The Antiobiotic Paradox." "The applications of this wonder drug seemed all but limitless."
For its ability to kill bacteria, penicillin was dubbed an "antibiotic." It was available at first without a prescription, and consumers gobbled it up like candy. (Even with prescriptions, "the cult of the antibiotic," as Alexander Tomasz, chief of the microbiology laboratory at Rockefeller University, calls it, continues today.)
But amid the initial euphoria, penicillin's discoverer, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming, urged caution; in a 1945 interview with The New York Times, Fleming warned that misuse of penicillin could lead to the propagation of mutant forms of bacteria that would resist the new miracle drug. Before long, Levy writes, Fleming's predictions came true; an estimated 14 percent of the staphylococcus strains isolated from patients in a London hospital had developed resistance to penicillin by 1946, just three years after the miracle drug was introduced.
In the three decades following the introduction of penicillin, new microbe-killers were discovered, tested and approved for marketing at a phenomenal pace. Streptomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin -- all became staples of the American medicine cabinet. Germs like staphylococcus aureas had never before seemed so vulnerable; by the 1970's, the common wisdom was that the battle of the bugs versus the drugs was over. With more than 100 antibiotics on the pharmacy shelves, the Government de-emphasized bacterial research and the drug industry, sensing a saturated market, shifted resources elsewhere. Bacteriology was passe.
Perhaps no drug is as emblematic of this hubris as Ziracin, a member of a new class of antibiotics called everninomicins. Everninomicins were discovered by scientists at the Schering-Plough Research Institute in the 1960's. From 1979 to 1984, company researchers worked with these antimicrobials, hoping to develop a medicine that could combat staph aureas and other similar microbes. But the effort was abandoned as unnecessary on the theory that no bug could beat vancomyin. "Of course," says Dr. Jean-Jacques Garaud, the company's director of clinical research, "that was pretty arrogant thinking. The bacteria were more creative."
In a report released in May, the Institute of Medicine complained that no nation, including the United States, has an adequate system for monitoring the emergence of these drug-resistant germs. It found that despite public education campaigns to persuade doctors not to prescribe unnecessary drugs, they still do: 20 to 50 percent of the 145 million prescriptions given each year to outpatients are unnecessary, the report found, as are 25 to 45 percent of the 190 million annual doses of antibiotics delivered in the hospital.
In the microbial world, where only the fittest survive, some germs inevitably stumble upon genetic mutations that protect them from the drugs. In the presence of antibiotics, the weak germs -- those that lack these mutations -- die off, leaving only the strong ones to survive and proliferate. The more antibiotics are used and misused, the more these drug-resistant bugs will spread. Moreover, as Lederberg showed decades ago in work that won a Nobel Prize, bacteria essentially talk to one another, exchanging genes -- including drug-resistant genes -- back and forth.
The net effect of this activity is clear: many germs are becoming resistant not only to one drug but to six and seven at a time. The story of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is by now well known. Less familiar is this fact, reported by the Institute of Medicine: more than 90 percent of staph aureas strains are now resistant to penicillin and a wide variety of other antibiotics, including methicillin, the drug that is next to last in the line of defense, before vancomycin. These are not statistics of mere academic interest. In New York City alone, methicillin-resistant staph infections killed 1,409 people in 1995. That is precisely 200 more people than were murdered in the city that year.
As resistance to each antibiotic continued to develop in the mid-1980's, infectious disease experts have been waiting and watching for the last domino to fall: the emergence of staph strains that are resistant to vancomycin.
Perhaps the most wakeful watcher has been Fred C. Tenover, chief of the C.D.C.'s Nosocomial Pathogens Laboratory Branch, the national reference laboratory for hospital-acquired, or nosocomial, infections. Tenover has been anticipating the appearance of vancomycin-resistant staph for years.
In his cinder-block warren of laboratories on the third floor of the disease control centers' headquarters in Atlanta, Tenover analyzes novel microbes sent by scientists from all over the globe. His specialty is antibiotic resistance; if a patient anywhere in the United States has a persistent infection that does not seem to respond to drugs, the bacteria will be packed up in special sealed shipping tubes and sent overnight to Tenover, who can test its susceptibility to a host of different medicines and call the doctor with treatment advice in two to four days.
On Dec. 16, 1996, Tenover received a tip by electronic mail that a Japanese doctor had detected the world's first VISA. "At first, I was skeptical," says the C.D.C. scientist, whose lab had received numerous cultures over the last year purporting to be the long-dreaded VISA strain. "We tested all of them," Tenover says, but none of them had ever been true.
But the scientist who had isolated this strain was Dr. Keiichi Hiramatsu of Juntendo University in Tokyo, one of the most respected bacterial geneticists in Japan. The case, Tenover learned in a subsequent E-mail exchange with Hiramatsu, involved a 4-month old boy who had undergone surgery in May 1996 and developed a staph aureas infection that was resistant to methicillin. His doctors then tried vancomycin, but it didn't work. Hiramatsu tested the bug, classified it as a VISA and sent it to the C.D.C. for verification.
The bug arrived in Atlanta on Jan. 29, 1997. To confirm Hiramatsu's results, Tenover tried to grow the bacteria in a series of tiny test tubes of nutrient-rich solution, each containing a different concentration of vancomycin. The goal was to determine the smallest amount of drug necessary to kill the germ; microbiologists call this level the minimum inhibitory concentration, an important measure of a bacterial strain's virulence. Most staph bugs are wiped out by .25 to .5 micrograms of vancomycin per milliliter of solution.
But at those concentrations, the Japanese bug kept growing; the minimum knockout punch of vancomycin, both Tenover and Hiramatsu discovered, was a whopping 8 micrograms per milliliter -- in other words, 16 to 32 times the normal amount of vancomycin necessary to destroy staph aureas. "This," Tenover mused to himself, "is very new."
By the time Tenover and Hiramatsu published their findings in the July 11, 1997, issue of the C.D.C.'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, another patient, this one in Michigan, had come down with a similar vancomycin-resistant bug. The following month, a third case emerged in New Jersey. Then came the Port Chester strain. Each time, the minimum inhibitory concentration was the same: 8. Authorities in France and England have since reported several more cases, although Tenover has not confirmed them.
Experts have long believed that staph aureas would remain at least partly susceptible to vancomycin until the minimum inhibitory concentration reached a level of 32. That, at least, was the theory. Now that doctors have seen these superbugs in practice, Tenover thinks the figure may need to be adjusted downward. "It could be," he said, "that 8 is as high as an organism needs to go to cause a treatment failure." In other words, full resistance may already be here.
There is no evidence that the four documented VISA strains are linked to one another, although the spread of these bugs, Tenover says, is only a matter of time. That each occurred in highly industrialized, medically advanced nations is probably no accident; while drug-resistant organisms are cropping up all over the world, the problem has been aggravated by countries like the United States where antibiotics are widely used. But antibiotic resistance is a global and social problem. Even if an individual scrupulously follows antibiotic regimens and uses them sparingly, he or she is still vulnerable to resistant strains that have emerged anywhere in the world. And with air travel and international commerce shrinking the global village, no place is safe. "These are international problems," Tomasz says. "The next wave of bugs is just a few days away."
The patients in Japan, Michigan and New Jersey were fortunate; they were treated intensively with a combination of other antibiotics and all survived. The New York detective died of pneumonia and the staph infection, according to the doctor who treated him in the hospital, although the underlying kidney disease was a contributing factor.
Complete resistance looms on the horizon. "Before the end of the decade," says Levy, "we will have fully resistant staph aureas." He does not need to point out that the end of the decade is less than 18 months away.
Drug companies are now pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into new antibiotics; as of 1996, the last time the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America surveyed its members, there were 27 new microbe-killers in the development pipeline.
"The war is not won, as everybody knows," says Richard Colonno, the chief of drug discovery for the infectious diseases division of Bristol-Myers Squibb. "Clearly, the research excitement is now more on the bacterial side." In part, that is a response to the urgent need for new drugs. But it has just as much to do, Colonno says, with the revolution in molecular biology. Now scientists can map the genetic blueprints of bacteria, and those maps provide clues to the weak spots of the bugs.
Colonno's mission at Bristol-Myers, and the mission of countless other drug-company scientists around the nation and the world, is to create an entirely new antibiotic, one that employs different mechanisms to kill microbes than the ones already on the market. Simply adding new drugs to the existing antibiotic arsenal is not good enough; so many different germs have figured out ways to avoid so many different drugs that a whole new class of pharmaceutical agent is needed. "It is the only way," Colonno says, "that we are going to get out of the resistance dilemma." And so the race is on.
The most promising candidates seem to be linezolid from Pharmacia & Upjohn and the once-abandoned Schering-Plough drug, Ziracin. In the early 1990's, the company picked up the project again and Ziracin is now in the late stages of human testing. But bringing a new class of antibiotics to market will take time; even these front-runners are not expected to reach pharmacy shelves until at least the year 2000 or 2001.
In the meantime, it may be left to an experimental drug called Synercid, from the French firm Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, to fill in the gap. Synercid, which is on the verge of receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration, is the first injectible form of a class of antibiotics called streptogramins that are being used in animals but not humans. It was not developed to combat vancomycin-resistant staph, but Tenover, the C.D.C. expert, has tested it against VISA strains in the laboratory and says it seems to work.
But Synercid has its limitations, says Levy. "It has been used in a different form already in animals," he says, "so resistance is already out there. The question is how long it will take before resistance compromises its use."
Perhaps the greatest obstacle to breaking the cyle of resistance may be economic rather than scientific. Drug companies, which are in business to make money, might be expected to market these new antibiotics aggressively, trying to persuade doctors to prescibe them as often as possible. But such rampant prescribing practices create the same problem all over again. Officials at the F.D.A. are wrestling with precisely this paradox. We have to balance drug development with drug use, says Dr. Dianne Murphy, director of one of the F.D.A.'s offices of drug evaluation. And that is a very difficult balance.
As the race to find new drugs proceeds, supermicrobes like the one that infected the New York detective will undoubtedly continue to flourish, leaving a trail of nervous public health officials and grieving families in their wake.
Three days after the former detective died, mourners gathered at a stately stone church in the town of Harrison. On that same day, with utmost secrecy, officials at United Hospital were frantically trying to determine where the vancomycin-resistant staph bug came from and, more important, whether the germ had spread. The unenviable job of getting to the bottom of those questions fell to Ginny McMath, the hospital's infection control official. The name of the detective was familiar to her; she remembered him from a previous admission in January, when he was treated for a staph infection that was resistant to methicillin. He was given vancomycin for several weeks, but the episode earned him an entry into a red loose-leaf binder where McMath carefully catalogues every instance of a drug-resistant strain at the hospital. The case fell under the worrisome category of M.R.S.A. -- methicillin resistant staph aureas.
When Sharon Rotun called with news of the detective's blood tests, McMath was alarmed but not altogether surprised; a 79-year-old man with a history of kidney disease and methicillin-resistant staph, she knew, was the optimal candidate for a VISA strain. "It's sort of like the natural experiment that we would do in the laboratory," explains Tenover, the C.D.C. expert, "except that in this case, the patient is the Petri dish."
McMath immediately began to track down everyone who had contact with the detective in the days before he died. Working with Natarajan, the kidney specialist, she identified 44 people -- dialysis workers, doctors, nurses and family members -- who might have been exposed to the deadly microbe. Each had their nostrils and, in some cases, their hands cultured to see if they were "colonized" with the bug.
Making the notifications was a delicate task. The cause of the detective's death had not been made public, and Natarajan and McMath were careful not to reveal too much. "There's a fear that people won't want to come here," McMath said. It was left to Natarajan to call the detective's family. "I told them that he had a staph infection, but there was a peculiarity and we wanted to see if anybody else had the same type of infection," he said. "I didn't want to cause them any panic."
That instinct -- not to cause panic -- is an understandable one, experts say, but it can also lead to public health problems of its own. Suppressing information about a potentially deadly germ might lead people who have been exposed to it not to take the testing seriously; indeed, Carole's daughter declined at first to be cultured, thinking it was unnecessary.
On April 24, one month to the day after the detective's funeral, Carole was driving to work when she heard a report over the car radio that an elderly dialysis patient in Port Chester had died of a rare staph infection. Her father was not identified, but it did not take much to put two and two together. "I didn't realize how serious a bacteria it was until I heard it on the radio," she said. "It really upset me that they were not more forthcoming."
As it turned out, 14 of the 44 people who were tested were carrying staph aureas. Of the 14, 2 -- a doctor and a patient -- harbored a germ that was resistant to methicillin. Genetic typing conducted by Tenover's lab, however, found that none of these bugs were identical to the one that infected Carole's father. It was an encouraging sign; the deadly bug, it seems, is buried with the detective.
Meanwhile, McMath's investigation, supervised by both state health officials and the C.D.C., quickly established that neither the hospital nor the dialysis center was a problem; Dr. David Ackman, who directs the state's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control, said infection control practices were meticulous at both. Even so, Ackman said: "We were very concerned. We wanted to make sure that there weren't other people carrying this around."
Ackman and other infectious-disease experts no longer view these episodes as isolated incidents; they are more like bullets that are becoming increasingly difficult to dodge. "We were lucky," says Tenover, who has no trouble spinning out scenarios for the near future that are far worse. "The next time it may be somebody who is on an open hospital ward, or maybe they have been in the hospital for several weeks, or been a lot of places before their infection is recognized. Or it might be someone in a nursing home that can spread it among 80 patients, in which case we are going to have a big job on our hands."

HEADLINE: Leaders, Leaders Everywhere

BYLINE: By Polly Morrice; Polly Morrice is writing a book about autism.

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
When I was in college I helped found a literary magazine that had no editors. Actually, two of us were given that title, but it was purely honorific. We held no more sway than anyone else on the staff. As for naming an "editor in chief" -- we were having none of that. It was hierarchical and patriarchal.
Twenty years later, our militant egalitarianism seems not only dated but also quaint, like a typewritten letter. 
 College students in today's boom economy show little interest in sharing the glory. Instead, like their elders in business, government and academia, they have embraced the cult of leadership.
The Internet currently lists nearly 5,000 matches for "leadership programs." They range from the University of Minnesota's Leaderquest, which "strives to develop student understanding and application of leadership theory and practice," to the programs offered at the Banff Center for Management in Canada, where "senior leaders . . . explore their leadership styles and requisite competencies, focusing on managing change and re-engineering processes."
The skills are described so nebulously that they could apply to working the cash register, but never mind: soggy, directionless prose is a hallmark of leadership mania. Your 1990's big shot would never do anything so point-A-to-point-B as, say, cross the Rubicon. She is much more likely to create value in an increasingly technoglobal society through outcomes-based decision making.
The most depressing aspect of this woolly hierarchy-speak is how it has seeped out of the world of business and management -- where you might expect it -- and into daily life. Parents who agree to organize the P.T.A. carnival are no longer good-natured helpers, but "volunteer leadership." Youngsters seeking summer jobs at the pool prepare themselves through courses in "Lifeguarding and Leadership"; their athletic peers don shoulder pads and jog off to "Football and Leadership" camp.
All this attention to life at the top begs a number of questions. As Garry Wills notes in his book, "Certain Trumpets: The Call of Leaders," published in 1994, "The ideal seems to be a world in which everyone is a leader -- but who would be left for them to be leading?"
The assumption that meaningful existence occurs only at the summit, preferably a corporate one, ignores how many endeavors (writing, painting, software design, among others) require the ability to work in solitude rather than command a platoon. And it undercuts the importance of essential nuts-and-bolts jobs like teaching, nursing and playing backup at a recording session. Finally, as Mr. Wills also points out, nobody assumes leadership unless others agree to become followers.
The truth is that the majority of us end up as members in good standing of the hoi polloi. Leadership courses notwithstanding, most recent college graduates don't step right into the corner office. Many never will, despite the injunction (repeated this spring by every college president in America) that they are the leaders of tomorrow, the rulers of all they survey.
At last the suspicion dawns that leadership is not what it used to be. It's no longer crossing the Rubicon, or even the street. Once you read the fine print, some of the university leadership programs boil down to teaching students to get along with other people, to use their time wisely and to try to grow up. An acceptance of conformity -- of going along to get along -- can be assumed. Doubtless, the popularity of these programs speaks to the same urge for security that has today's collegians flocking to study subjects that promise a comfortable financial return.
Compared with the play-it-safe attitudes of these future leaders, the idealism of my fellow college literati seems admirable, in a confused way. We managed to publish our magazine only twice. It could have been a lot better, too, especially if somebody had taken charge.
But our reticence has its own nostalgic value, as a relic of a time when people were willing to act, instead of wanting only to direct.

HEADLINE: Bringing China on Line (With Official Blessing)

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Peter Yip is not shy about his ambitions. As he steers a visitor through the bustling offices of the China Internet Corporation here, Mr. Yip describes how his company will be a catalyst for bringing the Internet to China and its 1.2 billion people.
Employees are busy collecting news dispatches from Reuters and Bloomberg, which they send to Beijing to be translated into Chinese. Later, China Internet will post the material on its service, where anyone in China with a computer and the $30-a-month subscription fee can log on to a world of Western news. 
 "The Chinese Government recognizes that the Internet is a global thing," said Mr. Yip, 43, the vice chairman of the company, which is based in Hong Kong and backed by the official New China News Agency -- not to mention an impressive array of American technology companies. "That's why they've established a strategy and asked me to help them create a vehicle to allow people to participate."
It is that kind of pronouncement that makes Mr. Yip's rivals seethe. They say China Internet, known as C.I.C., is only one of dozens of companies throughout the country that are racing to put China on line. In China, as in the United States, the Internet seems to be growing too rapidly -- and in too helter-skelter a way -- for any single company to mastermind its development.
"Because the Internet has taken China by storm, there are very different proposals about how to develop it," said Don Xia, chief executive of Unicom Media, a Hong Kong company that is developing Internet services for China Unicom, one of the country's two main telephone companies.
To Mr. Xia and others here, the debate is whether China's Internet should be open or closed; raw or edited, anarchic or controlled. Mr. Yip's company, they say, represents a more controlled, Government-directed approach. At the same time, hundreds of small-time entrepreneurs, most of whom lack China Internet's financial backing or political connections, are laboring to build a truly free Internet.
"C.I.C. is out of step with what Internet users in China are about," said Duncan Clark, managing director of BD Associates, a telecommunications consulting firm in Beijing. "I think companies that make deals with them are actually doing themselves a disservice."
The American companies that have made investments in China Internet, or formed other kinds of partnerships with Mr. Yip, include America Online, Bay Networks, Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems. And whatever the controversy that Mr. Yip may arouse, the success of his sales pitch is proof that a Chinese Internet is no longer just a utopian vision, but a ripe opportunity for sharp-eyed entrepreneurs.
According to the latest Government statistics, 1.18 million people are using the Internet in mainland China -- nearly double the number last October. While cyberspace is still largely the preserve of 20-something men, it is growing beyond its roots as a tool for academics. Nearly 80 percent of those surveyed said they had bought merchandise over the Internet, and many said they used it for information about entertainment, sports and business.
After much hand-wringing, Beijing seems to have decided that the benefits of the Internet outweigh its dangers. Although it still filters the content of the World Wide Web through central computers -- and periodically blocks access to Web sites such as those of Western news providers like CNN and The New York Times -- Beijing is also upgrading China's network to carry more data, and it has licensed more than 30 companies to offer Internet access.
"The Chinese see the Internet as the savior of their economy," said Kenneth Farrall, a Web site designer who lives in Xiamen, in southeastern China, and is starting an Internet consulting firm. "My impression is that the people blocking Web sites are paying lip service to the old guard in Beijing."
Yet for all the talk about openness, Internet executives here say the Government is still drawn to the idea of creating a vast intranet within the country. Such a network could tap the Web's riches but remain walled off from features deemed subversive -- like pornographic sites, postings from dissidents or anything about Taiwan or Tibet.
China Internet's model is tailor made for this approach. The company, which was started in 1994, operates a proprietary news service called China Wide Web, which has about 1,000 subscribers. For a fee of $30 to $340 a month, depending on the level of service, subscribers receive stock quotations and news from the New China News Agency, Reuters, Bloomberg, the Nikkei wire service and Agence France-Presse. But they cannot gain Web access because the service does not have an Internet connection. By contrast, the majority of people in China who use a dial-up service to get Web access pay a monthly fee of roughly $68 for unlimited use, plus access charges amounting to 50 cents an hour.
Mr. Yip said his long-term goal was to turn the China Wide Web into a Chinese version of the World Wide Web, a vast consumer marketplace with Chinese-language information and entertainment. He said the lack of such content was the biggest hurdle to Internet growth here.
"If you're in New York and you get on the Web, and everything coming at you is in Arabic, you're not going to stay on all that long," said Mr. Yip, who lived in the United States for 20 years and speaks rapid-fire English.
Another analogy for the China Wide Web may be America Online, a subscription-based service that organizes material in a form more digestible than on the Internet. Unsurprisingly, China Internet has a partnership with America Online, in which the companies are developing a Hong Kong version of America Online service.
Mr. Yip's competitors point out that America Online has a link to the World Wide Web, while the China Wide Web does not -- which keeps the Internet's less acceptable material out of the country. "The China Wide Web is an attempt to create a Web that is isolated from the Net," Mr. Clark of BD Associates said. "We're kind of past that already."
Mr. Yip acknowledged that the China Wide Web's lack of an Internet connection was a weakness. But he said it was for financial, not political, reasons: the dominant phone company, China Telecom, had set access fees too high. Unless the Government broke up China Telecom's virtual phone monopoly, it would make no sense to offer Internet access.
China Internet's close ties to the New China News Agency mean other restrictions. The agency has several editors in the company's offices who sift through dispatches from the Western services and pull any that run afoul of laws barring the distribution of political news about Taiwan or Tibet. "We're relying on Xinhua to interpret Chinese law and insure that we don't stray," Mr. Yip said, using the press agency's Chinese name.
So far, China Internet has skirted trouble by sticking to less controversial business and financial news. Its other products include inoffensive features like a Chinese-language site about the World Cup and one about the film star Bruce Lee. But Mr. Yip said that merely by distributing Western news, China Internet was doing its part to open the country.
Mr. Yip, who started and sold several technology companies in the United States before returning to his native Hong Kong in 1989, said the industry's hostility reflected envy at his success in attracting partners and frustration that most companies are still losing money on the Internet.
Indeed, by most yardsticks China Internet would not seem that big a threat. It has fewer subscribers than many of China's struggling Internet-access providers. It has less than $10 million in revenue and is losing money, although Mr. Yip said he expected annual revenue to exceed $25 million in 12 months. And a much-publicized joint venture with Pointcast, the leading purveyor of "push" technology on the Internet, fell apart because of financial disagreements.
Still, Mr. Yip has raised $25 million from investors, and he has turned China Internet into the first stop for technology companies seeking to capitalize on Internet growth.
Some rivals said China Internet represented the triumph of salesmanship over substance. "It's like a Hong Kong-style newspaper," said Edward Zeng, chief executive of Unicom-Sparkice, another Internet venture backed by China Unicom. "It's different than a Western-style newspaper. There's more promotion."
Mr. Yip said he was wounded by the criticism. He said he had sought to build bridges to the younger entrepreneurs, even introducing some to executives or venture capitalists in the United States. "I don't want to be perceived as Big Brother, trying to control the Internet," he said with a sigh.

HEADLINE: Patents;
An appeals court says a mathematical formula can be patented, if it is a moneymaker.

BYLINE: By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
IMAGINE that Albert Einstein were alive today and that he were just now formulating his theory of relativity. Could he get a patent on E=mc2 ?
Some patent experts contend Mr. Einstein just might be able to, thanks to a recent ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. 
 The case in question -- State Street Bank and Trust Company v. Signature Financial Group -- had nothing to do with physics. Rather, at issue was a patent for a data-processing system for a so-called hub-and-spoke mutual fund partnership in which mutual funds pool their assets in an investment portfolio.
The appeals court's ruling has been long awaited by financial services companies, which have resisted the idea that innovative approaches in their industry should be patented. Indeed, Visa and Mastercard filed an amicus brief in the case saying that they were doing just fine without patents, thank you.
But to no avail. The appeals court ruled on July 23 in favor of Signature Financial, upholding its patent.
In its ruling, the court said, "We hold the transformation of data, representing discrete dollar amounts, by a machine through a series of mathematical calculations into a final share price, constitutes a practical application of a mathematical algorithm, formula, or calculation, because it produces 'a useful, concrete, and tangible result.' "
Translation: If your mathematical formula has a practical end, you can probably patent it.
"I believe this is going to cause a surge in patents relating to financial instruments," said Peter A. Roberts, chief executive of College Savings Bank of Princeton, N.J., who in 1988 received a pioneering patent for a computerized prepaid tuition program.
Some patent experts suggested that such an interpretation might have allowed Michael R. Milken, for example, to have patented the idea of junk bonds back in the 1980's.
But the ruling may have even wider implications.
E. Robert Yoches, a partner with the law firm of Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner in Washington, said he thought the appeals court had made the right decision in the case. But he said the court had gone further than expected in its ruling.
"This is very broad, very sweeping," Mr. Yoches said. "You can probably get a patent on anything as long as it's not purely mathematical -- as long as it produces a concrete, tangible result."
The ruling seems to bolster software patenting guidelines issued three years ago by the Patent and Trademark Office, which expanded the definition of what kinds of software are patentable.
The last time the Supreme Court ruled in this area was in 1981, in the case of Diamond v. Diehr. Then the court held that three categories of matter are unpatentable: laws of nature, natural phenomena and abstract ideas.
Since then, the appeals court, which is the highest patent court in the land short of the Supreme Court, has deviated from this interpretation in a series of rulings.
"The direction the Federal Circuit has been moving is to say you can patent anything as long as it's economically valuable," said Richard H. Stern, who teaches computer patent law at George Washington University.
Stanley Amberg, a patent attorney in New York, said the appeals court had gone too far with the State Street ruling. "The Federal Circuit has crossed over a critical line, and now holds eligible for patent protection any computer-implemented math equation in which the input are numbers and the output are numbers," he said.
"Thus, if Einstein were alive and now uncovered the E = mc2 law of nature, he could effectively monopolize its use in the design of atomic reactors, bombs, et cetera," Mr. Amberg said. "Because, for all practical purposes, a computer must be used to perform the calculation of the amount of energy released."
 
Cutting Paper Use On the Exchange Floor
Despite the advent of cell phones and headsets and special electronic orders, most large buy and sell orders on the New York Stock Exchange still involve paper transactions.
The Papyrus Technology Corporation in New York has patented a system using handheld devices that allow floor brokers to receive and execute orders electronically.
"The floor broker enters information into the device as the order is being filled," said L. Thomas Patterson Jr., one of the inventors. "This takes the paper out of the whole process."
The exchange has developed its own handheld electronic device, which it recently introduced and which is being used by a small number of brokers. Mr. Patterson declined to comment on whether he thought the exchange's devices infringed his patent.
Mr. Patterson, Desmond Sean O'Neill and Stephen Tyler Carroll received patent 5,774,877, which is assigned to Papyrus Technology.

HEADLINE: Loud, Scurrilous and Poised to Win a Democratic Nomination for Governor

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 30

 BODY:
Before jumping into the race for the Democratic nomination for governor, Geoffrey Fieger was best known as the lawyer for Jack Kevorkian, the suicide doctor.
Now he is known as a politician who hurls insults like Thor does his hammer. A millionaire lawyer in a state that prizes the lunch-bucket ethic, he has never held political office. Worse yet, he has been seen driving a Swedish-made car on the streets of Motor City. 
 And he is winning, much to the horror of the Democratic Party and leaders of the United Auto Workers.
Mr. Fieger, who leads in opinion polls in Tuesday's contest over two more conventional politicians, Larry Owen and Doug Ross, cannot wait to throw insults at Gov. John Engler, Republican.
He has characterized the Governor as racist, a moron, a liar, fat and effeminate. "Dumber than Dan Quayle and twice as ugly," Mr. Fieger said about the Governor one recent morning, then stopped to chuckle. A brash populist, Mr. Fieger has taken the lead largely by building support among black voters in Detroit, who like his irreverent style and unvarnished talk about racism. As a lawyer, he has won some high-profile civil rights cases for blacks. And he talks loudly and proudly about his father's work on behalf of blacks as a Freedom Rider in the segregated South.
"With his no-holds-barred style, he reminds many African-Americans of Coleman Young," said Mario Morrow, a political consultant, referring to the first black mayor of Detroit. "And Fieger's got this tree-trunk of anger on his shoulder, which resonates among people who feel disenfranchised by the system."
The candidate favored by the auto workers union, Larry Owen, a wealthy lawyer and former mayor of East Lansing, has been desperately trying to court black voters. Earlier this week, he broke with Michigan tradition and named his running mate for Lieutenant Governor, Teola Hunter, a black woman who is clerk of Wayne County.
Mr. Owen has been compared with the former Presidential candidate Walter F. Mondale, a Democrat who has positions that labor and liberals find impeccable, but who has little charisma. Political analysts say it is unclear how the selection of a black running mate will play: it could win the support of black voters, but it could also backfire as a transparent political move.
While Mr. Fieger is in the lead among blacks in Detroit, Mr. Owen has had more success in the industrial I-75 corridor, which extends north to Saginaw.
Mr. Ross, meanwhile, a former Labor Department official in the Clinton Administration, is known as a pin-striped, businesslike politician with a voice of moderation. He does best with voters in the middle-class suburbs of Detroit, and in the western reaches of the state.
But whomever the Democrats pick on Tuesday, the campaign to unseat Governor Engler will surely be uphill sledding. Mr. Engler, who fits the socially moderate, pro-business profile that voters in many states have been choosing as governors in recent years, rides a robust economy in Michigan.
A decade ago, this state had the highest unemployment rate in the nation. Now the jobless rate in Michigan ranks among the lowest of the big states, at least before the recently settled auto workers strike.
Democrats will try to make political hay of Mr. Engler's reneging on his campaign promise to serve only two terms by running for a third, but a prosperous economy tends to make voters very forgiving.
While polls show that Mr. Engler would have a sizable lead against any of the Democratic candidates, he does best against the Democratic front-runner, Mr. Fieger.
"John Engler and the Republican Party are licking their chops waiting for Geoffrey Fieger," said Mr. Morrow, noting that Mr. Fieger's brash, take-no-prisoners style would seem unlikely to attract the conservative and moderate voters needed to win a general election.
While Mr. Fieger's prominence initially stemmed from his ties to Dr. Kevorkian, the Democratic candidate has kept his distance from the physician during the campaign.
Instead, Mr. Fieger has focused on the plight of poor Detroiters, saying he would revitalize the city's neighborhoods by imposing tariffs on developers who build on open land in the suburbs.
A big man with longish hair and a whiter-than-white smile, Mr. Fieger dropped in at a recent picnic for the elderly on the shores of the Detroit River, looking more Hollywood than politician, wearing a white T-shirt and a blue blazer. He kissed and hugged virtually every woman at the picnic, and talked hip with teen-agers.
But in an interview moments later, Mr. Fieger angrily denounced Governor Engler in personal terms, questioned the mental health of a Detroit editorial writer and fairly shouted profanities about a local political consultant.
"He is a loose cannon," Mr. Morrow said. "The Republicans would like to portray him as a lunatic, except that he's rich. When you're rich, you know, you're just eccentric."

HEADLINE: Bulgaria Becomes a Weapons Bazaar

SERIES: A WORLD OF ARMS: Suppliers of Choice

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria

 BODY:
Once the renowned supplier of weapons for the Soviet Union, this Balkan country has become the arms bazaar for rebels and terrorist organizations of every political, ethnic and religious persuasion, Western officials and experts in the small arms trade say.
Secret weapons shipments have gone to rebel groups forming in Congo, threatening another outbreak of war there; to rebels in Angola, who are preparing to take up their war anew there, and to Eritrea, adding to Washington's fears about the escalation of fighting in the Horn of Africa. And that is just in the last few months. Other arms shoppers have included the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka, a group Washington says is a terrorist organization, and the Hutu militia, who were responsible for mass killings in Rwanda. 
 If the Bulgarian arms traffic were shut down or cleaned up, the supply of weapons fueling regional wars would be significantly reduced, intelligence and industry experts say.
But Washington and the European Union, while voicing concern, have done little to stop the trade, diplomats from several nations said.
Indeed, both Europe and the United States have put more diplomatic muscle into getting the Bulgarian Government to shut down the production of pirate compact disks thanks to pressure from business groups, diplomats said. By contrast, they noted, there is no business lobby calling for a crackdown on Bulgaria's arms makers.
"We don't regard it as a subject on which to make a fuss," a Western Ambassador said, slightly chagrined.
The big attraction in Bulgaria is the Kalashnikov assault rifle. Light, durable and easy to maintain, it is ideal for young soldiers slogging through jungles or trekking up mountains. And Bulgaria makes the best. Having lost their traditional cold war markets, Bulgaria's arms manufacturers are desperate for customers, whom they have accommodated with false shipping documents to disguise both the buyer and the destination of the weapons.
Bulgaria's major arms suppliers declined to be interviewed. Government officials denied that the country has become a major center for illicit arms trafficking, as American and European officials maintain.
"The official Government policy is directed at restraining such activities," said Vladimir Tourtansky, a senior official in Bulgaria's Cabinet-level Council on Defense Industry and Logistics.
Advocates for greater controls on small-arms trade point out that so-called small arms and light weapons -- assault rifles, grenades, mortars -- have caused more death and destruction in the last 50 years than nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, which are the objects of international alarm and controls.
Bulgaria is not the only place where rebels and rogues shop. Arms manufacturers in Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania and Belarus are also major suppliers of weapons.
But at the moment, Bulgarian arms are the weapons of choice.
At the center of the trade are Kintex, the state marketing agency, and Arsenal, the country's largest arms manufacturer, which is also state-owned.
Founded by Bulgaria's secret police in the 1960's, Kintex has a history of dubious arms trading. During the Iran-Iraq war, the company sold to both sides.
Kintex "offers so many models of Kalashnikov assault rifles" that Jane's Infantry Weapons, the industry's authoritative guide, feels compelled to provide a summary. Altogether, Jane's lists 16 Bulgarian models, from the AKT-47, a training version of the original AK-47, to the AK-74, the latest version of the assault rifle, which was designed 50 years ago by Mikhail T. Kalashnikov for the Soviet Army.
All are made by Arsenal. Bulgarian officials boast that Mr. Kalashnikov has said Arsenal makes the highest quality Kalashnikov today. The company also manufactures the 9-millimeter Makarov pistol, which is often in the crates of weapons clandestinely shipped from here.
Kintex and Arsenal denied several requests for interviews.
Arsenal and Kintex, along with other Bulgarian weapons companies, are still largely in the hands of the men who ran them during the Communist days. In doing business today, they make use of the expertise and contacts they developed when Bulgaria handled Moscow's clients, including Libya, Iraq and Iran, and many African governments or guerrilla groups.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Bulgaria lost those secondary markets, as well as the Warsaw Pact. Struggling to survive economically has caused the companies to engage in shady practices, diplomats said.
"Their attitude toward the small arms trade is: We know we shouldn't but we can't afford not to," a European diplomat said.
An Asian diplomat put it this way: "If you can't sell to the Soviet Union, if you can't sell to the Warsaw Pact, if you can't sell to Iran, Iraq, Libya, what do you do?"
"They need capital," he went on. "So I suppose they don't look too closely at end-user certificates." That refers to the document that is supposed to identify the ultimate destination of the weapons.
A few months ago, acting for a British mercenary army, Arsenal shipped 35 tons of weapons for rebels in Sierre Leone, using documents that said they were going to Nigeria. In a deal for of 77 tons of Kalashnikovs and other weapons, air-dropped to a violent religious sect in India two years ago, Arsenal used phony documents saying they were going to the Bangladesh Defense Ministry.
Western and Asian diplomats said that the current Bulgarian Government, which came to power last year, was trying more than previous post-Communist Governments to curb shady arms practices, but that it was constrained by the country's economic needs and the influence of the military industry.
Mr. Tourtansky said he was not aware of any arms company that has been punished for using false documents. He added, however, that Bulgaria's arms sales policies "are in line with all international standards and norms." He stressed that Bulgaria was complying with the so-called Wassenaar Arrangement.
Pushed by the Clinton Administration, the Wassenaar accord -- named after the Dutch city where it was signed three years ago -- is aimed at controlling exports of conventional weapons and so-called dual-use goods, like computers and telecommunications equipment, to countries like Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea.
But Wassenaar, which has 33 member-nations, does not deal with illicit trade and does not require reporting on sales of Kalashnikovs and other small arms, American officials said.
The most comprehensive report on arms sales is published annually by the United Nations. But it covers only heavy weapons, like tanks, warships and combat aircraft. Assault rifles, mortars, rocket launchers and other light weapons are not included.
International policies like these allow Mr. Tourtansky to say with accuracy, "We are not required to report to anyone about our international sales."
The series is examining the spread of arms around the world. Previous articles explored how various rebel groups obtained their weapons.

Connecticut Politics -- It Isn't Brain Surgery

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
Connecticut used to be known as "The Land of Steady Habits," but that was before an ad agency came up with "Connecticut, We're Full of Surprises." The earlier nickname was better. While it is true that the state did go through a disquieting period when large structures were collapsing left and right -- a hotel here, a bridge there -- it really does not like all that much excitement. I covered the capitol for a long time, and the only surprise I can remember was the day the State Senate, caught in a violent battle between fans of the deer and fans of the whale, dyspeptically voted to name the human being official state animal.
Connecticut's incumbent Governor, John Rowland, a Republican, may be familiar to out-of-state residents for his starring role in tourism promotion commercials. (Americans who plan their vacations on the basis of the local elected officials' affinity for water sports will remember that Mr. Rowland is the one in the canoe with his wife, while New York's George Pataki was the guy teaching a little boy to fish.) Mr. Rowland's opponent this fall will be Representative Barbara Kennelly of Hartford. As surprises go, it was at least a bit of one that she would give up her very safe seat to make the run. 
 "You've virtually got to have a lobotomy, and you could still get re-elected if the economy's good if you're the governor," said Bill Clinton at a Kennelly fund-raiser.
It was hardly a remark designed to bring the party faithful to their feet cheering. "He was just having too good a time," said someone who sat with the President at the $5,000-a-plate luncheon catered by Martha Stewart. Mr. Clinton caught himself in time to assure the crowd that he was not trying to suggest that John Rowland had had a lobotomy. But he obviously did mean that Barbara Kennelly would have a tough time winning even if surgeons disconnected the frontal lobe of the Governor's cerebrum between now and November. The President couched this as a tribute to Mrs. Kennelly's political courage, but it was pretty dispiriting all the same.
Mr. Rowland has been talking a lot about cities and schools and doling out tax cuts, but it is not as if there is nothing to carp about. Like New York, Connecticut's economic upturn is lagging behind the nation's, and the state labors under a disproportionate amount of debt.
"We have no economic development strategy. Where we've given publicly subsidized economic development aid, 86 percent of the jobs never materialized," said Bill Curry, who ran against Mr. Rowland in 1994. Mr. Curry, who obsessed with policy, wanted to try again this year, but party elders seemed to feel voters would prefer Mrs. Kennelly's warm persona to an analysis of Mr. Rowland's privatization initiatives.
But the Congresswoman, having made the jump, seemed to sink like a stone. She turned out to be a terrible speechmaker, as well as a teller of truths who grimly assured reporters that yes, the polls did matter. Deconstructing Mr. Rowland's administration began to look like a better idea, and a former state legislator who is known as a policy whiz was grafted onto the ticket as the candidate for lieutenant governor.
Hillary Clinton, making a local visit, told Mrs. Kennelly's staff to keep her away from big speaking engagements and get her in close to the voters, where she is most impressive. At the Martha Stewart lunch, someone complimented the President on his wife's knowledge of Connecticut politics. "We've been talking about this race," said Mr. Clinton, launching into a dissection of local politics. You would have thought that he came from the Lower Naugatuck Valley. Then the greatest campaigner of our generation walked up to the dais and delivered the lobotomy speech.

Castro Arrives on Grenada Calling for Stronger Ties
The Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, arrived on Grenada, nearly 15 years after American troops landed there and expelled a militarized Cuban brigade that was building an airport. Mr. Castro, who received cheers and a 21-gun salute, said he was eager to deepen relations with Grenada and unveiled a plaque thanking Cuba for helping build the airport. A1
 
Fall of a Chinese Mob Ring
After a series of brazen robberies, murders and kidnappings, a Chinese mob ring was disbanded last week by China's national police. The gang's downfall is the latest chapter in the curious evolution of lawlessness in southern China, where organized crime flourished in step with the economy in the 1990's. A1 

Palestinians Demand Progress
Senior Palestinian officials said that they were prepared to pull out of peace talks unless Israel quickly showed a willingness to consider new options. Talks scheduled for today may be the last meeting, an official said, if Israel continues to resist an American-backed plan calling for a withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank.

Officials on the island of Sakhalin in Russia's far east announced that as a result of a coal miners' protest, they might have to cut off electricity for 24 hours to all but essential users. Coal miners have held sit-ins, marched and blocked rail lines for months complaining that the Government, a shareholder in many mines, owes them back wages. A3
 
110 Killed in Rwanda Attacks
Hutu rebels armed with machetes and clubs killed at least 110 people in attacks northwest of the Rwandan capital, Kigali, an army commander said. The attacks occurred on Friday, but were not reported until Sunday, the official said. Last month the rebels, some of them former soldiers of the previous Government, killed 34 people on a main road between the capital and the northwest. (AP)
 
Italy Jails Suspected Mobster
The Italian police said they captured a suspected mobster wanted for about 40 killings resulting from a feud between Naples-area crime clans.

Clinton Urged to Give Accounting of Relationship
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said that President Clinton should "pour his heart out" to the American people about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, and that by doing so he could take the steam out of any possible drive to impeach him. Democrats too were beginning to suggest that some sort of public accounting from the President would be useful. A1
 
Pressure Over Crime Statistics
Police officials around the nation are concerned that the sharp drop in crime in recent years has brought new pressure on police departments to show ever-decreasing crime statistics and might be behind incidents in which commanders have manipulated crime data. So far this year, there have been charges of falsely reporting crime statistics in Philadelphia, New York, Atlanta and Boca Raton, Fla., resulting in the resignation or demotion of high-ranking police commanders.

Search for Fugitives Is Futile
Two months after two men who are wanted in the deaths of two police officers disappeared into the vast no man's land known as the Four Corners, the authorities do not know whether the men are dead, in hiding or enjoying life in Mexico. Even using devices like infrared cameras, night-vision scopes and motion detectors in the red-rock canyons and mesas, searchers have come up empty-handed. "If you know the territory, you can survive," said Duane A. Smith, a western history professor. A10

A Change in Prison Use
In a significant change in how New York State uses its clogged prisons, the Pataki administration has quietly been pursuing a strategy of releasing nonviolent felons, mostly into drug treatment, while increasingly denying parole for violent felons.

HEADLINE: As Doctors Trade Shingle For Marquee, Cries of Woe

SERIES: AFTER THE REVOLUTION: The Doctors

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: PLACERVILLE, Calif.

 BODY:
It has been 22 years since a young pediatrician named Earl R. Washburn 3d hung his shingle in this rustic old gold-mining town in the foothills of the Sierras. There were no pediatricians in Placerville back then; with fewer than 7,000 people, there was not even a McDonald's.
But the town, with its towering pines and firs, charming turn-of-the-century cottages and proximity to the state capital, Sacramento, seemed a fine place to set up practice and raise a family. And Dr. Washburn, fresh out of residency with a wife and 15-month-old son, had very definite ideas on how to do both. 
 Antibiotics would not be casually prescribed, especially not to infants. Immunizations were essential; parents who opposed vaccination could find another doctor. Prospective partners -- there are now four partners and one associate in the El Dorado Pediatrics Medical Group -- were told they would not get rich, but neither would they miss their children's soccer games.
The goal, says Dr. Jeffrey Rabinovitz, who joined Dr. Washburn in 1977, was this: "You take care of your patients, and your family."
Achieving that goal meant staying independent. But over the last five years, as managed care has transformed American medicine, the independence of doctors has often been the first thing to go.
Last year, 92 percent of the nation's physicians had some type of managed-care contract, according to the American Medical Association. "Capitated" contracts, which pay a set fee for each patient, accounted for one-third of the average doctor's salary. Five years earlier, capitation was barely a blip on the medical association's radar screen, so negligible that the organization did not bother keeping tabs on it.
As the free market has achieved what President Clinton's ill-fated health-care overhaul proposal could not -- increased efficiency and lower costs -- doctors have learned to cope with burdensome paperwork, discounted fees and insurance company restrictions on the specialists they refer to and the drugs they prescribe.
But what troubles them most, it seems, are the intangibles that have been lost, the cherished traditions that Dr. Washburn and his colleagues still dream of fulfilling: building their own practice on their own terms; forging a bond with patients that lasts through the years, no matter which insurance company pays the bills.
"Compare the Marcus Welby type of doctor that existed up until 10 years ago," said Dr. Alan Hillman, director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, "where a doctor owns his or her own practice, sets his or her own rates, practices his or her own style of medicine. Now you have doctors subject to outside management, most doctors being employees of an organization or highly managed. The loss of autonomy and control is astounding. The doctors are battered."
Battered is precisely how Dr. Washburn and his colleagues in Placerville feel. Like doctors across the nation, they have been swept up in a roiling wave of medical mergers and acquisitions. Physicians who once had 2 partners now have 200. Others have sold their practices outright, trading patient charts for cash payments and employee status at hospitals, H.M.O.'s or "physician practice management" firms. In 1997, the medical association reports, 43 percent of the nation's physicians -- excluding those in training, Federal employees and those who did not see patients -- worked for someone else, up from 24 percent in 1983.
While the buying and selling frenzy appears to finally be abating, perhaps nowhere has it been as furious as in the region surrounding Sacramento. Known as the managed-care capital of America because 90 percent of all insured people are enrolled in health maintenance organizations, California's capital city is "the chaotic extreme of a generally turbulent marketplace," said Dr. James C. Robinson, a professor of health economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
That turbulence nearly put El Dorado Pediatrics out of business. In the last two years, Dr. Washburn and his partners have watched as big medical groups have gobbled up smaller practices like their own, and then dismissed some doctors while keeping their patients. Resisting offers to sell, they nonetheless affiliated their practice with one such company, only to watch it drown in red ink. When that firm was sold, Dr. Washburn said, the new owner, FPA Medical Management Inc., stopped payment for patient visits. After five months, the pediatricians were owed $86,000.
"We were desperate," he said, "down to our last 58 cents." The dispute was eventually settled, but now Dr. Washburn's group has a new worry: FPA, which administers the Placerville pediatricians' largest health care contract, accounting for a third of their patients, filed for bankruptcy on July 19.
"It's like some science fiction story, a parallel universe," Dr. Washburn said, "where they keep switching you from one universe to the next with a new set of rules. In about the time you figure out how to make the universe work, it changes again."
The tumult has taken its toll. With doctors losing jobs and patients, there is intense competition for work. Collegiality is all but gone, said Bill Sandberg, executive director of the Sacramento-El Dorado Medical Society. "It's been a bloody war," he said. "All we have had is unpredictability, chaos and crisis."
Amid the chaos, medicine's elite have learned an ego-bruising lesson: They could not count on their patients. Given a choice between loyalty to a longtime doctor and cheaper medical care, the patient will choose to pay less. Dr. Washburn, the pediatrician, has seen this from both sides; he is recovering from colorectal cancer, and recently switched primary care physicians because his doctor left his health plan.
Managed care, he said, worked wonderfully for him; he never even saw a bill, and estimated that he paid no more than $100 for $250,000 worth of medical care. "But," he added, "everybody who took care of me lost money on me."
 
The Practice
Four Doctors Cling To Independence
The hilly two-lane road that leads to the El Dorado Pediatrics Medical Group stretches south from California's Route 50, past a string of auto body shops, the local fruit growers association and a church. Dr. Washburn and his colleagues work out of a low-slung stucco building the color of caramel, tucked unobtrusively behind a split-rail fence.
Inside, the office is old-fashioned, with hand-painted murals in each examining room that feature barnyard scenes and grassy fields of blue lupine, astronauts and even an Egyptian tableau. Dr. Washburn is a tall, slender 51-year-old with big square glasses, a soft-spoken man who reads philosophy in his spare time.
The story of the Placerville pediatricians' foray into the high-stakes world of mergers and managed care is a tale of miscalculations and dashed hopes. It began in 1993, when Foundation Health Corporation, then the second-largest health maintenance organization in Sacramento, decided to create a separate practice management company so that it could funnel its own patients to its own doctors.
The new company quickly bought the practices of 100 Northern California doctors, most of them primary care physicians, said Kurt Davis, a former Foundation Health vice president. At the same time, it invested millions in building a dozen state-of-the-art clinics, including one in Placerville measuring 25,000 square feet and with enough space for 12 doctors. "We dove in full blast," Mr. Davis said. Dr. Washburn, meanwhile, gave the new clinic a nickname: "the Taj Mahal."
El Dorado Pediatrics was courted heavily by the new group. At a time when the price of a doctor's practice was plummeting, Dr. Washburn said, he and his colleagues were offered "a generous buyout," along with salaries of nearly twice what they were earning and a three-year guarantee that they would not be dismissed.
To Dr. Washburn, it sounded promising. He is not, by his own account, a wealthy man. He bought a new Subaru this spring, a step up from his old 1990 Ford Taurus, and said he has never made more than $100,000 a year; the American doctor on average now makes $200,000 a year, according to the American Medical Association. At the same time, Dr. Washburn was cautious.
"I'd be delighted to make more money," he said. "There's always things to spend it on. But in this practice we are very careful about balancing our social and personal needs with the needs of making money."
That means that when a doctor needs time off, as Dr. Washburn did during his cancer treatment, the others pitch in without complaint. And it means they practice as they see fit. When a mother who lacked insurance brought her son in for a sprained thumb on a recent day, Dr. Rabinovitz waived the fee. When that same day Dr. Washburn evaluated a high school boy for attention deficit disorder, he patiently questioned the boy for 60 minutes. "If we need an hour," said Dr. Ulrich Hacker, another partner, "we take an hour."
A for-profit company, the group worried, would undoubtedly interfere with that freedom. But when it came to a vote, they split down the middle. Drs. Washburn and Hacker wanted to stay. Dr. Rabinovitz and Dr. Linda Eldred, the fourth partner, wanted to go. In the end, they decided to decline rather than split up.
What they wound up with seemed even better: a lucrative five-year contract in which they became Foundation Health's first and only "associate medical practice." The agreement called for El Dorado Pediatrics to see as many patients as Foundation could provide, a risky proposition, since doctors do not like to depend too heavily on one health plan. In return, Foundation would pay the doctors 100 percent of what they billed.
In this era of heavily discounted medicine, such an arrangement was unheard of. But Placerville had just one other pediatrician, and he was fresh out of training. Foundation needed El Dorado Pediatrics. "We were in hog heaven," Dr. Washburn said.
 
The Corporation
A Deal Too Good To Be True, Was
The euphoria did not last. Before long, the Foundation medical group was "losing just tons of money," said Mr. Davis, the former company spokesman. The fancy clinics were expensive to run, the doctors were not seeing enough patients to cover the overhead, and health insurance premiums were in a nose dive. "We didn't read the tea leaves right," Mr. Davis admitted.
By early 1996, 26 Foundation doctors had been laid off, losing their patients as well as their jobs. While Dr. Washburn and his colleagues were counting their blessings that they had not sold to Foundation -- "one or two of us would have surely been fired," Dr. Rabinovitz said, in retrospect -- they were owed money by the sinking firm. Meanwhile, some of the laid-off doctors went to Mr. Sandberg, the medical society executive, for help finding work.
"Some were totally devastated," Mr. Sandberg said. "Some of them were crying."
But Dr. Robinson, the health care economist at Berkeley, has little sympathy for the out-of-work doctors. "Don't think of these doctors as poor oppressed proletarians," he said. "These doctors that sell get rich selling."
The white knight that rescued -- or appeared to rescue -- Foundation was FPA Medical Management Inc., a company based in San Diego that until recently was one of the nation's biggest physician practice management firms. FPA had been snapping up medical practices across the nation. With 7,900 doctors in 29 states at its peak, it acted as a middleman between doctors and health plans, negotiating contracts and administering claims. A publicly held company, it was making a big splash on Wall Street.
In October 1996, FPA paid $220 million for the Foundation doctors' group, and leased the half-empty medical centers. But when Dr. Washburn attended a meeting where a Foundation executive described the sale, he felt a little queasy. "He kept saying, 'We have to take care of our shareholders,' " the pediatrician said. "What about the patients?"
The takeover was rocky. Doctors did not like doing business with FPA; in Tucson, Ariz., a group of FPA-owned doctors formed a union last year to fight the company's cost-cutting measures, like increasing patient loads and dismissing specialists. In Sacramento, some quit amid complaints that they were not paid on time.
But the Placerville pediatricians could not leave. They were not employees. When FPA took over the contract, Dr. Washburn said, he spent five months trying to collect on the $86,000 that was owed. In an interview in May, Dr. Stephen J. Dresnick, FPA's president and chief executive, attributed the dispute, which was eventually resolved, to "a mismatch of expectations." In any event, the FPA executive said, the amount was negligible.
"Eighty-six thousand doesn't sound like a lot of money, does it?" Dr. Dresnick said, noting the practice has five doctors. "You're looking at $16,000 per person. That doesn't strike me as an extraordinarily high number of outstanding claims."
The pediatricians take a different view. They gave up six weeks' salary to make up for the deficit. "To him it's chump change," Dr. Washburn said. "To us, it's the world. This was our No. 1 contract. It was one-third of our income, and we were dying."
 
The Fall
Doctors Left Holding Their Black Bags
Each Wednesday afternoon, the five doctors of El Dorado Pediatrics Medical Group gather around some folding tables for a two-hour brown-bag lunch and business meeting. The talk runs the gamut, from medical journal articles to bookkeeping matters. In recent months, it has centered largely on FPA.
At one point, before it became clear that the company was headed for bankruptcy, Dr. Rabinovitz threw out an idea. Perhaps, he suggested, the group should send a letter to its patients, informing them that its contract with FPA was due to expire in 1999, and that the doctors did not plan to renew it. "What I'm saying," he told his partners that spring day, "is we cut our losses. We put ourselves in a position where we could afford to lose this contract."
Everyone around the table knew that such a letter could cut both ways. Patients might try to switch health insurance plans to stick with the doctors. Then again, as Dr. Rabinovitz himself acknowledged, they might not. "I'm a firm believer that we always overestimate patient loyalty," he said.
Today, that dilemma is moot. On July 15, the California Department of Corporations issued a cease and desist order to FPA, ordering the company to pay its doctors; the bankruptcy petition was filed four days later.
While state officials scurried to make certain that patient care was uninterrupted, Dr. Jack Lewin, the director of the California Medical Association, began tallying the losses. He estimated that FPA owed $60 million to California doctors. Some of those physicians, Dr. Lewin said, traded their practices for FPA stock, which hit a high of $40 a share last October but was trading at 25 cents by July 30. "Those doctors lost their shirts," he said.
Analysts say FPA tried to grow too big too fast. Dr. Dresnick, the FPA executive, vows that the company will emerge, healthy and revitalized, from its reorganization by the end of the year. But it is pulling out of Sacramento, he said in a recent interview. While the FPA-employed doctors there are busy affiliating themselves with new groups, the company is laying plans to dispose of the expensive clinics, including the half-vacant one in Placerville.
"It was losing money every month," Dr. Dresnick said, "and so the decision was, do we put more money into it, or just admit that this was one we couldn't make work?"
 
The Future
White Knights Of the Apocalypse
For the pediatricians, that decision is somewhat of a relief. FPA still owes them $24,000, and they are continuing to see patients without being paid for their work. "We assume, if they filed for bankruptcy, that they are out of our lives," Dr. Rabinovitz said. "But the question is, who is going to pay us? We will probably have to stand in line at the bankruptcy hearings."
In the meantime, the doctors will continue to work longer hours, a practice they began when Dr. Washburn became ill, in an effort to bring in more income. They are trying to persuade patients to switch their insurance to plans not administered by FPA health plans. And they are looking to sign more managed-care contracts, in an effort to diversify.
Although they have entertained other offers to sell during the past two years, it no longer seems like a viable option. Companies like FPA have come to realize that buying a medical practice may not be such a good investment; health economists say doctors tend to work harder when they are self-employed. In any event, the pediatricians say, they no longer believe they have to join a larger group to survive.
"At this point," Dr. Washburn said, "we are not looking to anybody to come in and be the white knight to protect us or save us. We are simply going to have to do whatever we do on our own."
Dr. Robinson, the Berkeley health care economist, said he believed that out of all this churning would come something good. Perhaps not universal health care for all Americans, as President Clinton once envisioned, but at least a system that is cost-efficient.
"We are re-engineering the health care system," he said, "and we are doing it the American way, which means incredible competition. We're going to have a consumer-oriented system, not a doctor-oriented system." The change, he added, will continue to be painful for doctors. "We are seeing supply and demand equilibrate here at a new lower price, and it is nasty."
In Placerville, Dr. Washburn sees something else in the future of American health care: complete collapse. He believes President Clinton squandered an opportunity to make lasting change, that the time is past when things can be "fixed in an orderly fashion," and that any system in which a crucial component is so demoralized -- namely, doctors -- cannot possibly survive.
Lately, Dr. Washburn has been writing philosophical articles for medical trade magazines. He has just picked the title for his next one: "The Coming Medical Apocalypse."
 
After the Revolution
This series will look at the effects of changes in the nation's health care system. Future articles will examine efforts to help the uninsured, and the problems of managed care.

HEADLINE: Thirsty New Jersey Resort Sees New Use for Salty Water

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: CAPE MAY, N.J.

 BODY:
For decades, vacationers have flocked to this resort's broad beach on the Atlantic, its big hotels and its quaint pastel Victorian guest homes, bringing a welcome infusion of cash.
But the visitors have had a devastating effect on Cape May's underground water supply, depleting it to the point that, since 1950, two community wells have been abandoned after they became contaminated by salty ocean water that seeped in to replace the fresh water, and the use of two others has been curtailed. 
 With the salt front threatening its fifth and last well, Cape May is installing the first desalination plant in the Northeast, becoming the northernmost of dozens of resorts and cities on the East Coast that have turned to desalting to offset strains on their water supplies. All are purifying brackish ground water that was once useless.
The move toward desalination began in the late 1970's in highly developed resorts on Florida's gulf coast like Sarasota, Fort Myers and Cape Coral, said James Birkette, a consultant on desalination from Maine. Boca Raton and Hollywood on Florida's Atlantic coast also rely on the plants. Recently, desalination moved northward to Mount Pleasant, S.C.; Cape Hatteras and Nags Head on North Carolina's Outer Banks; Newport News and Chesapeake in coastal Virginia, and now, to New Jersey's southern tip.
"It's a natural result of population growth and overstress on aquifers," Dr. Birkette said of coastal cities' growing reliance on desalting plants.
The common denominators for the resorts, he said, are the steady arrival of new residents and tourists and the overpumping of aquifers, porous underground layers containing water. By allowing the resorts to use once-undrinkable salty water, the plants ease the strain on aquifers and help slow the incursion of salt water. When fresh water is removed in large quantities, rainwater and streams cannot replenish the aquifers quickly enough, and salt water then seeps in.
In Cape May, summer tourism swells the population to nearly 40,000 from about 4,500 and pushes daily water demand on busy weekends to about 2.7 million gallons from about 900,000 gallons, said Thomas Phelan, a former Mayor and now head of Cape May's desalination committee.
Over the last 50 years, salt water has been spreading through Cape May's well field at an increasing speed. In the 1950's, the salt front crept northward at a rate of about 92 feet a year. By the late 1980's, the incursion had sped up to about 271 feet a year, according to a study conducted by the United States Geological Survey in 1992.
Federal geologists estimated at the time that the salt front would reach Cape May's only unaffected well, No. 5, by 2000.
"We had to take 1998 as the year it was going to hit, to be on the safe side," Mr. Phelan said.
The salt front encroaching on Cape May is not New Jersey's first. Two others in the last 20 years have ruined hundreds of wells in communities along Raritan Bay and on the Delaware River south of Camden. About $500 million was spent for a new reservoir, new water treatment plants and distribution pipes on the Raritan and Delaware Rivers, said water managers in the state's Department of Environmental Protection.
Saltwater intrusion is also a problem, though a much less severe one, on Long Island, which gets all of its drinking water from aquifers. In Nassau County, water officials said, salty water has doomed two wells in Great Neck, which like Cape May is on a peninsula, and forced that community to drill new wells farther inland.
Cape May's $5 million desalination plant allowed it to drive its first well into the deepest of five aquifers, which are stacked in layers beneath the Cape May Peninsula, and to begin treating the previously unused brackish water. That aquifer, called the Atlantic City Sand, is 800 feet below the surface and 600 feet below the Cohansey aquifer, which Cape May has used for its five wells. Cape May will cut back on its use of the overpumped Cohansey, which has been increasingly fouled by salt.
State environmental officials had been prodding Cape May to rely less on the Cohansey in hopes of slowing the northerly march of the salt front toward the well fields of two neighboring communities, Lower Township and Wildwood, which also draw from the Cohansey.
The new plant is to begin test runs early this month, and officials hope to have it operating by Labor Day. It is designed to treat 1 million gallons a day and can be expanded to treat 2 million gallons.
The sodium chloride, or salt, level in the Atlantic City Sand's water is about 2,000 parts per million, far higher than both the Federal drinking water standard of 250 parts per million and the level in the Cohansey, which is up to 400 parts per million in the two wells that have been closed and in the other two fouled by salt. In the fifth well, the salt level is well below the Federal standard.
The plant is intended to eliminate all the salt, said David Blair, project manager for Metcalf & Eddy, the engineering company that designed Cape May's plant.
Like the other plants on the East Coast, Cape May's relies on a filtration process called reverse osmosis. Under this process, the brackish water in the aquifer, which is considerably less salty than water in the ocean, is pumped at high pressure into an array of 40-foot-long tubes filled with rolls of semipermeable membranes. As the brackish water is forced through the rolls, the chlorides are separated out, and that stream of brine is eventually discharged to a creek flowing to the Atlantic.
After flowing through the membranes, the purified water reaches a hollow core at the center of the rolls and enters the water distribution network.
Officials say reverse-osmosis plants are far cheaper to operate than desalination plants that treat sea water, which has chloride counts of 35,000 parts per million. These plants, common in the Middle East, use a technology called flash distillation, which removes contaminants by boiling sea water and condensing the steam. High energy costs have made such plants rare in the United States.
Here in Cape May, Federal and state loans and grants paid the plant's $5 million in construction costs. The plant will add $1.25 per 1,000 gallons to the resort's summertime water-sewage charge of $14.53 per 1,000 gallons. Mr. Phelan of the desalination committee said he expected his family's water bill to increase about $85 a year.
But the big hotels on the ocean use from 1 million to 8.5 million gallons of water a year, city officials said. The new plant will add anywhere from $1,250 to $10,625 to their annual water bills, they said.
Residents and innkeepers seem more resigned to the rate increase than angry about it. After all, they have wrestled for years with the need for water conservation and threats the salt front poses for tourism, the backbone of Cape May's economy.
Dane Wells, owner of the Queen Victoria, one of Cape May's 60 bed and breakfasts, said that through conserving water and raising room rates he would cover the higher water charge. But he said residents of towns north of Cape May should pay a surcharge to underwrite Cape May's higher costs because the resort city is cutting back on its use of the Cohansey aquifer to help keep the salt front away from well fields in those towns.
"Because we're on the front edge, we're paying for rampant development north of us," Mr. Wells said. "The state should charge others and the money should go to a fund to help Cape May."
Mr. Wells has reduced his inn's water use by installing pressurized toilets that use less water per flush. And like many other residents, he has sunk a private well on his property for water to wash his car and sprinkle his lawn and flowers.
Four years ago, Mr. Wells began giving two- or three-night guests the option of using the same bed linens during their stay. That policy has cut water used for laundry by 20 percent, he said.
But some year-round residents said conserving water has not saved them much money. Pat Dillon, a secretary at the Chamber of Commerce, switched to low-flush toilets. She said the toilets cut her water use in half, but that did not save her money because Cape May raised water rates to offset the loss of revenue brought on by conservation.
State officials say Cape May's shift to the Atlantic City Sand aquifer will require careful monitoring because it is the main source of water for resorts on a 70-mile stretch of coastline from Stone Harbor to the northern end of Long Beach Island.
Much of the aquifer in that stretch has been heavily pumped and contains a precursor of a salt front invasion: a huge V-shaped void that hydrologists call a cone of depression. Over decades, if overpumping continues, salty ocean water might fill the cone of depression, as it has done here.
So far, monitoring wells have not detected any intrusion of salt in the Atlantic City Sand north of the Cape May Peninsula, said Robert Kecskes, a section chief in the state's Office of Environmental Planning. But, he added, state hydrologists and geologists are uncertain whether Cape May's pumping that aquifer will cause a salt front to pop up elsewhere on New Jersey's resort strip.
If that happens, the options include more desalting plants, he said. But he said a more likely response would be to have the next generation of sewage treatment plants discharge treated effluent into the ground instead of the ocean, so it can filter down to aquifers.
Any salt intrusion along the coast north of Cape May is years away, he said. "We all believe there's enough time to react to it safely and inexpensively," he said.

Map/Chart: "OVERVIEW: Repelling a Saltwater Invasion"
Over the last 50 years, the underground aquifer that provides water for Cape May has been depleted, resulting in the fouling of municipal wells with salt water. In response, the local government is installing a desalting plant that will clean brackish water tapped from a deeper aquifer.
 
Remedy: Desalting by Osmosis
Unlike a distillation process used to desalt water, the process used in the new plant is called reverse osmosis. This is how it works:
 
1: Aquifer water enters a 40-foot cylinder from a high-pressure pump.
Brackish aquifer water enters a 40-foot cylinder from a high-pressure pump.
2: The salty water is forced through rolls of mem 2/3branes to a hollow core, separating the salts. The clean water flows to the municipal water supply.
3: The salty water filters through several more tubes. The concentrated residue is then discharged to a creek flowing to the Atlantic; Map of New Jersey shows location of Cape May.

One Expert's Buzz Is Another's Target

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
There are two main paths to credibility in the world of professional technology experts. One is to champion new trends, making sweeping judgments and pronouncing ways in which the latest technology could make all nonbelievers obsolete. This is called preaching to the chat room.
The other is to debunk new trends, poking holes in the assumptions that others have made and throwing cold water on the preachers. This is called being a calculated contrarian. Both techniques seem to work when it comes to selling reports for thousands of dollars. But the two strategies will go head to head this week as two of the more prominent high-technology consulting firms publicize reports on the convergence of voice and data traffic in the nation's communications networks. 
 In its report on the market for telephone calls that use Internet technology, Abhi Chaki of Jupiter Communications calls the consolidation of voice, video and data information onto unified networks an "inescapable reality." The firm says that will fuel the adoption of Internet-style phone calls.
Over the last year or so, the views of people like Mr. Chaki have taken on the patina of conventional wisdom. But what is really inescapable after reading the report is the feeling that Jupiter, based in New York, is congenitally friendly to the Internet.
The calculated contrarian, Forrester Research, based in Cambridge, Mass., is as in tent on tearing down the concept of network consolidation as Jupiter is in promoting it. In its latest report, Forrester says that businesses will not bother with unified voice-data networks and that multiple networks will live on.
"What we try to do is demystify hype," Maribel Lopez, the Forrester analyst behind the report, said in an interview. "The buzz, a lot of it has to do with data guys looking to sell the next router upgrade."
But in the interest of demystification, it should be made clear that Forrester made an early copy of the report available to a reporter in an effort to create some buzz of its own. SETH SCHIESEL

HEADLINE: BellSouth Workers Authorize a Strike

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Unionized workers at the BellSouth Corporation voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike against the company, the Communications Workers of America said today, threatening the regional telephone company with its first walkout since the 1984 breakup of the AT&T Corporation.
The union's three-year contract with BellSouth, covering 48,000 employees, expires at midnight, Eastern daylight time, Saturday. 
 Jimmy Smith, vice president of the union, said that a key issue was "forced overtime and inflexible scheduling" caused, he said, by work force reductions several years ago. He said other issues were wages, pensions and benefits.
A BellSouth spokeswoman, Deborah Spice, said negotiations, which started June 22, were held over the weekend and continued today. She said any overtime was done within the framework of the existing contract with the union.
The union said 93 percent of voting members had authorized a strike at BellSouth, which serves nine Southeastern states.

Treasury to Retire $45 Billion of Debt Through September

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
The Treasury announced yesterday that it would retire $45 billion in debt through September -- the first time it has been able to do that in the third quarter since 1973.
The announcement came two days before the Treasury announces the size of its auction next week of new 5-year, 10-year and 30-year securities. It also came on a day when Treasury prices rose, helped by a stronger dollar, weaker commodities prices and an announcement by the Federal Reserve on security purchases. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 25/32, to 106 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.65 percent, from 5.71 percent on Friday.
The news that the Treasury would pay down $45 billion in debt represents a sharp shift from May, when the Treasury said it expected to borrow as much as $5 billion in the quarter.
Still, Treasury market analysts said they did not expect immediate changes to the Treasury's borrowing schedule as a result, noting that the announcement merely reflected the strong tax revenues that have come from a rising stock market and higher personal incomes.
"It just confirms what we've known for some time, which is as the surpluses rise, the borrowing needs fall, said Ward McCarthy, a partner with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.
Treasury prices gained early in the day, following the dollar higher after Asian stock markets slumped.
The market got another boost later in the morning when the Federal Reserve announced a permanent purchase of notes and bonds maturing in 10 to 30 years. Analysts expected the Fed to make such a purchase, but not until the start of the next maintenance period of Aug. 13. The Fed bought $1.049 billion in securities maturing Aug. 15, 2008, through April 15, 2028.
The Treasury held its regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills yesterday. Following are the results of the auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.741	97.457	Discounted Rate	4.98%	5.03%	Coupon Yield	5.11%	5.23%	High Price	98.744	97.457	Discounted Rate	4.97%	5.03%	Coupon Yield	5.10%	5.23%	Low Price	98.740	97.455	Discounted Rate	4.98%	5.03%	Coupon Yield	5.11%	5.23%	Accepted at low price	14%	30%	Total applied for	$32,329,030	$35,778,371	Accepted	$9,114,950	$11,940,627	Noncompetitive	$1,390,526	$1,347,268	

Both issues are dated Aug. 6, 1998. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 5, 1998, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 4, 1999.

Dow Falls 96.55, but Nasdaq Index Takes a Bigger Hit

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as investor concerns that Asia's economic crisis will continue to erode the profits of American companies depressed share prices.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 96.55 points, to 8,786.74, a 1.09 percent decline. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 8.23 points, to 1,112.44. 
 But once again, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index took a greater hit, declining 21.29 points, to 1,851.10, a 1.14 percent drop. Microsoft, Worldcom, MCI Communications and Tele-Communications Inc. were the leading decliners in the index, which lost more than 3 percent of its value last week. That compared with last week's 0.6 percent drop in the Dow and 1.8 percent fall in the S.& P. 500.
Concerns about Asia pushed the dollar higher against the yen, to 145.60, closer to its June 16 high of 146.75 yen -- its highest level in eight years.
Bonds gained as the strong dollar made Treasury issues an attractive safe-haven investment for foreign buyers. Treasury securities were also buoyed by a larger-than-expected decline in the July National Association of Purchasing Management's index. The key indicator of domestic manufacturing activity fell to 49.1 in July from 49.6 in June, its second consecutive decline after 22 months of being above 50, the dividing line between a manufacturing sector that is expanding and one that is shrinking.
Despite fairly strong consumer demand and tame inflation in this country, analysts are concerned that Asia's woes will crimp earnings, especially for large multinational companies.
"Based on second-quarter earnings, it's clear there's a meaningful slowdown in profit growth," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
Mr. Johnson noted that even companies with limited operations in Asia, like Computer Associates International, were being affected by the malaise. This is because some of the company's customers -- with greater exposure to Asia -- may delay spending on the software developers' products.
"It's hard to find a safe haven or avoid being hurt by what's going on in Asia," Mr. Johnson said.
In response to his more bearish sentiment, yesterday, Mr. Johnson lowered his earnings forecasts for the S.& P. 500. He now expects operating earnings for the S.& P. 500 to be $46.73 a share this year, down from $48.57, and $49.48 in 1999, down from $52.21.
His forecasts are slightly below the consensus estimates of $47.20 and $49.70, respectively.
Despite the declines and a strong bearish market sentiment, Mr. Johnson and several other analysts believe the declines simply signal a market correction and are not the beginning of a severe market decline.
"We view this short-term setback as a reality check, however, rather than the start of a meaningful move to the downside," Elizabeth J. Mackay, investment strategist at Bear, Stearns & Company, wrote in a recent market report.
Declines should be limited to a 7 percent to 10 percent decline for the major market indexes from their recent highs, Ms. Mackay wrote. At yesterday's close, the Dow was down about 5.9 percent from its July 17 record close of 9,337.97.
But if the index falls below its recent low of 8,627.93 investors may begin to worry more about whether the declines will end soon.
Yesterday's losses left the Dow 158.81 points away from its recent low of 8,727.93 on June 15. A close below that would signal an almost 8 percent decline from the July 17 high.
Elsewhere in the market, the German software developer SAP began trading on the New York Stock exchange yesterday.
The company, with a market capitalization of about $73 billion, is the world's second-largest technology company behind Microsoft. It is also the largest new listing ever on the Big Board, a spokeswoman said.
Its size is one reason SAP chose to list on the New York Stock Exchange, as opposed to the Nasdaq, said Kevin McKay, chief operating officer and chief financial officer of SAP Americas. "We don't characterize ourselves as a high-tech start-up," he said
In addition, the company favored a recent change in the exchange's policies that allowed SAP to select the specialist, or dealer, who is assigned to maintain fair and orderly trading in the stock. Generally, specialists are assigned securities by the exchanges.
The company's American depository receipts fell 1 15/16, to 59 9/16. One A.D.R. represents one-twelfth of a preferred share of SAP stock.

HEADLINE: Albertson's In $8.3 Billion Deal for Chain

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Albertson's Inc. said yesterday that it would acquire the American Stores Company for $8.3 billion in stock, in a deal that would create the nation's largest supermarket chain.
The transaction -- the latest in a round of deals announced in the grocery industry recently as supermarket operators have sought to form regional strongholds -- would create a chain of nearly 2,500 stores in 37 states with more than 200,000 employees and pro forma 1998 revenues of about $36 billion. The purchase would also establish Albertson's, which had been the fifth- largest chain, as the industry leader, vaulting past Kroger, which has nearly 1,400 stores in 24 states. 
 Albertson's is strong in the Western, Midwestern and Southern states and will now have a larger presence in the Southwest and on the West Coast, where American Stores is a large competitor. The acquisition would also move Albertson's into drugstore retailing because American Stores has 750 free-standing drugstores that operate under the Osco Drug and Sav-on names.
In all, American Stores, which is based in Salt Lake City, operates 1,558 stores in 26 states, including 269 food and drug combination stores and 539 supermarkets that operate under the names Acme Markets, Jewel Food Stores and Lucky Stores.
Albertson's, which is based in Boise, Idaho, operates 916 retail stores in 23 states. Both chains' stores will retain their names, and the company headquarters will remain in Boise.
Albertson's chairman and chief executive, Gary G. Michael, will run the combined company, and American Stores' chairman and chief executive, Victor L. Lund, will be vice chairman of the combined company.
"From a strategic standpoint, this transaction will strengthen our presence in many of our existing markets across the country -- particularly in Northern and Southern California and the Southwest -- and enables us to enter important urban markets like Chicago and Philadelphia for the first time," Mr. Michael said.
In addition to paying the $8.3 billion in stock, Albertson's will assume $3.4 billion in debt. American Stores shareholders are to receive 0.63 share of Albertson's common stock for each share of American Stores stock. Based on Albertson's closing price on Friday of $48 a share, the deal is worth $30.24 a share for American shareholders, who would then own 41.3 percent of Albertson's. Also, Albertson's will issue about 170 million additional shares in the transaction.
Albertson's said it expected to save $100 million in costs the first year from buying and distribution efficiencies and $200 million in the third year from reducing overhead and advertising expenditures in overlapping markets. Part of the lower overhead cost will come from eliminating some administrative jobs, although the number has not been determined. Albertson's said it would take an undetermined one-time charge related to the transaction, which it expects to add to earnings per share next year.
American Stores' stock rose $5.3125 yesterday to $28.50. Albertson's shares, meanwhile, were nearly flat, edging up just 50 cents, to $48.50. Shareholders' lukewarm reception may indicate that they consider the price of the transaction a bit rich or that they have concerns about how easily the companies can be combined.
Even so, "because of our consistent business philosophies and similar corporate cultures, I am confident the integration of these two companies will go smoothly," Mr. Lund said.
Analysts said the combination could be more difficult than the companies anticipate because of the numerous geographical regions in which they operate and because of the number and type of stores they run. The deal, which has been approved by both companies' boards, could also run into antitrust problems in such areas as California, where Albertson's stands to dominate the market.
The Federal Trade Commission is likely to mandate some divestitures where there is overlap, said Debra J. Levin, an analyst who follows the supermarket industry for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "They will have to sell some stores, but I don't think that will prevent this from working," she said.
Ms. Levin added that she had raised her recommendation on Albertson's stock to strong buy from outperform based on the acquisition announcement. "There are really a number of areas in which companies can achieve economies of scale by joining forces, and that is in the context of an intensely competitive environment," she said.
Indeed, the industry's merger trend is being driven by the benefits of size, namely, greater purchasing power, a larger bang for the advertising buck and additional stores from which to compete with WalMart, the warehouse clubs and other nontraditional retailers that now sell milk and eggs.
For instance, in May, Royal Ahold N.V. said it was buying Giant Food Inc., a supermarket chain, for $2.6 billion, adding 177 stores to its 830 domestic stores. And last year, Fred Meyer Inc. purchased Quality Food Centers Inc. and Ralphs Grocery Company in separate deals worth about $2 billion.

HEADLINE: Good Times Keep Rolling

 BODY:
The Asian crisis may alarm Alan Greenspan and assorted other economists, but to the American people the economic outlook could not be rosier. That is what they tell the pollsters, who put consumer confidence at virtually the highest level in 30 years. More important, consumers act on that belief.
Some economists thought the second-quarter numbers would show a decline in the American economy. But instead, the estimates issued by the Government last Friday showed continued growth, albeit at a reduced level. That was because Americans -- both individuals and businesses -- are buying at a very high, and ultimately unsustainable, pace. Adjusted for inflation, purchases by Americans are up 5.6 percent over the past year. Such rapid growth would be expected if the economy were coming out of a recession and pent-up demand were bursting forth. But this is the eighth year of economic expansion. 
 Unfortunately, incomes are not rising at anything like that pace. To support such spending, people are deciding not to save. The statistics on savings are muddied by the Government's decision to change the way they are calculated, but it appears that the savings rate is at the lowest level since the Government started collecting the figures in 1946. Perhaps people see little need to save. What savings they have are booming along with the stock market, and there is no worry about recession.
There are signs of problems for businesses brought on by the overseas weakness. So far those problems seem not to have dampened corporate investment, let alone the buying patterns of consumers. But the American trade deficit is soaring to record levels even with imported oil the cheapest it has been in many years.
For now, the trade deficit has little cost. The dollar is strong because the Japanese yen is weak, amid worries the Japanese recession will deepen. If Japan does get its economic house in order, the dollar could begin to fall, perhaps raising the reported inflation figures enough to trouble American consumers. But for now, consumers see a wonderful economy, and are spending on the assumption it will continue.

HEADLINE: Russia and France Gain on U.S. Lead in Arms Sales, Study Says

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The United States remains the world's biggest arms merchant, filling the developing world's arsenals with billions of dollars of weapons, but Russia and France are poised to overtake the United States, a new Government report says.
The study, by the Congressional Research Service, says the United States retained its No. 1 position in the arms trade, which it has held for seven years, by selling $15.2 billion worth of weapons last year, a 44 percent share of the shrinking global arms market. 
 Russia and France are in a dead heat in the competition for sales pacts, says the report, which is based in part on data compiled by the Central Intelligence Agency. The accords, not all of which are carried out, indicate trends in sales.
The report shows that sales by the United States and other nations to the developing world are slowing. There has been a steady decline in most sectors of the international trade since the end of the cold war and the Persian Gulf war.
The arms bazaar of the 80's and early 90's in Asia and the Middle East has calmed, in part because of the Asian economic crisis, which has prevented nations from striking huge new deals. Another factor is the long slump in crude oil prices, helping slow purchases by Saudi Arabia, once the biggest buyer of American weaponry. The Saudis have also been constrained by the huge costs that they paid to help finance the gulf war in 1991.
Developing nations, however, are still the biggest buyers of American weapons. Last year the United States delivered attack helicopters and a variety of missiles to Taiwan, missiles and torpedoes to Egypt, multiple-rocket launchers and airborne-jamming equipment to South Korea and air-defense communications equipment to Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia, with $11 billion in new weapons delivered, and Taiwan, with $9.3 billion, were by a 10-fold factor the largest buyers among developing nations last year, far outstripping their nearest competitors, Egypt, Iran and Kuwait.
They will soon have a new rival. In May the United Arab Emirates announced that it would buy 80 F-16 fighter jets, including weapons and support systems, a deal worth an estimated $7 billion.
The United States policy on weapons sales is set by an order signed by President Clinton in 1995, Presidential Decision Directive 34. It says the sales are "a legitimate instrument of U.S. foreign policy." The policy makes clear that increasing the sales and market share of American arms manufacturers is a goal of American foreign policy.
Lora Lumpe, who directs the Arms Sales Monitoring Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said, "This Administration has relied on armed diplomacy, weapons sales and military training, rather than fostering regional arms control and diplomatic initiatives to dampen or head off conflict."
No international arms deal has been rejected under the directive, which evaluates sales case by case. The policy also accepts the argument that if the United States does not sell weapons to developing nations, others like Russia or France will gladly fill the bill.
Among the biggest competitors, Russia is struggling to sign deals to obtain hard currency. But developing nations increasingly see it as a unreliable supplier because of its economic woes, the report says. Russia's best customers are India, which bought 40 Russian fighter jets last year, and China, which bought two destroyers.
In 1990, Iran was a major buyer of Russian fighter jets, bombers, tanks and submarines. But now "Iran, primarily due to its own economic problems, as well as U.S. pressure, most recently has ceased to be a major purchaser of arms from Russia," the report says.
Russia delivered $2.7 billion of arms from 1990 to 1993, but $700 million from 1994 to 1997. Iran has become more reliant on Chinese suppliers. But China's deliveries also fell, from $1.8 billion from 1990 to 1993 to $800 million from 1994 to 1997.
Of all regions the Middle East continues to have the deepest hunger for new weapons, the report says, and the United States continues to be its most reliable supplier. American allies in the region have received, among other weapons, 116 supersonic aircraft, 1,358 surface-to-air missiles, 1,332 tanks and self-propelled guns and 72 helicopters in the last four years, the study says.
But sanctions have effectively shut out two big United States enemies, Libya and Iraq, from the conventional arms trade, the report shows.
From 1990 to last year the United States signed contracts to sell $44.1 billion of weapons to Middle Eastern nations, the report says. France is in a position to overtake the United States as the region's biggest arms suppliers, the report states.
Asia is the second-biggest regional market, and Russian sales to India, China and Vietnam have given it the biggest share of arms-transfer agreements in the region. From 1994 to 1997, Russia concluded $29.6 billion in agreements to Asian nations, more than 40 percent of that market.
Over all, however, the United States has led the field in the 90's. From 1990 to 1997, it delivered $53.4 billion of weapons to the developing world, far outstripping Britain, Russia and France, the study shows.
The figures in the annual report, available from the research service at the Library of Congress, for United States sales includes just Government-approved military sales, not commercial sales of components and spare parts.

HEADLINE: U.N. Arms Inspector's Talks With Iraq Break Down in Bitterness

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Crucial talks in Baghdad on the remaining issues blocking the lifting of sanctions on Iraq collapsed in rancor today, United Nations officials said.
The Iraqis, returning to the belligerent tone that heralded an international crisis last fall, rejected a plan for settling issues proposed by the United Nations chief arms inspector for Iraq, Richard Butler. 
 Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi delegation leader, accused Mr. Butler, an Australian, of using "old tricks" and following an American policy of continuing sanctions no matter what progress is made.
Mr. Butler told reporters in Baghdad after today's session that he had not made the progress he had hoped for. "I made a proposal for further acceleration of work and it was rejected," he said.
Danilo Turk, the Slovenian delegate to the Security Council and its current President, said Mr. Butler would cut his trip short and return to brief the Council by Wednesday.
United Nations officials here and in Baghdad said they had no further information on the stalled discussions and declined to speculate whether the show of obstinacy by the Iraqis was a ploy to rally support against Mr. Butler, whose frank style they dislike.
The Iraqis once again staged a funeral procession for 35 Iraqi children outside the building where Mr. Butler and Mr. Aziz met. Their parents told reporters that the children had died because of sanctions.
The Iraqis accused the United States of "wrecking" the program under which limited oil sales are permitted to pay for food and medicine. United Nations officials countered that a loosening of the sanctions has increased oil sales sharply and has allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in medical supplies to reach Iraq. They said it was the Iraqi Government that recently reduced a United Nations proposal to raise caloric intake in food distribution.
The Iraqis have been encouraged by Russia, France and China to hope for a phasing-out of sanctions should the Security Council acknowledge that every detail about Iraqi weapons will never be known and that enough progress had been made to warrant a relaxation.
In June, Mr. Butler, under pressure from the Security Council, provided Iraq with a "road map" of steps to take to meet his disarmament requirements. Mr. Aziz, repeating that Iraq had no more weapons or information to provide, strongly indicated then that there would be no more cooperation.
Mr. Butler did not go to Iraq this week with high hopes.
The collapse of this round of talks would leave little room for averting tensions when the sanctions are reviewed by the Security Council in October. Iraq has significant questions to answer and has provided no new information since May.
The Iraqis have, in fact, lost some ground because of the discovery of VX nerve gas on shell canisters and a less upbeat assessment than expected last week by the International Atomic Energy Agency on accounting for nuclear programs. Iraq also refused to hand over a document found by inspectors last month.
President Saddam Hussein has threatened unspecified retaliation if the embargo on oil sales is not lifted this year. Last year, his Government expelled American inspectors, put large presidential compounds off limits and threatened to freeze all inspections.
President Hussein's defiance of arms inspectors led to a massing of American and British forces in the Persian Gulf early this year.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans To Spin Off Parts Division

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation announced yesterday that it planned to spin off its gigantic auto parts subsidiary to its shareholders next year, a move that could reignite the labor troubles that led to nearly eight-week-long strikes that ended only last Wednesday.
If completed, the move would represent a historic shift away from vertical integration, a corporate strategy in which a company produces most of the parts as well as the final product. Through the 1970's, G.M. promoted its vertical integration as a source of financial strength and savings. 
 But John F. Smith Jr., the G.M. chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that General Motors wanted instead to be a company that assembles and markets cars, but does not necessarily make a large proportion of the parts inside.
The spinoff of the auto parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, "represents nothing less than a fundamental shift away from vertical integration," Mr. Smith said.
The United Automobile Workers union reacted furiously to G.M.'s announcement this afternoon, which followed a regularly scheduled board meeting. "Should G.M. decide to proceed with the sale as announced, the U.A.W.'s record is clear: we can and will aggressively work to protect the rights and interests of U.A.W. members impacted by the sale," Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for G.M. issues, said in a statement.
General Motors' national contract with the union expires in September 1999, and the union could try to stop the spinoff of Delphi then with a strike.
Through strikes and the threat of strikes, the U.A.W. has sometimes forced G.M. to postpone or cancel factory sales and closings over the years.
Robert Stempel, the former chairman of G.M., announced in December 1991 the closing of two dozen factories and the elimination of 74,000 jobs, but some of those factories are still open and the jobs still exist.
But a spinoff of Delphi could be an attractive move for General Motors and its shareholders. The U.A.W. currently forces G.M. to pay the same wages of at least $19 an hour to assembly plant workers and parts factory workers alike, even though nonunion parts makers pay only half as much to their workers.
An independent Delphi could try to pay lower wages to its American workers who are members of the U.A.W. It might be able to sell more parts to other auto makers, which have been reluctant to order from Delphi for fear that it would share parts designs and other competitive information with G.M.
Ford and Chrysler have to pay the same wages to assembly workers and parts workers, but disposed of many of their parts factories piecemeal in the late 1970's and early 1980's, when their survival was in doubt.
Japanese auto makers pay close to $19 an hour to their assembly plant workers but buy the great bulk of their parts from outside suppliers with much lower wages.
Gerald Knechtel, G.M.'s vice president for North American personnel, had said last Tuesday, when a tentative settlement was reached with the U.A.W. in Flint, Mich., that the auto maker wanted a closer relationship with the union and would begin holding regular, top-level meetings with union officials. Mr. Knechtel said then that the strike could only be judged worthwhile if it produced a lasting improvement in the relationship.
Workers ratified the settlement last Wednesday and returned to work, but G.M. lost $3 billion in after-tax profits because of the strike, or nearly half a year's earnings.
Mr. Smith said at a news conference yesterday that G.M.'s board had been planning for months to decide on the spinoff of Delphi at its August meeting, but that the company had not told the union until after the Flint strike had ended.
Even if G.M. divests itself of Delphi, it will still be somewhat vertically integrated. G.M. factories that produce engines, transmissions and exterior sheet metal are part of G.M.'s auto assembly and marketing divisions, and would not be divested with Delphi.
The Delphi division makes hundreds of smaller parts, from spark plugs to dashboards to seats, that are less important to a car's exterior appearance or road performance.
The strikes in Flint affected two parts factories, a Delphi factory that makes speedometers, spark plugs and other parts and another, non-Delphi factory that stamps truck hoods and other parts from sheets of steel.
But G.M.'s planned spinoff of Delphi nonetheless represents a big decision. Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., is the world's largest auto parts maker, with slightly greater annual sales than the Intel Corporation.
Delphi's 200,000 employees around the world include 50,000 U.A.W. members in the United States, a sizable number for a union with around 730,000 members. There are another 150,000 U.A.W. workers in G.M.'s other operations that will not be divested.
General Motors said that it planned to dispose of Delphi in two steps.
During the first quarter of next year, G.M. plans to distribute to shareholders as much as 20 percent of Delphi's stock. The auto maker said it would dispose of the rest of Delphi later next year, by distributing shares or by exchanging G.M. shares for Delphi shares, or possibly by a combination of these approaches, in a transaction that is intended to be tax-free.

HEADLINE: Spending Climbed in June, Outpacing Income Growth

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Americans kept spending at a strong pace in June, even though their incomes posted the smallest increase in three and a half years. The combination of weak income growth and strong spending pushed the personal savings rate to a record low.
The Commerce Department reported today that personal incomes rose a scant two-tenths of a percent in June, just half the May gain of four-tenths of a percent. One reason was a loss of $2 billion, at an annual rate, in wages because of the General Motors strike, which was settled last week. 
 Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, rose at a strong clip of six-tenths of a percent in June. This was slower than the surge of nine-tenths of a percent in May, which was the strongest gain in nearly a year.
The strong growth in spending and the slowdown in incomes lowered the percentage of income that Americans were able to save to two-tenths of a percent in June, the lowest level since the Government began keeping monthly statistics in 1959. The savings rate had dipped to five-tenths of a percent in May from a 1.1 percent rate in April.
In a sense, however, the report of low savings is misleading because the Government report reflects the amount left over after subtracting spending from incomes, but does not count capital gains as income.
Another report today showed that a closely watched barometer of the manufacturing sector, the National Association of Purchasing Management's composite index, retreated in July to 49.1 from 49.6 in June. It was the second consecutive decline after 22 months of being above the 50 mark, the dividing line between a manufacturing sector that is expanding and one that is shrinking.
Analysts said the decline reflected the continued export problems that American companies are having because of the Asian economic crisis.
But a third report today showed that the domestic economy continued to have significant momentum, despite the Asian situation. Construction spending jumped 1.7 percent in June, the biggest gain in more than a year; spending for residential construction rose to a record high.
Overall construction spending climbed to a seasonally adjusted $644 billion in June, the second-highest level on record. The stronger-than-expected increase reflected a 1.6 percent rise in single-family homes and a 2.1 percent increase in nonresidential buildings.
"The economy is still quite healthy, but it is certainly slowing from the torrid pace that we saw last year and the first quarter of this year," said Cynthia Latta, economist at Standard & Poor's DRI.
Even with the end of the General Motors strike, many economists say economic growth will continue to be slow for the rest of the year as the Asian crisis pushes America's trade deficit to record levels and depresses manufacturing and foreign sales by American farmers.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Accuses Dain Rauscher of Fraud

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Dain Rauscher Inc. and two former employees of fraud for their roles in underwriting bonds connected to the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif.
The lawsuit, filed today in the United States District Court here, is the second S.E.C. action against a brokerage firm stemming from the bankruptcy. In the first action, Credit Suisse First Boston and two former employees agreed in January to pay $870,000 to settle S.E.C. charges. In addition, the commission is negotiating a settlement with Merrill Lynch & Company that is reported to be for a fine of less than $3 million. 
 The S.E.C. actions are distinct from lawsuits filed by Orange County. Those suits, several of which have been settled recently, generally accuse brokerage firms of selling risky securities to the county. The S.E.C. is concentrating on the adequacy of disclosures made by underwriters who sold bonds issued by the county or its municipalities to the public.
Dain Rauscher, a major participant in municipal finance, underwrote or was the financial adviser for 13 bond offerings, totaling more than $980 million, by cities and school districts in Orange County in 1993 and 1994, according to the S.E.C. complaint. The proceeds from the offerings were invested in an investment pool run by Orange County's treasurer, Robert L. Citron. The pool suffered heavy losses in 1994, precipitating the bankruptcy.
The S.E.C. accuses Dain Rauscher of misleading investors by not disclosing in the offering documents that the sole purpose of the bond sales was to obtain money to invest in the Orange County pool in the hopes of making profits. Moreover, the commission contends, Dain Rauscher did not disclose the riskiness of the pool's investments, which were highly leveraged and subject to big losses if interest rates rose.
Dain Rauscher, which is based in Los Angeles, strongly denied all charges. "We do not understand how the S.E.C. can allege fraud in these circumstances," the company said. It said it was not involved with the investment pool. It also said it knew less about the pool than the credit rating agencies, which gave the pool their highest ratings, and the S.E.C., which reviewed the pool at that time and took no action.
Moreover, the company said, all the investors who held the bonds it underwrote were paid in full. Michael J. Missal, a lawyer for Dain Rauscher, said it was common practice at the time not to disclose that the proceeds of a bond offering were going to the investment pool. But, he said, "Every investor knew where they were going."
Lawyers for the two former Dain Rauscher employees, who were the investment bankers in charge of many of the offerings in question, also denied the charges. The former employees are Virginia O. Horler, 57, of Moraga, Calif., and Kenneth D. Ough, 45, of Post Falls, Idaho.
Dain Rauscher was formed in January through the merger of Dain Bosworth of Minneapolis and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes of Dallas. It was Rauscher Pierce that was involved in the Orange County underwritings.
The action today was not a surprise. Rauscher Pierce disclosed in a quarterly filing last year that it was a focus in a Federal enforcement action related to Orange County. But talks aimed at a settlement broke down. In a separate case, the S.E.C. in January accused Rauscher Pierce of defrauding investors and the State of Arizona by engaging in "yield burning," in which Treasury bonds are sold to state or local governments at artificially high prices. The company denied any wrongdoing.
The S.E.C. also brought an administrative action against Ms. Horler, charging inadequate disclosure on bonds issued by Nevada County, Calif. She denies those charges, according to Mr. Missal, the lawyer.

Yen Hits Seven-Week Low Against the Dollar

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The yen fell to its lowest level against the dollar in seven weeks today, as currency traders tested the new Japanese Government's resolve to let the market determine the currency's value.
At 5 P.M. today, one dollar could buy 145.63 yen, up from 144.79 yen when trading opened this morning and from 144.70 yen late Friday in New York. The yen slipped more on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported, trading at 145.72 to the dollar early in the day, but its slide was limited because a Finance Ministry official said that Japan might act to buoy the sagging yen. 
 Many currency traders and economists expect the dollar to test this year's high of 146.75 yen any day, although few have forgotten being burned by intervention by the United States and Japanese Governments after that high was hit on June 16.
Kiichi Miyazawa, the newly appointed Minister of Finance, caught the markets' attention last week when he suggested that markets, rather than governments, should determine the appropriate dollar-yen exchange rate, although he hedged by saying intervention was "all right" in an "extreme situation."
"The comment by Miyazawa when he said he would leave the market to determine exchange rates was what got the most interest in the market, and now they're speculating about whether he will be as committed as his predecessor to capping the market," said Robert Alan Feldman, senior economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo.
Mr. Feldman has set a target of 160 yen to the dollar by the end of this year based on continuing gloomy economic fundamentals. Today, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said domestic vehicle sales fell 8.4 percent from a year earlier, the 16th consecutive month that sales have fallen.
Excluding mini-vehicles, however, sales climbed 13.5 percent from the previous month, and two of the country's five largest car makers, the Honda Motor Company and the Mazda Motor Corporation, reported a 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent sales increase, respectively.
The markets have been skeptical of new Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ability to address Japan's weak economy and shaky banking system quickly and comprehensively, even though his new economic team has won some grudging respect from the markets.
As yet, they have not articulated a single philosophy on what economic changes they will pursue, and Mr. Miyazawa is blamed in some quarters for doing little to rein in the speculative growth that created Japan's economic bubble in the 1980's.

Clinton's Foreign Debt

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
I thought that by going all the way to Brazil, I might actually escape the Bill Clinton soap opera. Wrong.
Scene one: A Brazilian macho men's association recently voted Bill Clinton "Macho Man of the Year," and even delivered the award to the American Embassy. 
 Scene two: Lunch in Rio de Janeiro with a group of Brazilian businessmen. They want to know just one thing: What might Bill Clinton's troubles mean for U.S. investment in Brazil? "The whole world is depending on U.S. capital flows," explains Joel Korn, a leading Brazilian management consultant. "If there is a change in the U.S. situation because of the President's troubles, which affects U.S. investment overseas, the whole world will be hurt."
You have here in a nutshell the two basic foreign reactions to Mr. Clinton's troubles: 1) Surely you Americans can't be serious about prosecuting a President for adultery. World leaders always play around -- just look at ours. And 2) My God, what if you Americans are serious about prosecuting your President for adultery! Don't you realize how important you are for the rest of the world? You are the world's only superpower. Nothing happens without you. And every emerging market is depending on your economic stability. Maybe you think you don't need a President -- but the rest of the world does.
And so it goes. Half the time the rest of the world is snickering at us as naive Puritans and half the time they are unnerved that we might actually devour another President, with all the uncertainty that might entail.
They are right to be concerned. Americans may think the world is safe for us to indulge in this entertaining Clinton saga -- and for U.S. foreign policy to come to a standstill while it plays out -- but it's not.
Look what's going on out there: Russia, with 20,000 nuclear weapons and an impoverished arms industry ready to sell anything to anyone, is teetering on the edge of collapse. Kosovo and Albania are imploding. China is considering devaluing its currency, in a move that could trigger a whole new downward economic spiral in Asia that would surely hurt the U.S. economy. Japan is stumbling around, lost. Saddam Hussein is preparing to rear his ugly head again. Iran is testing a long-range missile. The Arabs are moving closer to Iran, out of a feeling that the U.S. is too weak now to protect them from any Iranian meddling. The expansion of U.S. free trade, through the fast-track process, is frozen because the President is afraid to confront Congressional Democrats on this issue, because they are his only core support. And the Arab-Israeli peace process is frozen, in part because the White House has completely wimped out from its vow to confront Israel's Prime Minister, Bibi Netanyahu, if he continues to reject the U.S. peace plan.
But this is not some backdoor argument for letting the President off the hook and just ignoring this whole tawdry affair. It is an argument for why the President, in whatever he says to the grand jury this month or to the American public afterward, has to bring this case to a close, once and for all. No more "I didn't inhale," "I didn't consummate," "Not to my recollection." It's enough, already.
The press is now full of reports about infighting in the White House between aides who think the President should come clean with the grand jury and aides who think he shouldn't. Excuse me, but are these guys nuts? Do they really think there is any hope for salvaging the Clinton Presidency with anything less than full disclosure? Do they really think America's national security interests can indefinitely tolerate a wounded President, constantly on the run from the press, courts and Congress?
Mr. Clinton has got to say and do now what is necessary to put this case behind him -- in a way that might give at least some chance for him to pursue the progressive agenda, at home and abroad, for which he was elected. He owes that to all the people who believe in the social and economic programs for which he stood, and still might be able to salvage. He owes that to all the people who don't want to see an isolationist, mean-spirited Republican right shaping America's future.
But to have a morally impeached Bill Clinton, without a shred of hope for Clintonism, well, what's the point?
Mr. President, whatever your aides might say, your options are to tell the truth or resign. I hope you tell the truth, because the country and the world can't afford to have you endlessly twisting in the wind.

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: LOWVILLE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Most people watching the Lewis County Fair parade had no idea who the man in the monogrammed shirt was or why he had joined the procession of baton twirlers, beauty queens and Boy Scouts marching through town on a steamy summer night.
He was politely shaking hands, and occasionally introducing himself as Jim Larocca, a Democratic candidate for governor. But he was not urging people to support him in the Democratic primary on Sept. 15. And unlike other politicians marching in the parade, he had no zealous campaign aides passing out buttons and shouting his name to the crowd. 
 James L. Larocca (pronounced la-ROCK-a), a former state official from Huntington, N.Y., is the most understated of the four Democrats hoping to oppose Gov. George E. Pataki in the fall, and his campaign has by far the least cash. But what he lacks in money and flash, he makes up for in doggedness. Mr. Larocca registered as a gubernatorial candidate more than a year ago, long before any of his better-known competitors -- Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross and Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney. And he has traveled the state ever since, courting Democratic leaders with a quiet intensity that has earned him a surprising amount of support, considering that Mr. Larocca, 54, has few ties to the Democratic Party establishment, has never held elective office and is barely known outside Long Island.
"Jim is just a super guy," said Charles Merrell, the Lewis County Democratic chairman, who invited Mr. Larocca to the upstate parade. "There's a lot to like about him. He'd make a great governor."
Why, then, have Mr. Merrell and other party leaders who gush about Mr. Larocca thrown their weight behind other candidates? Why is Mr. Larocca, admired by everyone from upstate dairy farmers to urban advocates of gay issues, considered the longest of long shots?
Because the other candidates have more money and name recognition, factors that party officials said count more than good ideas when the Republican incumbent is soaring high in the polls. Mr. Larocca has raised only $845,000 and spent all but $3,600, which leaves him miles behind Mr. Vallone and Ms. McCaughey Ross, each of whom has raised more than $3 million. Mr. Hynes has raised $500,000 and still has $200,000 on hand.
"I'm going with Peter Vallone because he's got money and, let's face it, more people know who he is," Mr. Merrell said. "I just think he's got a better chance at it than Jim."
Mr. Larocca is the only Democratic candidate who has worked in state government, as Transportation Commissioner under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Energy Commissioner under Gov. Hugh L. Carey. He was also president of the Long Island Association, the island's largest economic development group, for eight years. Demographically, Mr. Larocca is a political consultant's dream: Roman Catholic, Italian-American and the only candidate not from New York City. He and his wife, Dale, have three grown children. And he looks gubernatorial, with silvery hair, perfect posture and an earnest gaze.
His platform is broad enough to appeal to both upstate moderates and urban liberals. He supports abortion rights, affirmative action and gay marriage, yet he also calls the death penalty "appropriate." Mr. Larocca would cut tuition at public colleges and universities by 25 percent, ban corporate contributions to political campaigns and push the State Legislature to allow casinos in economically depressed regions.
He also wants to create regional partnerships involving businesses, universities and local governments to assist economic development. He encouraged such partnerships when he was running the Long Island Association, and he said they helped the region's economy when the military contracting industry collapsed in the early 1990's.
His supporters on Long Island said Mr. Larocca had positively influenced everything from energy policy and land preservation to job creation as president of the association, experience that they said makes him more qualified to make statewide policy decisions than the other candidates.
Mr. Larocca also said he is the only Democratic candidate who is "unequivocally" in favor of allowing dairy farmers to join an interstate compact as a way of negotiating higher prices for milk, a stand that increases his appeal in the upstate regions he has worked so hard to impress. "He is the only one who can mount a credible, broad-based challenge to Pataki and not drag the rest of the ticket down," said Phil Friedman, a Democratic consultant and a friend of Mr. Larocca's. "If you want a candidate who can unify the Democratic Party, there's no question you should pick him."
But increasingly large stumbling blocks have made political life difficult for Mr. Larocca in recent months. The biggest came in May, when the Nassau County Democratic chairman, Stephen J. Sabbeth, switched his support from Mr. Larocca to Ms. McCaughey Ross. As a result, Mr. Larocca did not win enough delegate votes at the State Democratic Convention to get an automatic spot on the primary ballot.
Mr. Larocca turned to a more laborious way of getting on the ballot: collecting at least 15,000 signatures from registered Democrats around the state. Despite predictions that he could not afford a petition drive, he succeeded and spent only $2,500. A Suffolk County resident filed a challenge to Mr. Larocca's petitions, but state election officials have not yet received the required detailed explanation of the challenge, which means it will probably be dismissed.
These recent complications have hurt his fund-raising efforts, Mr. Larocca said, as would-be supporters have decided his campaign is doomed. He complains bitterly about his fund-raising disadvantage, saying Mr. Vallone and Mr. Hynes can easily raise money as elected officials, and pointing out that most of Ms. McCaughey Ross's money comes from her husband, a wealthy banker. But he also attempts to make an asset of his relative poverty.
"I'm proving that it's not about money, but about the vision and independence and integrity of the candidate," Mr. Larocca said. "I am also the only one who can mount an all-out assault on Pataki's fund-raising, because I have not been part of this system of raising money that has so troubled the public."
The absence of a political record and his relative obscurity have meant that he has not attracted much campaign criticism yet, but on Long Island, some civic and business leaders complain that he has failed to take a strong stand on the state's takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company. "He has been strangely silent on one of the key issues facing Long Island," said Jack Kulka, a builder on Long Island who is chairman of a coalition opposed to the Lilco takeover. "I haven't seen him say anything gubernatorial other than 'Vote for me.' "
Other critics say his insistence on staying in the race with no money is a sign of arrogance. Sheldon R. Sackstein, the chairman of Action Long Island, a nonprofit business and civic group, said Mr. Larocca was more focused on advancing his career than on solving problems. "I have always seen a lack of team effort on his part," Mr. Sackstein said. "If he truly was a team player, he would bow out and support the folks with the more likely chance to win."
But Mr. Friedman and others said Mr. Larocca would be wise to stress his independence from the Democratic political machine, because people who vote in primaries tend to admire underdogs who lack party support. The best examples are Mr. Carey and Mr. Cuomo, both of whom defeated party favorites in Democratic gubernatorial primaries.
"Nothing makes primary voters madder than having Democratic bosses tell them who they can choose among," Mr. Friedman said. "These are voters who follow the issues carefully, who believe in a progressive, independent Democratic Party and whose votes can never be totally predicted."
Mr. Larocca's distaste for old-style politicking shows on the campaign trail, where he spends more time huddling with small groups than working rooms. On a visit to a nursing home in Watertown, N.Y., in July, he listened to concerns about staffing and health insurance, then quietly ducked out. And when his daughter showed up at a candidate's forum in Manhattan, he retreated to a corner for a personal conversation with her instead of pumping hands.
"It's to his credit that he's not a back-slapping type of guy and likes to have deep conversations with people instead," said Assemblyman Eric N. Vitaliano, a Staten Island Democrat who has known Mr. Larocca for years. "Jimmy's got quiet strength, and that's an asset in this time of superficial sound bites."
Even those who believe Mr. Larocca does not have a prayer said his soft-pedal approach was winning him a loyal support base that could make him a strong candidate in 2002. John Zogby, a pollster in Utica, N.Y., said that although Mr. Larocca's better-known opponents would suffer from a primary defeat, he has nothing to lose.
"He's young, he's attractive, he is making the kinds of contacts he needs and he is not hurting himself by attacking the other candidates," Mr. Zogby said. "My guess is that Larocca is the only one of these four who's got legs."

Stocks Fall as Hong Kong's Slump Worsens

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The stock market fell sharply here today, as two new reports laid bare the depths of the Asian financial crisis and its impact on this former British colony.
First, Hong Kong's government reported that the economy shrank 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1998. The contraction was even sharper than the provisional figure of 2 percent the government released in June. And it confirmed that Hong Kong is headed into its deepest recession since World War II. 
 Second, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the leading bank here, announced that earnings fell 41 percent, to $791.16 million, in the first half of 1998 because of a huge charge taken to protect it from bad loans. HSBC Holdings P.L.C., the bank's London-based parent, said it took a $1.14 billion charge -- a jump of $889 million over a charge in the first half of 1997. As a result, HSBC said net profit for the first half fell 16 percent to $2.402 billion.
The provision for bad loans is one yardstick of how severe HSBC believes the financial crisis will be. Analysts said its size indicated that the bank expected many Asian companies to face financial hardship as the crisis wears on -- with a good number defaulting on their loans.
"What the market has to realize is that this is not the end, but the beginning," said Roy Ramos, a banking analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company in Hong Kong. "There will have to be more provisions for bad loans."
Although HSBC and the government made their announcements after the stock market here closed, investors had anticipated the bad news. The benchmark Hang Seng index of 33 leading issues fell 383.43 points, or 4.8 percent, to 7,552.77, worsening a market decline just over 8 percent in the two preceding weeks. HSBC, which accounts for a third of the weighted index, also slid nearly 5 percent today, to $179 (Hong Kong), or $23.25 (United States) a share.
 Early Tuesday, the Hang Seng index was up six-tenths of a percent, or 45.16 points, to 7,597.93.
 Government officials said today that Hong Kong's economic performance in the first quarter was worse than initially thought because declines in consumer spending and in tourism revenue were steeper than expected. K. Y. Tang, a government economist, said the rapid onset of the financial crisis had made it all but impossible to accurately forecast growth. But Mr. Tang acknowledged that -- with the latest trade and retail sales figures showing continued declines -- he expected the second quarter to be "somewhat worse" than the first. Private economists said Hong Kong's output would probably decline 3 percent in the second quarter.
"The only bright spot I can see is the normal seasonal pickup in trade in the fourth quarter," said Ian K. Perkin, chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. "But then we get into the problem of what happens in the first and second quarter of 1999."
Like many economists, Mr. Perkin said he worried that Hong Kong and other Asian economies faced several years of recession. Hong Kong's economy has been sapped by all the usual symptoms of the Asian economic ailment -- like an erosion of exports to its neighbors and a loss of consumer confidence -- and a few symptoms unique to this city. The trouble-prone opening of the Hong Kong airport disrupted cargo shipments, costing several hundred million dollars in exports.
All told, Mr. Perkin estimated that Hong Kong's gross domestic product would decline by 2 percent this year -- its first full year of contraction since the territory began keeping records in 1961.
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank is taking a similarly bleak view. It said it could not predict when Hong Kong or other markets would claw themselves out of their current trough. Executives at HSBC said the bulk of the $1.14 billion in bad-loan provisions was intended for loans to companies in Indonesia and Thailand.
Mr. Ramos noted, though, that the bank still needed to deal with loans to companies here and in South Korea, Malaysia and China. "We take a very strong premise that it is going to get worse in all these markets," he said.
At the moment, HSBC's nonperforming loans account for only 1.7 percent of all its loans in Hong Kong, and 6.9 percent of loans in the rest of Asia. But Mr. Ramos said he expected that the ratio of nonperforming loans could easily double in Hong Kong, and in some Asian markets -- like Thailand -- it could rise to as much as 30 percent of the bank's portfolio.
"In general, we've been taken aback by how severely economies in Asia have contracted," Mr. Ramos said. "And we've been taken aback by how high the ratio of nonperforming loans has risen."
HSBC executives noted, somewhat plaintively, that their underlying business was performing well. The bank's operating earnings before the bad-loan provision increased 13 percent, to $4.76 billion, in the first half. And HSBC's British and American operations both had solid profit gains.
But the bankers found it hard to accentuate the positive. Addressing a news conference in the bank's architecturally striking Hong Kong headquarters, John Bond, the group chairman of HSBC Holdings, said of the Asian crisis, "I think the speed and severity has caught everybody by surprise."

HEADLINE: Welcome to Grenada, Mr. Castro

 BODY:
A dictator who rules a country as long as Fidel Castro has governed Cuba sometimes gets to edit the history he helped create. Mr. Castro did just that over the weekend when he visited Grenada, the tiny Caribbean island the United States invaded almost 15 years ago in the name of preventing Cuban contamination in the hemisphere. Mr. Castro clearly savored the irony of his warm official greeting by the democratically elected Government of Prime Minister Keith Mitchell. He was welcomed with steel bands, a 21-gun salute and an official thank-you for Cuba's help in building the airport that Washington once viewed as a dangerous extension of Cuba's military reach into the eastern Caribbean.
The Cuban leader also got positive welcomes in Jamaica and Barbados, the first two stops in his tour of the English-speaking Caribbean. Six of the area's prime ministers have visited Havana in the past year and a half, and many of them are now pressing for Cuba's admission to the 16-nation Caribbean Community, a regional trade group. Further straining American ties with the Caribbean is a 90 percent drop in United States aid for the region between 1985 and 1995. Cuba has been quick to move into the breach with modest but appreciated programs of medical and technical assistance. 
 Meanwhile, Congress continues to treat Cuba as though the cold war had not ended. The Helms-Burton law of 1996, even though the Clinton Administration has been able to waive some of its most noxious provisions, denies the White House needed flexibility to modify America's 36-year-old economic embargo against Cuba to take account of changing circumstances. That embargo has failed to shake Mr. Castro's hold on power and hurts ordinary Cubans. It also runs counter to a theme of American foreign policy today, namely that increased trade and investment can be a useful mechanism for encouraging democratic change.
Despite harsh persecution by the Castro dictatorship, democrats within Cuba are pressing to expand the narrow legal boundaries of permitted political expression. The United States should reinforce their efforts to open up Cuban society by increasing its own official and unofficial contacts with the Cuban people. Isolation does not work.

Who Will Be Yanks' Newest Cable Guy?

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Each Yankees cable telecast should rightly be preceded by a notice like the ones that accompany public TV programs: "This game has been generously underwritten by a grant from the Madison Square Garden Network."
The MSG Network has made the Yankees flusher than flush since the start of their landmark $486 million cable TV contract in 1989. As the deal nears its end, MSG will pay the Yankees $53.3 million this year, $54.25 million next year and $55.25 million in 2000, according to people who have read the contract. 
 Most baseball teams survive on $45 million or $50 million a season less in cable cash. The entire National Hockey League gets less in its rights deal with Fox Sports.
But with the deal's expiration two years away, can the Yankees expect a new one to maintain such exorbitant payments -- or go even higher? When the deal was negotiated in 1988, it was the subject of rabid bidding among MSG, which wanted to become more than a six-month Knicks and Rangers service; Sportschannel New York, which had held the Yankee cable rights from 1982 to 1988, and Channel 11.
But now, Cablevision Systems owns MSG and Fox Sports New York, the former Sportschannel. Channel 11 is part of the WB Network and could not carry more than the 50 games it carries now under a subcontract with MSG.
"Probably less, as the WB expands," said Michael Eigner, who oversees Channel 11 as an executive vice president of the Tribune Company.
 So does Chuck Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, hold all the leverage? Can he dictate to George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, a significant cut in payments? Will Steinbrenner's cash wad shrink in the new millennium until he gets a new stadium?
No. No. And unlikely.
The Yankees' value has expanded in the past decade, almost making us forget the leanness of their 288-359 record from 1989 to 1992, the first four years of MSG's deal.
The Yankees are 78-28 after last night's victory in Oakland, and MSG's 3.88 rating after 63 games is up 51 percent from last year and 33 percent ahead of 1996's full-season MSG peak.
There are several scenarios that offer competition to Cablevision:
 Steinbrenner could create his own Yankee Network. For that he would have to set up an administrative structure to sell the rights to individual cable systems and commercial time to advertisers. He would get no cash up front, but would get all the cable system fees and advertiser payments. To execute the plan, he would need to make a deal with Cablevision, which owns systems totaling 2.6 million of the metropolitan area's 4.6 million cable homes. Dolan can be a tough negotiator, but any attempt to bar the Yankees from his systems would surely engender widespread viewer reaction.
 Steinbrenner could go into a partnership with Time Warner, which could create a sports channel on its New York City cable system, reaching 1.1 million subscribers. Time Warner would also have to deal with Cablevision to gain full local exposure beyond its environs. Can you imagine another entity starting a Yankee network and Dolan saying, "Nah, I'm not interested and my subscribers don't care"? Cable systems, including Dolan's, need the Yankees.
 ESPN could launch a regional sports channel. Until recently, ESPN contemplated creating ESPN West to carry games of the Anaheim Angels and Mighty Ducks, the teams controlled by its parent, Disney. When cable systems balked at carrying ESPN West, ESPN made 10-year deals to keep the Angels on Fox Sports West and the Ducks on Fox Sports West 2, two of the 22 regional sports outlets under the Fox Sports Net. A drawback to an ESPN New York is that it would remain a one-team service until other teams' rights became available. The Yankees plus college hoops and lacrosse is not a powerhouse channel. Josh Krulewitz, an ESPN spokesman, said, "We will consider regional opportunities if they make good business sense."
 New technologies, like digital television or satellite TV, could play a role in a non-Cablevision scenario.
"Chuck Dolan must realize George Steinbrenner has many options to work things out for himself," said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College and an expert on sports finance. "Steinbrenner has put an emphasis on developing a winning team in anticipation of negotiating a new package. He's played his cards right. I see this as a $50 million-a-year contract."
Dolan realizes all this and knows that not having the Yankees' cable rights would hurt more than the defection of any other team. If Yankees games were broadcast on the Yankee Network, you could expect that cable systems would, if necessary, pre-empt whatever was being shown on MSG to carry the Bronx Bombers.
Dolan knows this, which is why he tried to buy the Yankees last year. If he had bought the team, he would have acquired the cable rights to eternity, which the Fox Group did by buying the Dodgers. If he bought a chunk of the team, it would come with a continued cable deal. The talks never yielded a sale. But if there exists a price that would make Steinbrenner bite, it has risen thanks to the successful juggernaut the Yankees have been through 106 games.

When the young chief of Switzerland's drug police arrived here in late 1995 to inquire about $132 million found in Swiss bank accounts belonging to the influential elder brother of a former President, he knew enough about Mexico's political underworld to be wary of his official hosts.
No sooner had he been whisked from the airport by a squad of burly Mexican plainclothesmen, for example, than he began to wonder if he wasn't being kidnapped. 
 "I had seen it in the movies," the official, Valentin Roschacher, said, recalling what turned out to be merely some aggressive police security measures en route to his hotel. "I thought, 'Are these guys the good guys or the bad guys?' "
Now, more than two years later, Dr. Roschacher and his men have learned enough about organized crime in Mexico to follow a complicated financial trail and information from convicted drug traffickers to the conclusion that Raul Salinas de Gortari earned vast of sums of his money by assuring the safe transport of cocaine through Mexico to the United States.
Yet while the Swiss are preparing to use that evidence in a civil court action to confiscate the fortune of Mr. Salinas, the elder brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a much larger and more experienced group of law enforcement officials in the United States has been unable to make a similar case of their own.
Some of those officials say they may yet win criminal indictments. Privately, others acknowledge that Washington's pursuit of Mr. Salinas has been troubled from the start, with turf battles among law enforcement agencies and Federal prosecutors, disputes over the handling of witnesses and complaints from agents in the field of meddling and a lack of interest by higher-ups.
The secrecy with which both Governments have proceeded makes it impossible to fully evaluate their evidence before it is presented in court, and Mr. Salinas has denied any wrongdoing.
Justice Department officials are also quick to note that they have sought to build a criminal case, which entails a higher standard of proof than the Swiss will face.
Nonetheless, the unlikely initial success of Dr. Roschacher's small detective team has turned an unflattering mirror on Washington's handling of what United States officials once described as a watershed effort to confront not just the flow of drugs through Mexico into the United States, but also the complex system of official corruption that has long allowed it to flourish.
The contrast is even more striking, officials say, because the Swiss appear to have relied almost entirely on witnesses and information that were first uncovered by the United States.
"They're like the mouse that roared," one former senior American law enforcement official said of the Swiss authorities. "They were blocked almost every step of the way. But they just kept going and kept going, and they finally made a case."
Whether any of the investigations will definitively resolve the question of the Salinas family's alleged collusion with the drug trade remains far from clear.
A partial account of the Swiss and United States inquiries, assembled from government documents and dozens of interviews, suggests that neither has penetrated into the brothers' inner circle.
But some experienced investigators have concluded that someone like Raul Salinas could have been a valued asset for the traffickers even if he could not necessarily pick up the phone and call off police raids. He might have been paid off, they said, just to provide an impression of acquiescence at the highest levels.
"Raul Salinas was not somebody who protected a truck with a gun as it went to the border," Dr. Roschacher said in an interview at his office in Bern, the Swiss capital. "What we are talking about is a system -- a system in which a person can give orders to someone who gives orders to someone else."
Raul Salinas, who remains in a maximum-security prison in Mexico on charges of ordering the murder of a leading figure in the governing party, has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence. He has insisted that most of the money in his accounts was given to him by Mexican industrialists for an investment fund that he was to establish.
"I have never had any kind of dealings with drug traffickers, nor have I received any benefit or money from any drug trafficker," he told the Swiss Attorney General, Carla del Ponte, in a handwritten letter from prison two months ago. "The source of my money, and of all the money that I managed, is legitimate."
Carlos Salinas, who left office just before the Mexican economy collapsed at the end of 1994 and soon left the country, has never been charged with any crime. He lives in Ireland and the south of France, one of his old friends said, waiting impatiently for some judgment more generous than the one a bitter Mexican public has handed down.
 
The Swiss Case
American Help Is Slow to Arrive
Within months after the Swiss police found Raul Salinas's bank accounts on a tip from United States drug agents, his case entangled some of Mexico's biggest businessmen, as well as banks in Mexico, the United States, Britain and France. Initially, though, Swiss officials saw nothing remarkable in the notion that a foreign leader's relative might have stashed illicit wealth in their banks.
"I thought it's just a case like any other case," Dr. Roschacher said.
Like the hidden fortunes of Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, the Salinas accounts presented an opportunity for the embattled Swiss to show that the proceeds of political corruption would no longer be safe in their vaults. There was another incentive as well: whatever part of Raul Salinas's money the Government could convincingly tie to drugs, officials said, it would be able to keep under Swiss law.
In Bern, Dr. Roschacher had three hard-working detectives and the support of Mrs. del Ponte, the plain-spoken Attorney General who has earned a wide reputation for pressing to open up Switzerland's banks. He had little else.
After years of collaboration with American law enforcement agencies, Swiss officials assumed that they could count on their help. Instead, banking and credit card records took months to arrive. Interviews with convicted drug smugglers and other witnesses from United States court cases were sometimes slow to be granted, sometimes postponed and sometimes refused.
By the second half of 1996, with the Swiss under pressure to show progress, tempers began to rise. At one point, officials said, as Mrs. Del Ponte was trying to interview one American-supplied informant in the presence of a fastidious Federal prosecutor from New York, she exploded in anger and later fired off a letter to her counterpart, Attorney General Janet Reno.
"Sometimes we have had difficulties coordinating our procedures," Mrs. del Ponte said euphemistically, emphasizing her gratitude for the American help that eventually arrived. "Of course, when I am over there and the public prosecutor says to me, 'You cannot ask this question,' I am going to get angry."
 
The American Fumble
Distractions For the F.B.I.
In Washington, law enforcement officials had far more investigative resources and more knowledge of the mechanics of Mexican corruption. But they also found themselves struggling to move their sometimes rivalrous agencies and prosecutors in the same direction at the same time.
The rumors that circulated about Raul Salinas during his brother's presidency centered on the notion that he had grown rich from the kickbacks of Mexican businessmen whom he might have helped to win lucrative deals from the Government.
United States drug enforcement, customs and F.B.I. agents also received reports linking him to at least two major Mexican cocaine smugglers.
Drug enforcement officials said the reports were startling, but not enough to merit a special inquiry. That view quickly changed after the discovery of the Swiss accounts, but after some bureaucratic struggle it was the F.B.I.'s office in New York, where Mr. Salinas had also banked, that was finally assigned the investigation.
Bureau officials said the inquiry was important because its targets were high-profile: Mr. Salinas, who had moved tens of millions of dollars through Citibank, and officers in the bank's private-client section, who appeared to have helped him without trying very hard to verify the legitimacy of his funds.
Still, people familiar with the inquiry said it had not been a primary focus of the bureau office, which was soon consumed by its investigation of T.W.A. Flight 800.
"It wasn't a big man-burner," said one former senior official, noting that the inquiry had focused more on the trail of financial transactions rather than on the history of Mr. Salinas's supposed misdeeds. "It was a paper chase."
At offices of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington, Mexico and Texas, agents were turning their attention to Mexico's new cocaine kingpin, Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Again, there was a thin record of informants who said Raul Salinas had met with Mr. Carrillo and his associates, received money from the trafficker's operations or helped insure the movement of his loads.
Officials said they knew they would be hard pressed to turn such intelligence information into witnesses who could stand up in court and convincingly accuse the brother of a former Mexican President. But some complained that the greater challenge was navigating the disparate and sometimes competing investigations going on around the United States.
 
The Breakthrough
The Swiss Sleuths Start to Get Lucky
For months after Mrs. del Ponte's confrontation with the New York prosecutor, two officials said, the Swiss authorities' access to American informants all but dried up. They had yet to link Raul Salinas solidly to the drug trade. And the outcry over Swiss handling of the bank accounts of Nazi victims was adding to pressure on the Government to prove its vows of greater openness.
Then, little more than a year into the effort, the investigators' luck began to turn.
"We had a chance to talk to witnesses who knew a lot about what had happened in Mexico," Dr. Roschacher said. "For the first time, they were people who knew things concretely -- 'I was there; I saw that' -- and not by hearsay."
Not long afterward, though, Swiss investigators also began to see the confidentiality of their witnesses start to erode as information leaked to news organizations, particularly in Mexico, raising questions about Mr. Salinas's accusers.
One such witness, officials said, was Marco E. Torres, a Mexican smuggler who pleaded guilty to drug charges in the United States in 1996 and received a reduced sentence for his cooperation.
Two officials familiar with his statements said Mr. Torres had asserted that he had arranged the protection of cocaine shipments with Raul Salinas and paid him one large bribe himself after a drug seizure in Mexico in 1993.
But parts of Mr. Torres's account, including his claim to having known the Salinas brothers for years, were refuted by Mr. Salinas's lawyers after they were first reported last year.
Dr. Roschacher said he was not sidetracked by such particulars.
"As long as no one can say, 'He is a notorious liar -- we have checked and what he says is wrong,' then for us he is a witness and we take a look at him," he said. "Our case is not built on Marco Torres. His credibility is good. But we have several others who are as good or better."
Swiss officials would not identify those other witnesses, saying their names would be disclosed only to judges who will review the matter if, as expected, lawyers for Mr. Salinas challenge the confiscation of his accounts.
But starting in early 1997, for reasons that remain unclear, the spigot of United States assistance opened wider. The Justice Department arranged for Swiss interviews with almost a dozen more witnesses, officials said, including at least three convicted drug smugglers who offered detailed information linking Mr. Salinas to specific payoffs.
Mexican officials also produced records showing that during the last half of his brother's six-year administration, Raul Salinas had made huge deposits in Mexican banks.
In an interview, Mrs. del Ponte said the evidence made it clear that he had been "directly involved in receiving money for protecting the shipment of tons of cocaine through Mexico."
 
The Misgivings
Political Pressure? A Nagging Suspicion
Precisely how Mr. Salinas might have arranged such protection -- without ever having worked in law enforcement and having left the Government altogether in 1992 -- was a question that law enforcement officials struggled to answer.
Mexican investigators said they had focused closely on a relationship between Raul Salinas and one of his closest business associates, Justo Ceja, who served as Carlos Salinas's private secretary and is a fugitive from charges that he illegally amassed a large fortune while in the Government.
Raul Salinas's accountant was arrested in mid-July on similar charges, and Mr. Salinas's wife was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for putting pressure on witnesses to lie in the murder proceedings against her husband.
Investigators said they had also determined that Mr. Salinas and Mr. Ceja had had dealings with several senior Mexican law enforcement officials, each of whom has since been accused publicly of taking bribes. But the only one of those former officials to ever be charged with drug offenses, Mario Ruiz Massieu, has shown little promise as a Government witness.
United States officials said drug enforcement agents in Mexico City, Houston and El Paso who had tried to build their own case against Mr. Salinas had found several informants by the spring of last year who had told of drug payoffs that Raul Salinas had supposedly received. Two of those witnesses, in particular, gave detailed accounts of having seen Mr. Salinas meeting with major drug traffickers.
The two most important informants were taken from Mexico to Texas, officials said, where they submitted to lie-detector tests and appeared at first to be telling the truth. But under what agents described as unusual high-level pressure to recheck the men's stories, they were given further tests, in which they appeared to be less candid. In May 1997, officials said, the United States Attorney in San Antonio abandoned the case.
"We knew there was an enormous political component to the case," said one former law enforcement official who worked on it. "But the Justice Department, without ever saying so, appeared not to want us to deal with the political targets. They wanted us just to concentrate on the drug traffickers."
Similar questions have been raised since the announcement in April by Citibank's parent company, Citicorp, that it will merge with Travelers Group Inc. -- a $70 billion corporate marriage that could conceivably snag if the bank is ensnared in a major money-laundering case.
Justice Department officials declined to discuss the Salinas investigation in detail. But they denied that their problems in making a case had anything to do with political or foreign policy concerns.
Still more doubts about Washington's coordination of the Salinas case were raised by two other key witnesses, a Chilean-born computer expert named Guillermo Pallomari and a Colombian cocaine trafficker named Jose Manuel Ramos.
Mr. Pallomari, a former aide to the main boss of the Cali cocaine cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, fled Colombia in August 1995 after threats on his life and was interviewed by American drug enforcement agents for nearly three months.
But officials familiar with the debriefings said he had never been asked in detail how the Colombians had protected their shipments through Mexico, and some officials were stunned to learn what Mr. Pallomari, now a protected witness, told the Swiss last Nov. 19 at a Federal prison in southern Virginia where American officials took him to be debriefed.
According to officials familiar with his debriefings and a partial transcript of his statement recently published in the Mexican newspaper El Universal, Mr. Pallomari said the Colombians began to strengthen their partnership with Mr. Carrillo, the Mexican trafficker, about 1992, after problems with their operations in the Caribbean.
Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela also tried to replicate in Mexico the network of political protection he had established in Colombia, Mr. Pallomari said.
To that end, the informant said, Cali bosses drafted a manual on political corruption and sent a copy to Mr. Carrillo. They also funneled some $80 million in bribe money to Mexico -- about half of which was supposed to have gone to Raul Salinas to assure the compliance of his brother's administration, Mr. Pallomari said.
He said the money had been sent with cocaine loads, deposited with front companies or paid through a Bolivian intermediary whom the Colombians had stationed in Mexico. On one occasion, he said, Raul Salinas intervened at the Colombians' request to get back most of a five-ton cocaine load that the police had seized in Acapulco in early 1994 with American help.
Mr. Pallomari also showed the Swiss how payments to Mexican politicians were reflected in a partial set of 1994 accounting ledgers that were seized from the Cali cartel by an elite Colombian police unit in 1995.
Officials said Mr. Pallomari's story had some inconsistencies, but they did not question that it might have been vital to the drug enforcement agents in Texas who were then trying to tie Mr. Salinas to Mr. Carrillo's enterprise.
In the end, those agents did not learn even the outlines of Mr. Pallomari's account until a year and a half after he came under United States protection. When law enforcement officials from around the country caucused in El Paso in January 1997 to assemble the available evidence against Mr. Carrillo's organization, officials said, Mr. Pallomari's information was about the best they had against Mr. Salinas.
But Mr. Pallomari was unavailable. Federal prosecutors in Miami said they could not lend their witness until they had finished their own case against the Cali gang. Long before they did, the drug conspiracy case that might have linked Mr. Salinas to Mr. Carrillo collapsed when the trafficker died after plastic surgery last July.
United States prosecutors were apparently even less successful in coordinating the information offered by Mr. Ramos, a former lieutenant to the Colombian drug cartel based in the city of Medellin.
Two people familiar with Mr. Ramos's case said he approached prosecutors in Houston in 1991, the year he was sentenced on drug charges to two life terms in prison. He met Raul Salinas in the late 1980's, he told them, and contracted with him to arrange and protect the landing of drug planes in different parts of northern Mexico.
One American official said doubts lingered about part of Mr. Ramos's account, and his credibility was challenged by a Federal prosecutor who doubted that he had been forthright about another Colombian drug operation that had been discovered in Texas.
But Mr. Ramos offered unusual documentation to corroborate his claims: encoded payment ledgers, photographs and even a special Mexican passport that he had received under the carefully chosen alias Alejandro Salinas.
Still, two people familiar with the case said Mr. Ramos was all but ignored until late 1997, when the United States Customs Service arranged for him to be interviewed by a Federal prosecutor in New York and then by the Swiss authorities. "He knocked on the door several times," one of those people said. "He was rebuffed each and every time."

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK: Dr. Peter S. Raven;
Through Politicking for Plants, He Made His Garden Grow

BYLINE: By NANCY BETH JACKSON 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
Peter S. Raven jumps up from the conference table at midsentence and disappears out the door, returning loaded down with a stack of fat books. He picks up the conversation as though he never left.
"These are my babies," he says, patting the latest volumes in "The Flora of China" and "The Flora of North America" series chronicling "survivors and new species." 
 While Dr. Raven, botanist, evolutionary biologist and director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, has not been out there picking all the daisies himself, his "biopoliticking" and networking lurk behind the collaborative projects to catalogue and understand plants all over the world.
The same biopoliticking behind the "Flora" series surfaced last month with the announcement that the Missouri Botanical Garden, Washington University, the University of Missouri and Monsanto Company would be partners in a new $146 million Donald Danforth Plant Science Center.
Supporters say it will be the largest plant science center in the world and turn St. Louis -- already renowned among botanists because of the garden -- into an agricultural Silicon Valley when it opens in 2000.
"I specialize in networking," Dr. Raven said. "There is an enormous kind of pleasure in working with people, helping them to realize what they want to do. I like to link people." Jonathan Kleinbard, a former University of Chicago vice president who recently became the garden's deputy director, said his boss "likes to have 27 balls in the air."
Indeed.
Since 1971, when he left an associate professorship at Stanford University with no more administrative experience than "part-time access" to a secretary, Dr. Raven has turned a rather scruffy patch of real estate in a decaying urban neighborhood into an international center of biodiversity research and activism, a community magnet and one of the nation's largest herbariums.
And, he quickly added, the fastest expanding collection in the world, with 120,000 specimens added each year and at least a dozen staff taxonomists collecting somewhere in the world at any given time.
When Dr. Raven arrived at the garden as a 35-year-old Californian with no particular plan in mind, he found 85 employees and a budget of $650,000. Today, he directs a staff of 354, including 55 researchers with Ph.D.'s, and oversees a budget of $20 million. The New York Botanical Garden, by comparison, has a staff of about 100, including 30 Ph.D.'s. Recently, the Missouri garden opened an $8.6 million research center, housing a 122,000-volume library, nearly five million herbarium specimens and the TROPICOS database -- http://mobot.mobot.org/Pick/Search/pick.html, which averages over a million hits a month.
Known locally as Shaw's Garden, the place was created in 1859 by Henry Shaw, a major landowner who made his fortune selling goods to traders and pioneers headed west.
An amateur botanist, Shaw worked with George Engleman, a physician and botanist, to create a center for education, research and horticultural display. Shaw also endowed a school of botany at Washington University, a link between garden and university that continues today with the director holding a tenured seat on the faculty, teaching graduate students.
By the early 20's, the garden had built a national reputation for research and training, but by the time Dr. Raven arrived it was, as he describes it, "like an art museum with exhibits only in a few rooms."
Only 10 acres were laid out in gardens -- most of the 79 acres Henry Shaw had set aside still looked like the treeless prairie it once was. Dr. Raven set to work not only gardening but also building support.
A 1982 election gave the garden access to property tax revenues, which now make up 28.9 percent of the budget. An additional 30.4 percent comes from contributions, bequests and memberships, now over 30,000.
Over 250,000 people visit the garden each year, wandering through the living rain forest, feeding giant carp in the Japanese Garden, strolling through the Victorian Garden or the Rock Garden or the English Woodland Garden or simply admiring sculpture by Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, Carl Milles or Frank Stella. Gardeners get tips; jazz and gospel fans come to concerts. Children troop through on class outings.
Dr. Raven never misses a chance to get people involved -- in St. Louis and beyond.
But unlike Candide, he is not content to cultivate his own garden. He travels the world -- Washington, Australia, India, China, the Vatican are ticketed these days -- not to collect plants but to stir others to action, build human networks and promote biodiversity in the face of development. He makes speeches, lobbies politicians and corporate leaders, puts scientists together with research projects.
Locally, he has been grand marshal of the Veiled Prophet Parade, a St. Louis institution for some 120 years, and served on the University of Missouri board of curators. When he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame two years ago, he joined Henry Shaw, Ulysses S. Grant, Josephine Baker, Stan Musial as famous folk with roots or other important links to St. Louis.
And if there is any doubt of his local commitment, Dr. Raven says "Missour-ah," not "Missour-ee."
On the national level he is home secretary of the National Academy of Sciences, chairman of the report review committee of the National Research Council, member of the committee for research and exploration of the National Geographic Society. He also serves on the President's Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology and this year chaired a While House panel on environmental and economic strategies.
Dr. Raven has been a National Science Foundation fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, a MacArthur Fellow, headed the Botanical Society of America, the Society for the Study of Evolution, the American Society of Naturalists, the American Institute of Biological Sciences and then some. He has written 18 books and more than 450 articles.
"I have the type of personality that likes to be interrupted constantly," he said. "I like a lot of things in play. I get rejuvenated by noise and interruptions and have a great power of recall."
Dr. Raven, born in Shanghai in 1936 into a family of American bankers, counts as ancestors Mayflower pilgrims and a British Redcoat, but the strongest DNA may come from his maternal grandfather's grandfather: Patrick Breen, who arrived in California in 1847 after spending the winter snowbound with the Donner Party in the Sierra Nevadas. Of the 87 pioneers, only 46 survived, including all 9 of the Breens.
Now, at 62, Dr. Raven is doing what he began doing at age 6: exploring nature. An only child, he read a book on insects when he was sick in bed and then began growing caterpillars into butterflies. That led to exploring vacant lots around San Francisco in search of plant specimens. At 8, he became the youngest member of the California Academy of Sciences.
By 10, he was comparing field notes with Alice Eastwood, the grand old lady of California botany, then 90. At 12, he joined the Sierra Club and ended up sharing a tent with Ledyard Stebbins, who has been called one of the foremost plant evolutionary biologists of the century. At 16, he discovered a Clarkia franciscana, a member of the evening primrose, which had not been seen in Marin County since 1900; a subspecies, Ravenii, was later named in his honor.
Hardly surprising, he chose academic studies in botany, graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California at Berkeley and obtaining a Ph.D. from the University of California at Los Angeles. He was networking even then.
"As a graduate student," he said, "I had 15 other graduate students working on the evening primrose. They said I was the only graduate student to have graduate students."
At Stanford, after a postdoctoral fellowship, he began looking beyond botany toward evolution and biodiversity. He and a colleague, Dr. Paul Ehrlich, came up with a theory of co-evolution, a process in which species change as the species they interact with change. But they also became increasingly worried about what was going on in the world.
"We began thinking about population," Dr. Raven said. "In the late 60's, we became concerned about plant extinction. We began to put it all together. The real problem was that the kinds of things we liked to study were disappearing."
And he started worrying about how many more species were disappearing than being created and about what was happening to the rain forest before botanists had even started to find out what was there.
Ticktock, ticktock. At the Garden's Climatron, a flashing electronic bank counts down the disappearing acres of rain forest. Dr. Raven also frets about topsoil, the ozone layer, skin cancer, cutting down forests without replacing them, industrial wastes, global warming. His warnings often have him labeled a pessimist.
"The 1990's and the first few decades of the 21st century are likely to be the most tumultuous and destructive of the natural resources of our planet that we may ever face," he has written.
"We can either decide to be conservative in dealing with biodiversity -- such species are of such fundamental importance to us, and their loss is absolute and irreversible -- or we can recklessly conclude, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that what we are destroying is not important to us."
But not everyone likes the strategies he chooses to save ecological systems. He bets on multinationals.
"The way I see it," Dr. Raven said, "multinational corporations are one of the best vehicles to achieve global sustainability. Unlike governments, which can pretend there is no global warming because they can live from election to election, the corporations can't live in fantasy. They have to return value to shareholders."
He and the garden have been criticized by various groups for working with corporations, particularly Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis. The garden's new research center is named the Monsanto Center and Monsanto is a major donor in the new plant science center, which will explore genetic engineering, leading to commercial applications.
Dr. Raven dismissed such criticism as he spewed out numbers of things that were disappearing. A man with a cause, he can wear out board directors, committee members, politicians, academics and critics with his enthusiasm.
Now he is after Pope John Paul II. Dr. Raven will be going to Rome three times in the next six months in an effort to persuade the Pope to join his crusade, and he plans to push hard for the concept of "sustainability," or preservation of the earth's resources.
"If I can get the Pope to put sustainability higher on his agenda, present it as a world problem," Dr. Raven said as though talking to himself, "then I would be very successful and happy."

HEADLINE: Russia Needs True Reform, Not Higher Taxes

BYLINE: By Michael McFaul; Michael McFaul is a professor of political science at Stanford University, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
Russia's Government has come up with a new cure for the country's economic ills: higher taxes. A chorus of Western officials, including International Monetary Fund bureaucrats and Vice President Al Gore during his trip to Moscow last month, have praised the Government's new financial plan, which includes big tax increases, as important steps to advance reform.
The problem with this prescription is that the Russian economy produces very little to tax. Russia does need a more rationalized tax code, which might help collect revenue from a handful of oil and gas companies that do generate profits. But the vast majority of Russian companies are bankrupt and have been operating at a loss for several years. 
 Neither the $22.6 billion I.M.F. bailout nor the Yeltsin Government's so-called anti-crisis program addresses this deeper cause of Russia's economic problems: poorly defined property rights and the consequent dearth of profit-making companies.
In 1992, the Russian Government began an ambitious effort to privatize most of the economy. Two years later, Russia (and its Western advisers) trumpeted the program's success as more than 100,000 enterprises were declared to be in private hands.
While speedy, this privatization program did not produce effective owners or profitable enterprises. Instead, insiders -- that is, Soviet-era enterprise directors in cahoots with trade union officials loyal to them -- gained controlling shares at three-quarters of all large enterprises. These insider owners were interested first and foremost in securing control of their companies and thereby maintaining their jobs. Attracting investment or expanding market share were distant, secondary concerns.
Because these directors do not report to outside shareholders interested in profits, they have avoided pressure to become more efficient, to downsize and improve their products. Through complex arbitrage schemes, delays in paying workers and the stripping of assets, these directors can amass individual wealth while their companies continue to operate in the red.
Under market conditions, the companies would be forced into bankruptcy. Their assets would be reorganized and auctioned off, and either new owners interested in making profits would assume control or the enterprises would be shut down. In Russia, however, bankruptcies rarely occur. Instead, the state has continued to subsidize ailing companies, initially through direct state transfers and now by allowing these companies to not pay taxes or bills owed to other enterprises.
Given these conditions at the grass roots, the Russian Government's plan to raise revenue will not have any sustainable effect. No matter what the tax rate, you cannot generate revenue by taxing bankrupt businesses. Collecting taxes from the handful of companies that do generate profits is a necessary but only short-term solution. After all, most of these profit-making companies are owed huge sums from the same Government-supported, bankrupt enterprises.
At some point, the Russian state must break this vicious cycle by enforcing bankruptcy procedures as the first step toward restructuring enterprises, establishing real property rights and ultimately finding new, more responsible owners for the country's industries. The new owners, it must be remembered, will invest only under the right conditions, which include lower interest rates, state protection of their property and lower -- not higher -- taxes.
Those with a stake in the status quo are quick to warn that an embrace of a real free market risks creating more pain for the people and igniting social unrest. When companies are allowed to go bankrupt, workers lose their jobs.
But in contrast to Russia's first attempt at privatization, this next attempt should not be undertaken at all enterprises simultaneously. By moving more methodically, the Government can build a case that bankruptcy is necessary to clear away growth-stifling debt and to make companies more productive.
Here is where Western assistance can be most useful. Instead of allowing the Government to keep bankrupt companies afloat, Western money can help construct a social safety net so that Russian companies get out of the welfare business. Without this fundamental shift, enterprise directors will continue to blackmail the state by threatening mass layoffs of workers, and the workers will continue at their jobs even if they are only sporadically paid. And investors will keep their money elsewhere.
Areal social safety net in Russia would be expensive, but would it be any more expensive than the current I.M.F. bailout? Twenty-two billion dollars would pay for a lot of unemployment checks and job retraining programs.
Carrying out these reforms would take years, if not decades. And they can occur only if the I.M.F. remains engaged in Russia for the long haul.
But Western assistance should continue only if the Russian Government is committed to allowing real private control of its industries. The consequence of continuing to subsidize bankrupt enterprises will only be even more expensive bailouts down the road -- no matter how high the tax rate climbs.

HEADLINE: TEST KITCHEN;
Lemon Zesters, From Cruel to Cool

BYLINE: By Amanda Hesser 

 BODY:
THE lemon zester has a handy, if a bit esoteric, function. When its head is pressed against the skin of a lemon or other citrus fruit and dragged along the contours, it strips fine curly strands of rind.
Lemon zest is filled with essential flavoring oils that infuse dishes with the fruit's evocative essence. It can be added either whole or finely chopped to everything from marinades to cake batter. 
 A sharp, precise zester -- a straight-handled tool with a flat metal head rimmed with five holes -- will produce strips about an inch or two long and a millimeter or so wide. The strips should be neither so deep that they cut into the pith, which is bitter, nor so shallow that they merely skim off the top layer of skin.
Most zesters work, but few shine. J. A. Henckels makes various models, including one that sells for as much as $12 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street); (212) 787-2000. But a less expensive model, in the company's International Gourmet series, works much better. The head is angled so that the holes dig into the lemon skin, making uniform strands of zest. The zester is sold at Lechters stores for $5.99.
Econome, a French brand, has a zester that is absolutely cruel to the hand, with a hard plastic handle that was designed with no apparent regard for ergonomics. The zester is sharp and effective, but not without a good amount of elbow grease. It is $8.50 at Williams-Sonoma stores.
Until Oxo came along, it seems little attention was paid to comfort. The company, whose kitchen equipment is known for its black rubber, ergonomically correct handles, has two zester models, which outshone nine others I tested. They not only worked superbly but were also comfortable enough that if you had to zest a bucket of lemons, you could.
Oxo's original model -- sold at the Vinegar Factory, 431 East 91st Street, (212) 987-0885, for $4.99 -- has a fat straight black rubber handle, with a wide zester head. The stainless steel head is a little long, giving you less control, but it zests almost flawlessly.
Oxo hired Smart Design, a Manhattan company, to come up with its latest zester model, which will be available in September. Tim Kennedy, the head of the design team, said that the designers bought as many models as they could find and tested them to see their faults. Most zester blades, he found, were too flexible, hampering their ability to grip the fruit, and the handles were too small and thin to fit comfortably in the hand for long-term use.
For the new zester, the designers used a high-grade stainless steel for the head and created a short, rounded handle that rests snugly in the palm. They placed an indent where the handle meets the head, so that the index finger can rest there when pressure is applied to the lemon. The head is also short, so that the hand is close to the lemon, giving the user more control. It will cost about $5.99. For orders or information on retailers: (800) 545-4411.
Many zesters, including the two Oxos and one made by Hoffritz, are equipped with a stripper, which removes a single, wider strip of peel. If you drink martinis with a twist, you know the dimensions well. (It is, in fact, the only good use I know of for a stripper.) The strip is about two inches long and one-eighth inch wide.
A stripper is either a thin circle, like an eyelet, on the side of the zester head, or a pointed wedge pressed into the center of the zester head. Unfortunately, both designs are often positioned so that only right-handed people can use them; for everyone, eyelet strippers generally work more easily.
There is an alternative to buying a zester: wide flat strips of peel can be removed with a vegetable peeler and then cut into thinner strips. But it takes longer and fails to open up as many of the oily cells as a good-quality zester does.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
The Art of Film, via Brat and Brooder

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
If you had to boil down the personalities of the filmmakers Lars von Trier and Krzysztof Kieslowski into snappy cliches, Mr. von Trier might be described as a mischievous spoiled brat and Kieslowski (who died in 1996) as a gloomy neurotic fatalist. At least that is how these distinguished international directors appear in two short documentary portraits that opened today at the Film Forum as a double bill.
Both Stig Bjorkman's "Tranceformer: A Portrait of Lars von Trier," and Krzysztof Wierzbicki's "Krzysztof Kieslowski: I'm So-So," cut back and forth between interviews with their subjects and snippets of their films in hurried, only partly successful attempts to relate what they say about themselves to the images in their films. Both subjects appear wary of being interviewed. But once they start talking, both take an almost exhibitionistic pleasure in making extreme statements. 
 In the opening moments of "Tranceformer," Mr. von Trier, who exudes a Mephistophelean playfulness, announces cheekily that everything that's been written about him is a lie. "My whole life is a fabrication," he insists. He goes on to complain about his overly permissive upbringing by Communist-sympathizing Danish Jews whom he describes as "radical middle-class academics." His contempt for his upbringing is exemplified by the story of his mother, who returned from a visit to Yugoslavia exalting it as "the ideal society." The director then points to the country's subsequent disintegration to show how deluded she was.
As an adult, he is besieged with phobias that disappear only when he is immersed in work. Reflecting on the medium of film, he describes it as a "startlingly artificial product" that is paradoxically still capable of revealing some truth. The theme he is most interested in exploring, he says, is evil. And an actor in Mr. von Trier's acclaimed television serial, "The Kingdom," declares that the series is essentially the filmmaker's vision of the world as hell. At the end of the film, Mr. von Trier tells a story about having seen a U.F.O. as a child, then announces it is a lie. By this time, it's clear he's a more serious artist than he would like to let on.
Where Mr. von Trier is indefatigably puckish, Kieslowski conveys the sadness of a world-weary sage. The movie opens with frivolous evaluations of the Polish filmmaker by a graphologist, a clairvoyant, a psychotherapist and a priest, among other observers. But once the interview begins in earnest, Kieslowski emerges as a brooding intellectual and habitual pessimist who believes his social status is much higher than he deserves. When he visited the United States, he recalls, he was amazed at "the pursuit of empty talk combined with a very high degree of self-satisfaction."
Kieslowski seems incapable of self-satisfaction, and when the idea is put forth that he could be a political force in Poland, he insists he wouldn't want the responsibility. Brought up Roman Catholic in hard times, he has retained what he calls a "personal and private" relationship with God. But more than religion, what apparently shaped Kieslowski's cinematic vision was the experience of growing up in an economically depressed Communist country where freedom of speech was suppressed. The movie's most striking image is a montage from an early Kieslowski film of the grim, wizened, despairing faces of residents of Lodz.
"I have one good characteristic," he says without irony. "I am a pessimist. I always imagine the worst. To me the future is a black hole."
A year after uttering these words, Kieslowski was dead.

HEADLINE: The Politics of Poverty

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Nadine Gordimer ("Dare to Dream of Eradicating Poverty," Op-Ed, Aug. 1) gives a useful list of development goals for the next decade, namely, providing food, shelter, work and training for those in need. But she omits one of the most important prerequisites for eradicating poverty: the necessity for political empowerment of the poor. 
 With economic inequality increasing, foreign aid budgets falling, unpaid United Nations dues piling up and developing countries becoming increasingly marginalized in institutions like the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, there are few practical grounds for believing that the United Nations' Decade for the Eradication of Poverty will be any more successful than the United Nations' Development Decades, the fourth of which closes in 2000.

HEADLINE: U.S. Privatization Move Threatens Agreement to Buy Enriched Uranium From Russia

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
A $12 billion deal to turn surplus bomb uranium in Russia into fuel for American nuclear power plants is threatened by recent moves that will cut uranium prices and give Russia less revenue.
The governmental agreement, drawn up in 1992, was intended to prevent Russia's highly enriched uranium, the fuel for the simplest nuclear bomb, from falling into the wrong hands and to provide hard currency to the cash-starved Russian Government. 
 It called for the United States to buy 500 tons of highly enriched uranium from 1995 to 2005, enough to supply tens of thousands of nuclear bombs. The United States was to have diluted the uranium, sold it to civilian power plants and given the Russians ordinary uranium in exchange.
In addition the Russians assumed that they would receive $8 billion for the enriched uranium and $4 billion by selling the ordinary uranium over 20 years.
By Jan. 1, 1998 the United States had taken delivery of 36 tons of uranium.
But the agreement has hit a snag. Last month the United States sold the Federal uranium-processing operation that is supposed to do much of the work for the deal with Russia.
And that company, the United States Enrichment Corporation, is planning to sell off a great deal of its own uranium, more than 70 million pounds.
That is certain to lower uranium prices, possibly to half of what the Russians were expecting, market analysts said.
The Russians are crying foul, and they are casting doubt on a variety of aspects of Russian-American nuclear cooperation.
"The transfer of the 78 million pounds of uranium to the enrichment corporation was a huge mistake," Pete V. Domenici, the Republican of New Mexico who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said. "The ripple effects of that decision will probably result in a national security issue of high importance."
Administration officials concede that lower prices are quite likely and that the uranium that Russia wants to sell will be worth less. But the officials add that they do not believe that the changes will scuttle the deal.
"Russia's fundamental economic interest is to continue to carry out the agreement," said a White House official who insisted on anonymity, because Russia would still earn money from the enriched uranium and would be able to sell the natural uranium.
Even if the Russians cannot sell all the natural uranium they want at desirable prices, "our judgment is they will follow that fundamental economic interest," the official said. He predicted that Russia would continue with the part of the deal that requires it to blend down the bomb-grade material.
But the official conceded that "there may very well need to be further negotiations."
In Moscow, Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov, was less sanguine. In a letter to Mr. Domenici he said the prospects for the agreement were "dramatically deteriorating."
The privatization, he wrote, "constitutes deviation of the U.S. party from the implementation of agreed provisions."
He said the move made it harder for him to win approval for strategic-arms agreements and for American participation in projects to secure nuclear materials in Russia.
Another Administration official in Washington suggested that the complaints by the private uranium companies might simply be an effort to obtain the material from the Russians more cheaply.
Maj. Gen. William F. Burns, the former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency who negotiated the original deal, said the accord was threatened now.
"Right now," General Burns said, "it seems that we have our priorities mixed up, and we've allowed a commercial good to overcome a national security goal, and I think that's wrong."
The deal is a multistep arrangement in which the Russians are selling a service, the enrichment, to the enrichment corporation and are seeking to sell a commodity, the uranium itself, to a group of international uranium companies.
The Federal Government wants to pay to buy the enrichment, but not the uranium itself, a little like paying for the value of cleaning and pressing a shirt, but not the shirt.
Uranium as found in nature is a mixture of two types, and separating them to obtain the fissionable material most useful in bombs and reactors is called enrichment. Less than 1 percent of the natural mix is uranium 235, which is fissionable. Bomb-grade uranium is more than 90 percent uranium 235.
After having painstakingly concentrated the uranium 235 over the years, the Russians have agreed to dilute it to 5 percent, the mixture that power plants use.
With United States help, the Russians lined up three Western companies to buy the ordinary uranium. But when the companies saw the enrichment corporation's plans to sell more uranium, they grew nervous.
The chairman of one company, Bernard M. Michel, of the Cameco Corporation of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, said his company would be agreeing to buy the uranium at a time when the price was all but certain to decline.
Cameco and the other two companies, Nukem G.m.b.H., part of the RWE A.G. Group, the huge German utility in Essen, and the Cogema Group of Velizy, France, which is 86 percent owned by the French Government, had agreed to pay $34 a kilogram, even as the market price has already declined to $28, Mr. Michel said.
The Russian Duma agreed to that deal on July 17. But Cameco withdrew, and a Cogema official said that a decision by the enrichment corporation to sell the uranium now could make the sale of the Russian uranium "extremely difficult, if not impossible."
Behind the problems are the woes of the nuclear industry. The number of American reactors is declining, and the figure may drop faster with utility deregulation. Worldwide, few reactors are being built.
The demand for uranium remains fairly constant. Companies do not, for example, go out and build reactors because the price of fuel has fallen, and most utilities use long-term supply contracts. Market analysts say that means that the enrichment corporation's decision to add uranium to the world supply would be certain to depress prices.
Another issue is how much the Enrichment Corporation will sell. Administration officials argue that it will not flood the market. The president and chief executive officer of the new company, William H. Timbers Jr., wrote on July 21 that "as a public company with fiduciary obligations to its shareholders, USEC can ill afford to unsettle this important market."

HEADLINE: Ernest Dickerman, Defender of the Wilderness, Is Dead at 87

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
Ernest M. Dickerman, who was known by the Sierra Club as "the granddad of the Eastern wilderness" for his efforts to persuade people to defend their forests and wilderness from the power saws and bulldozers of loggers, developers, road builders and other commercial interests, committed suicide late Friday or early Saturday at his cabin in the mountains of Buffalo Gap, Va. He was 87.
He was found under a cherry tree behind his cabin, having shot himself, the sheriff's office reported. In a note to his family, Mr. Dickerman said he took his own life as he had long planned to do after the infirmities of age left him unable to "master my own fate in the wilds of this wild country." 
 Mr. Dickerman was a well-known lobbyist for the Wilderness Society, president of the Smoky Mountains Hiking Club and a leader of campaigns that led to the designation of protected wildlife status for more than 100 million acres in the United States, beginning in 1964. For several decades he was in the forefront of efforts to hold down development in the national parks, forests and designated wild lands. Among his accomplishments was the halting of proposed oil drilling that he said threatened the scenic highlands of Laurel Park in the George Washington National Forest in Virginia.
Brock Evans, former vice president for national issues of the Audubon Society, said, "The only way the environmental movement ever gets anything accomplished is through endless pressure, endlessly applied. And that was Ernie Dickerman -- always writing letters or making calls."
Mr. Dickerman, by all accounts, was a tireless hiker who was said to have had a compass in his head. He never used trails or trail maps, often carried the backpacks of less hardy companions and plunged onward through the wild and up the sides of mountains to what he regarded as a greater glory. On one of his climbs to the summit of Mount LeConte in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina, he said, "This is what I was looking for on this planet," and instead of planting a flag he did a handstand at the top.
Ernest Miller Dickerman was born on Dec. 22, 1910, in Chicago. His father, Judson C. Dickerman, was a civil engineer with the Federal Power Commission in Washington. His mother died when he was 5, and he and his brother, Charles, were taken care of at home by their sister, Virginia, who was 11, and were then sent to boarding schools. Mr. Dickerman graduated from Gettysburg Academy in Gettysburg, Pa., and then from Oberlin College in 1931.
He loved the outdoors from an early age and went to work for the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville in 1933, a job in which he hiked or biked or canoed around the poor villages of Tennessee, telling people what it was going to be like for them when they got electricity and trying to figure out where to put the power lines. He left after four years and went to work in a button factory in Knoxville.
Soon after, he joined the Smoky Mountains Hiking Club, which was formed to help preserve the natural woodlands and successfully pushed for three national parks, the Smokies, the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. He monitored the Government's management and development of the Smokies, fighting several battles on those issues with the National Park Service.
"Fortunately the service decided that there would be no commercial development, but it was unfortunate that the Civilian Conservation Corps was allowed to put in a dozen camps," Mr. Dickerman said. "The C.C.C. was one of the best things any government ever did anywhere but they overdid it in the Smokies. They built endless numbers of fire roads up every big hollow, and too damn many automobile camps, and 650 miles of park trails. Guys like me considered them another form of devastation."
Mr. Dickerman served in England and France with an Army chemical warfare unit in World War II. After the war, he found that, "where the Forest Service had been adding wild lands to its system, lands were now being removed."
"World War II technology made rough-terrain vehicles a reality," he continued, "and wilderness areas once thought inaccessible could now be logged at a profit."
A crisis arose in the mid-1950's for Mr. Dickerman and other conservationists when the Federal Bureau of Reclamation announced a plan to build a dam in Echo Park in the Dinosaur National Monument on the Utah-Colorado border. With the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club leading the way, the conservationist groups, acting in concert for one of the first times, blocked the dam and persuaded Congress to pass the Wilderness Act in 1964 to provide permanent protection from development for wilderness areas.
Two years later, when George B. Hartzog Jr., then director of the Park Service, announced a plan to build a second highway through the Smokies, Mr. Dickerman quit his job at the button factory and joined the staff of the Wilderness Society as a full-time organizer. He traveled the country giving speeches and organizing hikes against the highway, and the resulting overwhelming public opposition killed the project.
After he retired from the Wilderness Society in 1976, Mr. Dickerman was given a number of awards from the Sierra Club and other groups for his work in conservation and environmental protection. But he did not slow down. He worked for years at promoting conservation from his cabin on the farm of a nephew, C. Robert Dickerman, his only survivor.
As he approached his 90's, the phone in his cabin often rang with calls from young conservationists seeking advice on how to overcome opposition.
"You have to keep right on pointing out how important it is to preserve the wild country," Mr. Dickerman told them. "There is always a lot of opposition to wilderness. People are always a lot more interested in the short-term economic benefits rather than the long-term quality-of-life issues."

Lower Income Taxes Proposed in Japan

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan proposed lowering the nation's income tax rates across the board today and said tax cuts for next year could exceed $41.7 billion, the amount Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has pledged.
Mr. Miyazawa spoke to reporters after a meeting today with important members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel. 
 "We are not considering any measures that will lead to a tax increase" for some individuals or businesses for now, Mr. Miyazawa said, indicating that a tax overhaul later might lead to higher taxes for some. "It doesn't make sense if we fail to achieve big tax reductions."
Mr. Miyazawa said he and the Liberal Democratic panel were considering lowering the top income tax rate to 50 percent from 65 percent, and other groups would also get tax reductions based on certain percentages of personal income. Japan currently has five income tax brackets.
Two Liberal Democratic politicians, who are members of the panel, said next year's tax cuts might amount to about 7 trillion yen, including tax breaks for home buyers, which Mr. Obuchi has also pledged.
One of the politicians said the Government planned to adopt different income tax reduction rates for different tax brackets, providing larger cuts for lower income earners. The average income tax rate will probably be 14 percent to 15 percent, the legislator said.
Because legislation authorizing the tax cuts will not be introduced until the next regular session of Parliament, which will convene in January 1999, the reductions will be retroactive to that month, a senior Finance Ministry official said.
Tokyo has been under pressure from the United States and other Asian countries to make permanent tax cuts part of an effort to revive Japan's long-slumping economy.
After taking office last week, MR. Miyazawa pledged to draw up the outline of next year's tax cuts before the Prime Minister made his policy speech to Parliament on Friday.
The Prime Minister has pledged 4 trillion yen in income tax cuts next year, along with 2 trillion yen in corporate tax reductions, in an effort to bolster consumer confidence.
The ministry official said lowering the top income tax rate to 50 percent from 65 percent would cost the Government one trillion yen in revenue.

HEADLINE: G.M. Will Pare as Many as 1,000 White-Collar Jobs

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation announced a sweeping reorganization of its internal distribution structure today that is expected to save $200 million to $300 million a year and eliminate as many as 1,000 white-collar jobs.
The move follows a meeting Monday of G.M.'s board, its first since the auto maker settled a nearly eight-week strike by the United Automobile Workers at two Flint, Mich., parts plants, which over time virtually shut down North American assembly operations. The strike, which cost the company about $3 billion in potential profit, has increased pressure to cut expenses. 
 The revamping of G.M.'s wholesale operation is the second such major move by company management this week. The first was G.M.'s announcement on Monday that it would spin off its huge parts business, Delphi Automotive Systems.
The changes, in the works for a year, create a single organization, rather than one each for the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac-GMC divisions. The new organization closely resembles that of G.M.'s Saturn Corporation, a separate subsidiary established nearly a decade ago to find new ways to build and sell cars; Saturn will remain outside the new organization.
Under the realignment, the United States will be divided geographically among five market area teams, a concept used by Saturn. The teams will be made up of sales, service, parts and brand marketing people. They will call on G.M. dealers, regardless of which brands they sell. By contrast, representatives from each division have traditionally called on dealers with that franchise. The change is intended to eliminate layers of bureaucracy and the number of people visiting a dealer, since 65 percent of General Motors sales are made by dealers who have more than one G.M. franchise.
"This work is all about getting faster, getting decisions and information flow much closer to customers and dealers, and leveraging G.M.'s size and market power across the whole business, instead of on a divisional basis," said Ronald Zarrella, vice president in charge of G.M.'s North American vehicle sales, service and marketing group, at a news briefing today. Mr. Zarrella, the company's strongest proponent of brand management, said the new structure would also help G.M. better reach customer groups.
In addition, G.M. will institute a pay-for-performance system, a practice unheard of in the automotive business, to reward employees for delivering cars and trucks to the customer through the dealer. Details of the new compensation plan have yet to be worked out, but as much as 25 percent of an employee's pay could be "at risk," Mr. Zarrella said.
"This is the first significant departure from the Alfred P. Sloan structure of G.M. that I can remember," said Frank Ursomarso, president of Union Park Pontiac-GMC in Wilmington, Del., and the National Automobile Dealers Association's G.M. representative, in a phone interview. "It's a step in a positive direction."
Mr. Ursomarso, like Mr. Zarrella, said the customer would not notice the change, although closer information sharing without layers of bureaucracy between the dealer and G.M. should result in the right products being in the dealer's showroom.
"The chances of a customer finding the car or truck he or she wants in a certain color and with certain equipment should theoretically be here," Mr. Ursomarso said. And the dealer should have the opportunity to increase business "and penetrate market share," he said, adding, "I can't do that now with my GMC franchise, for instance, because I can't get the right trucks here because there's no system in place."
Two new positions were created today. Roy S. Roberts, a G.M. vice president and previously general manager of the Pontiac-GMC division, becomes general manager for field sales, service and parts. John G. Middlebrook, also a vice president and formerly Chevrolet general manager, was named general manager-vehicle brand marketing.
G.M.'s other division general manager positions will be eliminated by Jan. 1, 1999, when the revamping is completed. The general managers, previously vice presidents of the corporation, will be replaced with managers without vice president status, addressing criticism that the company is top-heavy with executives.
G.M. expects to realize savings by eliminating up to 20 percent of the 5,000 jobs now in its distribution system, which will be done through retirements and retirement incentives. In addition, the company expects to save money by eliminating duplication and adopting common processes and systems throughout G.M., Mr. Zarrella said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Rwandan Role in Congo Revolt

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Intelligence reports indicate that the Rwandan Government is behind a growing rebellion in Congo, senior American officials said today.
The Government of President Laurent Kabila, installed just over a year ago in Congo with Rwandan help, today accused the Rwandan Government of involvement in the insurgency, a charge Rwanda denied. 
 While American officials were careful not to directly accuse the Rwandan Government of backing the rebellion, they said that Mr. Kabila's failure to control Hutu rebels in eastern Congo was an obvious motive for Rwandan interference.
"Eastern Congo is clearly considered a zone of security by the Rwandans," a senior American official said. "They care about eastern Congo and this wouldn't be the first time they've sent their people in. A year and a half ago when they did it, it resulted in the overthrow" of President Mobutu Sese Seko. "Whether the same dynamic is going on or not, we'll see."
At the same time, American officials did not offer Mr. Kabila any support, a marked contrast to the spring of 1997, when they rallied around him as the best alternative to the corrupt rule of Mr. Mobutu.
In public, American officials said today that evidence is sketchy. "We don't believe that governments should be intervening in the affairs of their neighbors," the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said today.
The Clinton Administration is consulting widely with countries in the region and in Europe, officials said, but for now is simply urging restraint on the parties and watching for further developments.
Officials said the American special envoy for the region, Howard Wolpe, is in Kinshasa and is urging Mr. Kabila to reach out to all Congolese, especially ethnic Tutsi, and guarantee their rights and security in order to hold the country together. "That is the best answer for him," one official said.
Mr. Rubin called Mr. Kabila's rule "a mixed bag," with disappointments in the areas of democratic development, human rights, justice and the economy, noting in particular Mr. Kabila's refusal to cooperate with a United Nations team investigating charges of genocide.
"I'm not prepared to comment on whether we would like to see a change in the Government there -- that's not something we normally do," Mr. Rubin said.
But the United States wants "the Government in Kinshasa to be in a position to control its territory" and "believes strongly in the territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo," Mr. Rubin said, noting its strategic location and the risk of renewed violence between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups.
"There are many important countries that border on it, and as goes the Congo, so might go the stability of some of the countries in the region," Mr. Rubin said. "We want to see the people there have a government that can help them thrive and prosper in a democratic way. Those are our objectives."
He called on all sides to "show restraint and resolve these differences in a nonviolent way."
Officials noted that this insurgency began soon after Mr. Kabila expelled the last Rwandan military advisers from the country, which caused Congolese Tutsi "further concerns about their diminishing influence within the Kabila Government," an American official said.
"Depending on what Kabila does with this mounting insurrection in his military, we have to see what the Rwandans do," the official said. "It's up to Kabila to send a reassuring message to the various elements of the society that they can work things out."
Another official said that the Rwandans may not be seeking to overthrow Mr. Kabila, but to give him a warning or to create a buffer zone in eastern Congo.
A White House spokesman, P. J. Crowley, said: "The situation in the Congo is something we are watching very carefully. We are in touch with several governments in the region to assess what is going on there and what we can do to prevent a widening of this situation."
The officials said that the situation in Kinshasa appeared to be calm with some scattered shooting overnight, while traffic was moving nearly normally and the airport is open. Goma is calm, the officials said, but there are reports of continuing clashes in Bukavu and nearby areas of south Kivu.

HEADLINE: Iraqi Rejection Of Scrutiny Brings Rebuke From U.S.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Iraq's decision to go for broke and refuse to discuss any further cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors provoked a warning from the White House today that the action will only insure that Baghdad remains under sanctions indefinitely.
"This once again leaves Iraq further from what Saddam Hussein says his goal is, which is relief from the sanctions," said P. J. Crowley, a White House spokesman. "That can only come when Iraq complies with the resolutions." 
 Russia and France, which have supported Iraq's demand for an early end to sanctions, reacted with concern today to the breakdown of the talks. The Russians, who have served as mediators with Iraq in the past, called for the talks to resume. The French Foreign Ministry expressed exasperation in a statement today that said, "We repeat that good cooperation between Unscom and Iraq is necessary and unavoidable if sanctions imposed by the Security Council are to be lifted."
 The next sanctions review is planned for October, and time is running out for the Iraqis to answer the crucial remaining questions.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, who took some political risk in going to Iraq in February to defuse the last crisis, which drew the United States close to war with Iraq, said today that the latest confrontation "may be a major hiccup, but a hiccup we can overcome, I hope." The accord he reached promised full cooperation from the Iraqis, who have been under a comprehensive embargo since their 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The American and British position may be bolstered in the short term if Iraq provokes a new crisis at a time when its supporters on the Security Council thought they might be close to relaxing sanctions.
But some experts say that Iraq may be gambling that another confrontation will leave Washington even more isolated in the long run, as calls increase here and in the Middle East for an end to eight years of crippling sanctions that have failed to bring down President Saddam Hussein.
Many diplomats here also seem to accept as a given that President Clinton does not want a showdown with Iraq just before elections in the United States in November.
Richard Butler, the chief inspector, left Iraq early today to return to New York to brief the Security Council on Thursday about the early collapse of the talks. At a stop in Bahrain, he told reporters in somewhat more detail what happened at his meeting on Monday with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz.
"I offered him a new accelerated schedule of work for the next five weeks in order to try and resolve most of the outstanding issues, mainly in the chemical and missile areas, before our October report to the Security Council," Mr. Butler told Agence France-Presse. Iraq must account for all nuclear, biological, chemical and long-range missile systems before sanctions imposed in 1990 can be lifted.
"Aziz refused to accept the proposal, saying he wasn't ready to continue working with Unscom on these issues," Mr. Butler said, referring to the United Nations Special Commission, which he leads. He said Mr. Aziz had told him that "no more discussion would take place for the present."
On Monday, Mr. Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad that he had only one message for Mr. Butler, who refuses to accept the Iraqi contention that it has no more prohibited weapons or the means to make them. "I asked Butler to go to the Security Council and tell the truth and he refused to do that."
At the Middle East Institute in Washington, Andrew Parasiliti, an Iraq expert, said today that it was now in Iraq's interest to engage in "diplomatic brinkmanship" in dealing with the United Nations.
"One lesson of the November-February situation is that crisis diplomacy works," he said. "There was some political gain from the last crisis. The Iraqis exploited positions within the Security Council, they showed a political sentiment in the Arab world that was in their favor and they got the intervention of the U.N. Secretary General. That's all in the plus political column."
"But since then, it's been a series of negatives," Mr. Parasiliti said, listing a "damning" report from Mr. Butler's commission at the last sanctions review in April, a lack of progress in inspections, a revelation that Iraq had loaded the nerve gas VX in shells and a gloomier than expected report on nuclear programs from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
"There's a belief that because things aren't going their way, they had to take this to the edge diplomatically," Mr. Parasiliti said. "Every time there is high engagement, they raise the stakes."

HEADLINE: Major Measure of Economy Edges Down for a2d Month

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A key gauge of future economic activity slipped in June for the second consecutive month in another sign the economy is no longer sizzling.
The Conference Board reported yesterday that the strikes against the General Motors Corporation, which lasted nearly eight weeks, dragged down its Index of Leading Economic Indicators, but it said it was too early to warn of a recession. 
 "It doesn't mean bad times for the U.S. economy, but we've seen the best," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist of Primark Decision Economics.
The board, a private business research group, reported that its index for June stood at 105, down two-tenths of a percent from May. The fall was in line with economists' expectations.
The measure was off one-tenth of a percent in May. Earlier, the board had reported that the index was unchanged during that month.
The index's double dip was the first since a string of five monthly declines from January through May 1995 that turned out to be a false warning of impending recession.
Analysts said the economy's current slowdown, from its earlier feverish pace, should help keep the Federal Reserve from pushing interest rates up.
"The U.S. economy is downshifting now," Mr. Sinai said.
The June decline was largely caused by an increase in initial claims for state jobless compensation, a result of the United Automobile Workers strikes against G.M., which idled more than 200,000 workers.
"The rise of unemployment claims in June, largely due to a fallout of the since-settled General Motors strike, drove most of the decline in the leading index," said Michael Boldin, a Conference Board economist.
He said other components making up the index were mixed, suggesting that the slowdown measured by other indicators for the second quarter will continue.
Six of the leading index's 10 components fell in June. Other decliners were manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, building permits, stock prices, consumer expectations, and the difference between 10-year bond yields and short-term interest rates.
The leading index is intended to forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Land of Homeowners;
Most Israelis Own Houses, but Oh Those Mortgages

BYLINE: By JESSICA STEINBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
Julie Zuckerman and Josh Kulp, an American couple who moved to Israel three years ago, did not know what to expect when they shopped for their first mortgage here. What they got was a dizzying education in one of the more complicated home finance systems in the developed world.
Ms. Zuckerman, a vice president of an investment bank, and Mr. Kulp, a teacher of Judaic studies, now own a $212,000 five-bedroom duplex in Modi'in, one of the new towns that has sprung up along the 40-mile highway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. But it took three loans, at three interest rates, to make that possible. 
 A bank lent $74,000 at 4.8 percent. To encourage movement to a new town, the Government provided two more loans for another $41,000, charging 4.5 percent for one and 4 percent for the other.
"We had to decide on our mortgage within 20 days because the rates change on a daily basis," said Ms. Zuckerman, who used savings and family loans to come up with the rest of the purchase price. "The whole process was certainly more frustrating than we had expected."
And it may remain so. Ms. Zuckerman does not really know what she and Mr. Kulp will be paying because mortgages here are adjusted annually for inflation, as are salaries.
As baffling and daunting as the mortgage system is, it has nonetheless produced a nation of homeowners. About 73 percent of the country's five million citizens live in privately owned homes, compared with 66 percent in the United States.
Indeed, in Israel, home ownership is a type of pioneerism, the modern-day method of settling the Jewish homeland. Accordingly, the mortgage system has been a tool to foster land development and further other social ends. Children from big families receive larger loans than those from smaller ones, for instance, because their parents have less money to lend them. Ethiopian immigrants receive more than Russian immigrants because most Ethiopians arrive in Israel without any savings.
But now, the creaky mortgage system is at a crossroads, scrambling to find ways to keep pumping out all those new loans to people like Ms. Zuckerman and Mr. Kulp.
A holdover from the early days of statehood, when Israel's socialist nature promised home and hearth for every citizen, the system has had to expand to accommodate an ever more populous and diverse country. It has also had to adjust as that nation has lurched from heavy state control to a free market economy. Israel has nine mortgage banks, with the biggest now in the process of being privatized. Even so, the system remains an amalgam of private and public money.
The banks administer all the loans, including $2 billion a year in mortgages that the Government's Housing Ministry provides. The challenge is continuing the steady flow of $4 billion a year in nongovernment loans, a huge amount of financing for such a small country to generate.
While Israel is now experiencing a mild recession, and it is not uncommon to find new homes going begging for buyers, many in the construction and lending industries fear tight credit. And that means, those in the private sector say, that even as the Government tries to disengage from the mortgage business, there is an important new role for it to play: providing guarantees for a secondary mortgage market.
Such a market would serve as a new lending source by pooling and repackaging mortgage loans as bonds. The idea is for the banks to sell their loans to a quasi-government company, similar to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in the United States, which would bundle the mortgages as securities and sell them to institutional investors worldwide, funneling new cash back to the banks for use as new loans.
But despite the Government's traditionally deep role in the mortgage market, officials are balking at providing loan guarantees, which would make the bundled mortgages more attractive to investors.
After a two-year study, a Government committee made up of representatives from the central bank and the Finance and Housing ministries concluded that the capital markets should take responsibility for a secondary mortgage market.
In a report last June to Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman, the panel suggested easing regulations and lowering other barriers to such a market, including removing certain taxes. He is expected to seek approval for the market, but without the Government acting as insurer.
However the battle over a secondary market turns out, the mortgage system's central role in the country's social fabric is not going to change, industry experts say.
Many Israeli borrowers considered eligible for loans here would never stand the test of an American mortgage application, says Doron Nachmani, deputy manager of the Tefahot Israel Mortgage Bank, the largest of the mortgage banks.
Some are young couples who recently completed their army service and are entering college, while others are new Russian immigrants with little experience paying back long-term loans. Then there are the settlers living in politically disputed development towns over the so-called Green Line -- the local term for the border between Israel proper and the territories claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians.
The banks here have instituted their own checklists to determine who is creditworthy. Among other things, borrowers usually present various family members to vouch for them, a system that insures a high payback rate because the borrowers do not want to put their families at risk.
Construction was one of the fastest-growing sectors in the country after the wave of emigration from Russia and suburbanization of Israel in the early 1990's. Immigration has since slowed down, and so has the economy, resulting in an overflow of available homes.
Nonetheless, prices remain high. Mr. Nachmani, who is leading the lobbying for a Government-backed secondary mortgage market, says the Government's minimum mortgage loan of 70,000 shekels, or about $19,000, an amount that was set back in 1992, will not buy much more than a kitchen these days, much less a three-bedroom house.
Mr. Nachmani speaks in fatalistic terms about the long-term health of the lending system, contending that in five years there will be little private-sector money for mortgages.
A picture that is only a little less stark is painted by Boaz Schwartz, a principal of the Tel Aviv branch of Bankers Trust who has been hired as a consultant for Bank Tefahot, another mortgage bank.
"In the near future, mortgage banks will have less obvious resources to borrow from," he said. When the economy picks up, he added, there will be a renewed rush for mortgages and no ready new source for financing them.
The two logical sources are so-called provident funds -- long-term bank savings accounts that are invested in stocks and Government bonds -- and pension funds.
Government regulations sharply restrict the amount of money from provident funds that can be invested in mortgages. And pension funds are not allowed to invest that way.
Given the lack of cash flow into the mortgage banks' coffers, the idea of a secondary mortgage market, insured by the Government, has taken hold in the lending industry.
But Shai Talmon, the Finance Ministry's accountant general and head of the Government committee weighing the issue, is not interested in further involving the Government. He says that Government backing of the secondary market will not solve the long-term financing problem. What is needed, he says, is simply a commitment by the private sector to put up more money.
That is a paradoxical decision, said Menachem Feder, a Tel Aviv lawyer who is advising Bank Tefahot on mortgage securitization.
"Laissez-faire is a nice concept, but curious when the Government already slow-dances with several mortgage programs," he said, referring to the $2 billion in loans that it issues each year. Mr. Feder, a former Wall Street lawyer, welcomes the committee's recommendations to foster private initiative but is concerned about the slowness of change.
"Until that possibly distant day when the private sector will produce a secondary market all by itself," he said, "we're forced into half-baked methods of financing."
Mr. Nachmani and Mr. Schwartz are both annoyed with the committee's decision.
And David Brodet, chairman of the United Mizrahi Bank, Israel's fourth-largest bank and owner of 86 percent of Tefahot, said, "If you're establishing a secondary market, you need the U.S. system of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to give insurance."
For the time being, Bankers Trust, Bank Tefahot and Tefahot's lawyers are designing a simpler system that would allow investors to participate directly in mortgage pools, a riskier method of raising money. Mr. Schwartz would also like to see some more immediate improvements in lending terms, such as increasing the current maximum loan of 60 percent of a property's value to a level closer to the average 80 percent maximum in the United States.
"It's about the ability to borrow in an efficient market," Mr. Schwartz said of the push for change. "And that doesn't exist here."

HEADLINE: Allied Signal In $9.8 Billion Hostile Bid In Electronics

BYLINE: BY LAURA M. HOLSON and KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Allied Signal, a maker of aerospace and automotive products, announced yesterday that it was starting a $9.8 billion unsolicited offer for AMP Inc., a 55 percent premium over Monday's closing price.
The offer, $44.50 a share in cash, will begin in five days if management of AMP, a maker of electronics connectors, does not agree to sit down and discuss a deal on friendly terms, said Allied's chairman and chief executive, Larry Bossidy. 
 Mr. Bossidy said he had made several attempts in the last week to discuss a deal with AMP management, including two phone calls and a letter. The move has been approved by Allied Signal's board.
Shares in AMP rose $13.9375 after the 3:30 P.M. announcement to close at $42.5625. Shares of Allied closed down $3.5625, to $40.
AMP said that it was referring the offer to its board, but that it was urging shareholders not to take any action until the board reviewed its offer.
AMP, based in Harrisburg, Pa., has been struggling lately, making it an attractive target for Allied Signal, which is based in Morris Township, N.J.
In July, AMP said it was closing a Pennsylvania plant and would cut 3,000 jobs in the next two years, a result of the weak economy in Asia. That region accounted for 20 percent of AMP 1997 sales. The company has 48,300 workers in 53 companies, another attractive element for Allied.
For the most part, Wall Street analysts said a deal made sense, assuming that Mr. Bossidy and his team from Allied Signal could change the way AMP operates.
"From what we are beginning to learn about AMP, it is a nice, undermanaged company," said Phua K. Young, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. "With a strong management team, a combination with Allied Signal could lead to some nice synergies."
Allied Signal's offer, if accepted, would dilute Allied earnings by 27 cents a share, said Mr. Bossidy. It would be financed by the sale of $2 billion worth of Allied assets -- some analysts suggested in the automotive business -- as well as a $1.5 billion equity offering. That would offset the dilution, he said, and 1999 earnings of the combined companies would rise 13 to 17 percent. He added that the combination would generate cash flow of $200 million in 1999, $300 million in 2000 and an additional $100 million in 2001.
Analysts attending a meeting with Allied executives were skeptical of Mr. Bossidy's projections, particularly because his team had not inspected AMP's books.
"This strikes me as a kind of 'trust me in 2000 and 2001,' " one analyst said. "What is your competence on these numbers?" Mr. Bossidy replied, "I don't think we have any rose-colored glasses." He later added, "It will be difficult."
Allied may also face difficulties with its hostile offer because Pennsylvania has some of the toughest anti-takeover laws in the country.
As a defensive measure, Allied filed a suit in a Federal District Court in Pennsylvania in an attempt to insure that investors would not be denied the opportunity to consider the offer.
Still, analysts agreed that the rich offer would put pressure on AMP's management to consider the bid carefully.
"Part of the reason the premium is as big as it is is to get AMP shareholders in line," Mr. Young, the Lehman Brothers analyst said. "If AMP management can't do as much as Allied Signal to get the stock price up, they run the risk of getting sued," by shareholders.
Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with Schroder & Company, said that Allied was seeking out AMP as an addition to what he said was a growing stable of high-growth and high-margin businesses. "AMP is a dominant company in a niche that has seen its market position and profitability eroded fairly considerably," he said. "But with a little bit of management smarts you can hopefully reinvigorate the company."
Mr. Lustgarten said that by going after AMP, Mr. Bossidy was seeking to reinvigorate the company's growth early in the next century. "With aerospace likely to slow, you can begin to raise questions about where they would turn for faster growth," he said. "This is pretty well thought out."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Will It Be A Rebound Or Relapse?

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
As the stock market swooned yesterday, Ron Reuss, chief economist at Piper Jaffray, felt vindicated.
Last November, he was an outsider among economists in predicting that the domestic economy would slow drastically this year. When most were forecasting double-digit growth in corporate earnings for the second quarter, believing the impact of the Asian crisis would be only a first-quarter blip, Mr. Reuss anticipated that earnings growth would be in the range of 4 to 6 percent. 
 Now companies are reporting second-quarter earnings in line with his forecasts, and Wall Street is bracing for further weakness with the negative effects of Asia expected to be felt at least into the third quarter.
"My bearish forecast is finally coming to fruition," said Mr. Reuss, who expects the United States economy to roll into a recession in the fourth quarter, even though the gross domestic product has so far outpaced his forecast this year.
Investors dumped shares yesterday, pushing major market indexes down more than 3 percent and nearly 10 percent off their peaks, the point that typically signals a correction.
In its worst decline this year, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 299.43 points, or 3.4 percent, to 8,487.31, its lowest finish since early March. It was the third-largest point decline in the history of the blue-chip average.
The trading volume of more than 834 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange was the second-largest ever, after the 1.2 billion shares traded on Oct. 28.
As a result of the losses, led by declines in I.B.M., J. P. Morgan and General Electric, the Dow is 9.1 percent below its July 17 peak of 9,337.97 and is up just 7.3 percent this year. It had been up more than 18 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dived 40.32, or 3.6 percent. It is down 9.7 percent from its high of 1,196.75 set on July 17.
The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology shares that led yesterday's slide, fell 65.46, or 3.54 percent, to 1,785.64, its lowest level since June 19, when it closed at 1,781.29.
Losses in bellwether issues like Microsoft, off 3 15/16, to 104 1/2; Intel down 2 7/8, to 81 15/16, and Cisco Systems off 3 3/8, to 93 1/8, mean the Nasdaq has had a correction; it is off 11.3 percent from its high for the year. In telecommunications, Worldcom fell 3 7/16, to 48 7/16; MCI Communications 4 1/2, to 59, and Lucent Technologies 4, to 87.
Behind the heavy selloff, analysts said, was distress about the outlook for corporate earnings and for Asian economies, especially Japan. Some forecast that the Dow could fall as much as 20 percent before rebounding.
"Some folks have been calling for this correction for a while," said Charles W. Johnson, head of equity trading at Blaylock & Partners in Baltimore. "This is good for the market. It's healthy because it makes people become cautious again."
Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that investors were unlikely to regain confidence in the market immediately. "We are in this information void period," he said, until there is news from Japan or a new round of corporate earnings data in September.
While Mr. Galvin and many strategists expect a rebound then, Mr. Reuss remains pessimistic. "I don't see a rebound in the third and fourth quarter," he said, adding that consumer spending is crucial for economic growth and many consumers will soon be forced to curb spending and pay down debt.
Financial stocks were also hard hit. The S.& P. financial index fell 4.9 percent, just trailing the Nasdaq telecommunications index, which fell more than 5 percent.
Among leading financial shares, Citicorp fell 9 5/8, to 154; Chase Manhattan 5 3/4, to 69 5/8, and J. P. Morgan 5 3/4, to 116 7/8.
Small-company shares continued to be hammered. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks was down 11.7 points, or 2.8 percent, to 401.63. The Russell is off 8.1 percent this year.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Rise, With 30-Year Yield at 5.63%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds rose for a fourth day yesterday, driving yields to the lowest level in more than three weeks, as a sharp fall in stock prices bolstered the appeal of less-risky Treasury securities.
"The weakness in the stock market" prompted the buying of bonds, said Kevin McClintock, head of taxable fixed-income assets at the Dreyfus Corporation. "It's a flight-to-quality trade." 
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32, to a price of 107 4/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.63 percent from 5.65 percent on Monday. The yield was the lowest since July 10 and not far from the record low of 5.56 percent reached on July 7.
Earlier in the day, bonds fell along with the dollar after Haruhiko Kuroda, director general of the Japanese Finance Ministry's international bureau, suggested that Japan was ready to sell dollars for yen to bolster the ailing currency.
The expected sale of $9 billion in new debt by Worldcom and other companies also weighed on Treasuries, as did the sale planned next week of $38.5 billion in Government debt.
Treasuries bounced back as a last-hour plunge in United States stock prices increased the appeal of Government debt.
Bond investors welcome signs that the economy is losing steam, because slowing growth would reduce the risk of inflation.
Yesterday's rise in bond prices followed a larger-than-expected drop reported on Monday in the National Association of Purchasing Management's index of factory activity for July. It suggested that the economy was cooling off from a pace of robust growth earlier in the year.
The latest numbers followed a Government report last week that showed that the economy expanded in the second quarter at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent.
"We're starting to see the spreading impact of Asia," which could pave the way for lower bond yields, and thus higher prices, said Robert Alley of AIM Management in Houston.

BIG SELLOFF SENDS DOW PLUMMETING NEARLY 300 POINTS

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
After months of shrugging off bad economic news from Asia and a slowdown in corporate profits in the United States, investors stampeded out of stocks yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 299.43 points, or 3.41 percent, to 8,487.31, and other market gauges were down even more sharply. While up 7.32 percent since the beginning of the year, the Dow is now down 9.1 percent from its peak on July 17. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, with its heavy weighting in technology and financial stocks, has lost 11.3 percent of its value from its peak in July. Nasdaq lost 65.46 points yesterday, or 3.54 percent. Even so, the index is up almost 14 percent this year.
There was no single reason identified as the culprit behind the market's plunge. Rather, investors seemed suddenly ready to give credence to red flags that had been waving for some time.
For example, the economic meltdown in Asia has translated into a sizable drop in demand for American products. Economic growth in the United States slowed to a 1.4 percent gain in the second quarter, down from 5.5 percent in the first quarter. The strong dollar has wreaked havoc on companies doing business overseas. Uncertainty over President Clinton's future in the face of the Monica S. Lewinsky matter weighed on the market as well.
But perhaps most significant was investors' sudden recognition that earnings growth, the engine that powers stock prices, is deteriorating at even the biggest and best-known American companies. Combine this with an increasingly narrow stock market advance -- more stocks going down than up -- and the outlook for stock prices turns decidedly bearish.
"Investors are finally, finally starting to realize that earnings growth has slowed," said Liz Miller, portfolio manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen in New York. "If you have a weakening underlying economy, profits cannot keep going up."
Indeed, in recent days, such stock market stars as Procter & Gamble and Kellogg have disappointed investors with either lower-than-expected earnings or warnings of bad news to come. When the same blue-chip companies that have led the market to record valuations begin to lose steam, investors sooner or later take notice.
There was no sense of panic reported among brokerage firms yesterday. Several brokers said that the feeling among their clients was one of being resigned to a drop in stock prices. Indeed, in a measure of how far the market has come, the drop in the Dow was the third steepest in terms of points but not even in the top 20 in terms of percentage. Nice though the heady profits have been, investors seemed to think that the stock market was overdue for a fall.
Mutual fund investors did not appear to be crowding the exits, either. Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund giant, reported that more money went into funds across the company than left them. "There was some small movement from equities to money market funds," said Anne Crowley, a Fidelity spokeswoman, "but nothing of consequence."
The question on everyone's minds yesterday was where the market's fall would end. Was this the beginning of a stock market bloodletting or just a painful correction? A correction is a decline of 10 percent to 15 percent. Since the Dow peaked on July 17, it has lost 9.1 percent. A bear market is considered to have started once stock prices have fallen more than 20 percent from their peaks.
Following the rout on Wall Street, Asian markets were sharply lower early today. Japanese stocks were down 1.13 percent at midday, while Hong Kong stocks tumbled as much 2.5 percent before steadying.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, volume topped 800 million shares, the largest day of trading this year and the second biggest ever. Investors fleeing stocks sought refuge in Treasury securities, driving up the price of the 30-year bond and depressing the yield, to 5.63 percent.
Only time will tell, of course, whether the market will move into bear market territory. In recent years, investors have plowed back into stocks whenever they have declined, a phenomenon known as "buying the dips." Whether these investors will once again consider yesterday's precipitous drop in equity prices a buying opportunity remains to be seen.
Stocks began to slide in earnest about noon, when Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential Securities and a longtime bull on stocks, was quoted as saying that the Dow could drop 15 to 20 percent from its 1998 highs.
Stocks in all industries took a beating. Those hit hardest were the banks, down 5.5 percent on average, followed closely by the oil service sector, which lost an average 5.3 percent. Health care stocks fell an average 4.4 percent, and airline shares lost an average 3.8 percent.
Warning signs that stock prices might have gotten ahead of themselves had been evident for weeks, if not months.
Before the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index dropped 40.32 points yesterday, or 3.62 percent, to 1,072.12, it had gained 14 percent on the year. Yet the earnings growth reported by the stocks in the index during the first half of 1998 came in well below that gain, at about 4 percent. Something had to bring this disparity back into line and that something was stock prices.
Add to this the fact that labor costs are rising at the same time that intense competition among companies prevents them from raising their prices to consumers and corporate profit margins look particularly vulnerable.
Sharp-eyed investors may have noticed another sign that stock prices had hit something of a ceiling. Premiums paid in corporate takeovers had disappeared in recent months. Indeed, last week's proposed acquisition of GTEby Bell Atlantic offered GTE shareholders even less than the market price.
In addition, positive earnings surprises in the second quarter were no longer producing outsized gains in the stocks of companies reporting them. Indeed, companies with good news saw their stock prices underperform the S.& P. 500. This was an about-face from the period in 1997, when companies posting unexpected earnings gains of 10 percent or more above the Wall Street consensus outperformed the S.& P. 500 by 12.5 percent.
One money manager thinks the market has simply worn itself out moving to new highs in mid-July on a litany of bad news. "We'd had a big huge move relative to what had been happening," said William Fleckenstein, president of Fleckenstein Capital in Seattle.
"When you put that against the deterioration of the market itself, you could build a case that the market has exhausted itself," he said.
Painful though any fall in stock prices can be, some money managers who had been quietly raising cash and taking stock market profits were unsurprised by the move. To their view, such a drop was not a matter of if, but when. And if it ratchets down the exceedingly great expectations investors have come to look for in stock market returns, these folks say, the market's fall will be healthy.
"We were seeing valuations that were absurd relative to corporate earnings," said Elaine Hahn, of Hahn Capital Management in San Francisco. "But nobody wanted to listen."

HEADLINE: CANADA PACT GIVES A TRIBE SELF-RULE FOR THE FIRST TIME

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: NEW AIYANSH, British Columbia, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Canada's federal Government signed a landmark treaty with West Coast Indians today, giving a group of them control for the first time of a majestic swath of pine forest, crystal streams and towering peaks, along with the legal rights to run their own nation.
The Canadian Government had hoped the treaty -- seen as a model for dozens of other Indian land claims -- would foster the process of reconciliation between indigenous people and other Canadians. But its most immediate result so far has been division, suspicion and great uncertainty throughout British Columbia and across Canada. 
 Some Canadians argue that the treaty, which won't take effect until it goes through a full ratification process, fundamentally alters the Constitution and endangers the country's delicate unity by allowing the Indians a level of self-government that has been denied to French-speaking separatists in Quebec.
The rights granted under the treaty are comparable to those of Indian tribes in the United States, which already have the power to govern most of what happens on their reservations, although conflicts occasionally arise there over the extent of Indian jurisdiction and just who is covered by Indian laws.
But the treaty signed today in Canada carries with it even more potential for conflict because it was signed so much later than those in the United States, which were largely struck more than 100 years ago. Now about 50 other Indian groups are staking claims to territory covering virtually every square mile of British Columbia, even for already-developed cities like Vancouver.
If today's precedent, which covers about 750 square miles, is repeated, as seems likely, there will be intense clashes with high economic stakes.
Even before Canada's Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Jane Stewart, arrived for the signing this morning in this remote corner of Canada, hard by Alaska, the historic treaty with the Nisga'a (pronounced nis-GAH) people was being attacked. Some residents of British Columbia fear the treaty establishes a new level of government based on race, with its own system of privileged justice and sanctioned inequality.
Others criticized its price tag -- the equivalent of $320 million in United States dollars spread over several years, in addition to the land -- as a giveaway.
The commercial fishing industry and others condemned provisions they feel give the Nisga'a unfair access to natural resources.
Indian claims were bolstered in December when Canada's Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling involving the Gitxsan, another British Columbia Indian group, that Indian claims extend to the land's natural resources. The court also recognized Indian oral history as having legal standing.
Nevertheless, rival Indian groups in the province oppose the treaty because it impinges on their own land claims.
Even members of one of the four bands that make up the 5,000-member Nisga'a nation has gone to court to stop the treaty. Some members, like James H. Stevens, say it is poorly conceived and badly executed because it omits 90 percent of the territory that the Nisga'a have traditionally claimed.
"It was done by a bunch of young guys on the negotiation committee who don't even know our resources or our culture," said Mr. Stevens, a 72-year-old elder of the Kincolith band of the Nisga'a. "Maybe they were just sitting there nodding their heads."
Despite the flood of criticism, federal negotiators and most Nisga'a leaders believe the treaty breaks new ground in Canada's long and not always successful relationship with its Indian groups.
"It's time we did it," said Lorene Plante, a Nisga'a woman who took part in the negotiations.
While also hopeful, Stephen Nyce was more guarded since he, like many other Nisga'a, has not yet seen the details of the treaty. "My grandfather told me not to celebrate until you know for sure what you are celebrating," he said.
Tom Molloy, the chief federal negotiator, said that for the first time an Indian treaty will resolve a question of territory while establishing the principles of self-government that can free Indians from dependency on the federal Government.
"Today we join Canada and British Columbia as free citizens, full and equal participants in the social, economic and political life of this country," said Joseph Gosnell Sr., president of the Nisga'a Tribal Council, who wore a headdress trimmed with seal whiskers and ermine furs. "We intend to live here forever."
While Indian self-government is a new concept in Canada, most of the more than 500 Indian tribes and councils in the United States already govern themselves to varying degrees, and with occasional challenges from non-Indians.
Jerry J. Cordova, a negotiator with the office of self-governance in the United States Department of the Interior, said that in most cases, non-Indians are not allowed to run for office or vote in tribal elections, but there are exceptions.
The American tribes consider themselves sovereign nations, a view not always shared by individual states and the Federal Government. The tribes often do not tax the people living on their land. In some instances, their right to levy taxes has been challenged in court.
The experience of the American Indians suggests that a tribe's ability to govern itself greatly increases the chances of its reaching economic independence.
"Tribes that do have better control over their assets -- whether cultural assets or trust funds -- are more successful in economic development," said Lela M. Shepard, development associate with the First Nations Development Institute, a nonprofit group that provides financial assistance to Indian tribes like the Pauma Tribe of Southern California, which used a $300,000 grant to improve its orange and avocado orchards.
Ms. Shepard said the biggest problem for most tribes is raising the money to begin projects, since many banks are reluctant to lend them money.
The Nisga'a treaty that was signed today will allow the indigenous people here to run most of the social and economic activity in the area they will control -- more than half the combined land and water area of Rhode Island. They will set and collect taxes and determine how the revenue is spent, while agreeing to eventually give up the exemption from some sales and income taxes they have had.
Ms. Stewart, the Indian affairs minister, praised the treaty, calling it "a just and honorable settlement" that reinforces the Supreme Court of Canada's directive that negotiation, not litigation, is the way to settle Indian land claims.
Following today's signing, the treaty proposal will be put to a referendum among the registered members of the Nisga'a. Fewer than 2,000 of the 5,000 Nisga'a live in the area that is considered their ancestral home.
Some British Columbia residents want a province-wide referendum on the treaty because they say that by preventing non-Indians from running for government offices or voting in such elections, the treaty fundamentally changes Canada's Constitution.
Indian leaders have rejected the idea of a provincial referendum, calling it "the white man's veto." The Premier of British Columbia, Glen Clark, said the 250-page treaty is too complicated to be put to such a broad test. The people of British Columbia will be able to make their views known when the treaty goes before the provincial legislature, he added.
Following that, it also will be voted on by the federal Parliament in Ottawa. Negotiators believe the whole process could be completed by next spring, although substantial objections could delay it.
Unlike the eastern provinces that signed land treaties with Indians hundreds of years ago, British Columbia entered into only a few such deals, on Vancouver Island and in the northeastern part of the province, before abandoning the process. Small scattered reserves were created but the Indians themselves never surrendered claim to traditional lands.
By all measures, Canada's 800,000 indigenous people are the poorest, least educated and least healthy Canadians, which deeply embarrasses many Canadians. The Government has been looking for a way to change the situation by embracing the idea of self-rule.
Government officials hope that by giving Indian groups clear title they can not only compensate for past injustices but also encourage forestry, mining and other activities to sustain independence. Uncertainty over who controls the land has hampered such efforts.
Today's treaty is considered full and final, and can be amended only with the consent of the Indians, the province and the federal Government.
"It's a done deal," said Jack Ebbels, the chief negotiator for British Columbia.
But this is not like past deals in which Indian bands were bullied into giving away most of their land.
The Nisga'a will become major landholders in British Columbia, owning the land outright, just like other property holders. They will own the rights to all the timber, except for existing leases, and subsurface minerals, and will be able to negotiate future contracts.
Local government will be in the hands of the Nisga'a, who will have the power to make laws concerning language and culture, property, employment, traffic and most social services. The 100 or so non-Indians living on Nisga'a land will not be allowed to run for office or vote, although they will have the chance to do so in elections involving education and boards of health that directly affect them.
These restrictions have already stirred a huge controversy that threatens to derail the ratification of the treaty. Despite the small number of non-Indians on Nisga'a land, critics are worried about the precedent of establishing governments on racial lines.
"For the first time I know of, they are entrenching inequality in the Constitution of Canada," said Gordon Campbell, leader of the Liberal opposition in British Columbia. Mr. Campbell said that this also endangers Canada's national unity. "We are giving to the Nisga'a government something that the Quebec government asked for a long time ago and were told, 'No, you can't have it.' "
But Ms. Stewart, the Indian minister, said the Constitution actually guarantees Indians special rights simply because they were in Canada before Europeans arrived. She said the federal Government fully supports the restrictions that the treaty places on participation in Indian government.
But that has proved to be a far more uncomfortable position for the province. "It was a thorny, thorny issue," said Mr. Ebbels, the provincial negotiator. He suggested that the province had been worried about non-Indians being taxed by the Nisga'a without any representation in the local government. In the end, Indian taxing powers were restricted to Indians, while others will continue paying taxes to the province.
"We took some comfort in that," Mr. Ebbels said.

GOODYEAR TO LAY OFF 580 WORKERS AT THREE TIRE PLANTS

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company will lay off 580 workers at three plants as it grapples with a glut of tires because of the recent strikes that crippled General Motors assembly lines. Some of the jobs may be restored eventually if tire sales improve, a Goodyear spokesman, Chuck Sinclair, said yesterday. Most of the layoffs will be in a plant at Gadsden, Ala., where Goodyear is the largest employer. On Sept. 1 the company will lay off 449 workers there, about 22 percent of the work force of 2,000 at the plant. Mr. Sinclair said 85 workers would be laid off in Tyler, Tex., and 46 in Fayetteville, N.C.

HEADLINE: Phone Lines, and Lines and Lines, Keeping Their Appeal

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
CALL it phone-line meltdown, if you will; consumers know it well. It's that angina-inducing moment when an avalanche of both voice and data transmission needs threaten to turn your single, humble phone line, as well as your patience, into a pile of ashes.
Trying to stay in touch with the office -- 20 calls a day -- as well as surf the Net? Good luck. Plain-vanilla phone lines can do only so much. 
 In the past year in particular, consumers have been given a growing array of options for meeting their escalating need to fax, phone, send E-mail and go out on the Internet. As a result, they no longer have to rely on just a phone line or two.
But many of these newer transmission options, like cable Internet connections and A.D.S.L. (asymmetrical digital subscriber lines), are currently available only in certain parts of the country. And while their prices are dropping, they are, for the most part, still expensive, with not just higher service costs but also extra charges for special modems, installation and even Internet service providers. Even then, technical support for the services is often less than encouraging.
Given the constraints of newer technologies, many consumers are sticking with the tried and true. That usually means simply increasing the number of regular phone lines, from one or two to three or four -- or more. By all accounts, sales of regular phone lines are booming. An extra line is usually no more than $20 a month, with installation starting around $75.
In California, for example, Pacific Bell has installed a record number of telephone access lines in the past three financial quarters, and almost all of those installations have been standard phone lines, which use analog technology. Pacific Bell now offers its customers 17.7 million access lines. But it still has only about 170,000 customers for its I.S.D.N. (integrated services digital network) service. The company is now introducing A.D.S.L. service as well.
At Bell Atlantic, sales of extra analog lines are also brisk. The number of sales first surged in 1994 and is now growing by 15 percent a year, said Debra Swann, executive director for consumer local and toll services at Bell Atlantic.
Families with talk-happy teen-agers, as well as home offices, account for a good chunk of the interest, of course. At Pacific Bell, for example, about one-sixth of the requests for extra phone lines are now coming from families that plan to give the lines to teen-agers, said John Britton, a company spokesman.
Still, heavy Internet use seems to be the factor that eventually drives most consumers to pile up dial tones. For example, in a survey of 7,800 households last fall, Ziff-Davis Marketing Intelligence found that 51 percent of those that used the Internet 16 hours or more a week had two or more lines, while 8 percent had three or more.
At Byte Sized Computing, a home-office consulting business in Rye, N.Y., Dominick Curatola, the owner, said he was asked about the need for second lines "almost every day." So far, he added, consumers seem to be sticking with analog technology. "I think there's interest in newer technologies on a theoretical level, but the small office or home hasn't really begun to push it," Mr. Curatola said. That's because most people are buying computers that have modems that use traditional analog phone lines already built into them.
"Quite honestly, consumers are having enough time with regular modems and services, let alone the fancier technologies," said Jim Mulcahy, who owns another computer consulting service, Computer Tutor @PCI in Bronxville, N.Y.
But many consumers may simply not yet need the lightning-fast transmission speeds of newer technologies like A.D.S.L. At its fastest, A.D.S.L. can pummel data along 250 times faster than a traditional 28.8-Kbps (kilobits per second) modem.
"The killer application for the Internet is still E-mail," said Doug Michelman, another spokesman for Pacific Bell. "More often than not, consumers are accessing the Internet for E-mail."
Cost, however, may be an equally strong motivator. Take the McCalmont family of Cincinnati. The McCalmonts already have three phone lines. Yet until recently, they found themselves juggling those lines constantly to meet their considerable voice and data needs. Both Mr. McCalmont and his wife, Alyce, for example, work from home as professional organizers; as such, they not only need to maintain a semblance of order at home regarding communications but also need to rely on open phone lines for business calls and the Internet.
But the McCalmonts' daughter, Laura, 16, is on the phone constantly. And their son, Drew, 14, spends so much time on the Internet -- up to 12 hours a day in the summer -- that he now has his own phone line.
Earlier this year, the McCalmonts realized that they needed to expand their phone line capacity fast. But they were already paying almost $200 a month for their three lines, an Internet service provider and three car phones. As a result, I.S.D.N. service was never an option. In the Cincinnati area, it costs $110 a month for service alone, while installation, an I.S.D.N. modem and Internet service cost extra.
Of course, the McCalmonts could have installed a fourth phone line, at a service cost of about $20 a month. Three months ago, however, they opted for an even cheaper, as well as simpler, solution: an Internet call manager service from Cincinnati Bell. For $7 a month, the service lets them answer or transfer an incoming call while they are using the Internet on their business line.They can also flash callers a message to let them know they will return the call.
Jon Kiphart is also staying true to his analog phone lines. As a freelance programmer who, among other things, automates theme park rides, Mr. Kiphart often finds himself connecting to the Internet from phones in far-flung locales like Malaysia that are not equipped to send and receive data on line and that also have limited access to digital phone technology.
For times like these, Mr. Kiphart carries his own acoustical modem, a coupling device designed for phones. At home, in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., he makes do with two analog phone lines, even though he often has to download large files chock full of graphics.
"I've heard that I.S.D.N. modems are very difficult to set up," he said. "And what I need is ease of use, durability and reliability, as well as the ability to tap into my computer from exotic locations."
Cost, however, is also a sticking point for Mr. Kiphart. "If the local cable service were able to deliver Internet service for $20 a month, I'd go for it," he said. "I'd also be willing to pay $30 a month for unlimited I.S.D.N. access. But right now I'm already spending between $200 and $300 a month for two analog lines, Internet service, a cell phone and a pager."
Digital technologies are becoming more affordable. For example, computer manufacturers are expected to roll out products that have A.D.S.L. modems built into them as early as next year. Meanwhile, A.D.S.L. technology, unlike I.S.D.N., carries the advantage of not being metered, so consumers can usually get unlimited service for between $70 and $90 a month. That fee, however, doesn't cover A.D.S.L.'s hefty installation and modem costs, which can chalk up an extra $600 or more.
Phone companies are trying to keep connection costs down as well. For example, when Bell Atlantic begins rolling out A.D.S.L. service next month, start-up fees will be held to less than $200 for an introductory promotional period. That fee will include a $99 connection fee and an A.D.S.L. modem for less than $100. Bell Atlantic says it will also waive fees for any home wiring work that may be necessary and any setup help that customers may need to reconfigure their computers for the new technology.
Peter Castleton, director of data products for Bell Atlantic, says consumer interest in the company's A.D.S.L. service has been overwhelming so far. "There seems to be pent-up demand for it," he added.
Still, for now, many consumers seem to be sticking with the technology that gives them the fewest number of headaches. One example is Beth Rowan, a public relations and marketing consultant who lives in Bronxville, N.Y.
Ms. Rowan works from her home and has two teen-agers, ages 13 and 16. Not surprisingly, she likes "to have things simple and straightforward, rather than the latest technology on the block." As a result, when she needed more phone capacity last summer, she simply installed a third phone line.
Ms. Rowan may move to a faster transmission technology yet: she says she is tired of the "antiquated" phone system in her county that allows her to surf the Net at a speed of only about 28 Kbps, even though she has a 56-Kbps modem. For now, though, sheis sticking with the simplest solution possible.
So is Elizabeth Wise, a psychology student in Bronxville. Ms. Wise does a lot of Web surfing, and her husband, a financial analyst, often has to use one of the family's two phone lines to transmit lengthy reports to the computer at his office in Manhattan.
Even though Ms. Wise's home was wired for I.S.D.N. technology in a recent renovation, she is sticking with analog phone lines for now because of cost and because she knows that newer transmission technologies, like cable and satellite, will be coming along.
"I'm waiting to see how these other technologies are going to shake down," she said. "I want what is simplest, as well as most economical, for the home user. And when I get it, I'll stick with it."

A House Where Rooms Are a State of Mind

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI 

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif.

 BODY:
TROPHY houses, those 15,000-square-foot status symbols, may get all the ink in advertisements and the envy at cocktail parties, but the houses that are harder to measure and describe, the unconventional buildings with experimental or artistic qualities, are often more likely to throw a provocative curve at life.
Agents can easily show a 5-br prewar Tudor on lush 4 acres w vu of Snd, but how do they credibly push a house that is not a Jell-O mold for all-in-the-family living -- a house with, say, crackled concrete floors, voluminous space and gyroscopic sunlight pouring through faceted glass onto Stonehenge walls. The kind that is a catalyst for ideas and a trampoline for dreaming. 
 These exceptional houses are seldom found in ads; even when a client works with an architect, it's iffy to expect they can be built from the ground up.
In 1990, after wildfire incinerated the ranch-style house of Victoria and Richard Blades, along with 500 other houses on a hillside in Santa Barbara, the couple realized that their disaster was an opportunity to escape small, boxy rooms. They decided to look for a house with lofty, undecorated areas -- "No chandeliers, please," Mrs. Blades said. They wanted to live in a house that was a work of art, not one with a floor plan calculated for resale.
"We wore out a half-dozen real estate agents," said Mr. Blades, 58, whose work as a conceptual sculptor and metal fabricator influenced his eye for architecture. Mrs. Blades, 52, works in a high-tech company, managing a department that develops CD-ROM's. They have no children.
"Real estate agents wanted to deal with the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, and the kind of roof style," Mr. Blades said. "We were looking for volume. For us, the usual tiny family rooms meant an absurd compartmentalization of space. In most of the places, we couldn't get back far enough to see art. We tried to tell agents we were looking for tough, masculine materials." Instead of a typical high-end house, what they really wanted was a New York loft, set in Santa Barbara.
After many months of looking, the couple chanced to see the Crawford House in Montecito, a collaged composition of cubic forms and materials that fuse with the landscape. They found their way to its architects, the Santa Monica firm Morphosis, to confer with Thom Mayne about building a similar house on their one-acre lot, a house that would become a companion for thinking and sculpturing. The meeting was the start of a sometimes perilous five-year, hands-on collaboration.
With insurance money and savings, the Blades proposed building a $600,000 home of approximately 4,000 square feet, including pool and decks, or about $150 a square foot, with one master bedroom, an upstairs study and a double-height art gallery. (Many design-intensive houses range between $300 and $400 a square foot.) Mr. Mayne, 53, a member of the next architectural generation in Los Angeles after Frank Gehry, designs complex buildings energized by broken and chaotic forms, built of tough but finely crafted materials. Up front, given the budget, the architect said he told his clients that "there would be no marble, no exotic detailing, that we'd be building in generic materials like concrete and wood and metal and block -- that the welds would be showing and the metals would be left rusting and exposed." He added: "It'd be constructed like a cabin. The value of the house would not be in the raw materiality but in space and light."
The budget also meant that the architect's sometimes overfed designs -- as a young architect he often jammed too many ideas into too small a building -- would have to diet. Part of the economic strategy was to eliminate doors and some cabinetry; that decision in turn increased the sense of openness and emphasized the roughhouse qualities the couple had sought in a loft.
Mr. and Mrs. Blades had met a soul mate -- though one with his own esthetic agenda. The house would become a dual story -- of their search for an architectural house and Mr. Mayne's search for architecture.
Mr. Mayne was interested in taking his idea for the Crawford House, a fusion of architecture and landscape, a step further. Instead of placing a self-contained house on a passive piece of land, like setting a plate on a table, the architect wanted to cut and burrow into the earth, shaping the ground as part of the house's form. His inspiration for using the earth as an architectural element was the land artist Michael Heiser -- "He operates on a site by subtracting, rather than adding," Mr. Mayne said -- and the early Los Angeles modernist Richard Neutra, who put humans back into nature via a house that spread into the yard behind expanses of glass. Mr. Mayne's house would not be sited front and center.
His strategy was to create a large outdoor space with high, intermittent walls that suggest an oval and then to cut across the oval with a long thin house under an arching roof. "It's a continuous fluid space," Mr. Mayne said. "You can see all the way through for about 100 feet."
The Bladeses had their loft, or at least its California hillside incarnation. Starting with the kitchen at the lowest level, a big open space steps up the site, moving to the living room and then to the bedroom beyond. The long narrow room splits at the bedroom level, becoming a Y-shape plan. A staircase to Mrs. Blades's second-story study branches off to the right, alongside a dynamically tilted and angled wall that seems to be taking off over an outdoor pool. To the left, the Y branches into the bedroom and dressing area, where an open shower, with poured-in-place concrete half-walls recessed in the ground, anchors the space.
The bedroom, study and staircase area is an intense finale, where all the geometries of the house and site converge and pass through each other, like traffic at an intersection without a signal. No single order dominates, but several jockey for position in a landscape of fragments that marks an ambiguous and intriguing edge between outside and inside.
"There are never any complete geometries, only allusions to complete geometries -- there are never any wholes," Mr. Mayne said. "I was attacking the notion of a single boundary in a house. I wanted to create layers of boundaries."
The architect can afford the openness in the bedroom and bath area because he creates privacy along the street with a long straight, poker-faced wall that houses the garage, bathroom, entrance and gallery. The many "backyard" windows, which come in all shapes and are high and low in the structure, need no curtains.
During construction, the couple lent a hand, becoming subcontractors, fabricating the rails, stairs, parts of a shower and other metal details. "After the catastrophe, the whole design effort and the construction were very motivating," Mr. Blades said.
Although his wife kept her day job, he stopped his sculpture: the house was taking on a demanding life of its own. Living in an interim rental, they worked side by side on weekends, and after the work crews left, they could be found in boots browsing the site as though on a hike. "It was an opportunity to work together," he said.
But even with this help, and periodic cost-control meetings, the price crept beyond the budget, and it became clear that the couple wouldn't be able to afford the house. Mr. Blades, a sometime investor, played the stock market, investing in options and eventually getting into trouble. Just when he faced a $90,000 loss, he bet the ranch by holding on to stocks that seemed to be heading south. The market turned.
"We muscled our way through and ended up a couple hundred thousand dollars ahead," he said. "I had no other way of making money, so we went for it. I wouldn't do it again.'
They finally moved in, five years after they met Mr. Mayne (and after they dislodged an overdedicated contractor). True to unconventional form, the couple have not colonized the interior with designer couches and chairs but have settled in slowly, testing how they want to live in it. Its ambiguity makes it a house of several natures. "The complexity gives us many different locations in the house and on the property to be in," Mr. Blades said. "It's a matter of slowly evolving into the house."
Although the kitchen, dining and living areas and bedroom occupy parts of a continuum under the arching roof, "they're all open to each other," he said, adding, "We're definitely living in a loft, but a loft open laterally to adjacent yards and terraces."
Mrs. Blades said: "There's a feeling of continuity going through inside and outside, and for us that opens up opportunities. From inside, you just see all of nature come alive -- the grass changing colors seasonally, the moon casting its shadows through the house, coyotes on the kill." Duped by Mr. Mayne's sliding glass doors and overlapping boundary walls, a road runner and a gopher snake had, she noted, dropped in for a visit.
T HERE is not just one way to live in it. "Because of the fragmentation, you have to mentally complete the work yourself," the architect said. "I want the house to engage people's perception. That's how people finally interact with the work: they're involved with it. If it's completely predigested and there's only one reading, finally it's just not interesting."
The Bladeses spent months living primarily in the kitchen and bedroom areas, adjusting to its character like a sailor tuning and trimming a boat. They talk excitedly of exploring rooms, of "sleeping in an area that was more of a cave entrance than a house," Mr. Blades said. "Most structures, you walk around a corner, and you understand it right away, and you're bored with it," he added. "Here the windows in the concrete walls are all different, and you can clearly feel the sun moving, projecting shadows through the openings. Your eye steps from one fragment to another, which keeps the house from being flat."
His wife said: "Unlike houses where your views are limited to 15 feet, here your eye moves 40, 50, 60 feet. The area of privacy has expanded way out into a much larger visual field."
They're still tentative about furnishing it. "Do you need a living room?" they ask each other. "What is it, anyway?" For Mr. Blades, populating this open space with sofas is the equivalent of moving furniture into a natural picnic area: one should tread lightly, if at all. "We prefer it kind of empty. We feel more connected to the outside."
When they slide open the room's glass doors, they feel, Mrs. Blades said, "as though we're in a tent, or under a tarp swung over a branch, and the house is like a series of pathways from one part to another."
They are equally tentative about finishing the yard, and not only because Mr. Blades had quadruple-bypass surgery this year. In addition, Mr. Blades said, "financially we hit a wall." The final cost was $800,000.
"The property has native oak and grasses, and we've been struggling with how to extend that within the building," he said. "The yard has a wild, heavy Western feel, and it is interesting to formalize it without killing the native influence, which I'll do with plants and sculpture. From Day 1, I've been waiting for that moment. For now I get partway through a piece, and I can try it in a zillion different places, in the yard and in the house, and stand it two feet away, or 40 feet, getting a continuity of approach that you just don't usually have in many buildings, let alone houses.
"I feel free here. And for our relationship, we're much better able to do things together, cooking in that kitchen, doing the art. I feel an opposite of claustrophobia. I feel much more comfortable. It's really a riot, taking a shower in the open -- it feels so funky. Life has expanded for us."

The Damage Is Done

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT; William Safire is on vacation.

 BODY:
We have to wait now for the farce to run its course.
The voters have come to expect so little of Bill Clinton that they are willing to let him off the hook if he will only make a hypocritical little speech about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. ("I'm sorry. I lied to protect my family," etc., etc.) 
 But if he refuses, and if he sticks to his story before the grand jury, and if DNA tests link him sexually to Ms. Lewinsky despite his adamant denials ("I did not have sexual relations with that woman") -- if all of that happens, well, the voters will probably let him off the hook anyway.
In other words, unless somebody comes up with an X-rated video of the President and his intern cavorting in the Rose Garden, you can forget about impeachment.
But the damage is done. The nation handed its highest office to a man who embodies the narcissistic extremes of the baby-boomer generation. It's all about Bill. And like everyone else who has had a relationship with this irresponsible and self-absorbed individual -- his wife, his friends, his loyal aides, his party -- the nation is paying the price.
There are important issues waiting to be dealt with -- an economic crisis in Asia, the extraordinary gap between America's haves and have-nots, the future of Social Security, campaign finance reform, education, health care, race relations and a Congressional election in November. But there is no leadership coming from Mr. Clinton. He's worried about his grand jury testimony and a devilish stain on a blue dress.
The Clinton Presidency is like a car disabled on the side of the road.
"Half the White House staff is distracted by this," said Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat. Referring to pending legislative matters, Senator Leahy said, "The people we need the most are constantly preparing for grand jury testimony."
Bill Clinton was never about dignity or integrity or respect for others, qualities that should be prerequisites for the Presidency. He raised hopes with his style and his rhetoric, but it turned out there was very little that was authentic about the man. His contempt for the truth is legendary. His idea of ethical behavior is to operate as close as possible to the borders of corruption. His treatment of women, as the world knows, seemed at times both compulsive and atrocious, and became a source of profound embarrassment to the feminists who supported him so strongly.
Although he is nearly 52, Bill Clinton seems the perpetual adolescent, forever calling on aides and friends to clean up the messes he is forever getting himself into. Several associates, enmeshed in his scandals, have gone broke from the legal bills that resulted. Who can forget the terrified expression on the face of the President's personal secretary, Betty Currie, as she made her way to her first grand jury appearance?
The use of Ms. Currie as a go-between is instructive. It was another example of Mr. Clinton's penchant for using people, for seeing human beings as things, as tools or toys to serve his outsized needs. A survey of the consequences of being close to Mr. Clinton would be chilling. The price of being in this President's orbit can be fearfully high.
If Mr. Clinton was at all remorseful about any of this, you'd never know it. Last week he was out in the Hamptons, raising money and hanging with the movie stars.
This is not to say that Bill Clinton's enemies have not behaved atrociously themselves. The extreme right wing of the Republican Party would be happy to impeach the President for any reason at all, for having impure thoughts or daring to breathe. And Kenneth Starr, if he could get away with it, would very likely do its bidding. But it's Mr. Clinton's own behavior and lack of judgment that has so frequently betrayed and undermined his supporters, and provided his enemies with the opportunities and the ammunition to attack.
 The lesson, of course, is that character does matter. The voters will probably remember that the next time around. In the meantime, Mr. Clinton may or may not be contemplating a mea culpa. It doesn't matter. It wouldn't be any more sincere than anything else he has said. If he had any sense of dignity or personal responsibility, he'd be working on his resignation.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Maybe the lottery raises a lot of revenue, but as an investment, it's chancier than you might think.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IT'S the latest American success story: Save your pennies, invest in an organization that donates a third of its income to good works and walk away with a big nest egg, say $161 million.
Maybe Powerball -- and the state lotteries with more modest seven-figure prizes -- aren't what Horatio Alger had in mind. But for the vast majority of people, lotteries are merely a harmless pastime that diverts funds from illegal gambling. "The original idea was to replace the numbers racket and raise some revenue painlessly," reminds Charles Clotfelter, an economist at Duke University. 
 As the states work ever harder to persuade people to play, though, this reasoning is growing weaker. "Once you make it legal," argued Peter Reuter, an economist at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, "you inevitably lose control of the promotion."
For economists, locked in utilitarian reasoning, gambling is hard to explain among people who spend tens of billions of dollars to reduce personal risk. Why, for example, would someone shell out hundreds of dollars every month for medical insurance to eliminate the small risk of having to pay $20,000 in hospital bills -- and then turn around and trade the sure thing of a dollar in hand for one chance in 50,000 of winning $20,000?
And why do lottery players seem to be attracted to the games with the highest payoffs? So-called progressive games, in which uncollected jackpots are carried forward, might explain this phenomenon: as the prize accumulates, the expected return to each dollar wagered does rise, in some cases actually exceeding the amount bet.
But psychological research suggests a simpler explanation. People, it seems, just aren't up to the challenge of comparing tiny probabilities of unlikely things happening. So they may assess the chances of winning a $100 million jackpot as roughly the same as winning a $10 million jackpot.
Besides, noted Robert Frank, an economist at Cornell University, there's a sense that a few million dollars no longer counts as much because it no longer symbolizes true, drop-dead wealth. "Great fortunes are far more visible today than a few decades ago," he said.
No matter how the frenzy is explained, there's no doubt that business is booming. Last year, according to La Fleur's World Lottery Almanac (www.lafleurs.com), Americans paid $34 billion for lottery tickets -- up from $16 billion in 1988. Of the $34 billion, prizes absorbed 54.5 percent, and selling costs 5.8 percent. That left $11.5 billion for state-financed causes like education or aid to the elderly.
While states almost always earmark lottery proceeds for the needy at the outset, Mr. Reuter notes that the revenues do not seem to change government spending priorities in the long run: One way or another, an extra $100 million from the lottery for schools means roughly $100 million less for education from general revenues.
Lottery proceeds, like taxes on cigarettes, are widely perceived as "good" taxes because they are voluntary. No one, after all, is forced to buy lottery tickets. But while no one can deny the popularity of this back door to revenue, economists are generally appalled by the states' increasing dependence on lotteries. "This is a large, terribly regressive tax on a service sold by a state monopoly," Mr. Reuter argued.
What would he do about it? A modest step would be to eliminate advertising aimed at expanding the market. Massachusetts, where lottery spending (at 1.7 percent of personal income) is twice the national average, has been shamed into gestures in this direction.
A much bolder step would be to slash the effective tax rate by increasing the percentage paid in prizes. If one state did it, others might be forced to follow. On the other hand, why would a state kill the goose that is laying those billion-dollar eggs?
Robert Frank of Cornell argues that the state monopoly itself is a mistake because it links government to the socially destructive impulse to try to get rich quick. "I think states should be out of the business entirely," he said, perhaps by licensing and taxing private lotteries.
There is some hope that advertising for the lottery will subside, if only because the market is saturated. But even economists aren't naive enough to believe that the states will abandon a vastly profitable -- and popular -- monopoly in the name of civic virtue.
Besides, great things are sometimes done with lottery proceeds. "They built the Sydney opera house, perhaps the most interesting building in the country, with lottery money," recalled Mr. Reuter, who is Australian born. "Of course, it cost many times the amount originally budgeted," he said, "and that meant the hospitals did without lottery proceeds for a few extra years."

HEADLINE: Machinists Reject Northwest Airlines Pact

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: EAGAN, Minn., Aug. 5

 BODY:
The International Association of Machinists announced today that members had rejected tentative contract agreements with Northwest Airlines and authorized a strike.
The vote means that both sides will return to negotiations under a Federal mediator. No date was set for resumption of talks between Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, and its largest union. 
 "We're actually very proud of the show of solidarity," said Jill Hogan, secretary-treasurer of the International Association of Machinists.
"We are disappointed," said Doug McKeen, a Northwest vice president in charge of labor relations.
The countdown is already under way toward a strike by Northwest's pilots. The National Mediation Board declared talks between Northwest and the Air Line Pilots Association at an impasse last week, causing a 30-day cooling-off period. Pilots could strike as early as Aug. 29.
Pay and work rules are major issues in both disputes.
In announcing the results of the vote, Northwest's largest union said 85 percent of its voting members had authorized a strike.
More than 23,000 of the approximately 27,000 union ground workers cast ballots, Ms. Hogan said. Union members include mechanics, baggage handlers, office and security workers, with hourly pay ranging from $6.53 to $21.63.

HEADLINE: A Healthy Turn for China's Army

 BODY:
Over the last 20 years, China's army has become almost as formidable a force in the Chinese economy as it is in military affairs. Encouraged by the Government to supplement official defense budgets with profits from army-owned businesses, the military developed a multibillion-dollar empire of some 15,000 companies, including clothing manufacturers, airlines and hotels as well as defense-related industries.
Last month President Jiang Zemin ordered the army to sever its connections with these companies, with some of the lost revenues to be replaced by increased government spending. His initiative should reinforce China's economic and budgetary reforms, strengthen civilian authority over army leaders and create a more professional military, less likely to intervene in political affairs or complicate relations between China and the United States. 
 Having army-owned businesses sell defense equipment to the military invited corruption. Army businesses also proved ideal conduits for smuggling, with their ability to move luxury goods undetected across borders. The financial cushion provided by these businesses also made military leaders dangerously independent of government control and individually rich and powerful.
Since consolidating power last fall Mr. Jiang has put forward a surprisingly ambitious agenda of reforms, including closing unprofitable state industries, reducing government bureaucracy and, now, extricating the army from business. He has also encouraged a limited debate about introducing more democracy into China's authoritarian political system.
These are promising steps, pointing toward a better governed, more market-oriented and slightly freer China. China now has a leader with a reform plan and the political authority to put it into effect.

What Caused Wall Street's Summer Swoon?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
If you own stocks, taking a summer vacation may be a bad idea. You might return a lot poorer.
It was less than three weeks ago, on July 17, that the big stock indexes hit new records amid general celebration that the American economy was performing ever so wonderfully, whatever might happen to Asia. 
 But by late yesterday afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks had lost 10 percent of their peak value, although there had been no epochal event that would seem likely to cause such a fall.
At least for now, that plunge has been halted. Just before 3:30 P.M. yesterday, a flood of buy orders hit the New York Stock Exchange, many of them to be executed at the close of trading. It looked as if a big mutual fund -- perhaps an index fund that buys all the stocks in the S.&P. 500 -- had committed a lot of money to stocks. Whoever did it, the move lifted prices, and spirits.
Still, the question remains: What set this off? There is no shortage of explanations from the seers. They point to worries about Asia, to weakening corporate profits, and even to Monica Lewinsky. Some see disappointment over Senate resistance to further cuts in capital gains taxes, or over testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who seems unwilling to lower interest rates despite signs of a slowing economy.
There is a case to be made for all of those things having negative implications for share prices, but there could be a simpler explanation. Maybe American investors are running a little low on money to pour into the stock market. The most notable factor in the recent growth of the American economy has been the strong purchasing by American consumers. All that buying of goods may have left less cash available for stocks.
In fact, the great bull market of the 1990's was looking a bit shaky even before the current plunge. Big stocks recovered from a sag that began in the spring, but little ones did not. The Russell 2000 -- the best index of small stocks -- is down 19 percent from its April peak. The stocks that were moving were the big blue chips, which have risen to unprecedented valuations, and some Internet stocks that produced rampant speculation.
Notwithstanding the recent turmoil, there is no sign that Americans have lost their faith in stocks. Aging baby boomers still see stocks as the best place for their retirement money. It is unlikely that will change unless stock prices fall much further -- and over a much longer time period -- than they have so far. With long-term Treasury bonds yielding less than 5.7 percent, alternative investments do not look attractive.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman, Sachs strategist who has been bullish -- and right -- since 1991, reassured her followers yesterday by saying that profits were better than they seemed while the worst impact of Asian problems was behind us. You can get an argument on either point, but a wholesale flight from American stocks seems unlikely until the arguments are decided. It would probably take an American recession.
There is a wild card here, however. Never before has the American economy been so dependent on the stock market. Some economists say that a large part of recent growth in consumer demand has reflected the feeling of wealth brought on by higher stock prices. A bear market, if one comes, would damage the economy. The nice circle -- with the economy and the stock market pushing each other higher -- will not last forever.

Crime Is Unleashed but the D.A. Is Undaunted

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Samuel Del Villar, Mexico City's Harvard-educated District Attorney, works like a man with a mission, guzzling black coffee through 15-hour days in his crusade to suppress crime and corruption. And there's always more to do.
In the eight months since Mexico's City's opposition Mayor appointed him to office, he has dismissed police commanders accused of torture, auto theft, assault, kidnapping and narcotics trafficking. Last week, 63 detectives were dismissed after they tested positive for drug use. Three days later, he ordered the arrest of a prosecutor and eight subordinates after the jail-cell rape of a teen-age prostitute who sought police protection from her pimp. 
 Along this march of dismal events, however, Mr. Del Villar had cause to brighten one recent day when, on a visit to a downtown police precinct, he heard a detective complain that typing up routine reports took hours on a manual typewriter.
"Could you use some computers?" Mr. Del Villar asked, savoring the July 21 settlement that followed his prosecution of International Business Machines on conspiracy charges related to a procurement contract. I.B.M. is to pay Mexico City $37.5 million in cash and new computers, which he says will help to modernize the city's vast criminal justice bureaucracy. "We're going to have lots of computers!" he said.
The I.B.M. case is the largest achievement so far for Mr. Del Villar, whom Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas swore in last December with the pledge, "We're going to take the city back from the criminals." Mr. Del Villar is under pressure to show progress before Mr. Cardenas's expected presidential run in 2000, but he faces a staggering challenge, not just because organized crime is so entrenched but also because the police are discredited and he faces daily nit-picking in a hostile press.
"Corruption has been Mexico's disaster, because nobody has taken the law into account," said Mr. Del Villar during a breakfast of papayas and mangos at his downtown offices. "This is our chance to work for the rule of law."
Mr. Del Villar, who is 53, presides over the Attorney General's Office of Mexico City, supervising the city's 3,700-officer detective corps, known as the judicial police, and the 1,500 prosecutors, in a city of 8.5 million.
"I found him very bright, very interested," said Ray Kelly, the former New York Police Commissioner, with whom Mr. Del Villar discussed New York's efforts against police corruption during a dinner last year at the home in New York of Victor Gotbaum, the longtime union leader. "He was looking at what we'd done. He seemed familiar with the details. But obviously he has a heavy lift ahead of him on police corruption in Mexico City."
Mr. Del Villar, who holds degrees from Mexican and European universities and a doctorate in law from Harvard, has sought criminal justice reform throughout his career. He returned from Harvard in 1972 convinced of the need to strengthen Mexico's Supreme Court, which has been a mere holding pen for presidential cronies, and urged a prominent leader of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to seek appointment as Chief Justice.
But the PRI leader scoffed, Mr. Del Villar recalled. "He said that to be on the Supreme Court was just to be in limbo."
Mr. Del Villar got his own chance at reform when President Miguel de la Madrid appointed him in 1982 to head a campaign aimed at rooting out corruption. Eventually Mr. Del Villar concluded that he lacked presidential support and resigned, but not before arranging passage of a law requiring competitive bidding in Government procurement contracts.
That was the law he accused I.B.M. executives and city officials of violating when they arranged the 1996 purchase of a $26 million computer system.
His largest step toward political reform came after the 1988 presidential voting, which he denounced as fraudulent. He quit the PRI and helped Mr. Cardenas form the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
If the I.B.M. case has drawn him considerable praise, previous months were difficult. His first week in office, he was stunned by accusations that a top commander he had just appointed had headed a police unit tied to the torture and murder of a prisoner. Mr. Del Villar replaced the commander but faced weeks of attack in newspapers.
"This is an intelligent man who has always been a crusader," said Denise Dresser, a political scientist. "His main problem is that he is not fully in control of the Attorney General's office."
He is working to consolidate his grasp. During his tenure he has ordered the arrest of 60 subordinates. He has outlined sweeping plans to decentralize his agency, setting up new offices for reporting crimes throughout the city, including some in subway stations.
He has also inaugurated programs to train thousands of police officers and to consolidate law enforcement as a professional career by raising salaries. A rookie detective earns $517 a month.
These efforts keep him running. One day last week, his Chevrolet Suburban nosed into an underground garage before 8 A.M. and minutes later he was in his 11th-floor office, briefing a reporter over breakfast. At 10 A.M. he was at the head of a conference table with civic leaders, shining a laser pointer on a wall map of the city center to outline a campaign against muggers.
At noon, he was leading a tour of a precinct station that is a pilot project for a plan to reorganize the way citizens report crimes and the police book suspects, with an eye to eliminating delays and bribery.
He ordered the precinct's holding cells, which were originally adjacent to desks where citizens report crimes, relocated down a hallway after discovering that detained suspects were shouting threats at crime victims. From behind the bars of the newly constructed cells, a teen-age purse-snatcher whispered to him that corrupt police were protecting his daily thievery. Mr. Del Villar ordered an aide to investigate.
Through the afternoon there were meetings at two other precincts and examination of the curriculum at the Police Academy. As the sun set, Mr. Del Villar was back at headquarters, discussing security for the subways and schools. During a pause, he pored over graphs that he said showed reported crimes decreasing since he took office. Critics dispute that.
"I'll vouch for Samuel's honesty, but it's too early to draw judgments about crime trends," said Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a criminologist at the National University.
If there is debate over short-term trends, there is none about the alarming surge over recent years. Reported crimes doubled in the city in four years, from 366 daily in 1993 to 700 last year. Some criminologists attribute this to the economic crisis and some suggest other causes. Mr. Del Villar blames changes in the penal code in 1993 that encouraged criminals by raising the evidentiary threshold required for prosecutors to obtain indictments.
He has proposed legal reforms, and two PRI senators were waiting to discuss them. It was 9:30 P.M. when Mr. Del Villar poured another cup of coffee and stepped into his office to greet them.

HEADLINE: Summer, and Working Is Easy;
Nation's Resorts and Parks Are Feeling the Labor Pinch

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.

 BODY:
Sonji Thomas of Kingstree, S.C., started working at the Pavilion Amusement Park in this popular beach resort in late May, after finishing her junior year at Columbia College, a small liberal arts school in this state's capital.
Earning $6.25 an hour for everything from taking tickets to filling in for co-workers on break, she said, "I've earned money, made friends and met a lot of people." 
 She would have made even more if her roommate had not quit her summer job in late July, leaving Miss Thomas to shoulder the entire $170-a- week apartment rental herself -- an amount equal to two-thirds of her weekly salary.
She reluctantly returned home to prepare for the start of school on Aug. 26 -- leaving the Pavilion to fill the void left by her and the rest of the park's 475 seasonal employees who quit before summer's end.
Syreeta Owens, 18, of Marion, S.C., is planning her own departure from the Pavilion on Aug. 14 in order to begin her freshman year at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C., on Aug. 26.
Increasingly, at resorts and parks throughout the United States, the late-summer void left by American students is being staffed by retirees and foreign students, whose school terms often begin later in the fall.
While most retired workers work only part time, they have become essential to the seasonal tourist industry, especially during a period of low unemployment. The retirees are vital in national and state parks in October, after the students depart and millions of visitors arrive to view the changing leaves. And any number of amusement parks, from Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., to Six Flags Great Adventure and Safari in Jackson, N.J., roll out the welcome mat for retired people.
In fact, the number of employees age 50 and over at Six Flags, New Jersey's biggest seasonal employer, has more than doubled to about 600 since 1996. And this year, for the first time, Sea World of Florida -- whose 900 part-time workers include many retirees -- is offering part-timers who have worked six consecutive months the choice of cash bonuses or either of two medical insurance plans.
At his post beside a collection of amusement park antique autos in the Pavilion at Myrtle Beach, where he and his wife, Minnie, work as ride operators, Joseph McCracken, a 74-year-old retired farmer with a pacemaker, said he was well satisfied to be working at the park at his age and in his condition.
"Farming's never done," he said, explaining that both he and his wife spent years behind a mule, plowing their 35-acre farm in Aynor, S.C. "In all that time we never had a vacation. This is a vacation."
Mary E. Basden, the head of human resources for Burroughs & Chapin, the company that owns the Pavilion and many other attractions here, said: "It's usually a problem getting college students to stay through Labor Day. But it has never been as much of a problem as this year, mostly because there are so many job openings in Myrtle Beach and not enough people to fill them. People will quit to go someplace else for a nickel or a dime. And these aren't experienced workers. A lot of them are kids with their first job, and a lot of them still lack social skills."
The Pavilion, in order to retain student workers, gives a bonus to every seasonal employee who stays until Labor Day, and a scholarship bonus of up to $2,500 for employees who work at the park four consecutive years.
As if to underscore the labor shortage, restaurants, motels, souvenir shops, pizza parlors and convenience markets all along Route 17 and Ocean Boulevard, this city's two main roads, are plastered with help wanted signs, often with assurances that experience is not necessary.
But Myrtle Beach is not unique when it comes to a shortage of summer help, only that its problem is exacerbated by the fact that it draws some 13 million tourists a year, most of them in summer.
Employers in tourist destinations are scrambling as never before to hire seasonal employees and to retain those they have. Not only was the 4.7 percent unemployment rate in June the lowest in almost 30 years, but high schools and colleges increasingly begin fall sports practice and even classes by the third week of August, often because they have longer breaks during the school year. And, employers report, many students spurn entry-level salaries for vacations of their own or for summer internships, even unpaid internships.
To lure even inexperienced workers, many hard-pressed employers are offering $6 or more an hour, or at least 85 cents above the $5.15 national minimum wage -- and as much as $7 or $8 for cooks, chambermaids and security guards. Many employers recruit retired men and women at job fairs, or hire the many foreign students who arrive through student exchange employment programs, or, increasingly, simply turn up asking for a job.
When all else fails, or simply to prevent a labor shortage, many employers are offering inducements practically unheard of a year or two ago:
*At Seagram's Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla., employees who stay until at least the third week in August are eligible for a drawing whose prizes include a 1998 Chevrolet Tracker, a four-day Caribbean cruise for two, a free flight for two anywhere in the United States and cash awards of $5,000, $3,000 and $1,000.
*Elitch Gardens amusement park in Denver budgets up to $5,000 for scholarships, the amount depending on length of service, and recently began helping students apply for Federal aid and student loans for which they are eligible.
*At Lake Powell, the vast recreation area on the border of Arizona and Utah, the Aramark Corporation, the park concessionaire based in Philadelphia, pays an additional 25 cents an hour in a lump sum at the end of the summer to employees who fulfill their summer contracts. In addition, employees are treated to luaus and barbecues, and given free use of a houseboat for a week.
*The Inn on Lake Superior, in Duluth, Minn., pays about $5.50 an hour -- but adds an additional $1 an hour to an employee's tuition fund, up to $500 a year.
*At Yellowstone National Park, new workers start at $5.25 an hour, but are given subsidized room and board. They are also allowed to arrange their schedules to create an occasional four-day weekend. Even at that, to fill the park's 2,600 positions throughout the summer requires Amfac Parks and Resorts of Aurora, Colo., the park concessionaire, to hire 3,400 people.
*Ocean City, N.J., where the beach patrol dwindles from 125 lifeguards early in the season to fewer than 50 by Labor Day, recently sent invitations to "all old guards who are interested in returning to guard part time in August." The city expects about 25 old-timers, about the same as last summer, among them teachers, airline pilots and other professionals.
While Ocean City's invitation is somewhat unusual, in that lifeguards usually conjure up images of youth, summer businesses would have a hard time operating this summer -- other than on a vastly reduced scale -- without retirees.
"We use a lot of retired people, especially when we start losing employees in mid-August," said Terry Slowinski, regional general manager for Aramark, which operates the refreshment concessions and catering services at Lake Powell, Alaska's Denali National Park and a dozen other national and state parks.
Akane Nagatomo, 22, who has been working at Lake Powell since May and plans to remain until Labor Day, said, "I noticed older people working here, and it's impressive how much they accomplish and how much they seem to be enjoying themselves."
Unlike most of the foreign workers holding summer jobs up and down the Atlantic Seaboard who come from Europe, Miss Nagatomo is from the island of Kyushu in Japan. Majoring in hospitality at Mesa State College in Grand Junction, Colo., she earns $5.75 an hour, plus dormitory housing, at Lake Powell while fulfilling the 540 hours required of her internship. Many other parks, including amusement parks, offer internships to students, as do many hotels.
Except for occasional "strays" who turn up, most foreign students arrive with J-1 visas allowing them to work and travel in the United States for up to four months.
"It's basically a program that allows the kids to learn English," said Casey Slamin, project manager of Interexchange, which has been bringing foreign students to work in the United States for more than 20 years. This summer, he said, Interexchange has brought in about 3,500 such workers, most of them from Europe. In the winter, when the seasons and the school year are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere, it brings in college students from Australia, South Africa and Latin America to work in ski resorts.
Despite periodic demands that America tighten its immigration policy, there appears to have been little or no backlash against foreign college students -- not just because of the shortage of home-grown workers this summer, but also because "most employers want to internationalize their work staff," Mr. Slamin said, "so even during high unemployment, foreign workers would still fill a niche."
Another big reason for hiring foreign students, employers here and elsewhere say, is that European colleges do not usually start before October.
Peter Nolan, an electrical engineering major at University College Cork in Cork, Ireland, is not due back until Oct. 5. He is a busboy at the Kansas Steak House here earning $5.25 an hour. "I'm hoping to become a server," he said, "because they make good tips."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Fed's Survey Finds Economy Is Cooler but Remains Warm

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The American economy was operating at a healthy pace through July, but growth showed signs of slowing as slumping exports to Asia and labor shortages were felt nationwide, the Federal Reserve said today.
"Despite the high level of economic activity in recent weeks, many districts noted that labor shortages, shipping bottlenecks and continued weakness in East Asia were beginning to temper growth in their regions," the Fed's beige book economic summary said. 
 The survey by the central bank covers June 8 through July 27. It was based on interviews with business executives in all 12 Federal Reserve districts and will be used by policy-setting members of the Federal Open Market Committee when they meet on Aug. 18 to consider interest-rate strategy. The signs of slower growth and restrained price pressures suggest the Fed can keep interest rates steady.
The Fed's summary implied that robust domestic demand was still warding off the worst effects of Asia's crisis, but it highlighted the influences that were putting some drag on domestic expansion.
The Fed said manufacturing remained at a high level in July despite a United Automobile Workers' strikes against General Motors, weakening demand for exports and a general slowing in high technology.
But factories were starting to feel the impact of Asia's woes, as exports slowed and the volume of cheap imports rose.
Jobs were plentiful and skilled employees especially were in demand.
Farmers hit by falling commodity prices -- in part because Asian countries are unable to buy as much food from America -- were feeling a profit pinch, the Fed noted, aggravated by drought conditions in the South.
Consumer spending at retail stores increased in late June and July and inventories were described as balanced, a sign that producers were not being restrained by large stocks of unsold goods from the first quarter, when inventory-building occurred at a record pace.
Separately, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported today that its index of nonmanufacturing business conditions fell to 57.5 in July from 61.5 the previous month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
ABC and ESPN Make a Dual $600 Million Bid to Acquire N.H.L. Television Rights

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Despite falling ratings for National Hockey League telecasts, ABC and ESPN have mounted a combined $600 million bid for broadcast and cable television rights for five years to start in 1999, said executives involved in the talks.
At $120 million a year, the bid would represent a stunning 167 percent leap over the average annual rights payment that Fox ($31 million) and ESPN (about $14 million) have been paying. The offer would also double what Fox and ESPN are to pay in the coming season, the last year of their deals. 
 But Fox only has to match the ABC offer by Aug. 14 to retain its rights. The ABC part of the deal is about $250 million, the executives said.
"We've been informed of the ABC and ESPN bid and we're examining our options," said Vince Wladika, a Fox spokesman.
The cable portion, which is an estimated $350 million, is greater than ABC's because ESPN and ESPN2 would carry more games. ESPN has been showing one game a week and ESPN2 has shown three.
Fox could counter with a dual bid, adding FX or the Fox Sports Net as its cable component. Fox and FX currently carry major league baseball nationally. But low ratings and the size of the ABC-ESPN bid make matching unlikely.
"Hockey has good demographics, a high proportion of young males watching and growth projected because of the roller blading side of the game," said Neal Pilson, a sports television industry consultant. "But if these numbers are true, I'm hard pressed to come up with a rationale based on television economics."
ABC and ESPN, which are subsidiaries of the Walt Disney Company, made no comment on their joint bid. Their talks, which were held at the N.H.L. meetings in Nashville, were first reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. The ABC-ESPN bid is the newest evidence of escalating sports rights costs. In January, ABC, ESPN, Fox and CBS agreed to eight-year deals worth $17.6 billion to carry the National Football League games. Now, ESPN and ABC are heavily cross-promoting full seasons of Sunday night and Monday night games.
In mounting its hockey bid, Disney is trying to protect important programming for ESPN and ESPN2 from an incursion by Fox, and to create a broadcast position, with ABC, from which hockey can be heavily cross-promoted.
Disney's N.H.L. ties also include ownership of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Disney is also looking to a hoped-for uptick in national hockey interest because of in-line skating and the addition of teams in Nashville this season, Atlanta in the 1999-2000 season and Columbus and St. Paul the season after.
But even with Fox as hockey's broadcaster, ratings struggled. Fox's regular-season Nielsen rating fell 33 percent to a 1.4 from a 2.1 peak two years ago. And with teams from markets like New York, Philadelphia and Chicago faltering in the playoffs, Fox's post-season rating dropped from a 2.1 last season to a 1.8 this season. Disappointed by the ratings skid, Fox pared its 1998-99 regular-season schedule from an average of six regional games a week to three, over 11 weeks.
ESPN's rating last season fell to a 0.7 from a 0.8 in the 1996-97 season, while ESPN2's 0.4 rating was unchanged from last year.
Regarding ESPN's bid, Mike Soltys, a spokesman, said, "Our extension is not finalized." He would not address the ABC bid.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Treasury Prices Fall as the First of Big Debt Sales Begin

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bonds fell yesterday as the Treasury and companies, including Worldcom Inc., lined up to sell more than $40 billion of debt in coming days.
"Supply continues to weigh heavily on the market," said Dan Johnedis, who helps manage about $15 billion in bonds for Baring Asset Management in Boston. He has been buying high-yield bonds from companies that have little exposure to Asia's financial turmoil. 
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 17/32, to 106 17/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.67 percent, from 5.63 percent on Tuesday.
The Treasury said it will sell $37 billion in 5-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds next week, in its quarterly debt sales. Worldcom and other companies are expected to sell about $6 billion in corporate bonds in coming days, after Fannie Mae sold $3 billion in five-year notes yesterday. Treasury bills and notes, securities considered to be among the safest and easiest to trade, gained as some investors sought shelter from a volatile stock market.
"Equity accounts are looking for a safe place and that is helping" shorter-term Treasuries, said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond strategist at Miller, Tabak Hirsch & Company.
Fannie Mae kicked off yesterday's debt offerings, selling $3 billion of its five-year benchmark notes at 27.75 basis points more than comparable Treasury securities. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
The nation's largest buyer of home mortgages started its benchmark note program earlier this year, in part to capitalize on a decline in debt sales by the United States Government.
The $37 billion in securities scheduled to be sold next week by the Treasury is about $1.5 billion less than anticipated by analysts. A strong economy and surging tax revenue have put the Government on track for its first budget surplus in almost 30 years, and reduced its borrowing needs.
The Government will sell $16 billion of 5-year notes on Tuesday, $11 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday and $10 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE TRADING;
Fund Investors Buoy Stocks as Dow Recovers A Bit of Loss

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
While professional stock traders vacillated yesterday between certainty that the worst was over and fear that more declines remain ahead, mutual fund investors, who have provided crucial fuel to the market's advance in recent years, remained steadfast, if cautious.
As a result, the day was volatile, with prices swinging wildly between gains and losses but finishing generally higher. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 59.47 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,546.78. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the second heaviest ever, after a market plunge last October, with 859.21 million shares changing hands. 
 Midsized and small stocks continued to suffer. The Nasdaq composite index eeked out a gain of 2.56, to 1,788.20, but the Russell 2000 index, a small-cap benchmark, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Much of the credit for yesterday's gains might go to Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman, Sachs & Company's widely followed investment strategist, who weighed in from Israel, where she is vacationing, to call the recent decline an "overreaction."
Ms. Cohen's comments echoed through lower Manhattan's financial district yesterday, drawing sighs of relief, if not cheers, even from traders at rival firms. On Salomon Smith Barney's giant trading floor, traders repeated Ms. Cohen's remark that "stocks are trading at undervalued levels" throughout the morning.
As on Tuesday, much of the move in the major market averages yesterday came in the last half-hour of trading, when the Dow industrials bounced from a loss of 125 points to a gain of 59 points. Earlier, the industrial average at one point was up more than 87 points.
Throughout the day, the stock market looked as if Sisyphus were in charge. Bouts of selling from computer-driven investment programs sent the market averages plunging. Slower, steadier gains followed, only to be overtaken by rapid declines.
The one clear, unwavering factor in the recent activity has been the bullish stance of Ms. Cohen. Yesterday she said that she continued to believe that earnings, Asian developments and the outlook for inflation and interest rates all support "a favorable case for equity ownership."
In an interview, Ms. Cohen said, "The recent weakness in stock prices has not been accompanied by a proportionate fundamental weakness." In addition, she said, "the latest news on the economy and corporate performance has been better than is commonly perceived."
Therefore, Ms. Cohen said, she expects the Dow industrials will "easily surpass" the 9,300 level by the end of the year. "We look at a somewhat longer time horizon," she said. "Over the longer term, the fundamentals still look quite favorable," despite any "short-term noise."
Ms. Cohen pointed out that although overall earnings for the companies in the S.& P. 500 stock index did not grow from the period a year earlier, operating profits -- measured before special charges -- rose by 5.7 percent in the quarter.
But even that is less than some investors would like to see. "At the beginning of the year, people were expecting earnings to grow 14 percent," said Robert C. Doll Jr., manager of the $2.2 billion Oppenheimer Growth fund. "While 5.7 percent is not so awful on an absolute basis, relative to the 14 percent people were expecting, it's a horrible shortfall."
Not that Mr. Doll has been selling stocks this week -- for more than a year, he has kept more than one-third of his fund's assets in cash, because he cannot justify buying when most price-earnings multiples are so high.
Over the last two weeks, however, Mr. Doll said, he has been "nibbling away," buying certain stocks as prices declined and reducing his cash position to 36 percent of assets from 42 percent.
Corporations, too, seem to see some value in the lower stock prices produced by the recent market decline. At least 15 companies announced programs this week to repurchase their own stock, said Richard Peterson, an analyst at the Securities Data Company.
Mutual fund investors did not appear to be too troubled by the market's last two days. Some fund companies, like Fidelity Investments, the country's largest, reported that investors moved relatively small amounts of money from stocks into bond and money market funds. Others, however, like the Vanguard Group, said that optimistic investors put as much money into stock funds as pessimistic investors pulled out.
Brian Mattes, a Vanguard spokesman, said a far greater number of callers to Vanguard's telephone center were interested in simply checking their account balances.
A big reason investors are not likely to be much worried is that they generally still have hefty profits in their mutual fund accounts. Since the beginning of 1995, investors have poured nearly $600 billion into mutual funds that invest primarily in American stocks and they have aggregate profits totaling 46 percent, based on a weighted-average calculation of the prices at which that money flowed into mutual funds -- 739 on the S.& P. 500 -- and where it is now, 1,081.43.
Clearly it will take more than a 3 percent decline in prices, as the market suffered Tuesday, or more than the 10 percent decline from its peak that the S.& P. 500 hit at its low yesterday, to shake investors' faith. Yesterday the S.& P. 500 rose 9.31, for a gain of nearly nine-tenths of a percent.
Foreign equity markets generally declined yesterday, following Tuesday's sharp drop on Wall Street. European stock indexes fell between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, while Asian markets generally declined by 1.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei index fell less sharply, however, on Tuesday, declining by two-tenths of 1 percent.
Most professional investors expect the volatility to continue. "Unfortunately, too many people have gotten used to relatively low volatility and one direction of stock movement, which is up," said Robert Bissell, president and chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, a unit of Wells Fargo & Company.
The biggest remaining question for investors around the world is whether the weight of the bull market might be getting too heavy for Abby Cohen to keep pushing up the hill.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Graph: "After the Fall"
Tuesday marked the 22d time since 1987 that the market fell at least 5 percent from its peak over a period of a day or more. If history is any guide, the market will rebound. It is unlikely to recover all its losses in four weeks, though, as that has happened only twice. The graph shows the Dow Jones industrial average since 1987.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE INVESTORS;
Small Stockholders Again Refuse to Panic

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Jean Taranto isn't the kind who frets over a gyrating stock market. Prices go up and down, sometimes violently, but the American economy appears to be as strong as ever, she says. All that is to say that the stock market selloff Tuesday, which saw the Dow Jones industrial average plunge 299.43 points, is just one of the things investors must get used to.
"It's nothing to get desperate about," said Ms. Taranto, a Brooklyn teacher. "The news people are making it sound like a catastrophe. But I have a lot of telephone stocks, and my stocks did O.K." 
 That attitude, one of staying the course -- investing for the long term and remaining loyal to one of the greatest bull markets in history -- has time and again guided investors through the bumps and bruises of Wall Street trading in the 1990's.
But whether such complacency -- or a lack of fear -- is enough to pull the stock market out of a nasty slump that seems to have been caused in recent weeks by continuing fears about slowing profit growth at home and the festering economic crisis in Asia is another question.
The Dow Jones industrial average rallied yesterday, closing 59.47 points higher at 8,546.78. The gains were unremarkable, and hardly a clear indication of buoyant investor sentiment. Yet they are a sign that investors are not fleeing the market.
"What am I going to do?" asks Barbara J. Lewis, who runs a bed-and-breakfast in Cornish, N.H. "I don't know what I can do. I think just waiting would be a good way to handle this."
One thing is certain: Americans have had a love affair with the stock market. They now have more of their assets tied up in stocks than at any time in the last 50 years. And that means that sharp price movements can rapidly alter an individual's financial worth, for better or worse.
Since 1990, of course, a tremendous bull-market bubble has created enormous wealth for many Americans, and created young billionaires as well. In the fall of 1987, when the stock market crashed, and the Dow industrials fell to 1,738.41, Wall Street feared a recession. But the Dow has since rebounded and then some -- rising as high as 9,337.97. The question now is: has the market run its course? And how are investors coping with a summer selloff that has erased 8.5 percent from the industrial average and much more from an array of smaller-company stocks?
The only consensus is that Americans are transfixed by stocks. Their optimism has been buttressed over the years by bullish calls of Wall Street analysts and financial planners, who have long held that times are good and that the best way to save for retirement is by investing long term in a rising market. "I don't see any alternative but to wait it out, so I don't plan to change anything," said Dale Strok, a software magazine editor in Long Beach, Calif.
Of course, it is unclear whether summer vacations are skewing trading and Wall Street impressions of investor sentiment. But retail stockbrokers and mutual fund companies said that phone lines were not jammed yesterday and that it was caution, not panic, that had set in.
And in interviews with smaller investors around the country, many of whom have weathered sharp declines, the attitude is: the market will come back. "I'm going to stay the course," said Daniel Saltzberg, 75, a retail clothing consultant. "This market has to go up to at least 10,000. The economy is great. And where else will capital go?"
Mr. Saltzberg and others point to events last summer. A sharp market downturn began in August with a currency crisis in Southeast Asia, punishing stock prices, and this set the stage for the fierce selloff on Oct. 27, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 554 points, or 7.2 percent, in one day. (The market slowly recovered, and went on to gain more than 30 percent in less than a year.)
So the seasonal volatility could be exaggerating the market's course. For while the summer is best known for rallies and record highs, the late summer has also been known for volatile swings in prices and sharp declines that lead to banner headlines. In August 1990, for example, the Dow lost about 10 percent of its value as the nation confronted Persian Gulf tensions caused by Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
Still, the knowledge that stock prices can go through violent swings, and still move higher from year to year, may be comforting investors who believe they can ride out the latest downturn. "I'm not that concerned," said Theodore Garner, 48, a financial auditor in Portland, Ore. "I've been in the market for 10 or 12 years, and I'm not going to take money out for another 10 years; so it doesn't bother me much. The gains from the mid-1980's have grown so much that it doesn't matter if the Dow slips back down to 7,000."
Mr. Garner is not alone. A nationwide poll released Monday said it would take an "unprecedented market drop" of about 1,000 points in a single day to fully shake the confidence of small investors.
Of course, such a drop in the Dow would mean a loss of 11.7 percent, a figure that would not be unprecedented. The Dow fell 22.3 percent on Oct. 19, 1987, and 7.2 percent last Oct. 27. But such a huge point decline could seem monstrous to investors, some of whom may not realize that gains in points are less significant with the Dow near the 9,000 range.
According to the survey, by America's Research Group, stockholders would alter their investments if an armed conflict broke out or with Presidential impeachment. And they could fold if the Dow plunged 1,000 points in one day. But among the biggest concerns was a rise in interest rates, the same thing that shook bull markets in 1929 and 1987.
Few strategists think that interest rates will climb in coming months. But corporate earnings are growing at their slowest pace in more than seven years and if earnings growth sends the market into reverse, the experts do not know whether smaller investors will continue to buy into the slumps.
"I still think the psychology of the small and medium investor is buy on the dips," said Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of "Stocks for the Long Run." "But what concerns me is not the first dip; it's the second dip. People who have bought the first dip have always been winners. But suppose the market continues to fall. Who will buy then?"

HEADLINE: Auto Dealers Settle Charges of Boycott

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
A group of 25 auto dealers in the Northwest agreed today to settle Federal charges it illegally threatened to boycott the Chrysler Corporation in an effort to thwart competition from low-priced Internet dealers.
In an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, the car dealers, members of the Fair Allocation System Inc., agreed not to participate or threaten a boycott of any automobile manufacturer. The Montana-based group includes a substantial number of Chrysler dealerships in eastern Washington, Idaho and western Montana, the F.T.C. said. 
 The F.T.C. said the group planned to boycott the nation's third-largest car maker unless it restricted distribution to rival dealers that market on the Internet. Group members threatened to refuse to sell certain Chrysler vehicles and limit warranty service, the F.T.C. said.
The group primarily picked as a target Dave Smith Motors of Kellogg, Idaho, a Chrysler dealer that had been attracting customers by offering low, pre-determined prices via the Internet, the Federal agency said.
Chrysler allocates vehicles based on a dealer's total sales. Fair Allocation System members wanted the company to distribute based on expected number of sales in a dealer's local area. That would have substantially cut the number of cars to Dave Smith Motors, whose customers hail from a wider geographic region, the F.T.C.'s complaint contended.

HEADLINE: View From Pataki's Garden: A Serene Campaign Strategy

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Last Sunday, Peter F. Vallone, one of four Democrats hoping to wrest the governorship from George E. Pataki this fall, spoke at three churches in New York City, held a news conference to receive an endorsement, then raced up to the Orange County fair in Middletown to press the flesh.
Mr. Pataki spent the day at home. It was not just a day off the campaign trail. It seemed to be his campaign strategy. 
 Deep into the primary season, at a time when most other candidates are running hard -- including his would-be Democratic challengers and his political mentor, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato -- Mr. Pataki, the Republican incumbent, seems to be barely breaking a sweat in his race for a second term as Governor. But even as Mr. Pataki paces himself, he has stepped up his aggressive campaign for national attention, with a book tour, appearances on television and fund-raising trips that have taken him far from New York.
Last week, for example, a Republican contributor in California or Colorado, where the Governor spent three days raising money for his campaign, had a better chance of getting a glimpse of Mr. Pataki than did a New York voter. He made just two public appearances in New York -- a 10-minute speech to a police chiefs' association aboard a Lake George steamboat, and a press conference called on short notice to react to the Assembly's passage of his bill to sharply curtail parole.
With Mr. Pataki enjoying enormous leads in the polls and in fund-raising, and the Democrats still facing a hotly contested primary on Sept. 15, the Governor's advisers have decided that the best way for him to campaign is not to campaign at all.
"They're probably right in thinking that way," said John Zogby, a pollster and political analyst. He noted that his most recent poll showed Mr. Pataki leading each of his challengers by more than 40 percentage points in head-to-head contests.
"This could be as close to a front-porch campaign, or a Rose Garden strategy, as we've seen in modern times," Mr. Zogby said.
Mr. Pataki is hardly the first well-placed incumbent to adopt such a strategy. Indeed, the man he defeated four years ago for the Governor's office -- Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat -- lay low on the campaign trail during his re-election races in 1986 and 1990 when he held huge leads in the polls. And just last year, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York showed an equal disdain toward the Democrats clamoring for his job, including the eventual nominee, Ruth W. Messinger, whom he trounced.
But there is a risk to Mr. Pataki in embracing such a classic incumbent's gambit. In the last year, he has aggressively courted national attention and basked in the political glow as his name has been mentioned along with those of other Republicans, like Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in connection with the race for the White House in 2000.
That has put pressure on Mr. Pataki not just to win this fall, but to win by a margin that will boost his national standing.
Aides insist that Mr. Pataki is working hard on the campaign out of the public eye, averaging two fund-raisers a week and consulting with strategists.
"We've been all over the place," said Zenia Mucha, the Governor's chief spokeswoman for the last four years, who became his campaign manager this week.
Campaign records released last month showed that Mr. Pataki had already spent $2 million on broadcast advertising, and still had $12 million in the bank, almost six times as much as any of his opponents.
But his schedule is still filled with trips that take him across the country in pursuit of thousands of dollars more in campaign money and widespread national attention. In addition to the California and Colorado trips, he is planning one next week to Virginia.
When Mr. Pataki has taken to the stump during this primary season, it has been more in the role of incumbent than candidate. He does not mention the election, and he never refers to his opponents, even to criticize them. When asked how the campaign is going, all he will say is, "Fine."
The Governor's public events around the state, generally no more than one or two in a day, are invariably billed as the usual business of being Governor, like signing bills or breaking ground for new businesses. That allows him to avoid appearing overtly political while touting his achievements, and it also permits him to travel the state and promote his record at taxpayers' expense, a luxury his competitors do not share.
His approach has also caused a drag on the campaigns of his Democratic challengers -- Mr. Vallone, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn and James L. Larocca, a former state transportation and energy commissioner -- who are hard-pressed to win attention when Mr. Pataki ignores their moves.
While Mr. Pataki is careful not to seem to be taking things for granted, his advisers are much less reserved.
When asked recently about polls showing Mr. Vallone pulling ahead of Ms. McCaughey Ross among Democratic primary voters, Ms. Mucha said: "It doesn't matter. Either way."
When it was noted that a Democratic primary victory by Mr. Vallone would set up a three-way race, because Ms. McCaughey Ross has the Liberal Party nomination, Ms. Mucha replied, "It still doesn't matter."
Even the press release earlier this week announcing that Ms. Mucha was moving from the Governor's press office to head his re-election campaign carried an air of supreme confidence. It concluded that "Mucha plans to return to the administration after the November election."
At best, it has left the Democrats hoping that the Pataki camp becomes overly confident.
"They are so over-confident -- no, don't print that," Mr. Vallone said early this week. "Better to say they think it's going to be a cakewalk."
Anyone who dropped in on Mr. Pataki in each of the last three summers, and again now, would be hard-pressed to tell which was the election year. The Governor is no more visible, except on television, and he has stuck to the same few themes -- tax cuts, job creation and fighting crime -- on the stump and in his television advertisements.
"We are winning, slowly, this fight against crime," he declared at the police chiefs' meeting last week. "We are turning the tide and now we've got to make sure the tide goes all the way out."
Gerald Benjamin, a professor of government at the State University of New York at New Paltz, said, "The Rose Garden strategy makes perfect sense."
"He's way ahead," Professor Benjamin said. "The Democrats are beating each other up, the economy's doing pretty well, and there's no voter anger this year. And when the time comes, he'll campaign more actively and blanket the airwaves.
"In his situation," he asked, "why do anything?"

HEADLINE: General Motors Plans to Build New, Efficient Assembly Plants

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug. 5

 BODY:
Seeking to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the world's largest company, the chairman of General Motors said today that the auto maker planned to build a new generation of highly efficient assembly plants in North America.
To the dismay of the United Automobile Workers union, the plants could use as little as half as many workers as current assembly plants do. Outside suppliers, many of them with nonunion workers, would do much work previously done by G.M. employees. 
 The plans for new assembly plants are part of a broad effort by the auto maker to transform itself into a company that designs, assembles and markets cars and trucks, but makes few of the parts.
John F. Smith Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive, said the new plants would be modeled mainly on G.M.'s efficient new operations in Brazil, and to a lesser extent on its other factories overseas. Those factories rely on outside suppliers to produce large chunks of vehicles, like fully assembled dashboards, instead of delivering lots of little parts that are bolted together on the assembly line.
But in the United States, four out every five outside auto parts factories are not unionized, so shifting work to them weakens the union's grip on the industry and erodes its membership. Last week, the union settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich. Anxiety about G.M.'s plans to follow the Brazilian model in North American manufacturing was one of many union concerns during the Flint strike, but was not resolved.
In an olive branch to the powerful U.A.W., Mr. Smith said today that he wanted to develop a closer relationship with union leaders and planned to discuss how the new factories would work. Speaking at the University of Michigan's annual auto industry conference here in this Lake Michigan resort, 200 miles northwest of Detroit, Mr. Smith also promised repeatedly that G.M. would not lay off anyone in the coming years, but would rely instead on allowing workers to retire without replacing them.
Union officials were studying today's announcement and had no immediate reaction. But the auto maker and the union have been quietly discussing the new assembly plants for weeks and the union response in these meetings has been mixed.
The union leaders are pleased that G.M. is interested in investing at all in the United States instead of overseas, but deeply troubled by the kinds of factories that G.M. plans to build.
In a rare speech and news conference, Mr. Smith presented his plans for new assembly plants for the first time, part of a broad vision to change G.M., the world's largest company in terms of sales and share of global economic output. G.M. announced on Monday that it would turn its vast auto parts subsidiary into an independent company, with stock in the subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, to be distributed next year to G.M. investors. G.M. announced on Tuesday that it would combine the corporate staffs of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile and Pontiac into a single marketing organization that might be able to sell cars more effectively, although the names on dealerships and car models would not change.
Mr. Smith said that this week's moves had long been planned and that the strike had only delayed them a little. But Mr. Smith has also been under enormous pressure from Wall Street to take decisive action to make G.M. more competitive.
Some Wall Street analysts even asked publicly during the strike whether Mr. Smith was the right person to lead G.M., suggesting that while he had led the company back from the brink of bankruptcy after taking over in 1992, he had taken few bold moves since then and had not laid out a vision for the company's direction. Many institutional investors had expected G.M. to inflict a crushing blow to the U.A.W. at the end of a strike that cost the company $3 billion in after-tax earnings, and have pushed down the company's stock in response to the very limited settlement that actually resulted.
Mr. Smith discussed his plans for the company here at midday and G.M. stock closed at $68.375, down $1.125.
Mr. Smith refused to discuss today when or where G.M. would build its new assembly plants, which would be its first in the United States since the construction of the 7,000-employee Saturn factory in Spring Hill, Tenn. in the late 1980's. "We are planning on building some new assembly plants to replace and consolidate older plants," Mr. Smith said. "The new plants will be lean and agile in every respect, operating 24 hours a day."
After describing the large role that suppliers play in Brazil, Mr. Smith said, "We believe that vehicle manufacturing will evolve in this direction here in North America."
Ronald E. Harbour, a manufacturing consultant in Troy, Mich., said G.M. would probably start by building one of the new type of assembly plants, which could take a couple of years, and then watch how it worked before building more.
Next to each new assembly plant, G.M. plans to put a factory that could stamp hoods and other automotive body parts from sheets of steel, Mr. Smith said. That plan sheds new light on G.M.'s strong stand against the U.A.W. during the recent strike in Flint, Mich. G.M. tried unsuccessfully to stop investing in a low-productivity stamping factory in Flint that would be a logical candidate for closing if G.M. builds new stamping factories.
G.M. has already eliminated 125,000 hourly jobs in the United States since 1990 by not replacing people who retire or leave for other reasons, and thinks that it can continue reducing its work force this way, he said, adding, "We're not talking about layoffs or anything like that, we're talking about working within the window of our attrition rates."
With a steadily shrinking market share, G.M. has hired few employees since the late 1970's and has 220,000 hourly workers left in the United States, mostly represented by the U.A.W. The auto maker has 600,000 employees worldwide and continues to lag rival auto makers in terms of the number of autos that each worker produces annually.
"How do we close the productivity gap without costly work stoppages is the clear focus in my head," Mr. Smith said.
The strikes in Flint severely hurt G.M.'s sales in July. The company said today that its sales of cars and light trucks dropped 37.7 percent, as car sales plunged 45 percent while sales of sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans fell 28.1 percent. G.M.'s overall share of the light-vehicle market decreased to 21 percent, trailing the Ford Motor Company, at 27.5 percent, for the first time since a two-month strike in 1970 also crippled G.M.'s production.
G.M.'s plans to build efficient new factories might well provoke a flurry of offers of tax incentives and other financial assistance from state governments, Mexico and Canada.
Mr. Smith avoided saying whether G.M. would put any of the new assembly plants in Mexico. But he did say that G.M. was considering the construction of new plants close to existing ones. The U.A.W.'s contracts with the Big Three auto makers give workers the privilege of turning down transfers to work sites more than 50 miles away, and the workers have virtually guaranteed lifetime employment.

HEADLINE: Sex Shops Try to Obey Law, as Written

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
Despite a string of resounding legal victories by the Giuliani administration in its effort to curb New York City's sex industry, the vast majority of 144 adult video stores and strip clubs singled out by a new anti-sex shop law are investing their hopes in a novel legal strategy that a State Supreme Court Justice could either bolster or dismiss in a hearing in Manhattan today.
Who prevails in the legal battle, which is expected to generate months of appeals, will determine whether Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will be able to eradicate much of the city's sex shop industry or simply put a prettier face on it. 
 Herald Price Fahringer, a lawyer representing 107 of the 144 sex shops affected by the law, said all of his clients would try to remain open by conforming to a provision in the law that essentially says the stores are considered to be X-rated enterprises if 40 percent or more of their stock or floor space is in adult materials.
"I think all of them are going to try to stay in business," Mr. Fahringer said. "I haven't talked to anyone who said they're going to close up and move away."
Across the city, adult video stores have completed or are planning feverish renovations and bathing suit purchases that help them avoid the definition of an "adult establishment" under the law.
Store and club owners have responded by selling T-shirts, souvenirs and feature movies in 60 percent of their floor space and pornography in the rest. Strip clubs say they have confined topless dancing to less than 40 percent of their floor space.
As of yesterday, 75 percent of the stock in Show World, a sex emporium at the corner of 42d Street and Eighth Avenue that for three decades has symbolized the adult-entertainment business, was dedicated to luggage, perfume, souvenirs and other trinkets intended to capture the tourist trade, managers said.
Last night in Scores, an Upper East Side strip club that the city has so far not accused of violating the law, employees said they were trying to have the same number of strippers dance in the club, but in a small, curtained-off portion of it. Men in business suits crammed the dance area, while a vast, newly created dining area set up on the other side of the curtain was nearly empty.
Mr. Fahringer is expected to argue that because Show World has changed its inventory, it should not be closed under the law.
But city officials are expected to argue that the renovations are little more than subterfuges meant to avoid the law. City officials have refused to discuss the details of what they will present in court today. But when asked yesterday whether it would be acceptable for clubs to limit stripping to 40 percent of their premises, Steven M. Fishner, the Mayor's criminal justice coordinator, dismissed the idea.
"We don't anticipate that it's going to be a change in the utilization of the floor space," he said. "We anticipate a change in the actual use. A change from being a strip club to being some other kind of establishment."
Albert Fredericks, a former assistant corporate counsel who helped draft the law, said the clubs were trying to take advantage of wording the administration had to include to make the law constitutional.
Mirroring measures recently enacted in other cities, the law does not flatly outlaw the sale of pornographic materials or the existence of strip clubs, Mr. Fredericks said. Courts have repeatedly ruled that such bans are a violation of free speech.
"The problem is with the Constitution. It cannot be banned," he said, referring to adult material. "A law had to be drafted that dealt with the problem but still allowed reasonable access to the material."
The zoning ordinance and other city documents have specific language defining how the 60-40 ratio is to be applied, essentially measuring how much floor space and inventory are devoted to adult entertainment.
But Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the law, said the measure was not precise enough and created an opportunity for stores to remain open.
"What happens if in addition to 1,000 videos, the store is selling 1,000 pencils?" he said. "Does that mean that there are 2,000 items? What about T-shirts or dolls? Is it one for one, each T-shirt, each pencil, each doll, is that equal to one video? Do you put them on a scale and weigh them?"
But Mr. Fishner said yesterday that he was confident the city would prevail in court. He also said inspections to find grounds to close the clubs would continue.
Supporters of the clubs say that even if they win the legal battle, it is not clear that they can remain economically viable if they can devote so little of their floor space to adult entertainment. "We're all not sure whether this is going to work," one Scores employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said last night.
For now, owners of the sex shops and their lawyers appear to be awaiting the result of today's hearing, which involves the city's attempt to close six clubs: Show World; NRS XXX Video on Eighth Avenue in midtown; the Harmony Theater and Harmony Theater II strip clubs on Church and West 22d Streets; Les Hommes video store on West 80th Street, and Angel's strip club on Walker Street.
Judges in Brooklyn and Staten Island yesterday granted joint requests from city lawyers and the owners of two strip clubs padlocked over the weekend, Wiggles and Shark's, that their cases be adjourned for several weeks. Individuals associated with both clubs said yesterday that clubs owners were trying to identify ways they could reopen under the new law.
Solomon Kaplan, the lawyer representing El Coche, a strip club padlocked in the Bronx last week, said its owners also hoped to somehow reopen under the new law.
Mr. Fredericks, who helped draft the law, said that while many American cities had laws restricting sex shops, New York's sex shop owners might be one of the first groups to try to battle the law even as it is being enforced. "I think I've read just about every decision out there," he said. "There is very little out there that deals with this."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE OUTLOOK;
Market Gyrations May Point To Shift in Investor Strategy

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
For the last three years investors have been sleepwalking their way to riches in the stock market. Putting money into a stock index fund -- a one-decision move -- has proved not only the best way to avoid underperforming the averages, but also the path to outsized profits. The Vanguard Group's fund that mirrors the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has almost doubled since the end of 1994.
But the heyday of this particular investment strategy may have ended on Tuesday when the Dow Jones industrial average lost 300 points. Even though the major market averages rebounded ever so slightly yesterday, the sharp drop on Tuesday, coming on top of recent weakness, belied what might be the beginning of a big shift in investor psychology. 
 Trading was extremely heavy and exceedingly volatile yesterday. More shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange than had during the big drop on Tuesday. The averages whipsawed up and down all day, with the Dow ending up almost 60 points, or seven-tenths of a percent, and the S.& P. 500 rising almost 1 percent. The Nasdaq lagged, gaining only fourteen-hundredths of a percent on the day. Page D1.
Although investors were undoubtedly relieved that stocks held their own, the market's chop was discomforting. Market strategists predicted more rough spots in the weeks to come. "If we were down another 600 points on the Dow, I wouldn't be surprised," said Carey Leahey, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, a investment consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. "Not that the U.S. fundamentals aren't good, it's just that they're not good enough to sustain stock valuations."
Until Tuesday, investors had seemed to shrug off the idea that rising stock valuations had to be sustained by ever-rising corporate earnings. Now, the relationship between a company's stock price and its earnings is front and center for both professional and individual investors across the nation.
That reassessment makes some market watchers believe a profound shift in stock market strategy is under way. What has worked in the past may not work in the future.
"Boring is going to outperform sexy," said Robert Olstein, manager of the Olstein Fund and a veteran of Wall Street and its passing fads. Instead of just looking at where a company's stock price is headed, investors will be focusing on the company's underlying business and how well it is performing. "There is going to be more looking behind the numbers, more scrutiny paid to nonrecurring write-offs, more religion adopted."
What that leads Mr. Olstein to conclude is a return to active money management, the type of hands-on stock picking that comes from analyzing balance sheets and income statements. If this type of strategy becomes more profitable than buying a fixed basket of stocks, a practice known as indexing, it would represent a big change. Last year, only 10 percent of money managers who actively select stocks outperformed the S.& P. 500, down from 70 percent in 1993.
To be sure, money managers have been predicting for several years that active management would once again beat the indexers' returns. So far, the prediction has been premature. Still, no investment strategy remains on top forever. As the big capitalization stocks weaken and the indexes appear to lose some of their impressive momentum, the argument for hands-on stock picking gains more credibility.
With the two most widely followed market gauges down nearly 9 percent from their July peaks on no fresh bad news, a change in market psychology has clearly taken place. If Mr. Olstein is right about the new direction, and a chorus of fund managers agree with him, then investors may begin shunning the index strategy that has been so popular in recent years. In the first five months of this year, 18 percent of the net cash flows into equity mutual funds went to index funds, up from 11 percent in the comparable period of 1996, according to Strategic Insight, a New York mutual fund research and consulting company.
Certainly, with corporate profitability looking weaker and weaker, stocks that have taken the indexes to all-time record valuations -- Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Dell Computer, General Electric -- are much more vulnerable to disappointment than they were when earnings expectations were rosier. Wall Street analysts began the year believing that the earnings among the S.& P. 500 companies would rise 8.5 percent in 1998. Seven months later, these forecasters say earnings will grow only 5.6 percent. This may turn out to be optimistic as well.
Given that the stocks in the S.& P. 500 are trading at 25.66 times their earnings of the last year, some stock prices carry significant premiums to what they will likely produce in earnings growth this year.
The result? "I think we'll see a shift in what stocks the market punishes," said Nancy Tengler, money manager at Global Alliance Value Investors in San Francisco. "Investors will say 'I can pay 12 times earnings for 12 percent earnings growth or I can pay 50 times earnings for the same 12 percent growth in the case of Coke.' You're going to see people move more defensively."
One reason for this, Ms. Tengler believes, is that the volatility of recent weeks -- the Dow up 100 points one day, down 100 points the next -- is more than most investors want from their stock portfolios. Although they still believe the stock market is the place to be, they may want to take a more defensive posture.
Tuesday's market plunge may not have convinced all investors that their old practices of chasing earnings surprises and big market movers no longer work. But several brokers who deal with small investors said that most of their customers' calls yesterday came from those wishing to reconfigure their portfolios in a more sensible way. These investors were weeding out high-fliers for more stable names.
Whereas in recent months, the sexier the stock the better -- think high-flying Internet companies with no profits and maybe no revenues -- the dullest companies in the doggiest sectors may now be where the greatest profits lie, analysts say.
As it happens, investors reconstituting their portfolios have the chance to buy some stocks at fairly reasonable prices. The average New York Stock Exchange issue has lost more than a quarter of its value from the high, while the average Nasdaq stock is down more than 35 percent. This damage has produced buying opportunities unseen for years by value investors.
"This is an opportunity to buy companies that pay you for uncertainty up front via a dividend and generate earnings growth going forward," Ms. Tengler said. "And they're cheap."
Ms. Tengler recently identified 180 stocks in the S.& P. 500 that she considers good buys because of their relatively high dividends. At the end of 1996, she found 140 such stocks.
Stocks that look attractive to Ms. Tengler include Halliburton, the oil service company; Eastman Kodak; Phillip Morris; H. J. Heinz, and American Home Products, the pharmaceutical concern.
Mr. Olstein likes semiconductor equipment makers like the Altera Corporation and Xilinx Inc., and oil service concerns such as the Rowan Companies. He also says companies building the infrastructure for communications will be winners -- especially Superior Telecom and Corning Inc. -- as will beaten-down steelmakers LTV and AK Steel Holding.
Will old-fashioned stock picking once again outperform the indexes as it did in previous eras? They say that everything old becomes new again, even perhaps in the world of investing. If so, investors can welcome back the age of reason.

LTX ANNOUNCES IT WILLREVAMP AND REDUCE WORK FORCE

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
The LTX Corporation, a supplier of semiconductor test equipment, said yesterday that it would reorganize operations in the fourth quarter because of a downturn in the worldwide semiconductor market. The company, based in Westwood, Mass., will cut about 30 percent of its work force, or about 300 jobs. The revamping will also include consolidating the company's San Jose, Calif., and Massachusetts plants, restructuring sales channels in Japan and shedding its iPTest division in Britain. The company expects to record a fourth-quarter charge of $40 million to $50 million for the revamping and a write-down of inventory. Shares of LTX fell 68.75 cents, to $3.0625, a 52-week low.

Operating Prof it Rises For Cadbury Schweppes

BYLINE: Bridge News 

 BODY:
Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. said yesterday that its pretax profit from continuing operations rose 7.6 percent in the first half of 1998 as strong soft drink sales in North America and Australia helped offset unsettled market conditions elsewhere. Cadbury, the world's third-largest maker of soft drinks after the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc., said profit from operations rose to £254 million, or $417 million, in the six months ended on June 20, from £236 million in the period a year earlier. 
 The company, which makes Dr. Pepper and Seven Up soft drinks, said sales rose in Canada, the United States and Australia but were hurt by political and economic turbulence elsewhere. Its stock rose 27 pence, to 864.

Japanese Senior Managers Are Lagging in Internet Access

BYLINE: By BRUCE HEADLAM 

 BODY:
Remember a couple of years ago when Americans believed that Japanese business could do no wrong? Neither does anybody else, apparently. The newly formed legions of Japan-bashers can look for more ammunition in a recent study on Internet usage. According to a survey by Andersen Consulting, only 71 percent of Japanese executives have access to the Internet, the lowest level among senior management in nine of the world's leading economies. 
 American executives led the field, with 99 percent having access to the Internet, followed by executives from Canada (98 percent), France (91 percent) and Britain (91 percent). Only 13 percent of Japanese executives were reported as "comfortable" or "familiar" with the Internet, compared with 46 percent of American executives, although the Japanese were much more likely to use E-mail (69 percent) than their counterparts in Germany (55 percent).

HEADLINE: Bach, Tangos And the Beach

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
The Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival, which opens its 15th season this weekend at the Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church, was started for reasons that were entirely noncommercial but sensible nonetheless. Marya Martin, a flutist from New Zealand who settled in Manhattan, and Ken Davidson, who ran his own investment company, had recently married, and Mr. Davidson was dismayed by the prospect that Ms. Martin would be spending her summers traveling the festival circuit while he worked in the city and spent weekends on his own in the Hamptons.
From what Mr. Davidson and Ms. Martin could tell, there was no great demand for chamber music in the Hamptons; concerts they had been to in the early 1980's were poorly attended. Nevertheless, when Mr. Davidson flew to New Mexico to hear his wife perform at the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, two weeks after their wedding, he had a proposal. Why didn't Ms. Martin start her own festival so that they could spend their summers together? 
 As the new festival's director, Mr. Davidson raised the $15,000 budget for the first season, and as artistic director, Ms. Martin invited three colleagues -- the violinist Ani Kavafian, the cellist Fred Sherry and the pianist Andre-Michel Schub -- to join the endeavor. She also persuaded the initially reluctant elders of the Presbyterian Church to let her present her concerts in the sanctuary of their 19th-century building.
That first summer, the festival was really just a pair of concerts, each a different program but both devoted entirely to standard fare, from Telemann through Mendelssohn and Dvorak. Since then the festival has grown slowly, and this year it has a budget approaching $300,000, with a roster of 25 musicians who will join forces through Aug. 25 in various combinations for six regular programs, plus an opening benefit and a children's program.
In addition to the festival, concertgoers can attend programs offered in the Hamptons this month by two musical training institutes.
Because the Bridgehampton Festival performances are held in a 440-seat church, the configuration of which puts everyone close to the performers, there is a level of intimacy that the players consider close to what has historically been the chamber music ideal -- or at least, closer than they often find during the season, when tours take them to all-purpose halls better suited to larger forces.
Actually, much of the standard repertory, written before 1900, was composed to be heard in even smaller spaces than the church; composers' wealthy patrons commissioned works for semi-private performances in their own salons and drawing rooms. On the other hand, 20th-century chamber works, which are now a significant part of the repertory, were composed with concert halls in mind.
Indeed, the contemporary repertory, particularly American music, has been an increasingly important part of the programming mix at Bridgehampton. Ms. Martin's concerts adhere to the current programming fashion, in which diverse works are linked by common thematic threads. So besides all-Bach and all-Mozart programs, there is a concert called "American Sounds," with works ranging from Gershwin theater songs to Copland's Sextet and recent works by Ned Rorem and Eric Ewazen, as well as a program called "The South American Soul," with works by Ginastera, Villa-Lobos, Nazareth and Piazzolla. Another program, "East Meets West," looks at Asian influences on Western composers.
Even the most programmatically amorphous concert -- the opening night program, which includes Stravinsky's "Histoire du Soldat," a flute transcription of the Faure Violin Sonata and a Dvorak Piano Quartet (Op. 87) -- has a theme of sorts, the journey from Romanticism to early modernism.
 
Bach and Mozart Sell
"Juggling the programs is the tough part," said Ms. Martin, who discusses ideas with her colleagues and accepts suggestions from them, but who in the end is responsible for both the individual programs and the shape of the festival as a whole.
"This year I came up with another three programs I would love to do," she continued, "but which I'll have to save for another year. In the 'American Sounds' program, for example, I was going to do a concert in which everything was related to the year 1900. Kurt Weill was born that year, as was Aaron Copland. So was Colin McPhee, whose 'Balinese Ceremonial Music' we're including in 'East Meets West.' But then, I wanted to do the Rorem, because it's his 75th birthday, and this Eric Ewazen piece for flute, French horn and piano is quite fantastic. So the 1900 concert will have to wait."
There are also what Ms. Martin regards as necessary compromises; the Gershwin works on the "American Sounds" program, for example, are meant as drawing cards.
"If I programmed Copland, Ewazen, Rorem and something else that people didn't know," she said, "we may not be able to sell the house. And I've got to think of that, too."
But Ms. Martin said the all-Bach and all-Mozart programs made it easier for her to sell the more adventurous ones.
"I feel that the Bach and Mozart concerts help give me as much leeway as I need for the 'American Sounds,' 'South American Soul' and 'East Meets West' programs," she explained.
"I want the average concertgoer to feel there is something for them to go to, and if someone who hasn't attended the festival before sees the series, they may buy tickets to the Mozart concert, but they will probably then buy tickets to something else as well. Rarely do people buy only one concert. We've found that most people buy tickets to three."
The festival has been a popular draw since the beginning. When it opened for business in 1984, Ms. Martin and Ms. Kavafian were rehearsing backstage just before the concert when Mr. Davidson asked them to come to the front of the church, where a long line had formed on the path leading to the door.
 
After Practice, Picnics
The festival is also popular among the musicians. They say that because Bridgehampton is a small community -- and because many of them stay at the homes of board members while they are playing at the festival -- they have gotten to know the audience.
"There is a wonderful social scene at the festival," said Mr. Sherry, the cellist who was a regular in the festival's early days. "I don't know if people understand how important the social scene is, among musicians. In the early days especially, it really was a mom-and-pop festival, and everybody was involved in everything. We'd spend the day hanging around the church, rehearsing, then we'd all go to lunch at a coffee house, then back to rehearse some more. Then we might practice on our own, then go to the beach, where we'd all have picnics. It was idyllic, and the music making was very relaxed."
Though Mr. Sherry is traveling this summer, he said he expected to return in other seasons.
The musicians also say that the festival, more than many others on the summer circuit, allows them time to perform in a far less pressured atmosphere than they are used to during the regular concert season.
Alan Kay, a clarinetist who is playing in all but the Bach and Mozart concerts this summer, said: "During the season, you're playing chamber music but also rushing around doing 10 other things. At Bridgehampton, the schedule keeps us pretty busy, but it's not pressured. We have three or four days to put each program together, and it's very collegial. We also have time to go out after concerts, or hang out at the beach, and all that adds pleasure to playing the concerts."
 
Surviving the Heat
Ms. Martin said she considered the church where the performances are held to be one of the pleasures of the festival.
"It's very New Englandy," she said. "It's got a beautiful spire, and because Long Island is so flat, if you're at all above the tree line, you can see it. And the building is very pretty; it's all white, white inside, with white benches and a red carpet. And the acoustics blew me away when I first went there, years ago. That's why we wanted to do it there."
The church is not air-conditioned, however, and that has been a mixed blessing. For Mark Peskavov, a violinist who is playing on the opening program, and who has played at the festival in past years, the heat has its charms.
"Because of the lack of air-conditioning," he said, "the door is open when we rehearse, and people who were outside, going about their business, hear the rehearsal and wander in. I don't recall the musicians ever minding that. It's part of the casual atmosphere."
But the heat has wrought some near disasters. The violinist Ida Kavafian, who was a Bridgehampton regular in the festival's early years (her sister Ani having been on the founding roster), but who now has a festival of her own, Music From Angel Fire, in Taos, N.M., pointed out that heat and humidity tend to affect precious instruments adversely.
"One summer my sister was playing first violin in the Mendelssohn Octet on the second half of a program," Ms. Kavafian said, "and she got to the concert, warmed up and went out to listen to the first half of the concert. When she got back at intermission, the tailpiece on her Strad had broken, everything was in pieces. So they asked the audience if anyone had a violin that wasn't too far away. Someone brought one, and the show did go on.
"But it's a funny thing about Bridgehampton. It's like a collective attitude about 'we don't need air-conditioning.' Everyone seems to go out of their way not to have it."
Ms. Martin said that she'd happily raise money to air-condition the church, but that the elders were not interested. The festival has survived the heat, as well as the economic and scheduling vagaries of presenting a music festival.
And it has changed. At first a small band of musicians remained together as a troupe for the entire festival. Now, most of the players are on hand for only a single performance. That said, Ms. Martin has focused on her guests' specialties.
The pianists Claude Frank and Lilian Kallir, for example, are lending their expertise in Mozart's two-piano music to the all-Mozart program. The harpsichordist Robert Wolinsky will play Bach, and Pablo Ziegler, a commanding tango player, is the pianist in the Latin American program.
In 1994 and 1995, Ms. Martin sought to extend the festival's reputation -- and get second performances for some of the more interesting works -- in a series at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan during the concert season. But when she realized that it would take too many years of deficits before she could get proper foundation or private support for a Manhattan series, she shelved the idea.
In 1996, the Bridgehampton Festival itself took a sabbatical for the sake of reorganization (but it's still calling its current season its 15th). Mr. Davidson, who had retired, became the festival's chairman, and Ms. Martin hired a staff to help with the administrative work.
In 1986, the festival's third season, Ms. Martin began bringing in new American music, with works by Mr. Rorem, Arthur Foote and William Schuman. Soon music by John Corigliano, David Diamond, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, Roberto Sierra, Jonathan Kramer, Lukas Foss, Leonard Bernstein and Henry Cowell, as well as a humorous work by Peter Schickele and arrangements of jazz classics by Louis Armstrong, rounded out the festival's prospectus, along with standard repertory and 18th- and 19th-century rarities.
Mr. Rorem's work on this summer's "American Sounds" program, "Bright Music," was commissioned by the festival for a 1988 premiere, and is making a second appearance. Musicians from the festival also recorded it, along with Mr. Rorem's "Winter Pages," for New World Records.
 
Off the Beaten Track
The festival has also commissioned works from Mr. Bunch and Bruce MacCombie, and Ms. Martin said her dream was to commission eight works for a single festival, with one performed on each program.
But commissioned pieces are expensive, and until she raises the money, Ms. Martin can expand the festival's repertory by looking around during the regular concert season. Since she plays on all the festival programs, her explorations in the flute repertory turn up both new and familiar works. She has also discovered a few out-of-the-way composers, like Louise Dumont Farrenc, a 19th-century French composer whose work Ms. Martin brought to the festival in 1995.
Besides playing recitals and teaching at Boston University and the Manhattan School of Music, Ms. Martin is a member of the New York Wind Soloists, a quintet with David Jolley, the hornist; Steven Taylor, the trombonist; Frank Morelli, the bassoonist, and Mr. Kay, the clarinetist. Some of the pieces that have been on the quintet's programs have found their way to the festival, too, and her colleagues have introduced her to composers like Mr. Ewazen, whose Horn Sonata is in Mr. Jolley's repertory.
The quintet also plays a Mozart program in which, like the one at this summer's festival, Mozart's letters are read between works. And the "East Meets West" program was influenced by the quintet's work on pieces by Mr. McPhee and other composers.
 
Other Festivals
Other musicians have started festivals in the area more recently. Several flourished for a few years and then folded. Those that have survived tend to offer, as Bridgehampton does, a few condensed weeks of programming, and avoid overlapping with the competition. That way festival administrators don't have to worry about fragmenting the audience and listeners can partake of one festival after another.
The Festival of the Hamptons, which has been directed by Lukas Foss for the last two years, has already run its course. In July, it offered 10 days of concerts in Southampton, East Hampton, Westhampton and Bridgehampton. But two musical training institutes that present public concerts are still running.
Three years ago, the violinist Itzhak Perlman and his wife, Toby, transformed the Hamptons Summer Music festival into a training camp. Now called the Perlman Training Program, and based in East Hampton, it offers private lessons, chamber music coaching classes and orchestral sessions, as well as tennis lessons, to gifted young (pre-college) musicians.
Between Aug. 14 and 27, the students will present several public performances, including an open chorus and orchestra rehearsal conducted by Mr. Perlman. The camp was Mrs. Perlman's idea, but Mr. Perlman seems happy to devote part of his summer to it.
"This program is very dear to me," Mr. Perlman said. "It gives me a chance to coach, conduct, teach and to learn from my students. What more could I ask for?"
 
More Classical Music
Another institute, Pianofest in the Hamptons, is based in Southampton and runs through Aug. 11. Its main focus is a series of master classes for 30 students from around the world, ages 16 to 27, but there are also public concerts, including a marathon tomorrow evening in which a dozen students will play works they have studied in the classes. Pianofest, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary, is the direct result of a visit to the Bridgehampton Festival by the pianist Paul Schenly.
"After one of the concerts," said Barbara Goldowksy, the manager of Pianofest, "Paul went backstage to say hello to Andre-Michel Schub, and while he was there he began speaking with a local man named Bill Plate, who told him that the Hamptons needed more classical music and invited him to start something new."
Ms. Martin is protective of her festival. When another ensemble sought permission to hold a festival in the church where the Bridgehampton concerts are held, she argued against it -- and prevailed -- on the grounds that her festival had a close association that she preferred to keep exclusive. Still, she speaks highly of festivals taking place elsewhere in the Hamptons, and says that "if they can survive, it's better for music."
"We do have a very loyal audience," she added. "There is a woman who sits in the front row, who's been sitting there ever since we started. I say hello to her when I walk out on stage. I don't know her name, but it's as if she's part of the family."

HEADLINE: Retailers Report Strong July As Shoppers Flock to Stores

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
It took retailers more than a year to catch up with the stellar American economy, and now, as growth slows slightly and the stock market behaves erratically, shoppers are showing no signs of slowing their spending.
Retailers yesterday reported the strongest July same-store sales in five years, a result of robust demand for clothing and housewares. The figures resumed a trend that began with a 10.2 percent gain in April and a 7.1 percent rise in May. Sales stumbled slightly in June, increasing 4.4 percent. 
 Goldman, Sachs & Company's retail composite index rose 4.8 percent last month, compared with figures from the month a year earlier, the best July gain since 1993, when sales rose 5.4 percent. Same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least one year, are considered the best measure of a retailer's health. Undeterred by hot weather, shoppers filled their carts with ceiling fans, bathing suits, spiral notebooks and planting soil -- indeed nearly every category of merchandise flew off the shelves, much of it at full price.
Leading economic indicators pointed to strong demand.
"All our key indicators are flashing green," said Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "Real wage growth was up in June, the most recent month, 3.2 percent, which is the strongest in 25 years. Real personal consumption expenditures were up 5.3 percent in June, and you'd have to go back to about 1983 to find the last time that number was over 5 percent. And housing turnover, which is a key indicator of sales of home-related products, was running up 14.7 percent in June."
The big winners were specialty apparel stores, which for years lagged behind the rest of the industry as consumers stocked up on basic casual clothes that have become the staple of the American wardrobe. The church of basics, Gap Inc., reported sales gains of 19 percent, with strong performances in all of its divisions, which include Gap Kids, Old Navy and Banana Republic.
Other specialty stores showed similar gains. Limited Inc. said same-store sales were up 7 percent, and Ann Taylor Stores reported same-store sales gains of 23.2 percent.
Among merchants of off-price clothing, which has been extremely popular with shoppers for more than two years, the story was the same. Ross Stores reported gains of 7 percent, the TJX Company said its sales rose 9 percent and Value City reported gains of 6 percent.
"There was a lengthy period when apparel underperformed," Mr. Baum said. "So there was some pent-up demand, and we are still seeing some residual of that. And there are favorable demographics: Teen-agers are the fastest-growing group, and they spend a lot of money on clothes."
The strong apparel sales only made weaker players stand out more. Sears, Roebuck & Company said its sales rose a mere 1.7 percent, mostly because of a weakness in their apparel department. At the J. C. Penney Company, sales fell 5.7 percent.
At the same time, department store results were mixed. Kohl's, which sells less expensive merchandise, said sales rose 10.4 percent, and Saks Holdings said sales rose 9.9 percent. But Dillard Department Stores reported a sales decline of 2 percent, and Mervyn's, a unit of Dayton Hudson, said sales fell 3.1 percent.
Department stores are likely to continue feeling the squeeze from the off-price shops, as are discounters, where apparel accounts for about one-third of their merchandise. Wal-Mart Stores said its sales rose 7.1 percent, compared with figures in the month a year earlier, while Target, another Dayton Hudson unit, reported a 6.7 percent gain.
All these strong sales bode well for profits. "Most retailers are entering the third fiscal quarter with very clean inventories and the wind at their backs," Mr. Baum said. "They ought to have really good second-quarter earnings."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Foreign Economic Warning Hurts American Express

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Nervous investors drove shares of the American Express Company down 6.8 percent yesterday after the company warned that its growth overseas would be hampered by the Asian financial crisis and by a softening of the global economy.
"Given the interdependencies among markets, the effects of Asia will eventually spill over," Harvey Golub, the chief executive of American Express, told analysts at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. "We can expect to see the impact of Asia on Latin America, and have seen it to some extent in Europe and the U.S." 
 American Express is one of the most geographically diverse United States companies and, while no single company is a proxy for financial developments overseas, many analysts and investors look to American Express for insights about global business prospects -- particularly as they pertain to the company's core travel services and credit and charge card operations.
Mr. Golub said American Express had hoped, within a "reasonable time frame," to increase its overseas profit 25 percent to 30 percent a year, with earnings from abroad accounting for half of overall profit.
"The current economic slowdown, however, is depressing the financial results of both our card and travel business and will likely delay our progress in attaining these 'mix' goals," he told the analysts.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of American Express plunged $7.375 yesterday, to $101.0625, on nearly five times the normal trading volume.
"I don't think the sky is falling because it's too early to figure it out," said Samuel Liss, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "I think the Asian problem and the impact of the euro on their foreign-exchange business are among some of the things they need to consider."
Mr. Golub spoke privately with the analysts on Wednesday, and the company did not widely distribute copies of his statements until yesterday.
In his remarks, Mr. Golub said he thought the company would "continue to do well, but it will not be as easy or simple to match the performance of the last two quarters."
American Express has posted solid financial results lately, driven by an upswing in its card business and tighter expense controls. The company recently reported that its second-quarter profit increased 11 percent, to $578 million, compared with $520 million in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent, to $4.8 billion.
But Mr. Golub said there were important unknowns, including the possibility of further economic deterioration in Japan or a downturn in China, as possible "risks in our ability to cope."
Another blow for American Express was its decision this year not to bid on the United States Government's card account, which had been an important account to the company in terms of billing volume and number of cards. Mr. Golub said American Express was not willing to go after a contract with the Government if a bidding war meant that that the profitability of its card business would suffer.
Some analysts thought that the stock market overreacted yesterday to Mr. Golub's comments, noting that the warning was evidence of cautious management and a prudent approach, given current economic uncertainties.
"I look at this company and think they have a lot of flexibility on the expense side and have a strong financial cushion," said Susan Roth of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. She added that "all financial service companies are considering how their resources should be managed, given the spillover from Asia."

HEADLINE: Chrysler's Chief Will Fare Quite Well in Daimler Merger

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Whether the merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz succeeds or not, Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, is guaranteed to do well, documents released by the companies showed yesterday.
To persuade Mr. Eaton, 58, to stay on for three years under the combined DaimlerChrysler, he can earn nine extra years on his pension -- in addition to the three he would earn anyway. Those nine extra years alone are worth $30,000 a month for the rest of his life. 
 But if he quits or is dismissed during the two years after the merger, he will be paid $24.4 million, with DaimlerChrysler paying the "golden parachute" tax for him and the taxes on the compensation paid to cover the tax.
And he will also get stock appreciation rights on 2.27 million shares of DaimlerChrysler, a benefit worth almost $23 million for each $10 rise in the price of the company's shares.
Severance benefits and stock appreciation rights were also issued to 29 other Chrysler executives, but only Mr. Eaton was given the pension sweetener.
The pay plans were disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the the No. 3 United States auto maker and the German luxury-car company in anticipation of closing their merger in November.
Chrysler has scheduled a special shareholder meeting for Sept. 18 in Wilmington, Del., to vote on the merger.
Investors will be issued DaimlerChrysler shares, which will trade on exchanges around the world, including the New York Stock Exchange. Each Chrysler share will be exchanged for 0.6235 share of DaimlerChrysler. A holder of 100 Chrysler shares would be issued 62 shares of the new company and a cash payment for the difference, the companies said.
Daimler-Benz shareholders will exchange shares on a one-for-one basis unless 90 percent swap their shares for DaimlerChrysler stock, in which case they will receive a bonus of one-half of a percent, giving them 1.005 shares of DaimlerChrysler for each Daimler-Benz share. That bonus is so small that either way, Daimler-Benz shareholders will have 58 percent of the new company and Chrysler shareholders the remaining 42 percent.
In a sign of how the global economy will make life more complicated for investors, the two companies said that Americans who hold DaimlerChrysler shares would also face new tax complications. One-quarter of each dividend payment will be withheld to pay German taxes, but by filing a German tax form most of the tax can be refunded, the companies said.
The merger highlights key differences in the compensation styles of German and American companies.
No compensation details were disclosed for Jurgen Schrempp, the chairman of Daimler-Benz, and the nine other top executives there because their compensation packages are not being changed by the deal. Mr. Schrempp was paid no more than $2 million last year, compared with $6.1 million in salary, bonus, incentive pay and other cash for Mr. Eaton, who also made $5.3 million from exercising stock options.
When the merger is complete, Mr. Eaton will also receive $66.2 million in DaimlerChrysler stock in exchange for Chrysler options of the same value, and $3.7 million in cash, the bonus he earned for the first 11 months of the year under Chrysler's pay plan.
Chris P. Theodore, a vice president for engineering at Chrysler, said that he and colleagues were joking recently about how they hope compensation changes after the merger. "What we said was: 'We have a great idea. We'll have Daimler vacation policy and Chrysler pay policy,' " Mr. Theodore said.

HEADLINE: Reprieve for the Salmon

 BODY:
The United Nations has declared 1998 the International Year of the Ocean. This has provided a pretext for lofty talk about rescuing the oceans from pollution and overfishing, but not, as yet, much useful action. Recent decisions by Canada and Greenland to close down commercial fishing for Atlantic salmon originating in North American rivers are thus cause for celebration.
Wild Atlantic salmon -- as opposed to the farm-raised variety most people find on their menus -- have been declining at an alarming rate. Industrial wastes, polluted runoff from farms and the construction of dams killed most of the salmon spawning in the United States by the late 19th century, leaving only a handful of precarious wild runs, all in Maine. Canadian salmon have also dwindled. Scientists estimate that the number of large fish returning to Canadian rivers, mostly spawning females, reached an all-time low of 114,000 this year, one-sixth the number of 20 years ago and barely half the number required to sustain the species over the long term. 
 The decline continued despite Canada's decision to shut down a large commercial fishing ground in Newfoundland in 1993, as well as temporary measures to reduce the salmon catch near Greenland, where the fish congregate in large numbers before returning to their native rivers. In desperation, Canada closed its last remaining commercial fishery, in Labrador, on June 9.
Three days later, influenced by Canada's example and by entreaties from Canada's Atlantic Salmon Federation and Britain's Atlantic Salmon Trust, Greenland agreed to close its commercial fishery. This was a courageous step because there are not many other jobs for unemployed fishermen in Greenland. On the other hand, the move could ultimately save Canada's recreational fishing industry, valued at $100 million a year.
The decision will be reviewed in one year, and will presumably be renewed if mortality rates do not improve. In the meantime, Greenland will be allowed a subsistence catch for local consumption, while thousands of wild Atlantic salmon receive a badly needed reprieve from the gill nets.
The reprieve will also allow conservation groups, and Washington and Ottawa, to turn their energies to other threats facing Atlantic salmon. These include polluted watersheds and dams that have outlived their usefulness as sources of power and serve only to diminish the future of a once-flourishing species.

HEADLINE: RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE;
A Neighborhood Called Dumbo Has High Hopes

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A 1915 warehouse overlooking the Brooklyn waterfront that had been used as an office building in the last decade is now being converted into condominium lofts, offering views of the East River and the Manhattan skyline.
The $30 million conversion of the Clock Tower Building at One Main Street is the latest step in the slow transformation of the gritty swath of land between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges into a contemporary urban address. The onetime manufacturing area is known as Dumbo, for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. 
 When the developer, the Two Trees Management Company of Brooklyn, completes the conversion in October, the 16-story building will be the first in Dumbo to become housing. It will have 124 one- to three-bedroom apartments, all with 11-foot-high ceilings and some with dens or home offices.
Most units will range in size from 1,161 to 2,592 square feet and in price from $220,000 to $980,000. Three lower-floor units are priced from $160,000 to $180,000, and three 3,200-square-foot apartments in the tower, to be offered as unfinished space, are to cost from $1.5 million to $2 million.
The company, which for 18 years has owned 2 million square feet of space in eight area buildings, plans over the next year to convert two of its nearby vacant buildings into 150 more units. The plan ultimately is for a total of 1,000 residences, David C. Walentas, its president, said.
"I always envisioned having residential here, and now, I got lucky," he said, noting that all the ingredients -- from a strong economy to a tight housing market -- were in place.
A ripple effect from Manhattan is benefiting the Brooklyn housing market, especially neighborhoods like Brooklyn Heights, which is adjacent to Dumbo. "There is a dearth of product," said Christopher D. Thomas, sales director at the Brooklyn office of William B. May, the Manhattan brokerage concern. But this is the first project for that area, he added, and the test is if buyers will be willing "to step into an unestablished area and pay prices consistent with those in Brooklyn Heights for a product with features -- space and views -- not widely available."
In addition, they will be betting that the area, desolate at night, will develop "with residential services and night life," he said, observing, however, that "the area is next door to Brooklyn Heights, an established neighborhood, and three long blocks from bodegas and restaurants."
In the two weeks since sales opened, contracts have been signed on 30 apartments. Jed Walentas, the project manager for his father, said prices would soon be increased by "as much as 15 percent on some units, and not at all on others" in response to demand.
Since he bought the buildings, David Walentas's vision has been to turn the area into a SoHo-like neighborhood. In the intervening years, he has renovated four buildings into office space and upgraded others to enhance their use as storage or warehouse space as well as artists' studios.
The area's zoning, however, did not permit turning the buildings into housing. But last year, the developer won rezoning from the city for two blocks, in and around where the Clock Tower sits. At the same time, the building, which Two Trees had renovated into offices at a cost of $20 million, was losing its tenant, the city's Department of Labor.
Those factors, along with the building's size and views, made it ideal for conversion, Mr. Walentas said, adding: "Part of what people are buying is the future of the area, and this will set the tone for later conversions."
Amenities planned for the project, designed by the Manhattan firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, include a concierge and rooftop deck. There will also be underground parking, for an added charge, for 120 cars in a building across the street. Financing is coming from a $30 million construction loan from the Emmes Asset Management Company, also in Manhattan.
Mitchell Maxwell, with his wife and two children, will relocate to a 2,100-square-foot Clock Tower loft from a condo in Manhattan. Mr. Maxwell, a Broadway and film producer, said he was about to buy a similar-size apartment in Manhattan for $1.1 million, but instead bought the 12th-floor loft for $550,000.
Estimates are that monthly maintenance fees will be $199 to $1,048. Tax abatement from the city will help keep real estate taxes low for 10 years. The taxes, which are not included in the estimated maintenance figures, are to range from $42 to $220 a month; without the abatement, they would be $135 to $710 a month.
Verdell Bivins, district manager for Community Board 2, said many area residents thought the conversion was "good because it will bring people into the community." But, she said, "what potentially concerns residents is that the developer will operate unilaterally" on his plan for the waterfront area.
Six months ago, the city "conditionally designated" Mr. Walentas as the redeveloper for city-owned land beneath the two bridges. And over the last year, he has been negotiating with the state to redevelop its waterfront property, comprising a three-acre state park and seven Civil War-era warehouses. Mr. Walentas had been designated the developer for both sites in 1982, but that project never came to fruition.
The developer's proposal calls for retail stores, a 100-slip marina and expansion of the park to nine acres, including an esplanade, a movie theater and parking garages.
Meanwhile, the Downtown Brooklyn Waterfront Local Development Corporation, established in December by the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, and other Brooklyn officials, is pursuing, with community input, the redevelopment of five piers into a park.
"We want input into the development of the entire waterfront, not just the piers, to insure that there is a comprehensive plan in place," and that the community's primary goals of open space and public access are met, Ms. Bivins said.

HEADLINE: Region Gains Jobs, but Gap in Incomes Widens

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut continue to benefit from robust job growth, but the income gap has widened sharply between the highest- and lowest-paid workers, according to two reports released yesterday.
Perhaps most striking, at a time of huge gains on Wall Street, an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that full-time workers near the bottom of the region's income spectrum have seen their paychecks shrink, after inflation. 
 Compared with the rest of the nation, "the earnings gap grew at a faster rate in the region, with a particularly pronounced rise occurring in the New York metropolitan area," said the Federal analysis, which looked at wages from 1979 to 1996.
Coming six years into recovery from one of the New York region's deepest recessions in decades, the Federal report, taken together with another by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, points to several areas of economic strength that may seem reminiscent of the boom years of the 1980's.
Once again, as Wall Street prospers, the rich get richer. And once again, as the regional economy perks up, real estate prices surge.
But the Port Authority, in what has become an annual economic report and forecast for the region, underscored sources of economic strength that are now different from, and probably more resistant to downturns than those that fueled the 1980's boom.
"The economy is growing at the strongest rate in a decade, and the difference now is in its diversification," said Eugene Spruck, acting chief economist for the Port Authority.
"Almost every sector is participating," he said, pointing to buoyant growth in the last two years in construction, tourism, retail sales, movie and television production and Broadway ticket sales, which have generated strong economic gains to complement the wealth and employment being created by Wall Street.
According to the Port Authority report, the region has yet to make up for all of the 600,000 jobs that were lost during the recession, from 1989 through 1992. But its recovery is moving rapidly. After a gain of 133,000 jobs in 1997, the biggest annual increase in 30 years, the Port Authority forecast at least 100,000 more new jobs this year.
As in other parts of the country, New York City and its suburbs are feeling the impact of the steep downturn in Asia, where cutbacks in trade with Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and other nations could become more severe, the Port Authority said. The most prosperous Asian nations collectively account for a third of the New York region's international trade, the authority said.
But the region is far less dependent on Asia for exports and imports than some other parts of the United States, the report said, and should weather the Asian downturn better than most. For example, Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., rely on Asia for more than 80 percent of their international merchandise trade.
While the report said New York and its suburbs would be more resilient in a Wall Street downturn than they were a decade ago, Mr. Spruck said gyrations in the stock market would affect economic conditions throughout the region.
Although stock brokerage houses employ a tiny fraction of the region's workers -- about 156,000 -- their high wages ripple through things like real estate values, sales of luxury goods and the business of restaurants, resorts and Broadway theaters.
"There is the potential for a shock from the Asian downturn and possibly another on Wall Street," Mr. Spruck said, "but I don't think the region is in for a major setback over the near term."
In its analysis of wage levels, the Federal Reserve Bank looked at the amounts paid to full-time male workers in the 17 years ended in 1996, the most recent year for which data were available from the United States Census Bureau.
It looked only at what was made by people in the 90th percentile of the income spectrum and those in the 10th percentile. The average inflation-adjusted annual income of people in the 90th percentile increased 26 percent, to $80,000, during the 17 years studied, the report found, while for those in the 10th percentile it fell 21 percent, to $15,000.

HEADLINE: The Debate On Banks Gets Nasty In Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 6

 BODY:
A six-month discussion about Mexico's $62 billion bank bailout has suddenly turned into a national brawl.
Opposition politicians are accusing pro-Government businessmen of enriching themselves at public expense, while Government officials are warning that the debate is degenerating into a witch hunt. 
 The debate began when President Ernesto Zedillo proposed that vast debts from the Government's rescue be assumed by the Mexican Treasury.
The widening confrontation of recent days led to opposition demands for an investigation into the financing of Mr. Zedillo's 1994 campaign as well as to threats of lawsuits by wealthy bankers who say they have been unjustly accused of financial wrongdoing.
Some analysts are calling the debate a watershed in Mexico's political life.
For the first time powerful forces, including the opposition parties in control of the lower house of Congress, are demanding a thorough airing of the cozy dealings between Government officials and the circle of wealthy industrialists and bankers who finance Mr. Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
The latest battles flared on Monday, when the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or P.R.D., made public a list of 310 people, including several billionaires, characterizing them as beneficiaries of the bank rescue that followed the 1994 peso devaluation, though the party acknowledged that in many cases its information was sketchy.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the P.R.D. president, said the party pieced the list together from people in the banking and business worlds after the Government cited bank secrecy laws for refusing to provide details of the bailout.
"We've been asking for information, bank by bank and file by file, but the executive has refused," Mr. Lopez Obrador said at a news conference. "If this was a matter between two private parties, where one owes and the other is trying to collect, we wouldn't care about knowing secrets. But any attempt to make the debt of a handful of private people public makes full information indispensable."
For its part, the Government contends that the bailout was aimed at supporting ordinary depositors by saving the banks, but it acknowledges that the banks cannot collect some very large loans made to wealthy people, some of them bankers themselves, on the basis of their reputations, and without collateral.
The P.R.D.'s defiant action has provoked angry criticism from the Government and its supporters.
Officials at the bank rescue program, the Fund for Bank Savings Protection, immediately attacked the P.R.D. list as inaccurate and sloppy.
"This list does not agree with the information that exists in our databases," the fund said in a statement.
The Treasury Department's spokesman, Marco Provencio, said at a news conference that the P.R.D.'s tactics were similar to Senator Joseph McCarthy's demagogic use of a list of supposed Communists in Washington in 1950.
The Mexican Bankers Association published full-page advertisements in newspapers, expressing concern about the "radicalization of positions," and the PRI issued a statement calling publication of the list "political impertinence."
Central to the showdown is the Government's argument that while it wants to inform the Congress fully about the bank rescue, and has already made available 8,000 pages of documentation, it cannot share the names of people whose unpaid loans have been assumed by the fund. Mexico's bank secrecy laws prohibit such identification, the Government says.
But the Government has a history of enormous flexibility in interpreting, and reinterpreting, statutes in ways convenient for the PRI and its supporters. Given that, opposition leaders and some independent analysts have characterized the Government's legal arguments as tactics to protect inappropriate transactions from scrutiny.
"Until now, the tight alliance between the Government and the economic elite permitted that the most powerful industrial groups could do almost whatever they wanted, as long as they did it within a framework of support for the official party," Jonathan Heath, a prominent private economist, wrote in a newspaper column today. "The publication of the list by the P.R.D., despite its inaccuracies, has broken that taboo."
Because the debate has begun to challenge longstanding relations between Government officials and wealthy supporters, "it is marking a watershed in our political system," Mr. Heath said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Strategy: Keep the Pressure on Iraq

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The United States vowed today to "keep the pressure on" to persuade Iraq to end its defiance of United Nations arms inspectors, but said it was too early to contemplate a military response to the latest standoff between Iraq and the United Nations. Iraq said on Wednesday that it would end all cooperation with the inspectors.
"Noncompliance is completely unacceptable," said P. J. Crowley, a White House spokesman. "We will not allow Iraq access to resources necessary to restart their weapons of mass destruction program. We will continue to keep the pressure on until Iraq complies fully with their obligations." 
 Mr. Crowley also said that President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed "Iraq's latest bout of noncooperation" today in a free-ranging talk that produced renewed determination to keep sanctions in effect.
James Foley, a State Department spokesman, noted that this was not the first time that Baghdad had refused to cooperate with the arms inspections, only to back down.
"We've seen this time and time again," he said. "We're not calling it a crisis because, frankly, we don't want to play into Saddam Hussein's hands. Clearly he's in a box. He's trying to squirm his way out. He's trying to provoke a crisis."
The Defense Department said it had "a very adequate force" in the region of the Persian Gulf -- 19,000 troops, 167 planes and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln -- to deal with Iraq in the case of any military confrontation.
But Administration officials said the Iraqis' apparent motive was to provoke a crisis in hope that it would further divide the United States from other members of the United Nations Security Council, especially Russia and France, who have sought to lift the economic and military sanctions imposed on Baghdad after the 1991 gulf war.
In its announcement, Iraq called for the inspection team, the United Nations Special Commission, to move its headquarters to Geneva or Vienna from New York to reduce what Baghdad sees as undue American influence.
"There is an obvious effort -- and it's not the first time -- on the part of the Iraqis to characterize this as a confrontation between Iraq and the United States, and we categorically reject that characterization," Mr. Foley said. "The fact of the matter is that the confrontation, if there is one, is between Iraq and the U.N."

HEADLINE: United Healthcare Takes a $900 Million Charge

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW and REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Proving that few, if any, companies are immune to the financial perils facing health care providers, the United Healthcare Corporation, one of the nation's largest health maintenance organizations, said yesterday that it was taking a $900 million charge in its second quarter, in part to abandon unprofitable Medicare plans.
The move ignited an investor stampede out of health care stocks and possibly jeopardized United Healthcare's proposed $5.5 billion merger with its rival, Humana Inc., which would create the nation's largest H.M.O., with 10 million members. 
 Worse still, United Healthcare's announcement, unexpected by Wall Street analysts and investors, raised serious questions as to whether H.M.O.'s can make money covering Medicare patients.
"People seem to forget that Medicare was created because private insurers could not make money on the elderly population," said Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer group in New York. "Now managed-care plans are discovering the same lesson all over again and are getting out."
Analysts think that many people on Medicare will not be affected. But the company did not give details about which markets it might leave or how it might change its coverage. Analysts said that the most vulnerable markets were those where United Healthcare does not have enough enrollees to negotiate steep discounts with hospitals and doctors. For example, Utah is nearly devoid of managed-care coverage for people on Medicare.
While United Healthcare had said it would realign its operations, few analysts expected the scope to be so broad or the write-off, covering future Medicare losses and its exit from some markets, so steep. Having watched many of its competitors like Oxford Health Plans stumble, United Healthcare, based in Minneapolis, had emerged as Wall Street's best hope for managed care.
The company's chairman and chief executive, William W. McGuire, was well liked and viewed as having a strong grasp of the fundamental issues of managed care. "They were and supposedly are the best in the industry," said Larry Feinberg of Oracle Partners, a New York hedge fund that specializes in health care.
That belief was largely shattered yesterday when the company disclosed the reorganization charge as the cause of its $565 million loss in the second quarter. United Healthcare said that the company's continuing operations remained profitable, with its commercial business remaining robust, but acknowledged that it could not afford to cover Medicare patients in some areas. The company said it was losing money in two-thirds of the 24 markets where it provides care to people on Medicare.
"Medicare is clearly our largest disappointment," Mr. McGuire said. The company also said it was leaving several commercial markets as well.
Investors, who were caught completely off guard by the news, immediately fled the stock, dumping many other health care stocks in their wake. United Healthcare plunged $15, or 28.4 percent, to $37.875. Humana dropped $6.625, or 25.7 percent, to $19.125. Pacificare Health Systems fell $5.375, to $63.75, and Wellpoint Health Networks dropped $1.6875, to $56.25.
With health care stocks tumbling, and with United Healthcare indicating that it was rethinking its aggressive push into the Medicare market, analysts questioned the fate of United Healthcare's pending acquisition of Humana. A spokeswoman for United Healthcare said yesterday that the deal was still progressing on schedule, but Humana, based in Louisville, Ky., was not so enthusiastic.
Soon after the announcement was made public, Humana, which received no warning of United Heathcare's write-off, released a terse statement saying it would not comment on the charge until it discussed it with United Healthcare executives.
Mr. McGuire said yesterday during a meeting with analysts that Federal and state regulatory review of the merger was continuing and that the shareholder vote was expected at the end of this month. Asked about Humana's statement, he refused to comment.
"With the stock prices so low, the acquisition may be renegotiated," said Linda Varoli, an analyst with Merger Insight. "Humana's board of directors has a responsibility to their shareholders. They may want more assurances from United Healthcare or get more considerations from them in the deal."
And much of the merger's appeal is Humana's strong presence in the Medicare market, although Mr. McGuire emphasized that United's losses were caused by the start-up nature of its programs.
Even if the acquisition is completed, United Healthcare, which said it has 1.3 million people in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey and is an aggressive player in the area, will face questions about its commitment to Medicare patients. Consumer advocates clamored yesterday that United Healthcare's move to drop certain counties was typical given that H.M.O.'s tended to put profits in front of health care.
But Mr. McGuire said that United Healthcare was not abandoning this group. "We remain committed to serving seniors in a variety of ways," Mr. McGuire said yesterday. United Healthcare will re-evaluate its programs in specific markets to see whether it can generate what he described as "acceptable margins." Still, the company is prepared, he said, to leave markets where it cannot make money."
United is the latest managed-care company to stumble in an attempt to make money serving the Medicare population, and many of its competitors have decided to withdraw from that market. Oxford has attributed some of its heavy losses on its Medicare programs in some areas, and several companies, including Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and Health Net in California, have recently decided to throw in the towel.
The economics of serving people on Medicare make it virtually impossible to make money, said Karen Korn, a health care services analyst at Putnam Investments in Boston. The Government has approved rate increases for Medicare-managed programs of about 2 percent while medical costs are rising at 4 percent or higher. "There's no way that translates into O.K. margins," Ms. Korn said.
Despite the Government's push to have more Medicare members in managed care, there may be few providers that remain interested in serving the population. "We'll see a lot more dropping out of it than getting into it," predicted Barry Barnett, a principal at Kwasha HR Solutions, a unit of Price Waterhouse Coopers.
But United Healthcare's woes also raise the question of whether managed care works as a model for the future of health care in keeping costs under control. While the company's difficulties are limited to caring for the elderly, it is unclear how successful any managed-care company will be once it covers more people. The backlash from consumers, who are increasingly demanding more from their plans and want more choice of doctors and hospitals, adds to the difficulty of containing costs. "You can't make huge margins in this business long term," Mr. Feinberg argued.
The effect of yesterday's announcement on employers, many of whom are now choosing health plans for their employees, is unclear. While some benefits consultants said that they thought the news would have little effect, others said that it would give some employers pause.
"I'm tired of managed-care companies believing they can control health care costs," said Todd B. Richter, a health care analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "They need to learn how to price health care. They are insurance companies. And that means they are in the risk-management business."

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Increased by Only 0.1% in June

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Held back by slumping demand for aircraft and autos, orders to factories rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in June, the Commerce Department said today.
Still, the report exceeded the expectations of analysts, who had expected it to show a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent. In issuing June's data, the Commerce Department also revised May's decline to 2.2 percent, the biggest drop in three years, from the 1.8 percent reported previously. 
 In the second quarter, factory orders fell seven-tenths of 1 percent from the prior three months. Economists said the decline reflected Asia's economic turmoil. Export sales to Asia have plummeted, and American manufacturers are facing increased competition from Asian products whose prices have fallen because of currency devaluations.
However, a separate report today from the Labor Department suggested jobs remained plentiful despite the manufacturing slowdown. The number of first-time applications for unemployment benefits edged higher last week, to a seasonally adjusted 307,000, but remained near the 15-week low of 301,000 that was reached the week before.
That was well below the 394,000 claims registered for two consecutive weeks in late June and early July, when workers idled by the General Motors strike filed for benefits.
The June factory report was weighed down by the transportation industries. Excluding those manufacturers, factory orders increased 1.1 percent in June, in contrast to a decline in May of 1.8 percent.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
N.B.A. Owners' Group Brings an Abrupt End to Session

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Negotiators for the National Basketball Association and its players met constructively, they thought, for nearly two hours yesterday morning. Then they broke for lunch, and each side had to wonder what was in the water the other side had with its food.
Within 15 minutes after the negotiators returned from lunch, the owners' group abruptly ended the session, dismissing a union proposal as economically perilous. Both sides accused the other of deliberately torpedoing the meeting and the immediate chance for progress in the off-season lockout. 
 "They were like my 4-year-old," said Karl Malone, who traveled from Alaska for his first taste of collective bargaining. "I don't want to play anymore so I'm going home."
The half-dozen owners who were in the conference room of a midtown Manhattan law office, on the other hand, were described as stunned and insulted by post-lunch developments.
"We thought the best thing to do to preserve any semblance of a bargaining balance for continuity would be to end discussions right there," said Commissioner David Stern, who with his deputy and chief negotiator, Russ Granik, expressed disappointment and sadness at yesterday's developments.
The negotiators were meeting for the first time since June 22, and the first time since the league imposed its lockout on July 1, suspending all N.B.A. business, including the signing of free agents and the payment of salary that teams contractually owe players for the 1998-99 season.
No further bargaining sessions are scheduled, though lawyers for the league and the players will meet today with an arbitrator, John D. Feerick, to schedule a hearing on the union's grievance over the teams' failure to pay guaranteed salaries. Feerick's decision in that case is expected to have a major impact on the future of talks.
League officials, in fact, suggested that the union strategy centered not on negotiations but on the salary grievance and an unfair labor practice charge it filed with the National Labor Relations Board.
"The strategy here is to litigate, arbitrate and make no concessions," said Granik. Billy Hunter, the union chief, countered by saying that the players will use every avenue available to them to undermine the lockout, but that they want to negotiate a new agreement.
At the morning session, the owners who were present engaged in back-and-forth dialogue with the 13 players who were at the large table. Stern called the exchange constructive. Hunter said at least part of it was acrimonious, particularly an early exchange between Malone and Jerry Colangelo of the Phoenix Suns.
But the exchange prompted the union to make a post-lunch proposal. Jerry Kessler, one of the union's outside lawyers, said: "Colangelo said we had to address the drug agreement, rookie issues and a hard salary cap. They want to slow the growth of salaries."
So the union returned from lunch with a proposal that would change the 20 percent salary increase veterans receive in new contracts, grant clubs the right of first refusal on players ending their three-year rookie contracts and would add marijuana to the drug-testing list if all economic issues were resolved first.
But the owners viewed the overall effect of the elements of the economic proposal as perilous. The union's ideas, they said, could increase, not decrease, the percentage of revenue that would go to players' salaries. In addition, the owners took offense at remarks made by Kessler.
"When they lecture you on the grave risk you face if you don't take their proposal, that's when it's time to leave," Stern said. "That's not the tone in which we address the players."
Kessler said he wasn't lecturing the owners.
"When they were about to storm out of the meeting," he said, "I suggested that they recognize there are going to be some very important legal decisions to be made rather quickly and it might be in their interest to negotiate seriously before those decisions come down."
Patrick Ewing, the union's president, said the players felt they were making progress with their proposal and the owners "showed disrespect by getting up and walking out."
At the morning session yesterday, one of the participants said, the owners raised a salary cap idea they had previously discussed with variations. They proposed implementing a hard salary cap for the future, though current players would not be affected by it.
The players rejected the idea, and then everyone went to lunch and drank the water.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Stocks Lower Yet; Tokyo Is Up

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Friday, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Stocks continued to fall here early today after declining sharply on Thursday.
The benchmark Hang Seng index hit a three-and-a-half-year low Thursday, as interest rates rose and the local currency -- the last in Asia still pegged to the United States dollar -- weakened slightly. 
 In early trading this morning, the Hang Seng was down 121.16 points, or 1.67 percent, at 7,133.20. It closed at 7,254.36 on Thursday, its lowest since January 1995. The Hong Kong dollar traded around 7.75 to the American dollar, the same as on Thursday, compared with 7.7492 Wednesday.
In Tokyo, stocks were modestly higher at the midday trading recess. The Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 86.87 points, or a little more than half of 1 percent, at 15,963.09.
Speculation has been growing that the region's slowing economies may force China and eventually Hong Kong to devalue their currencies.
Problems abound locally, as well. After Cathay Pacific Airways posted its first loss ever Wednesday, the conglomerate Swire Pacific announced on Thursday that its first-half profit fell a worse-than-expected 39 percent.

Security Council Is United In Criticism of Iraq Action
The Security Council closed ranks to berate Iraq for ending cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors, but took no action other than to demand that Baghdad reverse its decision. Secretary General Kofi Annan suggested that the Iraqis were desperate for movement toward ending sanctions and needed to be brought more closely into deliberations at the United Nations. A1 

The United States vowed to keep the pressure on Iraq, but said it was too early to contemplate any military action. A6

HEADLINE: SECURITY COUNCIL CLOSES ITS RANKS AGAINST BAGHDAD

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The Security Council closed ranks today to berate Iraq for ending cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors, but took no action other than to demand that Baghdad reverse its decision.
But even as Iraq was isolated in the Security Council, the Government got mixed signals from Secretary General Kofi Annan, who suggested that the Iraqis, "desperate" for some movement toward ending sanctions, needed to be brought more closely into deliberations here. 
 But in a written statement in Washington, President Clinton said, "Far from hastening the day the international community lifts sanctions," Iraq's failure to permit inspections "will perpetuate those sanctions and keep the Iraqi economy under tight international control."
The Security Council members, united in shock and a touch of weariness at having to work their way through another unexpected crisis created by Baghdad, called Iraq's decision to freeze cooperation with inspectors "totally unacceptable."
In Beijing, Moscow and Paris, the capitals most sympathetic to the Iraqis, Governments distanced themselves from Baghdad in statements. In Russia and China, there were expressions of concern about the consequences of continued Iraqi defiance.
"It is now extremely important not to stoke tensions over Iraq," the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vladimir Rakhmanin, told a news briefing in Moscow. A Chinese spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said his Government would do what it could "to avoid a worsening of the situation."
While President Clinton said the Iraqi move "once again will backfire," his statement emphasized sanctions as the wedge to force Iraq to comply with inspections. Administration officials said there was no immediate consideration of military force, saying that the situation so far seemed to be less serious than it was last October, when the Iraqis expelled American inspectors.
But they said that the Administration would consider the use of force if the situation deteriorated. "We'll take our time -- we're not going to let Saddam call the shots," one Administration official said last night, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Surveillance went on as usual in Baghdad today, though no actual site inspections were attempted because Iraq barred them on Wednesday, United Nations officials said.
When Iraq decided this week that it would end cooperation with arms inspections and allow only passive monitoring by surveillance cameras, the Iraqis were aware that they were actually close to meeting disarmament requirements in some areas, Richard Butler, the chief arms inspector told the Security Council today.
But officials of the United Nations Special Commission, known as Unscom, said today that the Iraqis also knew that problems in accounting for biological and some chemical compounds were serious and growing. Right up to the present, Iraq has continued to change figures and alter other information earlier presented as "full, final and complete" declarations.
At times the Iraqis have been forced to revise a story when confronted with evidence by inspectors -- as in the recent case of the discovery of traces of VX nerve gas on shell casings after Iraqis denied that they had used it. At other times, they volunteer new information -- but that only raises more troubling questions about why an account has changed.
In recent examinations of old warhead remnants, for example, weapons experts found more traces of anthrax than they could explain, Unscom officials said today. When the Iraqis were pressed, they revised earlier "final figures" to say that they had actually filled three times as many warheads with anthrax -- 16 -- as with botulism -- 5. Until then, Iraq said it had filled weapons with more than three times more botulism than anthrax.
This admission has revived speculation among inspectors that Iraq produced not only more anthrax, but also two kinds of it, one in a dry form that is easier to spray and has a longer shelf life. Officials insisted today, however, that this is only speculation at this point.
"Every time Iraq changes the figures, it has a ripple effect throughout their entire declaration," said Charles Duelfer, deputy chairman of Unscom. "That is a very complicated procedure because a declaration is built and substantiated to support one set of numbers and to change that becomes very difficult."
This week Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister and chief negotiator on weapons issues, gave a new explanation of how VX nerve gas could have been found on the shells. In a letter to the Security Council on Wednesday, he said the traces could have been created from the "decomposition of other chemical substances or from the use of equipment which had already been used to produce the VX agent."
After today's lengthy Council meeting, a Western diplomat said that nobody relished having to take strong action to make Iraq conform to its agreements. Until the arms inspectors are satisfied that Iraq has provided answers to outstanding questions about biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs, President Hussein cannot hope to see the end of sanctions, which were imposed in 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait.
"Everyone was weary, everyone was annoyed and everyone was concerned that this not turn into a crisis that would force the United States to act as it had to act last year," the diplomat said.
The Council action came after Mr. Butler briefed members on his aborted trip to Iraq, which ended when talks broke down earlier this week. He also spoke on the Iraqi leadership's refusal to turn over documents, including one discovered in July that shed light on the amount of "nonconventional munitions" used during the 1980-87 war with Iran.
Diplomats said that the document could prove that there are larger quantities of chemical -- and possibly biological -- agents unaccounted for in Iraq than inspectors were told about last year. Iraqis said that they had filled 101,080 warheads with chemical weapons in the 1980's, but the new document reveals that fewer than that were actually deployed. The inspectors want to know what happened to the rest.
Secretary General Annan also spoke to the Council about his assessment of Iraq's position after talking this morning with Mr. Aziz. Mr. Annan told the Council that Iraq was "clearly in violation of the resolutions of the Security Council and the memorandum of understanding I concluded in Baghdad in February."
"I believe this is well understood by the Government of Iraq," he said.
But Mr. Annan added that he thought Iraq's position was "not a closed one," that Baghdad had acted out of frustration and even desperation, and that it might be the right time "to stand back and make a comprehensive reassessment of where we are, where we are going and how to get there."
"In undertaking this comprehensive review," he said, "it might be helpful to engage the Iraqis much more closely than we have hitherto."
Over the last year, Iraq has persistently and successfully managed to broaden its diplomatic contacts with United Nations officials, skirting the Security Council when it could. Iraqi has complained repeatedly that the Council and the disarmament commission are dominated by the United States.
In a letter to the Arab League today, Mr. Aziz appealed for support against what he called the "injustice" of Unscom.
Arms inspectors see this as an Iraqi tactic to bring international politics into what is essentially a technical operation to disarm Iraq and destroy its capacity to make new weapons of mass destruction.
Mr. Butler also provided the Security Council today with results of a technical evaluation in July of Iraq's "full, final and complete disclosure" on biological weapons, a document the Iraqis say closes the file on that issue. This was the third such technical evaluation demanded by Iraq over the last year, and its findings were no different from earlier ones.
"No new material was presented by Iraq at this meeting," Mr. Butler wrote in his report of the July technical evaluation. The international experts again concluded that Iraq's latest disclosure "was not adequate to allow for credible verification."
The biological experts found problems with Iraqi accounts of what they had done with bombs, warheads, spraying devices or quantities of the agents themselves, including botulinum toxin, anthrax bacillus and aflatoxin.
Today Bill Richardson, the United States representative to the United Nations called the Iraqi demand "disarmament by ultimatum."
"That's not going to happen," he said.

HEADLINE: Lewinsky Said to Detail Clinton Affair

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Ending months of anticipation with a resigned shrug, Monica S. Lewinsky walked into a Federal courthouse here today, and, a lawyer familiar with her account said, testified that she and President Clinton had carried on a sexual affair inside the White House.
Her testimony before a Federal grand jury, which contradicted a previous sworn statement, tightened the legal and political vise around Mr. Clinton. The President denied under oath in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit that he had had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and he has denied it as well to the American people. 
 Ms. Lewinsky testified to having had several sexual encounters with Mr. Clinton in his small, private study down a short hallway from the Oval Office, the lawyer said. As expected, she also testified that she and the President had talked about ways to conceal their relationship, the lawyer said, but she also said he never directly told her to lie under oath.
Kenneth W. Starr, the independent prosecutor, is investigating accusations that Mr. Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice by trying to conceal the relationship.
More than six months of waiting for Ms. Lewinsky to tell her story ended just before 8:30 A.M., when she stepped from a dark green Toyota Land Cruiser, embraced a lawyer, shrugged and vanished inside. As portable generators rumbled in the background and one cameraman swept the scene from a cherrypicker 50 feet over Third Street, about 20 satellite trucks beamed the images of Ms. Lewinsky, once an unpaid, anonymous sorter of White House mail, around the planet.
Ms. Lewinsky, who is 25, answered questions in exchange for immunity from prosecution for any wrongdoing she describes. She is vulnerable to prosecution only if she lies in her testimony, in a deal worked out with prosecutors nine days ago. In an affidavit on Jan. 7 in the Jones case, Ms. Lewinsky swore that she had not had a sexual relationship with the President.
An associate of Ms. Lewinsky described her six and a half hours before the grand jury as grueling. "She was asked very specific questions about very private matters which are very hard to discuss in public," the associate said.
Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky has agonized for months over the prospect of damaging Mr. Clinton's Presidency, friends have said. One of her friends described Ms. Lewinsky as saying Wednesday night, as she prepared for her testimony: "What I'm doing tomorrow is something I never ever wanted to do. It breaks my heart."
Since Jan. 27, the 23 grand jurors have listened to the testimony of more than 70 witnesses and hours of surreptitiously taped conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and her former friend Linda R. Tripp. Today was the grand jurors' first opportunity to look Mr. Starr's prized witness in the eyes, question her and judge her credibility for themselves.
Before another media scrum after Ms. Lewinsky completed her testimony, her spokeswoman, Judy Smith, said she had answered questions from prosecutors and jurors "truthfully, completely and honestly."
"Monica and her family are relieved that this ordeal finally appears to be coming to an end," Ms. Smith said.
Mr. Clinton has never publicly described his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in any detail, beyond defiantly declaring that it was not sexual.
In a capital whipsawed between disclosure and denial, starkly different days unspooled at the Federal courthouse and the White House. Summoning the authority and trappings of his office, as well as his own storied political resilience, President Clinton went about his official duties today without betraying a hint of interest in the former intern's testimony.
"I have looked forward to this day for quite a long time," Mr. Clinton said in one speech at a Washington hotel, referring to his opportunity to address a White House conference on building economic self-improvement in Indian communities.
At the White House, the President appeared before a row of uniformed police officers in the sun-gilded Rose Garden to call for a permanent five-day waiting period for people seeking to buy handguns. With a quick left-handed salute after the official remarks, the President cued a brassy Marine band to strike up "Stars and Stripes Forever." Reporters waiting to shout questions about Ms. Lewinsky were stymied.
Some White House advisers gave vent to frustration over the spectacle at the courthouse and the unremitting pressure of the Lewinsky investigation. "I hate the whole thing," said one. "I hate you, I hate us." Then, in his disgust, words failed him. "Ugh," he added.
Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, provided the official reaction to the testimony. "The President has not expressed any views to us on this," he said in a contentious and sometimes raucous briefing today, "except we know that he does agree with us -- and probably all Americans -- that if this means that we're coming to the end of this four-year, over $40 million investigation, then that would be a good thing."
Another official said the White House had no interest in drawing attention today. "We're showing wise restraint," he said. "Nobody's going to criticize Ms. Lewinsky, and we're not going to get in the story. It's a big enough story without us."
For all their restraint, White House advisers telephoned reporters late this evening to ask what they had learned about Ms. Lewinsky's testimony.
Just last week, Ms. Lewinsky's version of her relationship with the President was still in doubt. But Mr. Starr's investigation has rushed forward since then, with her immunity agreement and Mr. Clinton's own promise to testify at the White House on Aug. 17. In striking the deal with Mr. Starr, Ms. Lewinsky also turned over a navy blue dress that prosecutors have sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation crime laboratory. Technicians there are trying to determine if the dress contained physical evidence of a sexual encounter.
Ms. Lewinsky was asked a series of questions about the dress today. Prosecutors have left open the possibility of recalling Ms. Lewinsky before the grand jury, perhaps after the President testifies.
Reporters from across the country and around the world converged on the courthouse today, clucking over the spectacle and contributing to it at the same time. Some reporters began claiming choice spots as early as Wednesday evening for a glimpse of Ms. Lewinsky, only to be flummoxed this morning as she took an unexpected route through the courthouse, up to the third floor in an elevator reserved for judges.
Outside, as passers-by stopped to take in the scene, scores of photographers lined up for a shot of her. When George Hancock, a supporter of Ms. Lewinsky's from Bowling Green, Ky., tried to raise his yellow hand-lettered sign wishing her luck, he cut off their line of sight. "You wave that sign again," screamed one cameraman, "I'll kill you!"
Ducking out of view, Mr. Hancock was surrounded moments later by reporters and photographers, some of whom berated him while others tried to interview him. "How's it make you feel, buddy?" Dominic Mumeka, 33, murmured as if to himself as he stood off to one side. "This is your 15 seconds."
Mr. Mumeka, who cleans a taxi depot, said he had dropped by to watch history be made. "There hasn't been anything like this since Watergate, and before that since Andrew Johnson, 1869," he said. But, he asked, "Can a guy really get impeached for going to bed with someone?"
The White House has resolutely refused to question Ms. Lewinsky's credibility publicly. But there have been fragmentary accounts that White House officials were concerned that she had a crush on the President.
An Indianapolis lawyer who has worked as a Democratic operative said in an interview today that he had been asked to keep an eye on Ms. Lewinsky at an Oct. 23, 1996, fund-raiser here to insure that she did not "embarrass the President."
John J. Sullivan, a lobbyist and lawyer from Indianapolis, said he had been asked by a friend in the Administration to watch Ms. Lewinsky because she had recently left the White House and there were concerns she was "disgruntled."
Mr. Sullivan recalled his friend as saying about Ms. Lewinsky: " 'We don't know if she has fantasized a relationship with the President. But she keeps showing up at these events.' "
Mr. Sullivan said he had watched Ms. Lewinsky reach out with both hands to hug the President. "And he hugged her back," he said. "Then he said to her, 'How are you doing?' She said, 'Fine.' He said, 'How's your new job?' And she said, 'Great.' He said, 'I wish you the best of luck,' and that was it."
Mr. Sullivan said he spoke on Monday with a television station in Indianapolis. In a sign that the White House is following up any lead to bolster Mr. Clinton's story, Mr. Sullivan said David E. Kendall, the President's personal lawyer, called him on Wednesday to ask a number of questions.
Mr. Sullivan said he felt no pressure to tell his story publicly.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Plans to Push Smaller Tax Cuts in Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded today that huge tax cuts would probably have to be put off until next year, but he and other House Republican leaders said they would forge ahead this fall with a smaller tax cut in the belief that President Clinton would ultimately accept it.
In meetings with fellow Republicans over the last week, Mr. Gingrich has said Mr. Clinton will probably accept a bill cutting taxes by a maximum of $70 billion to $80 billion over five years. 
 On the one hand, the Speaker's decision can be seen as a retreat in the face of opposition from the President and moderate Republicans. Mr. Gingrich and other conservatives had been promoting legislation that would cut taxes by $167 billion over five years and by $700 billion over 10 years. On the other hand, Republicans said, the strategy could prove to be a big advance toward getting a tax cut enacted into law this year.
Senate Republicans had made clear that they would not approve tax cuts of the magnitude Mr. Gingrich originally wanted. And the White House sounded cool even to the idea of a smaller tax cut.
In an interview tonight, Gene Sperling, assistant to the President for economic policy, said: "The President is not going to sign any new spending or tax initiative if it drains any of the surplus that is reserved for Social Security, whether it's $700 billion, $70 billion or $7 billion. We believe that all of the surplus should be reserved for Social Security until we have a comprehensive bipartisan reform solution for that program."
By contrast, at a caucus of House Republicans, Mr. Gingrich said, "We believe the surplus money will go to save Social Security and to provide tax relief." He vowed that "every penny of Social Security payroll taxes" -- but not necessarily every penny of the surplus -- "will be used to strengthen Social Security."
The Congressional Budget Office foresees a surplus of $63 billion this year and a total of $1.5 trillion in surpluses over the next 10 years. In this fall's elections, Mr. Gingrich said, Republicans will ask voters, "Do you want the money to go back to the American taxpayer, or do you want the money spent by bureaucrats in Washington?"
The House Republicans' top priority for this year's tax bill is to reduce the effects of a longstanding quirk in the tax code known as the marriage penalty. Because of this provision, many married couples with two incomes pay higher taxes than they would if they filed separate tax returns as individuals.
Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, who writes tax legislation as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: "I look forward to producing a middle-income tax cut bill in September, and I hope the President will sign it. If he doesn't, he risks being known as the President who imposed a marriage penalty on the American people."
In a speech to the House Republican caucus today, Mr. Gingrich listed five other priorities for tax-cutting legislation this fall and next year. For example, he said, Republicans will try to cut capital gains taxes, eliminate estate taxes and increase the tax deductions allowed for the purchase of health insurance by individuals and small businesses.
Capital gains are profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets. Mr. Gingrich wants to reduce the top tax rate on such gains to 15 percent, from 20 percent.
Mr. Gingrich said the Republicans would also "work to" repeal a law that reduces Social Security benefits for elderly people who earn more than a certain amount, $14,500 a year. Critics say the earnings limit punishes people for working and forces some people to retire though they would prefer to work.
Finally, Mr. Gingrich said the Republicans would try to repeal provisions of the 1993 budget law that increased the taxation of Social Security benefits for people with substantial income from other sources.
The President said today that he would accuse the Republicans of weakening Social Security if they pursued a big tax cut financed by projected surpluses in the Federal budget. In the Rose Garden of the White House, Mr. Clinton declared, "We should reserve every penny of the surplus until we save Social Security for the 21st century."

The final stunt for "The Magic Hour" will be a vanishing act. The late-night talk show, featuring the basketball legend Earvin (Magic) Johnson as its host, has been canceled by its syndicator, 20th Television, after only two months because of low ratings.
In New York, the hourlong show appears on Channel 5 at 11:30 on weeknights. Reruns will continue until early September. 
 "We were improving with each day," Mr. Johnson said in a statement, "but this is television, and shows are canceled all the time for one reason or another."
"The Magic Hour" had an average Nielsen rating of 1.6, or a little more than two million viewers each night, since its June 8 debut.
"While the show was gaining in popularity, the economics of such a major enterprise make it impossible to continue beyond its initial commitment without gaining higher ratings in a very short time," said the announcement by 20th Television, which is owned by the News Corporation.

In the 'Free' World Now, But He's Still a Dissident

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Communist bureaucracy made Aleksandr I. Ginzburg stateless during the cold war. French bureaucracy would have left him stateless now if he had not raised his voice in protest.
Mr. Ginzburg knows something about protest. As a poet and outspoken supporter of human rights in the Soviet Union, he was in prison for much of the 1960's and 1970's. He was freed and flown to the United States with four other imprisoned dissidents in 1979 in an exchange for two convicted Soviet spies. 
 The swap left him with freedom but "indeterminate nationality," as described in the French travel document he must use instead of a passport.
Since he has lived and worked in France for most of the last two decades, he finally applied for French citizenship three years ago. But when the decision finally came, in a letter dated June 17, it was, as he puts it, "a resounding 'nyet.' "
"You understand and speak French only indifferently and can neither read nor write it," said the letter, signed by the Subdirector for Naturalization in the Directorate of Population and Migration of the Ministry of Employment and Solidarity.
That title might have come from Gogol's satire on the Russian bureaucracy, "The Government Inspector," prominently displayed in Mr. Ginzburg's library, but the Subdirector's letter was no joke.
"Under these circumstances, you cannot be considered assimilated into the French community," it said.
But Mr. Ginzburg, 62 and short of breath after a bout with cancer that left him with only one lung, has not lost his combativeness.
"It's a fact that I don't speak French well at all," he said, in Russian, in his sixth-floor apartment near the Gare de Lyons. "But it's also a fact that nobody ever gave me an examination that would justify such a finding."
France, like the United States, prides itself on two centuries of devotion to republican ideals of freedom, equality and human rights. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, it gave shelter to thousands of "white Russian" refugees who opposed the Bolsheviks. Some survivors of that immigration still do not speak French well, but they hold French passports.
Times have changed, though, and it is harder in these days of double-digit unemployment rates and mass clandestine immigration to qualify for naturalization in France or anywhere else in Europe.
So as things stood in June, Mr. Ginzburg would not qualify, though his wife, Irina, and their older son, Alexandre, 25, were granted citizenship. Alexandre's younger brother, Alexis, 23, grew up in Paris with him, but he was turned down.
"You have in fact attracted the attention of the police, in 1995, for willful damage to private property (graffiti)," the letter to Alexis, also dated June 17, informed him. But it said he could apply again for citizenship in a year.
"Paris is one of the world capitals of graffiti art," his father said in exasperation. "There are art galleries devoted to it, and four art journals. There are exhibitions from time to time, and the newspapers treat the artists as celebrities.
"My son is offended when the newspapers write about him and don't reproduce his art. He was painting on his own building when the police came by, and all they did was ask him to show his papers -- he never heard another word from them."
Mr. Ginzburg came to France in 1980, after his release, to take a job working for the European office of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., so he could not apply here for immigration status as a refugee. "I came here from New York City, so I wasn't fleeing persecution," he said, laughing.
He stayed in France to work for a Russian emigre journal, Russkaya Mysl, or Russian Thought, but he clashed with the editors, he said, and was dismissed last year. His dismissal, he is persuaded, was not unconnected to the refusal of his naturalization request, since the editors are well connected with the French authorities.
But so is Mr. Ginzburg, who says he has known President Jacques Chirac for years.
He proudly displayed an invitation to the July 14 Bastille Day garden party at Elysee Palace this year, though he was not feeling well that day and did not attend.
After news of his plight appeared in the daily Le Figaro and other French newspapers, he received a handwritten note from the Culture Minister, Catherine Trautmann, assuring him that his case would be rapidly cleared up.
"My colleague Martine Aubry," the Minister of Employment and Solidarity, "is personally taking charge of your difficulty, which we sincerely deplore," Mrs. Trautmann wrote.
On Wednesday, Mr. Ginzburg said, the police in the precinct where he had applied for naturalization called and told his wife that he would soon have his citizenship papers.
"Now I can finally get rid of this green snake," he said, unfolding the accordion-like travel document. "But they said they knew nothing about Alexis's application. Me, an old man, they'll accept, but they turn down a healthy young man who grew up in France and considers himself French."
He hopes, he said, that the authorities will soon relent and grant Alexis, too, the citizenship of his adopted country.

Tokyo Leader Calls for Cuts In Tax Rates

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 7

 BODY:
In his first major policy speech since taking over as Prime Minister a week ago, Keizo Obuchi today proposed cuts in individual and corporate taxes and additional spending for public works while making less-concrete promises to deregulate the economy and trim the Government budget.
While Mr. Obuchi spoke forcefully, he proposed primarily to speed up changes his politically less powerful predecessor had pursued for some time; he offered little in the way of shock therapy for Japan's ailing economy. 
 He plans to serve up a quick cocktail of tax cuts and public spending aimed at spurring the economy over the next year or two. For the long term, his menu is a far less detailed list of promises to deregulate, push administrative change, privatize the public sector and overhaul the tax system -- in short, the program the man he succeeded, Ryutaro Hashimoto, pushed for.
"I am determined to make my utmost effort, at the risk of the Cabinet's life, to bring the Japanese economy to a recovery path within a year or two," he told Parliament, alluding to newspaper reports that have described his Cabinet as standing on the edge of a cliff.
Mr. Obuchi may not have much time. "It seems he wants to engineer a soft landing of the Japanese economy," said Heizo Takenaka, a professor at Keio University, "and the basic question is, Is that possible? I personally feel that some kind of shock therapy is necessary."
In Washington, the Clinton Administration continued to walk a line between hope that Japan would move quickly to enact the changes necessary to shore up its economy and skepticism that decisive action was forthcoming.
"The early restoration of growth in the Japanese economy is critical not only for Japan but for Asia, other emerging markets and the world economy as a whole," said a senior official at the United States Treasury Department, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
"Japan also needs to move aggressively to use public money along with actions to strengthen and restructure banks, to dispose of the burden of bad assets and to improve bank supervision and disclosure," the official said.
The pace of deterioration in the Japanese economy has gained momentum of late. In the week since Mr. Obuchi took office, the unemployment rate hit yet another high, domestic auto sales were down for the 16th straight month and the yen sank against the dollar. Manufacturers are cutting production, and even in the midst of sweltering heat, air-conditioner sales are off.
"The problems are so serious right now that the best we can hope for even in a year's time is that he can stabilize the situation," said Jeffrey D. Young, chief economist at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. And, indeed, Mr. Obuchi's immediate plans are to do just that. He promised 6 trillion yen, or roughly $41 billion, in overall tax cuts next year, effectively making permanent the 4 trillion yen in temporary cuts for individuals that Mr. Hashimoto extended this year.
He pledged to lower the maximum combined local and national income tax rate to 50 percent from 65 percent, the first step toward what he hopes will be a comprehensive reworking of the tax system.
And borrowing another page from Mr. Hashimoto's book, he said he would lower the corporate tax rate to 40 percent from 46.3 percent starting in April, bringing it roughly in line with Western levels.
Economists and business leaders have long criticized Japan's high taxes for inhibiting entrepreneurs and forcing dynamic individuals to move to other countries. "I paid 200 million yen in taxes last year," Takuya Okada, chairman and chief executive of Jusco Ltd., one of Japan's largest retailers, fumed recently.
The temporary tax cut he got this spring returned just 18,000 yen to him, which "did not really inspire me to spend," he said. "Now, if they cut my income tax to 50 percent, then I might think about spending," he added. Few economists, though, say a tax cut will put the economy on a path to lasting recovery.
"Tax cuts are necessary because bankruptcies are increasing and unemployment is spiraling up," said Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders in Tokyo. "But it's not going to start a consumer-led recovery."
Neither will corporate tax cuts necessarily stimulate capital investment. Only 35 to 40 percent of Japanese corporations pay taxes, and the low cost of capital -- companies can borrow at around 1 percent -- offsets the tax burden for those companies doing well enough to have to pay taxes.
While economists welcome a corporate cut, many say the tax structure itself is in need of a fix. "Companies now get tax breaks for certain types of investment that made sense a long time ago, but, given changes in technology and the economy, now make no sense," Mr. Young said.
Voters, however, are demanding something that makes sense. Mr. Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost control of the Upper House of Parliament when voters turned out in unexpected droves on June 12 to vent their anger. Popularity ratings for Mr. Obuchi and his Cabinet are so low that commentators see a bright side: they probably cannot get any worse.
The loss of the Upper House threatens to stall the passage of legislation to revamp the debt-ridden banking system, and foreign investors will continue to punish the stock market and the yen until they see evidence that change is for real.
Mr. Obuchi is well aware of that, and he was at his most eloquent when speaking about the financial sector. "The flow of funds is like the blood of society, and the financial institutions that are responsible for its circulation assume the role of the heart," he said. "A partial failure of the financial sector, therefore, might lead to a systemic crisis."
Nonetheless, he left lingering doubts about the Government's ability to swallow the strong medicine of failed banks and falling asset prices that would accompany a banking system overhaul. At a news conference after the speech, Akitaka Saiki, Mr. Obuchi's deputy press secretary, was pressed about whether the Prime Minister would allow insolvent banks to fail. Foreign investors are all but baying for a bank failure as a sign that the Government is serious about cleaning up the system.
"We don't intend to save bad banks," Mr. Saiki said. "They need to take responsibility for their actions."
The only specific long-term goal Mr. Obuchi proposed was to push through measures that would cut the Government payroll by 20 percent over the next decade and cut Government costs by 30 percent, both ideas that have been floated for years.
Mr. Obuchi plans to pay for tax cuts by issuing deficit bonds, a financing technique all but prohibited by last year's Fiscal Structural Reform Act. That law severely limited Mr. Hashimoto's ability to maneuver when the economy started sliding toward recession late last fall, and the Prime Minister said today that he would submit legislation in the fall to suspend that law.
He also proposed a supplemental spending budget of 10 trillion yen, or about $69 billion. That will come on top of 16 trillion yen put together in the spring by Mr. Hashimoto, meaning that Japan will spend more than 4 percent of its gross domestic product this year trying to get its economy going again with public works projects. "This is an amazingly big set of packages by any standards," Professor Takenaka said.
Mr. Saiki, the Prime Minister's spokesman, said Mr. Obuchi intended to spend this money somewhat differently from the way such budgets have been spent in the past, when they largely went to building bridges, transportation facilities and roadways that kept the politically loyal and labor-intensive construction industry afloat when the bubble economy started losing air.
Mr. Obuchi, he added, wants a bigger portion of the new supplemental budget spent on "industries of the future," like medicine and technology.
Those industries are considered the best hope for putting a plug in rising unemployment, which is a source of continuing discomfort for politicians, who consider it a ticking time bomb that could blast them out of office.
But economists see higher unemployment as painful but necessary, for it means companies are trying to increase productivity and profitability, which makes them more competitive globally.
And even Mr. Saiki said that if deregulation proceeded, Japan may face more unemployment in the short term. "The structure of the economy has to be changed," he said.

HEADLINE: Bite-Size Treasury Bills

 BODY:
There is no safer investment than a Treasury bill. But for nearly three decades, the Government has refused to make such safe investments available to those with less than $10,000 to invest. It is good that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has decided to end that practice.
The reasons for discriminating against small investors were never very good, but they vanished years ago. The policy was adopted in 1970 out of fear that small savers would seek the higher yields then available from the Government rather than the lower rates paid by banks and savings and loan associations. The Federal Reserve's infamous Regulation Q in those days limited the rates banks could pay, a move that supposedly kept mortgages affordable but in reality assured that mortgage money would dry up when market interest rates rose. 
 Beginning with next Monday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills, the minimum investment in Treasury bills will be returned to $1,000, where it was before the 1970 change. The minimum for two- and three-year Treasury notes is being reduced from $5,000 to $1,000, which had always been the limit for longer-term Treasuries.
The Treasury also announced improvements in its Treasury Direct program, which lets investors buy securities directly from the Government, avoiding commissions. Beginning next month, investors will be able to buy such securities through the Internet. Telephone purchases will follow.
Once these improvements are up and running, the Treasury should consider reducing the minimum investments for Treasury securities even further, at least to $500 and perhaps lower. There is no reason that such safe investments should be denied to people with relatively little to invest.

HEADLINE: Legal Obstacles Loom for Proposed Indian Casino Near Atlantic City

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
For 20 years, the New Jersey beach resort of Wildwood has been a town seething with envy. As hotels and shops along its boardwalk have tried to survive on the income they made three months out of the year, its more famous neighbor to the north -- Atlantic City -- has used its neon-splashed casinos to become a year-round mecca for tourists.
Now Wildwood is fighting back. 
 On Thursday, Wildwood's City Commissioners voted 2 to 1 to approve the transfer of a 2.5-acre municipal parking lot to the Delaware Tribe of western Oklahoma. In return, the Delawares would operate an Indian casino on the lot.
But this plan would immediately run afoul of Federal laws that give the state a deciding voice in the creation of new Indian land, a Federal Indian Affairs spokesman said yesterday. And Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's administration has been opposed to the city's gambling plan for years.
Undeterred, Mayor Fred Wager of Wildwood said yesterday that he believed the city could skirt the Governor's opposition by limiting the gambling to so-called Class II gaming, which includes bingo and, he said, keno poker and off-track betting.
The Mayor said he hoped that the low-level gambling casino would eventually grow into a full-fledged Class III casino, of the type operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation in Ledyard, Conn.
"We're looking for all of it, but we're willing to start out with a Class II casino, where you have bingo and keno poker and horse racing, and move to a Class III casino later," Mr. Wager said.
He said the city could do this without Federal approval because Class II gambling was not regulated by the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. "As far as our checking into it, we don't need the state or the Federal Government's permission to do that," the Mayor went on. "I don't know if there's a way they can stop us, but the information we have is that we don't need their permission."
However, Rex Hackler, a spokesman for the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, said that Federal rules governing the tribal ownership of land, and not the type of gambling the city envisions, stand in the way of an Indian Casino near the glitter of Atlantic City's 12 gambling palaces.
"Any Indian gaming has to take place on Indian land, and just because the town of Wildwood gave this land to the Delawares does not make it Indian land," Mr. Hackler said.
"Even Class II gaming cannot take place until the Indians have taken the land in trust, which basically means that the Governor must give her blessing."
The Delawares, who were compelled to move to Oklahoma in the last century, signed an agreement with Wildwood in 1995 to operate the casino. Larry Snake, the tribal chairman, said at the time that the tribe had had no plans to operate a casino until Wildwood merchants got in touch with him.
The tribe filed suit for the land in state court in March, citing archeological evidence of Indian habitation near Wildwood. Jeffrey April, the tribe's New Jersey lawyer, said in the spring that the litigation was intended to expedite a casino.
Turning the parking lot over to the Delawares would settle the tribe's claim to all of Wildwood as its ancestral lands. The tribe has not formally agreed to the settlement under which they would get the casino lot and the city's backing for a casino, Mayor Wager said. But, the Mayor noted, the Council still had to take the legal steps authorizing the transfer before a deal could be made.
Mr. April could not be reached by phone yesterday.
The Mayor said the Wildwood casino would not serve alcohol, or offer any dining more lavish than a food court, so that local businesses would benefit directly from the crowds they expect the wished-for casino would draw. Wildwood expects to earn more than $8 million a year in new revenues from the casino, as well as employment for 600 to 1,000 residents -- a lot of jobs for a town of 5,000.
"We're not looking to compete with Atlantic City. We're not looking to put 12 casinos in here, and we're not looking for the high rollers," Mr. Wager said. "We're looking for a family atmosphere."
Under the New Jersey Constitution, casino gambling is legal only in Atlantic City. The Attorney General, Peter G. Verniero, repeated through a spokesman on Thursday that the state was opposed to the creation of an Indian tribal casino at Wildwood.
But State officials were not clear yesterday which state agency, if any, would govern Class II gambling in New Jersey.
Bingo and similar games of chance are regulated by the Department of Consumer Affairs, but a Consumer Affairs spokeswoman said her department oversees only charity games.
Several municipalities and developers across the country have in the past tried to create Indian reservations out of private or municipal land for the purposes of creating a casino, but without success, and the Federal Government has never approved a grant of land to a tribe outside its home state, said Stephanie Hanna, a spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.
"What would have to happen is that they would have to establish reservation land in New Jersey and then enter into a compact with the State of New Jersey for Class III casino gambling," Ms. Hanna said. "There has to be some established legal record that gave them that land."
Moreover, said Mr. Hackler of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, approval to take land in trust in order to create an Indian casino is a rare occurrence, even with full state backing.
"In the entire history of the B.I.A. we have taken only one piece of land into trust for gaming purposes," Mr. Hackler said, "and that was in Duluth, Minn., and that came with the blessing of virtually everybody involved, including the state."
Mr. Hackler said, "We wish the town of Wildwood the best in developing its economy, but it isn't going to happen this way."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Silver Lining in Japan's Debt?;
One Nation's Loss Is Another's Gain

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Norie Nishikawa scans the parking lot and walks into the apartment complex, moving quickly to a mailbox. She pokes the letters she finds there, noting the return addresses, especially the ones from collection agencies, before a building clerk asks her to leave.
Outside, she snaps a roll of pictures and is off, jotting down notes on everything from maintenance problems to hints of the presence of gangsters. 
 Miss Nishikawa and hundreds of brokers like her are working alongside American investment banks to transform Japan's mountain of bad debt and depressed property into an investment opportunity -- and, some experts hope, to reverse Japan's long economic slide.
For investors, acquiring Japan's bad real estate debt is a big gamble even at sale prices, but, if successful, could help shore up the foundations of the Japanese economy and reassure markets around the world.
Essentially, Americans and other foreigners are moving in to buy up "packages" of the bad loans held by Japanese banks, for around 10 cents on the dollar, and then trying to sell the collateral that backed the loans. They either hope to get an immediate profit or else to hold on and enjoy big gains when the property market picks up.
The dividends throughout the economy could be substantial: If foreign investors help increase liquidity in the Japanese property market, the banks could get rid of some of the nation's bad debt -- which is estimated at anywhere from $500 billion to $1 trillion. If property prices turn around, confidence in the economy could soar, and this could put new pressures on yakuza, as Japanese gangsters are called, who have been occupying many properties -- sometimes at the behest of property owners who want to discourage foreclosure.
"The whole economy is frozen because everyone thinks there's a yakuza in every garage," Jack R. Rodman, the national director for Asia at E & Y Leventhal Real Estate, said.
More broadly, investors here and abroad hope that the infusion of interest and cash could bolster the real estate market and help bring about an end to eight years of paralysis in the Japanese economy.
"It's a very active market, a very healthy market," Mr. Rodman said, though one, he added, that is fraught with frustrations.
The Government intends to give the emerging market for bad Japanese debts a push in the fall with a blueprint called the Total Plan that will encourage banks to part with their loans, partly by easing the process for them to sell collateralized properties at the Government auction.
 Friday, Keizo Obuchi, the new Prime Minister, announced a series of measures to stimulate the economy in his first major policy speech since taking office. He proposed tax cuts and public spending to spur the economy in the short term, but offered few details.
Already, over the last 18 months, many foreign companies have flooded into the business of combing the bad debt market and bidding up prices for the depressed land. So far, however, the profits and the number of transactions have been limited and they seem not to have done as well as they expected.
"We came in thinking it was a good business and everyone had their home office calling up and saying why haven't you done a deal yet?" said an American investment banker who is involved in such sales but refused to be identified. "There is no market. These sales don't represent a market."
But whether or not the foreign companies make any money, their activity could still help rescue Japan's troubled economy as they create a new business: wrapping up the bad debt into a tradable security.
Mr. Rodman is helping put the packaged transactions together, advising Japanese banks how to take bad loans, bundle them in groups of up to 300 loans and sell them for a bit of cash and a lot of tax deductions.
Optimists like Mr. Rodman note that the method is similar to the way the United States extricated itself from the savings and loan debacle of the 1980's. One key difference, though, is that the United States Government set up the Resolution Trust Corporation to clean up the crisis in five years, which is about as long as the Japanese have taken just to talk about the idea.
But it is far from clear whether the plan will work as well in Japan as it did in the United States. For starters, Japan's bad loans are worse than America's bad loans were. Japan also is dependent for buyers not on local people -- who generally have not touched the stuff -- but on the fickle appetites of foreigners, mostly Americans.
The bundles of bad Japanese loans have already attracted significant interest: midsized real estate investors, as well as blue-chip names like Merrill Lynch; Goldman, Sachs; Morgan Stanley, and Bankers Trust.
After Japan's bubble economy, which had been built on inflated real estate values, burst in 1990, banks and property owners hung on to bad loans even as prices fell. The entire property market congealed and banks became stuck with bad assets. But they often did not demand repayment for fear of putting their longtime clients into bankruptcy.
"It's a freezing situation that was comfortable to both" the banks and their borrowers, said Kiichi Miyazawa, who was appointed Finance Minister in July and is a former Prime Minister. Mr. Miyazawa added, however, that Japan was now beginning to address the financial crisis.
The recovery of Japan's real estate market is central to the restoration of health of the finance sector and the economy as a whole. But for now, bad loans remain the fundamental source of economic disarray.
Properties in Japan have lost up to 90 percent of their value in some locations, so Japanese banks have been reluctant to sell collateral at cut-rate prices and lock in huge losses, or to turn their backs on long-time clients.
"We're pushing the banks," said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, who resigned recently as parliamentary vice finance minister. "There should be a variety of ways of resolving the bad debt, and the largest part should be through sales, bulk sales or singles sales -- straight sales to the market."
Japanese banks have been selectively selling their collateralized properties at public auctions and private sales, already removing billions of dollars worth of bad loans from their balance sheets. Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper, estimated that the face value of the transactions might have reached $28 billion, and bankers involved in such sales say that estimate is reasonable. If so, the sum is equivalent to nearly one-third of the official accounting of unrecoverable loans.
A typical sale works this way: A Japanese bank assembles a giant package of many bad loans, some backed by collateral properties, some not. The total face value of the package may be worth as much as a few billion dollars, but the bank sells the package to foreign investors at a deep discount, anywhere from 5 percent to 50 percent of the total face value.
Some of the savvier banks first go out and sell the collateralized properties themselves because they think they can get a decent return through the Government auction process or private placements. Then they include these unbacked loans in the package to foreigners free, bundling them along with the collateralized ones, just to sweep the bad debt off the books.
Selling loans can be a messy business because a collateralized property may have as many as 50 liens on it, making it hard for the bank to seize.
And the packaging of the bad debt is a risky undertaking for everyone involved, in part, investors and brokers say, because of the yakuza, the Japanese gangsters who control rackets involved in squatting in troubled properties and small-debt collection, among other activities.
No one wants to knock on the door to collect the rent on a new investment and find the yakuza at home. And while the police may be able to help in pinpointing a yakuza connection to a particular property, they sometimes cannot do much until it's too late; few have forgotten that a Sumitomo Bank executive involved in loan collection was murdered in 1994, and industry executives suspect the yakuza.
Many investment bankers say the yakuza connection is exaggerated and illegal squatting is on the decline because courts are starting to crack down.
Still, one of the most pressing questions on the mind of every investor is whether a given piece of property is somehow linked to the yakuza.
That is where Miss Nishikawa comes in. Her company copies the auction listings from dog-eared postings at the Tokyo courthouse, where real estate auctions are held, and she and her colleagues dash off to check out the properties and draw up a report for customers looking to buy homes or buildings on the cheap.
"Many people might have the image that this kind of property is involved in the cleanup of unhappy problems," said Takami Toriya, a board director at the Tokyo Auction Forum Company, which brokers properties sold at the Government's auction. "But there are good properties at any auction. We opened this place in central Tokyo to try to remove this dark, dangerous and fearsome image."
The problem arises because companies that own real estate with bubble-sized loans sometimes pay for the yakuza or other gangsters to squat on the property on the theory that they will dissuade the bank from foreclosing and make the property impossible to sell, according to experts in Japanese real estate.
"If a bank initiates a foreclosing and tries to evict a tenant or a loan shark, sometimes trouble happens," said Shoichi Honda, executive vice president at Kennedy-Wilson International, which helps evaluate mob connections when it appraises properties for investors. "When we checked one portfolio, we found 15 percent of the property contaminated."
One owner of a real estate company, who purchased a collateralized property at a Government auction, acknowledged that he had to call in mob affiliates to evict squatters in a building he bought.
"The properties put on auction are not such good quality," said the real estate executive, who refused to be identified. "They've got all kinds of dirty connections. In some cases, the houses are built illegally."
That presents another impediment to investors. For example, if buildings were constructed illegally, without access to the street, new investors may not get a local license to demolish and rebuild. "These properties," the real estate executive added, "are actually just trash."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stocks Gain, But It's Too Early to Cheer

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market rallied for a third day yesterday as investors bought stocks whose prices had been pummeled during, and even before, the headline-grabbing selloff that began in mid-July.
But even with the three-day rally, the major market measures still ended the week down sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 3.2 percent and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks down 2.8 percent. 
 "There are too many concerns around this market," said Marshall Acuff, an equity strategist with Salomon Smith Barney. "The market is going to remain volatile until they are all worked out."
The buying of battered stocks kept the technology-heavy Nasdaq index and the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks well above water, but still off their highs for the day. The Nasdaq finished up 17.26 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 1,846.77, while the Russell ended at 415.80, up 9.18, or 2.3 percent. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners, 2 to 1, another positive turn for the market.
But the way the Dow and the S.& P. gave up their gains in afternoon trading was a signal of continued volatility -- and continuing investor concern. It seemed that after a turbulent week, in which the Dow suffered its third-worst one-day point decline ever, investors were just tired or wanted to take what profits they could from the rally.
"That is another sign that the blue chips have further to decline," said Ralph J. Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential Securities, whose sudden switch to bearishness on Tuesday helped knock the Dow down 299.43 points.
The Dow and the S.& P. index, which are dominated by the bigger-company stocks that many investors now feel are overpriced, sank into negative territory in the afternoon. The Dow struggled back to finish up 20.34 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, at 8,598.02. It had been up 112 points. The S.& P. ended off 0.18 point at 1,089.45, after hitting 1,102.54.
Yesterday's early rally was helped by an apparently favorable July jobs report. Despite the distortions from the nearly eight-week strike against General Motors, the data showed that the domestic economy, especially the service sector, was still quite robust.
But there were still reminders of the worries that helped send the Dow industrials down 9.1 percent before the end-of-the-week rally. The drag on American exports and manufacturing from the economic crisis in Asia was reflected in the generally weak increase of 66,000 nonfarm jobs last month.
And as the stock market was rallying, the Japanese yen tumbled and is now weaker than it was when the United States and Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the currency in mid-June.
The renewed weakness in the yen is a result of the lack of confidence in the new Japanese Government's ability to turn the nation's economy around, a necessary ingredient in any economic rebound across Asia. The first policy statement of the new Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi, to Parliament yesterday just added to the disappointment.
"The market has tried to shrug off Asia, but I think the problems there are getting worse," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "Japan is becoming a modern macroeconomic policy makers' nightmare."
Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, was more confident about the economic outlook. "When you look at the core forces underlying the market, they remain in good working order," he said. "So the sky is not falling."
The role battered stocks have played in the market rebound the last three days can be seen in the performance of the semiconductor industry, oil stocks and smaller-company stocks.
Worries about demand from Asia and climbing inventories had sent semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola and Teradyne tumbling. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which also includes Intel, had fallen 29.5 percent from its February high to its low on June 15. But in the last three days the index is up 8.8 percent.
Oil stocks had also been off sharply as the price of oil plunged. The Philadelphia oil service index, which includes Halliburton and Schlumberger, dropped 48.5 percent from May 1 to Wednesday. But on Thursday and yesterday, the index jumped 7.8 percent. The Standard & Poor's index of major oil companies, including Exxon and Chevron, rose 3.3 percent yesterday after falling 16.8 percent since May 1.
Lastly, the Russell index of smaller-company stocks had fallen almost 19 percent from its high in April to a 1998 low on Wednesday. But in the last two days it jumped 4.3 percent.
In the bond market, the jobs and wage data in the July employment report did not upset investors because it supported the view that the Federal Reserve, whose policy-making committee meets on Aug. 18, will leave interest rates unchanged.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 20/32 , to 107 4/32 , while the bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.63 percent, from 5.67 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Vacco Says Man Led Ring In Illegal Sale Of Medicines

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
A Bronx man who is suspected of leading one of the largest black-market prescription drug operations in the state was indicted yesterday after more than $1 million worth of prescription medicine was found in his apartment, the authorities said.
The suspect, Elvin Mendez, 27, is accused of running the operation by buying prescription drugs from street-level dealers, stockpiling them and reselling large quantities to middlemen who then sold them to pharmacies throughout the nation. 
 The street-level dealers typically either bought the drugs from Medicaid patients for a fraction of their cost, stole the drugs from hospitals or clinics, or enlisted the help of medical professionals who could write and fill prescriptions, the authorities said.
Mr. Mendez was indicted after a six-month investigation in which investigators said they found plastic bags stuffed with AZT, the expensive AIDS medication, and other drugs at his Bronx apartment last spring. Investigators from State Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco's Medicaid fraud unit also found a large number of empty prescription bottles, counterfeit drug manufacturers' labels, seals and packaging inserts, the Attorney General's office said.
Mr. Mendez is charged with one count of criminal diversion of prescription medications and prescriptions in the second degree, a felony, and faces up to seven years in prison if he is convicted. He was arraigned in State Supreme Court in the Bronx and was being held in $50,000 bail. Mr. Mendez has pleaded not guilty.
"This increasingly common scam, known as drug diversion, costs taxpayers millions of dollars," Mr. Vacco said, "and also potentially places the public at great risk because the drugs that are diverted from regulated channels of distribution are often expired, mishandled and potentially unsafe."
Mr. Mendez is accused of paying only a fraction of the cost for powerful drugs. Among the drugs the authorities said they found were Invirase and Viracept, two AIDS medications; Biaxin, an antibiotic; Procardia, a heart medication; Prozac, an antidepressant, and Proventil, an asthma drug.
Pointing to inconsistencies in the laws for such offenses, Mr. Vacco has proposed stiffer penalties for drug diversion. "A drug diverter who is caught selling a $1,100 bottle of medication would be slapped with a felony," he said. But if Mr. Mendez had been prosecuted solely for the $1 million worth of prescription drugs stashed in his apartment, he would have been subject to only a misdemeanor charge, Mr. Vacco said.
Most prescription medications that are diverted through the black market end up on the shelves of pharmacies, Mr. Vacco said.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Motives For the Bombing

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
It is still unclear who is behind the evil bombing attacks against two U.S. embassies in Africa, but if you want to speculate here are some things to consider:
First, the targets -- Nairobi and Dar es Salaam -- were most likely chosen because these were soft locations, with open borders and lax police, where perpetrators could easily smuggle in explosives, assemble car bombs and detonate them without fear of detection. To pull off nearly simultaneous bombings, outside U.S. embassies in two different African countries, is not something your local terrorists are likely to be capable of. This usually requires at least the help of a state intelligence service, with access to safe houses, bomb-making techniques and diplomatic pouches. 
 Which countries or groups might have the capabilities and intentions to pull off such a twin attack?
Iran: Anyone who is following Iranian politics can see that there is a civil war going on inside Iran, between hard-line fundamentalists associated with Iran's spiritual guide, Ali Khamenei, and moderates aligned with President Mohammad Khatami. Although Mr. Khatami is President, Iran's intelligence services -- which are suspected of involvement in previous bombings against Jewish targets in Argentina and U.S. targets in the Middle East -- are still under the control of Ayatollah Khamenei and the hard-liners.
The White House has recently made important overtures to President Khatami and the moderates to see if it is possible to forge a new relationship, which Mr. Khatami himself has encouraged. The Iranian hard-liners are not pleased with this, and they are trying to undermine Mr. Khatami and his allies every way they can. The Iranian hard-liners may believe that the best way to kill any budding rapprochement between Iran and the U.S. is by killing Americans. Indeed, you can be sure that the closer the U.S. and Iran inch toward better relations, the more the hard-core, anti-American Iranian forces will do things to rupture them.
Iraq: Iraq too would have the capabilities and intentions to hit U.S. targets. It's hard to see why Iraq, when it's desperate to get the U.N. economic sanctions lifted, would undertake such an egregious attack on the U.S., which could only set back the lifting of sanctions indefinitely. But when it comes to Saddam Hussein, any perverse logic is possible.
A new Ramzi Yousef: Ramzi Yousef and his gang were sophisticated enough to pull off the 1993 truck bomb attack on the World Trade Center in Manhattan, which killed 6 people and injured more than 1,000. Mr. Yousef, a native of Pakistan, was not a country or a superpower. He was a super-empowered angry man. He had no particular ideology or political goals. He just hated America. He felt the U.S. was hostile to Muslims, and his goal was simply to kill as many Americans as possible.
There are more than a few Ramzi Yousefs still out there. They hate America because it is the most powerful country in the world, because they feel it throws its economic weight around with great arrogance and because its cultural exports uproot their traditional societies. They use the best of today's modern technology for the most evil of deeds. One reason Ramzi Yousef was caught was because police found his Toshiba laptop computer in his Manila apartment where all his plots were filed on the hard drive.
For now one can draw only a couple of conclusions. One is that the U.S. pays a price for letting things like the Khobar Towers bombing go without retaliation. Khobar Towers was the U.S. military apartment building in Saudi Arabia where a huge truck bomb exploded June 25, 1996, killing 19 Americans. The Saudis have never turned over all the evidence because some of it reveals links to Iran. The Saudis didn't want the U.S. retaliating against Iran and then leaving Saudi Arabia to absorb the counterstrike. The White House basically bowed to Saudi wishes. But when people think they can attack the U.S. with impunity, they will be tempted to try again.
The other conclusion is that if the U.S. is compelled to retaliate, the Monica Lewinsky affair can only complicate matters. Every foreign or domestic actor who is looking for excuses to oppose any U.S. retaliation in this case will say that President Clinton is only acting to distract attention from his embarrassing entanglements, and that will make building diplomatic support more difficult. Just one more reason it was so reckless for the Commander in Chief to be involved in any sort of improper relationship in the Oval Office.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Slowed a Bit in July But Still Kept to a Vigorous Pace

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
The economy created jobs at a slower but still robust pace last month, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent, the Labor Department reported today. Continued strong employment growth in service industries more than offset the damage that Asia's woes are inflicting on manufacturers.
Employers added 66,000 jobs to their payrolls in July, the lowest monthly figure in two and a half years. But the number was distorted by the strike against General Motors, which was settled late in the month after idling nearly 200,000 workers. 
 Economists said that without the temporary effects of the G.M. strike, the payroll increase would have been more than 200,000, a slight slowdown from the pace of job creation earlier in the year.
The figures provided further, but by no means definitive, evidence that the economy may be gradually cooling off, reducing concerns about inflation without raising any serious risk of recession.
Coming after a sharp selloff in stocks on Tuesday and several subsequent days of sweaty palms on Wall Street, the report reassured investors that the economy remained basically stable despite the confusing and sometimes conflicting forces, from Asia's downturn to the buoyancy of consumer spending, that have left the outlook unsettled.
After gaining as much as 132 points today, the Dow Jones industrial average fell back in late trading and closed up 20.34 points at 8,598.02.
"We're moving toward a desirable soft landing, but we're not quite there yet," said M. Cary Leahey, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm.
During the first half of the year, the economy added an average of 245,000 nonfarm jobs a month, raising concern that employers would have to bid up wages to attract workers, setting off an inflationary spiral.
Mr. Leahey said that July's underlying gain of about 207,000 jobs was consistent with an economy growing at 2.5 percent to 3 percent a year, still high enough at the current low unemployment rate to make inflation a threat, at least in the view of many Federal Reserve officials.
To bring growth within the Fed's noninflationary "speed limit" of about 2.25 percent would require that job gains decelerate to around 150,000 a month, Mr. Leahey said.
Although the economy slowed to a 1.4 percent growth rate in the second quarter from 5.5 percent in the first three months of the year, most economists see growth in the second half of the year running at an annual pace of 2 percent to 3 percent.
The most striking aspect of the report was the wide gulf between the strong growth in consumer-oriented service jobs, especially retailing, and the slide in employment among manufacturers, which are having trouble exporting to Asia and are facing increasing competition from imports from that part of the world.
Service industries created 229,000 jobs during the month, including 125,000 in retailing. Manufacturers, on the other hand, shed 176,000 jobs during the month, including those lost temporarily to the G.M. strike. Even after adjusting for the effects of the strike, the manufacturing loss was about 20,000 jobs in July, in line with the scale of the manufacturing downturn throughout most of this year. Last year, manufacturers added an average of 20,000 jobs a month.
"Manufacturing and services are in two different worlds," said Cliff Waldman, an economist with the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
The report showed that wage gains appeared to be moderating or holding steady. Average hourly earnings in July increased 3 cents, or two-tenths of a percent, to $12.79, although the gain might have been slightly greater in the absence of the G.M. strike.
Over the last 12 months, earnings have increased at a 4.2 percent annual pace, matching the pace over the 12 months ended in June and slightly lower than the annual pace in April and May.
The Federal Reserve has been looking intently for signs of inflation since March but has not raised interest rates, because there is little evidence that inflation is taking root and also because any rate increase could further destabilize the already-shaky financial markets in Asia. Today's report is unlikely to lead the Fed to change its stance at its next meeting, on Aug. 18, analysts said.
They added that Fed officials were sure to track closely the tug-of-war between those sectors of the economy that are being hit by the combination of the strong dollar and Asia's difficulties and those being driven by consumer confidence and a willingness to spend.
The Fed reported today that consumer installment credit in June jumped $6.7 billion -- a 6.4 percent annual growth rate -- indicating that consumers remained willing to borrow to continue their long spending spree.
Some analysts think consumers are about to become more cautious, reflecting the slowdown in wage growth and record-low savings. But others see few signs of consumer moderation and think service-sector job growth will continue to put pressure on wages even as manufacturing shrinks.
Today's job report "indicates only the most minor slowdown in labor demand, almost exclusively in the manufacturing sector," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist with HSBC Securities. "There is nothing in this report to support the idea that a wider slowdown is gathering pace."

HEADLINE: G.M. Marketing Chief Glum In Assessing Strike Damage

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug. 7

 BODY:
The nearly eight-week-long strike this summer at two General Motors parts factories will continue to hurt the auto maker's sales until October, and some customers have been permanently lost, G.M.'s top marketing executive said here today.
In the gloomiest assessment yet of the strike's damage, Ronald L. Zarrella, the group vice president for North American sales, service and marketing, said that G.M. dealerships would not be fully restocked until mid-September. The introduction of some 1999 models will also be delayed, he said, because G.M. has so many parts left over for 1998 models that it is cheaper for the company to keep building those models instead of discarding the parts. 
 The company will run new advertisements this weekend that will emphasize that the auto maker is back in business and that 1998 cars and trucks are available at discounts that reflect the end of the model year, Mr. Zarrella said. But G.M.'s market share, usually about 31 percent, will be below 25 percent in August and will not rebound fully until October, he said.
Without giving a number, Mr. Zarrella said some longtime customers had decided to buy cars and trucks from competitors and would be hard to woo back. Each percentage point of market share is worth 150,000 cars and trucks a year, or $3 billion in annual sales.
Susan G. Jacobs, an automotive consultant in Rutherford, N.J., said that General Motors' permanent loss might be as high as one and a half percentage points because the strike slowed its introduction of several completely new car and truck models. But G.M. executives may benefit from highlighting the strike's harm, she said.
"They can refer to the long strike as derailing them from staying over 30" percent, a convenient excuse for declining market share, she said.
Wall Street's assessment of the strike's costs grew steadily grimmer this week, and the company's share price drifted down despite G.M.'s announcement of several initiatives long sought by institutional investors, including a spinoff of the auto parts subsidiary and a consolidation of marketing operations. Shares rebounded to $72.50 during the day today, from $70.25 on Thursday, but then gave back some of the gain after Mr. Zarrella's disclosures at a midday news conference at the University of Michigan's annual auto industry conference here. The stock closed up 81.25 cents a share at $71.0625.
G.M. announced on Wednesday that its sales dropped 37.7 percent in July compared with July 1997. Its market share was just 21.1 percent.
In a typical year, many G.M. factories would be closed by now to install new equipment for the production of the next model year's cars and trucks. The new models would then go on sale in late September and early October.
But Mr. Zarrella said the company had continued to produce 1998 models since the strike ended on July 29. It still has 1998 model-year parts for 200,000 more cars and trucks, or about two weeks of production. The company will use up these parts before converting production to the 1999 model year, he said.
Auto makers have traditionally introduced their new models at the same time because of a belief that laggards could lose sales to companies that move faster. But Mr. Zarrella said it was not clear whether G.M. would suffer this autumn by offering a mix of 1998 and 1999 models even as other auto makers have ample supplies of 1999 models.
Wall Street analysts estimate that the strike cost G.M. $12 billion in lost production and $3 billion in lost after-tax profits. Until this week, some analysts thought G.M. would be able to recover most of the lost profits by running its factories around the clock for the rest of the year.
But John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said on Wednesday that even with extra production through the rest of the year, the auto maker's permanent loss would be about $2 billion.
"We ran into a buzz saw in the strike," Mr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
Illegal Smoke For the 90's, From Cuba

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
LAST night, on Day 3 of the great Federal crackdown against Manhattan's outlaw Cuban cigar aficionados, a cigar bar seemed just the place to puff awhile and wait for the smoke to clear.
"Dragging those people off just for smoking Cubans, it's absurd," said John McFadden, an investment banker who was savoring an Astral cigar and gesturing in the general direction of his companion, Joseph Avantario. 
 "This whole Cuban thing was topic one at lunch today," said Mr. Avantario, lighting up another of Mr. McFadden's Astrals. "Just about every U.S. Senator smokes Cuban cigars. So why not go after them?"
They were enjoying a predinner puff last night with a friend, Janine Johnson, in the Cigar Bar at Carnegie Bar and Books at 156 West 56th Street, a cynosure of the smokily comfortable, clubby little world of the upscale Manhattan cigar worshipper.
True, it was the Friday night kickoff to a summer weekend, and many high-end cigarophiles had already headed for the Hamptons or were firing up entirely legal Cuban Cohibas in the hills of Tuscany.
But in New York, 35 diehards were breathing cigar smoke, sipping cocktails and listening to light jazz in the mahogany-and-maroon bar, with its bronze chandeliers and showcases filled with Partagas, H. Upmann and Dunhill cigars.
Subi Gurge, a financial consultant, was puffing a Honduran Padron as he sat with 11 colleagues under the bar's ornate stairway. He was ruminating annoyedly about "that ridiculous embargo against Castro."
"The rest of the world doesn't support it," he said, "and it isn't effective anyway."
Last night, most of the smokers said they were well aware of the news that on Wednesday, Federal officials charged the operators of an upscale restaurant and a private club in Manhattan with illicitly selling Cuban cigars to customers.
Federal agents with search warrants seized hundreds of boxes of cigars from the humidors of the Patroon restaurant on East 46th Street and the Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue. On Thursday, prosecutors charged four investors and businessmen, including two chief executives, with buying contraband Cubans.
Yesterday, two more cigar smokers were drawn into the Federal investigation, bringing to nine those arrested. Michael Dana, 38, a managing director in the investment banking division at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, and Jeffrey Kelter, 44, president of a real-estate investment company in suburban Philadelphia, were arraigned in Manhattan Federal Court and released on their own recognizance.
"The enforcement seems so selective," Ms. Johnson said. "Why single these people out from all the people who have Cuban cigars?"
FEDERAL officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said high-profile Cuban cigar prosecutions were a deterrent that not only responded to violations of Federal law (since owning them is a felony), but also supported United States foreign policy and helped to deny economic benefits to Cuba, since the state manages cigar production.
One of Mr. Gurge's colleagues, who gave his name only as Eric, said: "Americans shouldn't smoke Cubans because that's supporting the Cuban Government," he said. "And they're evading paying taxes."
But Mr. Avantario, an investment banker who lives in Chappaqua, N.Y., said Cuban Cohibas, Montecristos and Romeo Y Julietas are ubiquitous. "If you want them, you can get them," he said. "They even hide them under the ribbons of Dominican cigars."
Only a few in the bar would admit to having gone Cuban. "I did have one Cuban cigar," said Peter Genet, a real-estate consultant, "but I didn't inhale."
His companions in the book nook near the door, Robert and Marie Guarnieri, rolled their eyes as they laughed. "I had my first and only Cuban cigar on my wedding night in Sweden," said Mr. Guarnieri, a technology consultant who lives in Manhattan.
"And that was legal!" Mrs. Guarnieri said.
At the ornate mahogany bar, Eric Lightner, the manager, explained to a visitor that "people ask all the time for Cubans," he said. "What we tell them is the truth. We don't have them."
However, "many customers come in with their own Cubans to smoke them here," said Tara Oniki, the cocktail waitress. "They aren't worried by all this. They don't take this seriously. In fact, the only reason they smoke Cubans is for show. You know why I think they smoke them? Because they're illegal."

HEADLINE: Rent Deregulation Has Risen Sharply Under 1997 Law

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Since New York lawmakers scaled back rent regulations last summer, at least three times the number of apartments in New York City have been deregulated under the new laws as under the old ones, a new study has determined.
The rise -- from 1,000 a year to more than 3,500 -- has occurred almost exclusively in Manhattan, the study found, and is higher than either landlords or tenant groups predicted during the wrenching battle over rent laws. And it indicates that with the economy booming and real estate prices soaring, landlords in prime neighborhoods have taken full advantage of measures they won in Albany to bring about deregulation by increasing rents sharply when some apartments turn over. 
 Under the new laws, landlords were allowed to increase rents on vacant units by 20 percent, and all regulations were lifted when, upon vacancy, the rent rose beyond $2,000.
The survey by the city's Rent Guidelines Board, the first detailed look at the city's housing market since the new laws were passed, also found that while rents had risen steeply for newly occupied apartments south of 96th Street in Manhattan, the new laws appeared to have had only a small impact elsewhere, as many economists predicted.
"This really is a tale of two cities," said Edward S. Hochman, chairman of the rent board. "What it shows is that in many parts of the city, regulated rents already may be at or approaching market levels."
From June 1997 to last March, when the study was conducted, the median increase for newly rented apartments protected by rent laws in so-called core Manhattan was 21 percent, far outstripping an estimated 12 percent rise the year before the changes. Citywide, the increase was 12 percent, after an 8 percent increase the previous year.
For example, an average renter south of 96th Street whose old rent was $1,500, paid $1,815 after moving. Citywide, using the same example, the average renter paid $1,680 for a new lease.
In the Bronx, by comparison, such rents rose by an average of 5 percent, the same as the year before; in Queens, rents rose 8 percent, after a 5 percent increase the previous year.
But the study warns that even though increases remained relatively stable outside Manhattan, working-class and poor families appear to be having a harder time finding apartments they can afford.
For those earning the median income for families in rent-stabilized housing, $26,797, about 39 percent of newly occupied apartments were considered affordable. A year ago, half the newly occupied apartments were considered affordable, which, according to the Government, means that the family paid 30 percent of its income or less for the apartment.
And advocates for tenants warn that the problem will grow more severe more quickly as a result of less stringent rent protections. "Even though you may not be seeing bigger increases immediately in those neighborhoods, it is going to happen," said Michael McKee, policy director for the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, "because people will be priced out of part of the city and pressures will grow in other neighborhoods."
But some landlords contend that the survey is the first clear demonstration that only Manhattan is truly affected by rent protections. In most other neighborhoods, they say, market forces already prevail and rents will rise at slow, predictable rates, while landlords will continue to be burdened with the bureaucracy of rent regulations.
"What this says is that the whole angry debate last year was a waste of time," said Dan Margulies, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade association for apartment building owners. "Things have changed very little for most owners."
The quickened pace of deregulation is what the city's larger landlords had most hoped for with the passage of the new laws. The survey estimates that 3,500 to 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments, nearly all in Manhattan south of 96th Street, crossed the $2,000 threshold and were deregulated in the year after the laws went into effect on June 15, 1997. By comparison, 1,000 apartments a year lost rent protections under the previous law. During the debate in Albany over the rent laws many and landlords and tenant groups had predicted that the changes would cause the pace of deregulation to double.
The survey estimated that about 9 percent of the stabilized apartments that became vacant in the lower half of Manhattan in the year after the new laws went into effect became deregulated, representing 1 to 2 percent of all the stabilized units there, roughly 264,000.
The survey -- which made citywide projections based on information collected from nearly 2,300 renters who had moved since the new laws went into effect -- suggests that landlords in sought-after neighborhoods moved quickly last June to take advantage of a combination of tools given to them to raise rents when apartments became vacant.
The most powerful tool allows landlords to raise rents by up to 20 percent after a vacancy. The vacancy bonus was one of the most significant changes in two decades to the rent-stabilization system, which governs rents for about a million apartments, nearly all in New York City.
Under the new laws, the rent can also be increased if the previous tenant's rent was lower than $500 or if the tenant lived there for many years, meaning the rent was kept unusually low because the landlord was not allowed vacancy increases.
For example, if the previous tenant lived in an apartment 20 years, the landlord is allowed a 12 percent increase, plus the 20 percent vacancy bonus. Landlords can also add a portion to the rent if they renovate an apartment.
The survey found that landlords put these measures to the greatest use on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side, where two-thirds of the deregulated apartments were. The remainder were largely on the East Side of Manhattan in neighborhoods like Gramercy Park, Turtle Bay and Sutton Place.
In the last two months, the survey itself became the subject of legal and political wrangling after Mr. Hochman, the board chairman, refused to release it, saying it was flawed. When the survey was first completed in late May, it used stabilized rent figures from 1996, before the Legislature changed the laws, instead of those from last year, to gauge the rent increases.
When more recent numbers were made available last month by state housing officials, the board's staff revised the report and mailed out copies of the new version to board members yesterday.
Two rent board members who represent tenants accused Mr. Hochman, an appointee of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, of trying to suppress the original report because it could show dramatic rent increases in some parts of the city.
The board members, Kenneth Rosenfeld and David Pagan, went to court, and a State Supreme Court justice, Louis B. York, recently ordered the original report released. But the city has not released it, and lawyers for the board members returned to court this week to seek a finding of contempt in the case.

Marketing Chief of G.M. Gives Gloomy Assessment
The strike this summer at two General Motors parts factories will continue to hurt the auto maker's sales until October, and some customers have been permanently lost, G.M.'s top marketing executive said. 
 In a gloomy assessment of the strike's damage, Ronald L. Zarrella, the group vice president for North American sales, service and marketing, said dealerships would not be restocked until mid-September. The rollout of some 1999 models will also be delayed because G.M. has so many parts left over for 1998 models that it is cheaper to keep building them instead of discarding parts. Page D2.

Ex-E.D.S. Chief to Get $38.6 Million
Electronic Data Systems in Plano, Tex., said that the retirement of Lester M. Alberthal Jr. as chairman and chief executive would cost the company $38.6 million in benefits. Shares of E.D.S. rose 14 percent. Mr. Alberthal announced his retirement after the stock market closed on Thursday under pressure from board members and shareholders dismayed by the company's loss of its former leadership in computer services.

Worldcom Expects MCI Charges
Worldcom expects to take charges of $6 billion to $7 billion in connection with its $37 billion purchase of MCI Communications, and other big one-time costs could follow as the company contemplates a reorganization. D3.
 
Drug Wholesalers End Deals
The nation's four biggest drug wholesalers abandoned plans to merge into two companies. The collapse of the deals -- Cardinal Health's $2.8 billion acquisition of Bergen Brunswig and McKesson's $2.3 billion purchase of Amerisource Health -- had been expected since regulators opposed the mergers, saying that they would hurt competition.

Crescent Real Estate Equities, the real estate investment trust controlled by Richard Rainwater, has canceled a planned $1.7 billion acquisition of Station Casinos. D3.
 
Vietnam Devalues Its Currency
Vietnam, as expected, devalued its currency, the third such move since the Asian financial crisis took hold more than a year ago. The Government has been under pressure to open its markets and to devalue the currency, the dong, to bolster export-dependent industries, especially after nine months of bad weather hit crops especially hard.

At Least 80 Are Killed In East African Blasts
Bombs exploded outside the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing at least 80 people, 8 of them Americans, in what appeared to be coordinated terrorist attacks. In Washington, President Clinton condemned the attacks as abhorrent, and he vowed to bring those responsible to justice "no matter what or how long it takes." A1 

Clinton Administration officials said that while no one took responsibility for the bombings, they were probably carried out by one of a small number of terrorist groups that have attacked American installations in the past. A1
 
The two bombed embassy buildings did not meet security standards ordered for the State Department's overseas posts after separate terrorist attacks in Beirut in the early 1980's against the American Embassy and the marine barracks, American officials acknowledged. A1
 
Push for Iraqi Compliance
Diplomats from member nations of the Security Council said that countries friendly to Iraq were being asked to try to persuade the Government of Saddam Hussein to cooperate with arms inspectors in return for a new hearing of the Iraqi case in New York. A4
 
Kabila Seeks Region's Help
The Congolese President, Laurent Kabila, went to the provincial city of Lubumbashi to meet with senior South Africans and then to Zimbabwe to ask a group of regional leaders for help in pressing Rwanda to end its support of a rebellion against Mr. Kabila's Government. A3
 
Rwandan Ordered to Surrender
A Federal District Court judge in Texas has ordered a Rwandan who was indicted for genocide in Africa but who is living in the United States to surrender to an international war crimes tribunal for Rwanda. The Rwandan, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, has 30 days to appeal the order. A3
 
Israeli-Vatican Dispute
The Vatican rebuffed Israeli efforts to block the appointment of a Palestinian Archbishop in Galilee, stating that such nominations "are the reserve of the Pope in the exercise of his supreme power." It was the first open confrontation between the Holy See and Israel since they established diplomatic relations in 1994. A4
 
Colombian Takes Office
Andres Pastrana, a Conservative who is planning peace talks with leftist rebels who have been battering Government forces, took office as President in Colombia, ending the fractious, scandal-ridden presidency of Ernesto Samper with a promise of change. A2
 
Big Flood in China Reported
Thousands of people were missing after a major breach of a Yangtze River dike unleashed a deluge that submerged part of the eastern city of Jiujiang today, a Chinese journalist reported by telephone from the city. (Agence France-Presse)

Federal Judge Finds Starr May Have Broken Rules
A Federal judge has found that prosecutors investigating President Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky may have violated Federal rules by providing grand jury testimony to journalists, and that the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr may have broken the ethical code governing criminal investigations in his remarks to reporters. A1
 
A Faster Road to Citizenship
The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced a series of measures that officials said would cut in half the time that immigrants must wait to become citizens. A12
 
Vote to Bar Gay Adoptions
The House approved an amendment that would bar adoptions by gay couples in the District of Columbia. President Clinton said the measure was an unacceptable intrusion into local control, and advisers recommended that he veto any bill that included it. The Senate is not expected to approve the amendment. A12

SYQUEST TECHNOLOGY TOCUT 50% OF STAFF

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Syquest Technology Inc., the long-struggling disk-drive maker, said yesterday that it would cut about 50 percent of its staff in a sweeping restructuring seen as a last-ditch bid to stay afloat. The company, which makes removable disk drives and cartridges, will cut 950 jobs and close a manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif. It will also adopt other cost controls at its plant in Malaysia. Syquest said the moves should cut its expenses in half and bring costs more in line with its market size. Syquest, which is based in Fremont, has been in a restructuring mode for two years. Once nearly bankrupt, Syquest has fought a pitched battle with the rival Iomega Corporation for sales in the removable disk-drive market.

CONFRONTING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
Devastation, Hope,
 and Healing.
 By William J. Winslade.
 220 pp. New Haven:
 Yale University Press. $27.50. 
 Five months after a car crash that nearly killed him, James Blakely gradually emerged from a coma and slowly re-learned to speak, read, work a computer and get around in a wheelchair. But his astounding recovery masked the fact that his brain injury had changed him in profound and surprising ways. A special-education teacher for the Tucson, Ariz., public schools, Blakely had successfully juggled his teaching job with work on a doctorate in education. Three years after the accident, in the kind of erratic behavior that had become common to him, he telephoned the police one morning to report a lost cereal bowl.
The long journey back from brain trauma is the focus of this powerful book. William J. Winslade, a bioethicist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, captures our attention by making it clear that the horror stories he relates can just as easily cleave our own lives -- or the life of someone we love -- indelibly into before and after. Today, medical heroics can bring back shattered bodies from the brink of death, leaving devastated accident victims in vegetative comas for months, their relatives sitting in anguished vigil. Often people find hope in the unlikeliest of places. Take the grasping reflex, for instance: when an adult responds to something touching his palm with an infantile curl of the hand, it signifies profound brain damage. But if the hand you're holding is your comatose son's or daughter's, Winslade writes in "Confronting Traumatic Brain Injury," it is "comforting to interpret this very negative symptom as a positive responsive squeeze."
Even a mild concussion can have surprisingly long-term consequences, and, like James Blakely, most victims of serious brain injury will never be the same again. Of the two million victims of brain trauma in the United States every year, the majority of them young people on the threshold of the rest of their lives, some 90,000 require extensive rehabilitation and never fully recover. A significant proportion -- the numbers are hard to come by -- go on to live blighted half lives for which the victims and their families pay dearly in terms of expenses, lost opportunities and dashed hopes for the future.
"The average victim of severe brain trauma who is fortunate enough to survive and regain consciousness faces five to 10 years of demanding, expensive, often frustrating rehabilitation," Winslade writes. "Even that investment carries no guarantee of ultimately achieving independence, much less complete recovery." Those who recover physically and intellectually might suffer changes in personality, attention span, memory, judgment or sense of humor that are almost as debilitating for being so subtle and unexpected. Winslade recommends, among other things, mandatory set-asides of taxes on cars, guns and alcohol, and surcharges on fines for driving under the influence and other moving violations. These funds could be used to provide high-quality rehabilitative services regardless of an individual's ability to pay. Such services can cost as much as $4 million over a patient's lifetime, wiping out a family's resources in a matter of months. He also urges more stringent enforcement of seat-belt and motorcycle-helmet laws, and a new look at whether people in persistent vegetative states should be kept alive indefinitely just because it is medically possible.
Winslade sees the epidemic of traumatic brain injury as a public health catastrophe. And he sees our collective response to it as a moral challenge. "We have to do more than pay the cost," he writes. "We have to retool our culture. We need to nurture rather than deny our impulses toward empathy, compassion and fairness and restore these virtues as central values in our society." To do otherwise, he says, will lead to economic and emotional costs that "will drive us not just to bankruptcy but to despair."

HEADLINE: The Carver Chronicles

BYLINE: By D.T. Max; D.T. Max, a contributing editor at The Paris Review, last wrote for the magazine about the novelist Terry McMillan.

 BODY:
For much of the past 20 years, Gordon Lish, an editor at Esquire and then at Alfred A. Knopf who is now retired, has been quietly telling friends that he played a crucial role in the creation of the early short stories of Raymond Carver. The details varied from telling to telling, but the basic idea was that he had changed some of the stories so much that they were more his than Carver's. No one quite knew what to make of his statements. Carver, who died 10 years ago this month, never responded in public to them. Basically it was Lish's word against common sense. Lish had written fiction, too: If he was such a great talent, why did so few people care about his own work? As the years passed, Lish became reluctant to discuss the subject. Maybe he was choosing silence over people's doubt. Maybe he had rethought what his contribution had been -- or simply moved on.
Seven years ago, Lish arranged for the sale of his papers to the Lilly Library at Indiana University. Since then, only a few Carver scholars have examined the Lish manuscripts thoroughly. When one tried to publish his conclusions, Carver's widow and literary executor, the poet Tess Gallagher, effectively blocked him with copyright cautions and pressure. I'd heard about this scholar's work (and its failure to be published) through a friend. So I decided to visit the archive myself. 
 What I found there, when I began looking at the manuscripts of stories like "Fat" and "Tell the Women We're Going," were pages full of editorial marks -- strikeouts, additions and marginal comments in Lish's sprawling handwriting. It looked as if a temperamental 7-year-old had somehow got hold of the stories. As I was reading, one of the archivists came over. I thought she was going to reprimand me for some violation of the library rules. But that wasn't why she was there. She wanted to talk about Carver. "I started reading the folders," she said, "but then I stopped when I saw what was in there."
It's understandable that Lish's assertions have never been taken seriously. The eccentric editor is up against an American icon. When he died at age 50 from lung cancer, Carver was considered by many to be America's most important short-story writer. His stories were beautiful and moving. At a New York City memorial service, Robert Gottlieb, then the editor of The New Yorker, said succinctly, "America has just lost the writer it could least afford to lose." Carver is no longer a writer of the moment, the way David Foster Wallace is today, but many of his stories -- "Cathedral," "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?" and "Errand" -- are firmly established in the literary canon. A vanguard figure in the 1980's, Carver has become establishment fiction.
That doesn't capture his claim on us, though. It goes deeper than his work. Born in the rural Northwest, Carver was the child of an alcoholic sawmill worker and a waitress. He first learned to write through a correspondence course. He lived in poverty and suffered multiple bouts of alcoholism throughout his 30's. He struggled in a difficult marriage with his high-school girlfriend, Maryann Burk. Through it all he remained a generous, determined man -- fiction's comeback kid. By 1980, he had quit drinking and moved in with Tess Gallagher, with whom he spent the rest of his life. "I know better than anyone a fellow is never out of the woods," he wrote to Lish in one of dozens of letters archived at the Lilly. "But right now it's aces, and I'm enjoying it." Carver's life and work inspired faith, not skepticism.
Still, a quick look through Carver's books would suggest that what Lish claims might have some merit. There is an evident gap between the early style of "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?" and "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love," Carver's first two major collections, and his later work in "Cathedral" and "Where I'm Calling From." In subject matter, the stories share a great deal. They are mostly about the working poor -- unemployed salesmen, waitresses, motel managers -- in the midst of disheartening lives. But the early collections, which Lish edited, are stripped to the bone. They are minimalist in style with an almost abstract feel. They drop their characters back down where they find them, inarticulate and alone, drunk at noon. The later two collections are fuller, touched by optimism, even sentimentality.
Many critics over the years have noticed this difference and explained it in terms of biography. The Carver of the early stories, it has been said, was in despair. As he grew successful, however, the writer learned about hopefulness and love, and it soaked into his fiction. This redemptive story was burnished through countless retellings by Tess Gallagher. Most critics seemed satisfied by this literal-minded explanation: happy writers write happy stories.
Sitting under the coffered ceiling of the Lilly, I began pulling out folders from the two boxes marked "Carver." Here were the stories from his first two collections as well as from "Cathedral" in versions from manuscript to printer's galleys. I had previously seen some manuscripts in the Carver holdings at Ohio State University, an archive to which Gallagher has said she will ultimately give the Carver papers in her possession. The manuscripts at O.S.U. are clean, almost without editing marks, as if they'd gone straight from author to typesetter. Where there are multiple drafts of a manuscript, the procession is unremarkable: the annotations in Carver's tiny handwriting drive the story confidently from draft to draft until the story achieves its finished form.
The Lilly manuscripts are different. There are countless cuts and additions to the pages; entire paragraphs have been added. Lish's black felt-tip markings sometimes obliterate the original text. In the case of Carver's 1981 collection, "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love," Lish cut about half the original words and rewrote 10 of the 13 endings. "Carol, story ends here," he would note for the benefit of his typist.
In "Mr. Coffee and Mr. Fixit," for example, Lish cut 70 percent of the original words. With a longer story, "A Small, Good Thing," in which a couple anxiously wait for their child to come out of a coma, Lish cut the text by a third, eliminating most of the description -- and all of the introspection. He retitled it "The Bath," altering the story's redemptive tone to one of Beckettian despair. In Lish's version, you no longer know if the child lives or dies.
Lish was constantly on guard against what he saw as Carver's creeping sentimentality. In the original manuscripts, Carver's characters talk about their feelings. They talk about regrets. When they do bad things, they cry. When Lish got hold of Carver, they stopped crying. They stopped feeling. Lish loved deadpan last lines, and he freely wrote them in: "The women, they weren't there when I left, and they wouldn't be there when I got back" ("Night School"). Other times, he cut away whole sections to leave a sentence from inside the story as the end: "There were dogs and there were dogs. Some dogs you just couldn't do anything with" ("Jerry and Molly and Sam"). On occasion, Carver reversed his changes, but in most cases Lish's handwriting became part of Carver's next draft, which became the published story.
"Fat" was one of the first stories Carver gave Lish to edit. It became the lead story in "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?" In "Fat," a restaurant waitress recounts to her friend Rita a large meal she served to a ravenous but melancholy obese man. The waitress's lover, Rudy, the restaurant cook, feels jealous. When they get home, he insists on having sex with her, but her mind remains with her experiences in the restaurant: the fat man has touched her in some way, made her feel dissatisfied with her life. This was how Carver wrote it, more as an anecdote than a story. It proved excellent material for Lish's talents. Some of what Lish does is technical: he moves the story into the present tense, for example. And he eliminates the waitress's self-reflectiveness, so we seem more involved than she does in what she is feeling. (Critics would later declare such touches to be trademark techniques of Carver.) Most important, Lish picks up on the "long, thick, creamy fingers" Carver gives the fat man, and finds in this the story's core -- the connection between longing and sexuality.
"My God, Rita, those were fingers," the waitress tells her girlfriend, who herself has "dainty fingers." At the end, when Rudy gets into bed with her, she observes, "Rudy is a tiny thing and hardly there at all." These lines -- and several others -- were written by Lish. In Lish's hands, fatness becomes sexual potency, fullness, presence. He finds the resonance Carver missed.
If "Fat" was a successful -- if unusually extensive -- edit, Lish's efforts on another story, "Tell the Women We're Going," seemed closer to a wholesale rewrite. Written by Carver in the late 1960's or early 70's, the story was unusual for him, one of the few in which the violence implicit in his characters becomes explicit. The story first made an appearance as "Friendship" in Sou'wester, a small literary magazine. By the time it appeared in the "What We Talk About" collection, Lish had retitled it -- and cut it by 40 percent. The story is set near the town in which Carver grew up, Yakima, Wash. Bill and his tougher friend Jerry take a break from their wives at a barbecue and drive off looking for action. They find two teen-age girls bicycling along the road and try to get their attention. Things go awry. After a tense pursuit full of strange pleas and laughs, Jerry rapes and kills Sharon -- a scene that Bill, who has dropped behind, arrives in time to witness. He cries out, asserting in that moment the horror that the reader feels, too.
What's noteworthy about the story is the way Carver makes a boring afternoon build to murder. Lish didn't care about this. He was after more abstract effects. He made cuts on every page. Bill becomes just a passive companion to Jerry. The pursuit is eliminated: the violence now comes out of nowhere and is almost hallucinogenic. " Bill never knew what Jerry wanted. But it started and ended with a rock," Lish wrote in. "Jerry used the same rock on both girls, first on the girl called Sharon and then on the one that was supposed to be Bill's." The story ends right there. One wonders how Carver must have felt when he saw that.
As I thumbed through various manuscripts at the Lilly, my face was flushed. I wanted Carver to win, whatever that might mean. He had shown writers the value of measuring your words. He had come along in the early 1970's when the first "post-modern" novelists, writers like John Barth and Donald Barthelme, dominated the literary scene. Their cerebral stories were admirable, but they were hard to love. Carver broke up their racket.
My favorite story had always been the sly "They're Not Your Husband." An unemployed salesman, Earl, goes to the restaurant where his wife, Doreen, is a waitress, and without identifying himself tries to goad the male customers into checking her out. He needs the validation. I particularly loved a description of Doreen's thighs as she bends over to scoop ice cream: "rumpled and gray and a little hairy, with veins that spread in a berserk display." The story also has a wonderful ending: "Then she put the unfinished chocolate sundae in front of Earl and went to total up his check." Lish didn't edit this story much, I discovered, but it turned out he had written the first sentence and rewritten the second. In Carver's version, the thighs are barely mentioned. In his original ending, Doreen just reaches for a coffeepot.
Overall, Lish's editorial changes generally struck me as for the better. Some of the cuts were brilliant, like the expert cropping of a picture. His additions gave the stories new dimensions, bringing out moments that I was sure Carver must have loved to see. Other changes, like those in "Tell the Women We're Going," struck me as bullying and competitive. Lish was redirecting Carver's vision in the service of his own fictional goals. The act felt parasitic. Lish's techniques also grew tired more quickly than did Carver's. After a while, the endless "I say," "he says" tags Lish placed on so much of the dialogue felt gimmicky. In all cases, however, I had one sustained reaction: For better or worse, Lish was in there.
Back in New York I contacted Lish. Much has changed for "Captain Fiction," as the once-dapper Lish was nicknamed during his Esquire heyday. Now 64, he is a widower, living alone in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He shuffles around in his socks, his long white hair and loose clothes making him look like a vanquished sorcerer.
We sat across from each other at his kitchen table and I asked him what had happened. "I don't like talking about the Carver period," he said, "because of my sustained sense of his betrayal and because it seems bad form to discuss this." I was aware that he had been a radio actor before becoming an editor. Was he playing his reluctance up for me? "This puts me in an absolutely impossible light," he continued. "I can only be despised for my participation."
Lish already has plenty of enemies: By the 1990's, his aggressive editing, controversial private fiction seminars and taste for publicity had cost him many friends. "I said no to the people to whom one doesn't say no," he said. In 1994, after a decade in which the writers he was championing found fewer and fewer readers, Knopf fired him. He now writes fiction full time. His latest is titled "Self-Imitation of Myself." Reading his stories is like looking at the gears of a clock that's missing a face.
Lish's "sustained sense of betrayal" was, of course, also a strong motivator toward conversation. He was still embittered, he said, by the biting ingratitude of "this mediocrity" he had plucked from obscurity. When Lish is excited, his psoriasis acts up; he pulled a cooking spoon from his shelf and began scratching his back. And he began to tell me his version of the story.
In 1969 he persuaded Esquire to hire him as fiction editor. He promised to find new voices, to clear out the cobwebs. It was quite a leap for a part-time literary editor from Palo Alto, Calif. The pressure was on to produce.
One of his friends was Carver, who was editing educational materials in an office across the street from where Lish had worked. They were drinking pals, Carver tall, handsome, and deliberate, Lish short and wiry. Lish was the more worldly and aggressive. Maryann Burk-Carver recalls them walking down a Palo Alto street with Lish asking every woman they passed to sleep with him; he was trying to prove to Carver that you only had to ask to get what you wanted from life. At this point Carver had a small reputation, but he was not a name. "He was not known, not known at all, to the persons I would be delivering stories to for approval," Lish remembers.
Lish contacted Carver, who quickly sent off several stories to him. Lish reworked and returned them, using as his model the disorienting, unemotive stories of James Purdy, the author of "Why Can't They Tell You Why?" The stories -- "Fat," "Neighbors" and "Are You a Doctor?" -- wound up as Carver's first national magazine publications. Lish had a genius for beating the drums for his writers. He was friends with important writers like Cynthia Ozick and Harold Brodkey. Critics quickly took notice of the "new" voice in fiction Lish was championing, of its radical compression (many stories were but a few pages long) and stark silences. Much was made of Carver's name -- although Lish was the one doing the carving.
In 1976 Carver collected his stories in "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?" including a version of the title story that Lish had cut. In The New York Times Book Review, the novelist Geoffrey Wolff, who would later become a friend of Carver's, hailed the stories, describing them as "carefully shaped" and "shorn of ornamentation," marked by "spells of quiet and tensed apprehension." In fact, Wolff wrote, Carver's prose "carries his mark everywhere: I would like to believe that having read the stories I could identify him on the evidence of a paragraph." The collection was nominated for a National Book Award.
Carver was gaining confidence from his success and writing more ambitiously. And he was finding out the world wasn't so harsh. He had friends now, acolytes even. He separated from Maryann and became involved with Tess Gallagher. He bought a boat and celebrated it in a poem in which he imagined it filled with his friends.
His editor's confidence was also growing. Lish thought of himself as Carver's ventriloquist. "I could not believe no one had stumbled on what was going on," he says. A collision was inevitable.
Initially, Carver had been grateful for Lish's help -- or perhaps just compliant or cowed. Carver was in a bad place in his life, beset by drink and poverty. Lish was his way to a readership. Nevertheless, Carver's unease was evident from the beginning. These letters are in the Lish archives. Responding to an edit in December 1969, Carver wrote: "Everything considered, it's a better story now than when I first mailed it your way -- which is the important thing, I'm sure." He echoed these sentiments in January 1971. "Took all of yr changes and added a few things here and there," he wrote, taking pains to add that he was "not bothered" by the extent of Lish's edit. Carver had a role in keeping the romance going, too. "You've made a single-handed impression on American letters," he wrote Lish in September 1977. "And, of course, you know, old bean, just what influence you've exercised on my life." He even offered to pay the charges for any work Lish sends out to be retyped.
After "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?" they began work on a second collection, which Lish would ultimately title "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love." (Carver had called it "Beginners.") Lish was editing more heavily now. He treated Carver as if he barely had a vote. Meanwhile, Carver was becoming a known literary figure. In 1978 he won a Guggenheim Fellowship. The next year he became a professor of English at Syracuse University.
Carver began to object to Lish's editing, but he wasn't sure what to object to. He wrote a five-page letter in July 1980 telling Lish that he could not allow him to publish "What We Talk About" as Lish had edited it. He wrote, "Maybe if I were alone, by myself, and no one had ever seen these stories, maybe then, knowing that your versions are better than some of the ones I sent, maybe I could get into this and go with it." But he feared being caught. "Tess has seen all of these and gone over them closely. Donald Hall has seen many of the new ones. . .and Richard Ford, Toby Wolff, Geoffrey Wolff, too, some of them. . . . How can I explain to these fellows when I see them, as I will see them, what happened?" He begged to be let out of his contract or at least to delay publication: "Please, Gordon, for God's sake help me in this and try to understand. . . . I've got to pull out of this one. Please hear me. I've been up all night thinking on this. . . . I'll say it again, if I have any standing or reputation or cedibility sic in the world, I owe it to you. I owe you this more-or-less pretty interesting life I have but I can't take the risk as to what might happen to me." In the same letter, he wrote imploringly, " M y very sanity is on the line here. . . . I feel it, that if the book were to be published as it is in its present edited form, I may never write another story."
Lish does not recall being moved. "My sense of it was that there was a letter and that I just went ahead." He knew what was best for Carver -- even if Carver didn't see it that way. In the end, "What We Talk About" was published much as Lish wanted.
The book received front-page reviews. Critics praised its minimalist style and announced a new school of fiction. Even so, Carver continued to press for stylistic control over his work. He insisted that if Lish wanted to edit his next collection, he would have to keep his hands off. "I can't undergo that kind of surgical amputation and transplantation," he wrote Lish in August 1982. "Please help me with this book as a good editor, the best . . .not as my ghost," he pleaded two months later.
Lish reluctantly complied. "So be it," he wrote in December 1982 after giving the manuscript to "Cathedral" only a light edit -- although he wrote some acerbic criticisms in the margins. Even then, Carver feared a sneak attack. "I don't need to tell you that it's critical for me that there not be any messing around with titles or text," he warned Lish. Publicly, Carver also began to make a break. He made a point of telling interviewers that he controlled every aspect of his stories, invoking the adage that he knew a story was finished when he went through it once and put the commas in, then went through again and took the commas out.
Lish was angered by Carver's rebellion. He began asking his friends whether he should make his "surrogate work" public. They advised him to keep quiet. Don DeLillo, for example, warned him against taking Carver on. "I appreciate, and am in sympathy with, everything you say in your letter," he wrote to Lish. "But the fact is: there is no exposing Carver. . . . Even if people knew, from Carver himself, that you are largely responsible for his best work, they would immediately forget it. It is too much to absorb. Too complicated. Makes reading the guy's work an ambiguous thing at best. People wouldn't think less of Carver for having had to lean so heavily on an editor; they'd resent Lish for complicating the reading of the stories.
"In the meantime," he ended, "take good care of your archives."
Once Carver ended his professional relationship with Lish, he never looked back. He didn't need to. "Cathedral" was his most celebrated work yet. Famous writers wanted to meet him; Saul Bellow wrote him an appreciative note. The collection was nominated for both a Pulitzer and a National Book Critics Circle Award. Proudly, Carver wrote a letter to Lish in which he noted that the title story "went straight from the typewriter into the mail."
Indeed, many writers and critics see Carver's later work -- stories like "Blackbird Pie" and "Errand" -- as his best efforts, his final brilliant flowering. Seen in this light, the Lish period, though responsible for bringing him to national attention, was an apprenticeship to be transcended. Some of Carver's friends certainly saw it that way. The poet Donald Hall read a manuscript copy of "The Bath" before Lish cut it. He asked Carver's permission to publish the original version under its original title, "A Small, Good Thing," in Ploughshares magazine. In this more expansive, uplifting form, the story won a 1983 O. Henry Award. "I was hearthurt at what had happened to that story," Hall remembers. "I've wondered in my head why Lish did what he did. Was it unconscious jealousy?"
That is one way to explain the Lish-Carver relationship. The story is complicated by, of all people, Tess Gallagher. The poet, who now lives in Port Angeles, Wash., is generally seen as the heroine of the Carver saga. And with reason. When she met Carver in 1977, he was just turning a corner in his life, trying to control his drinking. She was ready for the job of keeping him sober. "God has given you to me to take care of," she told him. Gallagher made a home for him in which to work. She taught him to say no to Lish and ultimately to free himself from him, winning the long tug of war for Carver's soul. She encouraged him to publish "Where I'm Calling From," a selection of 7 new and 30 old stories, in the form he wanted posterity to read. (Carver never explained, however, that he was, in some cases, reversing Lish's edits.)
So Gallagher helped Carver to find his true voice. Weirdly, though, many of her pronouncements also have the effect of claiming a piece of Carver's work. Although she declined several requests to be interviewed for this article, Gallagher has described in detail her contribution to two of Carver's greatest stories, "Cathedral" and "Errand." Unlike Lish's claims, they cannot be checked against original drafts, because most of Carver's late manuscripts remain in her hands. Besides, the collaboration she describes would be so intimate that no traces were likely to remain.
But in the 1992 PBS documentary "To Write and Keep Kind" and in a series of unpublished interviews, Gallagher emphasized that she had given Carver the original idea for "Cathedral" -- or, more accurately, that he had stolen it from her. The story focuses on the discomfort that a husband feels when his wife brings a blind friend into their home. Tess herself had a blind acquaintance whom she talked about with Carver; she said she was planning to write a story about him when Carver "scooped" her. In addition, Gallagher claimed that she had written or helped shape several key lines. She spoke of the story as a joint effort.
Then there's "Errand," Carver's last published story. It tells of Anton Chekhov's early death; the work has a special status among Carver readers because Carver identified with Chekhov and because, although Carver said he did not know he had cancer when he wrote it, it limns his own death. The end of "Errand" takes place in a Badenweiler hotel room in 1904. The point of view of the story gracefully shifts from Chekhov, this man of letters dying of tuberculosis, to a young waiter worrying about a cork that has fallen to the floor in the room. The widow is lost in grief, and he is preoccupied with the cork. The ending is classically Chekovian in its attention to the waiter and his worries, and it fuses elegantly Carver's death, his life and his work.
As Gallagher explained in "To Write and Keep Kind," Carver had trouble envisioning the end of the tale: "Ray had written many, many drafts and didn't know how to get out of this story." So she came to his aid. "I was empathizing with his waiter character," she said to the camera, "and I said, that waiter is going to be looking down and you know what he's going to see? He's going to see that cork that popped out of the Champagne. I think the ending is involved with his response to that cork, and that he's going to bend down to get that and we're going to know something from that gesture, that action."
Collaboration between a literary husband and wife is not unusual. Nor is theft: F. Scott Fitzgerald lifted pages from the diaries of his wife, Zelda, for the sanitarium sections of "Tender Is the Night." Such entanglements still arouse discomfort. In an interview, Gallagher said that she had always kept their collaboration private, because "people's ideas about authorship are perhaps a bit fixed and unimaginative when it comes to what really happens when two writers live together." This has emerged as a theme of hers. Her next book is to be called "Soul Barnacles: On the Literature of a Relationship, Tess Gallagher and Raymond Carver."
Perhaps Gallagher and Lish did make their marks on Carver's fiction. But who needs them? Carver is enough. That's how Carver's friends -- Richard Ford, Tobias Wolff, Mona Simpson -- feel. "I have absolute confidence that Ray wrote everything in his stories according to my understanding of how writers write what they write," Ford said. He said he feared that any discussion of the archives would "inadvertently diminish Ray." Simpson expressed a lack of surprise. "I think people already assume an editor helps to make the work better. Who would want one who didn't?" Wolff said it reminded him what a good idea it is to destroy your drafts.
I mentioned the competing, and in some cases overlapping, claims of collaboration to Dick Day, Carver's college writing teacher at Humboldt State University. He thought his own influence was negligible. "I know any time I read a sentence by Carver that it's Carver's," he said. "Ray's voice was his own and it's authentic." A top editor at Knopf finds the very idea of co-authorship noxious. "I never met an author so many people claimed a piece of," he says.
How far can one take the question of influence, anyway? When I spoke with Maryann Carver about her ex-husband's work, she cited her impact on the story "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?" In the story, a husband and wife have an altercation over a past affair. When I pressed for details, she said it would be "crude" to get specific. Then she showed me where her tooth had entered her lip.
DeLillo had pointed out in his letter to Lish how central the idea of authenticity is to our literary culture. We have the text on the printed page. Why complicate our enjoyment of the stories by focusing on how they came to be written? To ask is to transgress. Besides, that writers take the help that is offered is not news. Chekhov, Carver's idol, used to pay friends 10 kopecks for an anecdote and 20 for a plot. Carver came out of the 1970's workshop tradition, in which you showed a story around and took the suggestions you found useful. What's so strange about a smart writer taking smart advice? "I edit my writers a lot or a little," says Gary Fisketjon, the editor at large at Knopf who worked with Carver after Lish. "Either way, it's their story."
Academics familiar with the Lish papers see the question of collaboration as more complex. "If you exalt the individual writer as the romantic figure who brings out these things from the depths of his soul," says Carol Polsgrove, a professor at Indiana University who has written about the archives, "then, yes, the awareness of Lish's role diminishes Carver's work somewhat. But if you look at writing and publishing as a social act, which I think it is, the stories are the stories that they are." Her view is becoming more widespread: a new form of literary analysis, "genetic criticism," focuses on the evolution of literary manuscripts from drafts to published form, taking into account the inevitable impact of editors and publishers.
Brian Evenson, a professor of English at Oklahoma State University, is the scholar whose findings Gallagher fought to keep unpublished. (The essay had been under consideration for an upcoming anthology, "Critical Essays on Raymond Carver," when Gallagher got wind of the submission and issued the publisher a copyright warning.) In Evenson's eyes, "You really have to say that Lish is almost as responsible as Carver for the stories he worked on." He feels the work really has to be admitted to be a "collaboration" -- almost like a musical with book and music by different artists. All the characters, the settings and the plots are Carver's. Carver country conceived of as a physical place with a given population is still Carver country. But the minimalist tone, for good or ill, was Lish's. He was more avant-garde than Carver, whose real voice was closer to his plain-spoken poetry. That's how he wrote before he met Lish, and that's how he wrote after. "It's no wonder Carver grew angry when critics called him a minimalist," Evenson says. "That was Lish."
What does one make of literature that is the product of collaboration? Some historical perspective is in order. Consider Ezra Pound's revising of "The Wasteland" in 1922. Pound did for T. S. Eliot something of what Lish did for Carver. He made liberal cuts to the poem, shortening it by half and eliminating the strong element of parody. (The original title had been "He Do the Police in Different Voices.") Pound found a voice -- not necessarily the voice Eliot intended -- and honed it brilliantly. He helped make him a modernist cause celebre. Eliot acknowledged the debt obliquely, praising Pound as il miglior fabbro ("the greater craftsman") in his dedication. When Eliot outgrew Pound, he moved on. Scholars learned of the extent of this collaboration only with the discovery of the original manuscripts in 1968. This has not hurt Eliot's reputation. Seen in the larger context of his career, the fact that his masterpiece did not read quite like anything else he wrote did not lessen his stature or importance. Somehow it has come to seem natural.
Thomas Wolfe, on the other hand, did not come in for such gentle handling. Wolfe was a brilliant writer, but there was a lot about writing a novel he never understood. He dumped the 330,000- word manuscript of his first novel, "Look Homeward, Angel," on the desk of his editor, Maxwell Perkins; in long sessions, Perkins cut, revised and made suggestions (always with Wolfe's consent). Wolfe decided to publicize the situation, much to the embarrassment of Perkins, who thought the editing process should be private. By Wolfe's second book, Perkins was mixing and matching batches of manuscripts, connecting the dots with Wolfe as he went along. After Wolfe died in 1938, Edward Aswell, an editor at Harper & Brothers, went even further. He created two more books out of the million words Wolfe left behind, creating composite characters and sometimes adding his own words. As these revelations have become known in the past two decades, Wolfe's reputation has dimmed considerably. "We have been threatened with scholarly publication of Wolfe's original manuscripts, and doubtless the threats will be fulfilled," wrote the critic Harold Bloom in 1987, "but the originals are most unlikely to revive Wolfe's almost-dead reputation."
Between these two examples sits Carver. To be sure, some of the early stories were so transformed by Lish that they should be considered the product of two minds. But what about the later stories Gallagher claims to have influenced? It's hard to say. That Carver's relationship with Gallagher was consensual rather than antagonistic matters, but what's most compelling is that the stories from "Cathedral" feel as if they came from him. They share a common voice, a brightness. If Gallagher helped him, so much the better. To paraphrase Mona Simpson, who would want a wife who didn't? Of course, one day, Gallagher may reveal a deeper level of collaboration. It's one thing to guide the pen; another to hold it. If that day comes, I suspect I will start to feel about Carver the way I do about Wolfe: namely, that he was a writer who never left a clear record of his talents. DeLillo is right: this is a culture in which we want a single name on the front of the book.
But why place so high a price on purity? The stories are what they are, regardless. Perhaps that's why Carver was not inclined to talk openly about the editing process. He was a private man and nonconfrontational. "Ray once said to me, 'Who needs trouble?' " remembers Tobias Wolff. "He wanted everything to be peaceful." When interviewers asked Carver about his relationship with "Captain Fiction," he always acknowledged Lish as a friend, a talented editor, a man who had been there for him at a crucial time. But he carefully avoided talking about the back-and-forth of their editing relationship, why it had ended or what it might reveal for those interested in his work.
In 1982, however, he came close. He was in a discussion with students at the University of Akron and, in response to a student's question, he began talking about the editor-writer relationship. He ticked off all the famous examples of heavy editing: F. Scott Fitzgerald's cutting of Hemingway's "Sun Also Rises," Perkins and Wolfe, Pound and Eliot. Carver quoted Pound's explanation of the process: "It's immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a jot of difference who writes them."
Then he paused. "That's it. That's it exactly," he said.
 
Literary Spin Control
 
The work will find its own way: that's the gospel of literature.
All the same, in a world where not even the Nobel Prize guarantees immortality -- think Henrik Pontoppidan -- nothing is certain. Some writers disappear only to come back, like Zora Neale Hurston (thanks to the interest generated by Alice Walker). Others fade, it would seem, for good. Not surprisingly, writers or their descendants make efforts to stack the deck.
Posthumous publication is most helpful in keeping the public interested in a dead writer. With the publication of All of Us: The Collected Poems next month, there will have been almost as many Raymond Carver books published after his death as before. That's no match for Virginia Woolf, however. Her letters, diaries and miscellany now take up at least 30 volumes, giving her a publication rate only Joyce Carol Oates could match. Henry James rewrote his own texts for posterity; Norman Mailer engaged in a similar ploy with his recent anthology, The Time of Our Time, providing his own greatest-hits guide to his work.
Finding the right biographer is crucial. The idea nowadays is to pick someone you like before someone you don't picks you. Tess Gallagher, who hasn't authorized a biography of Raymond Carver, is now talking to Jay McInerney, who studied with her husband, about writing one. Such plans don't always work. Robert Frost put his fate in the hands of his friend Lawrance Thompson -- only to watch Thompson's admiration turn to dislike. It was perhaps Thomas Hardy who took the matter to its logical conclusion, secretly writing his own biography and then having his widow publish the work under her own name.
Beyond that, the best you can do is try to control the information that gets out. Franz Kafka took the famously extreme view when he asked his friend Max Brod to burn all his work, even to the last page. (Brod decided not to honor this request -- and who can blame him?) Other authors carefully arrange their papers for posterity. Saul Bellow has placed his manuscripts and letters at the University of Chicago. Toni Morrison used to keep hers at home -- but after a fire almost consumed them, she placed them at Princeton. Allen Ginsberg sold not just his letters and journals, but also a pair of old tennis shoes and other personal memorabilia to Stanford shortly before his death. Access to the documents (or the shoes) is available to interested scholars.
 
Widow's Work
 
Who looks after an author's work after he or she dies? Usually, it's the writer's spouse or lover; sometimes it's another family member, a friend or a scholar. These watchdogs are formally known as executors -- and informally as keepers of the flame.
Keepers of the flame must make decisions about everything from the placement of archives to posthumous publication. They tend to be loyal, beleaguered and a bit capricious. Their ace in the hole is permission to quote from the work, a power that prompted the following advice from the biographer Justin Kaplan: Shoot the widow.
T. S. Eliot's widow, Valerie, has been a typically unpredictable executor. Peter Ackroyd had to insert paraphrases into his 1984 Eliot biography after Valerie refused him the right to quote from letters and unpublished works. Although she has guarded many Eliot manuscripts with secrecy, she did allow the poet's bawdy juvenilia to be published in 1996. And she provided Andrew Lloyd Webber with unpublished poetry fragments for his musical Cats.
Executors tend to be protective by nature, but this instinct can turn extreme. Ted Hughes, widower of Sylvia Plath, destroyed the last volume of Plath's diary after her 1963 suicide. It was an act, he claimed, designed to protect their two children from additional grief. Although feminist scholars condemned Hughes, his act had many precursors: Lord Byron's friends, for example, torched the poet's supposedly salacious memoirs, fearing scandal. More recently, letters written by James Joyce's daughter, Lucia, were burned by her nephew Stephen Joyce. He did so pre-emptively after his grandmother, Nora, was the subject of a biography. I didn't want to have greedy little eyes and greedy little fingers going over them, he told dismayed Joyce scholars in 1988.
Other executors tirelessly promote the deceased's work. Tess Gallagher is of this school. She has been Raymond Carver's constant champion, doing everything from reading his work in public to issuing posthumous works and encouraging film interest. (She worked with Robert Altman on the 1993 movie Short Cuts.) At times, all this vigilance can seem thankless. Widows don't get much applause in America, Gallagher has lamented.
Alas, not all the work in the world will bring the beloved back. As Elaine Steinbeck says: The hardest part of being a keeper of the flame is just being lonely for your husband. I think we would all say the same thing.

HEADLINE: Libertarian Paradiso

BYLINE: By Alex Heard; Alex Heard, an editor of the magazine, is the author of "Apocalypse Pretty Soon," a forthcoming book on millennial American subcultures.

 BODY:
Lazarus Long doesn't care much for American bureaucracy ("Government is an octopus," he grumbles), so he wants to start all over, creating a spiffy new nation on an unpopulated Caribbean shoal, the Misteriosa Bank, situated about 120 miles west of the Cayman Islands. He'll call it the Principality of New Utopia; place it on a grid of huge, pillar-mounted concrete platforms, and govern it based on the notions of maxed-out individual liberty and capitalism celebrated in Ayn Rand's 1957 novel, "Atlas Shrugged."
It sounds uniquely crazy, but others have tried to build a new nation where nothing existed before, often inspired by Rand. There's even a history of the quest: "How to Start Your Own Country," a 1979 book by Erwin Strauss, a Virginia-based new-nation buff. Strauss recounts such noble failures as the Republic of Minerva, a 1972 scheme to landfill a pair of tide-washed atolls 260 miles from Tonga, with permission from Tonga's king. (The king changed his mind, eventually seizing the reclaimed land.) He says international law doesn't expressly forbid new-nation building, but there's a problem: there's no unclaimed land worth settling. In recent years, United States-based new-nation groups with names like Oceania -- the Atlantis Project, the Millennial Project and the New Island Creation Consortium have hatched plans to build a country on floating platforms moored on the open seas, but none have worked. 
 Long, a 67-year-old retired entrepreneur based in Tulsa, Okla., is utterly serious, and he hopes to make a great leap forward this fall. He says an offshore company, the Mercator Group, has agreed to front the $3 million cost of installing the first platform, which will be created in Florida and barged out to the site. (An official concurs, saying the company has been promised a future payback of $4.5 million.) He has assembled 507 on-paper "citizens" and an eight-person Board of Governors that has helped him write a constitution, and he's preparing to lead. Long, whose given name is Howard Turney, has legally rechristened himself Lazarus Long in honor of a free-thinking character created by Robert A. Heinlein, the late sci-fi writer. He has anointed himself "prince" of his hoped-for realm. Strauss is skeptical -- he doubts the Cayman Islands would tolerate the competition -- but who knows? For a brief, gauzy moment, let's jump on board with the Prince. Here's a look at What Might Be, based on his actual plans.
 
AYN & HEIN: New Utopia's grid of platforms will be arrayed to create Venice-style waterways, and will be dotted with beautiful, spacious public parks. "Four of 'em," the Prince reckons, "2,000 feet long and 600 feet deep." This park honors two now-dead visionaries who inspired the dream: Rand and Heinlein. The 80-foot-high "water wall" sculpture has three sides, gracefully symbolizing the triple dynamos of New Utopia's economy: medicine,
tourism and finance. "It will be beautiful, with trees, landscaping, gulls, songbirds, parrots," the Prince sighs. "This will be the central place where people get their picture taken in New Utopia."
 
WONK PREP: "Study hard, kids," this New Utopian educator seems to be saying, "and you too could grow up to become an economic czar." This bromide has real meaning at Alan Greenspan Middle School, so named for the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Greenspan has no link to New Utopia, but he's admired because he was once a member of Ayn Rand's inner circle. The Prince proudly says that Dr. Joseph Greenspan, a Texas M.D. and New Utopia's health minister, is Greenspan's nephew. The doctor and the chairman deny this, but the Prince is certain. "Joe has told me many times that Alan Greenspan is his uncle," he says. Better clear that up before the dedication!
 
RX: WHATEVER: The Prince, a medical layman, made some of his money in a now-defunct alternative clinic in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, which dispensed human growth hormone for rejuvenation purposes. His theories are frowned upon by healing-arts pros -- like his faith in MTH-68, a reputed anticancer agent now being tested in Hungary, which is not approved as a cancer drug in the United States. No matter. At the $22 million Thomas R. Seslar Memorial Medical Center (named for a deceased friend of the Prince), you can get anything you want. Here, the Prince (with pipe) and a staff doctor contemplate a mineralized hot pool in the healing spa.
 
BIG EASY: Casino gambling! Swimming holes right on the edge of the business district! Tourist opportunities will abound in New Utopia, including some not legally available elsewhere, even in New Orleans: pot, prostitution and
polygamy. The Prince and his Board of Governors intend to keep a light touch on the personal-morality tiller, and to foster a rousing business climate by doing away with income taxes. (Government expenses will be covered by a 15 percent duty on imports.) The Prince has a taste for opulence, though. Rising at left is Government House, which contains a lavish banquet hall. Isn't that too grandiose for a libertarian island? "You have to have a little pomp to attract the people," says the Prince.
 
BADDIE, AHOY!: A queasy moment for this blackguard: after a night in an offshore cell, he's bound for permanent exile. While the Principality will be easygoing about some things -- judges will wear casual island garb, not robes -- there will be Zero Tolerance for classic felonies like murder and arson. New Utopia's attorney general, Michael Fairchild (the Prince's lawyer), says the standard punishment for minor crimes will be a fine; for major ones, "exile," using cash incentives to persuade another country to handle the rejects. What if they won't? "Castaways would be a possibility," he admits, "but only as a last resort."

HEADLINE: Permission Granted to Kill a Whale. Now What?

BYLINE: By Robert Sullivan; Robert Sullivan is the author of "The Meadowlands: Wilderness Adventures at the Edge of a City," an adaptation of which appeared in The New York Times Magazine in February.

 BODY:
In the fall, the Makah Nation, a Native American tribe of 2,000 people that makes its home at the very northwest tip of the continental United States, plans to send a crew of eight men out into the Pacific Ocean in a canoe to harpoon a whale. It will be the first time a Makah crew has hunted a whale since the late 1920's, when a tradition of thousands of years was ended because of overhunting. So it is an event of great significance to the Makah people, who consider the whale hunt to be a sacramental act. It is turning out to be an event of great significance to people who aren't Makah too.
In the Northwest, a little tribe that no one had heard of is suddenly front-page news, with environmentalists' protests and anti-Makah Web sites springing up like the late-summer wildflowers that drape Washington State's Olympic Peninsula, site of the Makah reservation. On a sunny day last winter, as the newly chosen whaling crew was making its first practice run in Neah Bay, John McCarty, one of the Makah who were organizing the hunt, stood on the beach and watched the canoe put into the white-haired waves. "The whole world," he announced, "is watching the Makah." 
 For the most part, the world is not too happy. In 1996, with the support of the Federal Government, the Makah applied to the International Whaling Commission to hunt whales, citing an 1855 treaty that they say allows them to do so. But by the time they received permission, in October 1997, to take up to five California gray whales a year for five years for ceremonial purposes, everyone from an Australian animal rights group to an international whale-watching association had begun complaining. This spring, just as a $310,000 grant from the Commerce Department was winding down, preparations for the hunt nearly came to an end. At an anti-Makah rally in downtown Seattle in June, Representative Jack Metcalf, a Washington State Republican who has spoken of the American people's "special relationship with whales," vowed to stop the whale hunt.
As the time for the hunt approaches and protests become increasingly belligerent -- an anonymous letter threatened that one Makah would be killed for every whale -- the tribe has taken to meeting regularly with a law-enforcement task force, partly to protect the Makah, partly to protect the protesters who are expected to show up in Neah Bay at the end of this month at the tribe's annual Makah Days celebration.
The protest operations are being led by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, the marine-conservation group based in Marina del Rey, Calif., that prides itself on having sunk nine whaling ships during 20 years of whale-hunt protests. In the past, Sea Shepherd has been a champion of Native American rights, but in this case it insists that a Makah hunt will be used by worldwide commercial whaling interests to break the world's moratorium on hunting whales. (Whale hunting is generally banned internationally, though a few nations ignore the ban and several aboriginal groups are allowed special privileges to hunt.) Paul Watson, the president of Sea Shepherd, plans to block the Makah whaling crew with his command ship, a flotilla of private boats and a small decommissioned Norwegian Navy submarine armed with killer-whale sounds intended to frighten away gray whales. "This is possibly the most important whale hunt in the past 25 years," Watson says.
All this is not exactly what the Makah imagined when they dreamed of one day having a chance to hunt a whale again, back when it looked as if just getting permission to hunt was the big hurdle. And yet the Makah -- despite the protests, the political pressure and a nasty bout of internal squabbling -- are moving ahead with the hunt.
"It's a war out there, and we know it," George Bowechop, a village elder and a member of the tribe's whaling commission, told me one night at a celebration for the return of the hunt. The protesters' scorn, he said, has made the Makah only more determined. "They want us in the museum. They'd rather we just said, 'Oh, the Makah were great whalers,' and leave it at that. They want us to have a dead culture. But it's been our way of life. We look at the ocean and we feel we not only have a legal right but a moral right to whale."
On the day last winter when the whaling crew was making its very first practice run, a few Makah village elders surveyed the action alongside local kids and a small team of aboriginal and commercial whalers who had flown in on a kind of whalers' field trip. They came from Iceland and Tonga and Japan and a few of the other whale-hunt-friendly places around the world. One Icelandic whaler -- blond-haired and blue-eyed and wearing a parka, in contrast to the shirtless, dark-haired Makah crew members who were shedding their basketball shoes and preparing to paddle off in gym shorts -- reminded another visitor that the actual whale-hunting portion of a whale hunt can be difficult too. "In Iceland," he said, sizing up the Makah's 34-foot canoe, "we hunt for whales much smaller than the gray whale and we use a boat that is much bigger than this one. I hope they are careful, because with a whale, you know, it's not a game."
Micah McCarty was at the front of the Makah canoe as it set out that day. Micah is the son of John McCarty and great-grandson of Hishka, one of the last of the great Makah hunters, and for a long time Micah has been talked about as the Makah expected to harpoon the whale. As he paddled out toward the mouth of the bay, out toward the snow-covered mountains of British Columbia, all was quiet except the paddles as they sliced through the gray surf: when you closed your eyes you could imagine a hunt that was free of protests and politics and bureaucracy -- a hunt like his great-grandfather might have led. "If you paddle right," Micah said, looking out ahead of the canoe, "you can paddle for hours."
As he continued to paddle, Micah talked about how the canoes of his ancestors were equipped with food and water for several days, in case the whale fought and ran and dragged the boat through the ocean. "We could get one right away or we might have to go for a while," he said.
With that, Micah rose up in the canoe, and, though there was no great hump of barnacled whale rising up from the flat surface of the sea, he drew back his arm and stood as if he were about to launch his harpoon.
For the Makah, the idea behind the whale hunt was simple: by resurrecting this cultural and spiritual centerpiece of the tribe, the community would blossom again and the local economy might even be revived. Unlike most tribes in the United States, the Makah live on their ancestral land, on the very peninsula of cedar trees and rocky, volcanic cliffs from which their great-grandparents set off in search of gray whales. As it is now, Neah Bay, the reservation's main village, is a small fleet of ramshackle houses on streets lined with old furniture and rusty appliances: about 50 percent of the villagers are unemployed. The hunt has in some ways created a canoe-based empowerment zone.
Though the Makah no longer crave the taste of whale meat, the gray whale has historically been considered life sustaining. Traditional tribal stories tell of the time when the Makah could not leave the land for food because of great storms and Thunderbird, a flying wolflike god, delivered a whale to their shores. But for the last two generations, this life-sustaining relationship has become a parody. Even when dead whales have washed ashore on the Makah's beaches, armed Federal guards have been posted to keep the tribe from carving them up.
Some opponents of the Makah's hunt have argued that it was actually dreamed up by commercial whalers in Iceland or Norway or Japan. But as some Makah remember it, the tribe's fisheries-management people were down by the docks when they read in the local newspaper that the gray whale would soon be coming off the endangered-species list. John McCarty, who at 63 is too young to have witnessed his grandfather's last whale hunt, recalls walking up from his fishing boat at about that time and hearing someone say: "Hey, John! How'd you like to go hunt a whale?" It wasn't long before the idea became a hit with the tribal council, and the simple idea began its accrual of modern complications.
The complications began last fall, with the choosing of an eight-man crew. In the old days, each family had its whalers, but now the council had to jump-start the dead tradition. A whaling commission was formed to select the crew and to draw up some physical and spiritual guidelines -- paddling-endurance standards, for example, and instruction in methods of personal prayer, all of which had to be culled from old stories and archival sources, since no living Makah had been on a whale hunt. Everything had to be cleared by the tribe's Seattle-based lawyers, and a whale-management plan was written in cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service. The tribal whaling commission came up with a budget, hired a staff and tried to set up its computer, such that over the winter the sacred act of whaling became a kind of bureaucracy in itself. Aside from being the great-grandsons and -nephews of Hishka, aside from being connected by tradition to the spirits of the sea, the crew would also have on-the-job insurance.
At the core of the crew were the first four men named. Wayne Johnson ended up being the leader of the squad, in charge of getting everyone together for physical and spiritual training, though he tended to emphasize the physical. He is tall and thin; he looks like a semiretired stuntman. At 45, he is by far the oldest crew member -- and is likely, when the hunt comes, to follow alongside the whaling canoe in some kind of a chase boat. Darrell Markishtum, in his mid-30's, is the crew's unofficial chaplain, its spiritual center. He works for the tribal fisheries office but in his spare time collects traditional Makah stories. Donnie Swan, in his early 20's, is a fisherman and hunter who rides a motorcycle and wears Oakley sunglasses and camouflage. He is strong and quick and anxious for the hunt. "My oldest daughter's always saying, 'My daddy's gonna catch the whale!"' Donnie says.
Micah McCarty, 27, is the crew's bohemian, a kind of Save the Whales whaler who sees environmentalism and whaling as compatible if conducted on ancient Native American terms. He generally wears black jeans, a black shirt, black hiking boots and a black beret; he ties back his long, dark brown hair in a ponytail. He carves traditional masks and totems from cedar and exhibits his work in galleries in Seattle and Victoria. He is smart and sharp-tongued. "Our sacred tradition is all wrapped up in red tape," he often says. Micah lives amid carving tools and paperbacks in an old military barracks, a few dozen yards from the ancient Makah whaling village. "I grew up as a minority kid and I knew I was the descendant of these people who were like kings, and I was like, Why? To me, I'm living the last will and testament of my ancestors, as opposed to dying on the job in some industrial reality."
The members of the Makah Whaling Commission had envisioned a kind of Colonial Williamsburg-style hunt, one that would resemble the hunt of their ancestors, with at least one exception. In keeping with tradition, the crew was given spiritual training and learned the old whale-hunting songs; they traveled to Alaska hoping to sing and dance and hunt with native whale hunters. The big exception was that, in addition to the harpoon, the Makah crew would take along a gun. That gun is a .50-caliber rifle with an infrared sight; it's light green-gray and is heavy and looks to the untrained eye like a bazooka. It was modified with the help of a ballistics expert (who is also a veterinarian) to quickly kill a gray whale without knocking the hunter out of the canoe. The people protesting the hunt have called the Makah's rifle inhumane. "There isn't a trace of 'ceremonial whaling' in this plan," Sea Shepherd has written. "It's blatant, undeniable whale warfare!"
But to the crew, the rifle is a safety precaution, and they don't see why a modern traditional whale hunter shouldn't have one. "The rifleman will shoot as this is in the air," Micah explained to me one day on the beach, holding aloft his practice harpoon. "It will be simultaneous. Because that's the way we feel we can achieve the quickest time-to-death ratio. Basically, the time to beat is 15 minutes until the whale is subdued."
Even with a rifle along, however, a whale hunt is something to be anxious about. Early one morning last winter, when the bay was like a sheet of glass in the just-risen sun, Wayne got the crew together at J.J.'s Pizza, a little beachfront bakery. Everyone was there but Micah, who at the last minute caught a ferry to British Columbia to visit his girlfriend. The whalers talked about taking group hikes and group sweats. Darrell was thinking about getting back into tai chi. Everyone was needling Donnie about having given up smoking in preparation for the hunt.
In the old days, Wayne was saying, there were periods of quiet and prayer and deprivation before the hunt. Men would purify themselves by living alone in the woods and bathing in mountain ponds and streams; they would abstain from sex. "If they hunted a whale," Wayne said, "and the whale got away, the first thing they would do is look around the canoe and say, 'O.K., who slept with their wife?"'
After coffee, the men wandered down the beach. They shared some modern whale stories, like the one about the Russian whalers who were tossed from their canoe and dangled in the freezing water while the whale came back and studied them as if it were pricing a cheap jewel.
"When we met the Russian chief, he said that not everyone's going to come home all the time," Wayne said. "The gray whale, if he gets mad, he'll attack you."
They all nodded their heads and were quiet for a while, and then they compared the length of a 50-foot gray whale with the length of their canoe.
March was to be the month that the crew's rigorous training started, but things didn't go as planned. The month began all right, with a potlatch for the crew, a night of celebration and dancing, after which the crew flew to Alaska. But the whalers returned to discover that the protesters were gaining strength and that their own momentum had stalled.
The men were reduced to sitting around -- this was the week, coincidentally, that "Moby-Dick" was playing on cable TV. They went out in the canoe a few times, and trained a little on their own; Donnie was smoking again, but he had also begun to harpoon seals and sea lions. Micah, too, continued to practice throwing his harpoon. For the most part, however, the crew members were frustrated. In the crew's sweat lodge one night, across the street from a diner, Wayne lamented in the steamy darkness that they weren't getting out in the canoe enough. "The women are out there every night canoeing," he said. "And if the women can do it, we can, too."
As executive director of the tribal whaling commission, John McCarty was coming under stealth attack; unbeknown to him, factions of the whaling commission and the tribal council were moving to shut him down. They felt he had not moved fast enough and that he was not taking proper advantage of the technology available to the hunt. For a time, John tried to run the hunt without the tribal council's blessing; in the end, he decided to pull out altogether and moved away from the reservation for a while to work a roofing job. His son Micah stayed on the crew.
By the end of June, training was back on track. Wayne had the crew out paddling after work almost every night. The carving of a traditional 36-foot whaling canoe was almost done. Keith Johnson, the president of the Makah's whaling commission, announced that, barring any legal challenges, the hunt would go on sometime in October -- which is when the whales arrive and also the time when the ocean normally begins to turn dangerously rough. Keith, for his part, was trying to keep expectations down. "We're going to learn a lot," he said. "There are a lot of unknowns. We could have a great, great hunt and not get a whale."
Although momentum had been recaptured, the tone of the hunt had somehow changed. The crew seemed more interested in using modern technology to get the first whale and traditional methods later, after it had established -- to protesters, to the world -- the tribe's ancient right to whale hunt. No one seemed to lament this more than Micah. He was still planning to go on the hunt, though it wasn't clear who would throw the harpoon. "Whoever throws that harpoon is going to go down in history," Wayne said.
For his part, Micah said he would give up his place in the canoe only if he felt the hunt was somehow sacrilegious, if it was not respectful of the whale. He also talked about the possibility of leading his own hunt, perhaps next year. As for training, Micah had managed to stay focused during all the turmoil. Most days, he woke, said a water prayer, stretched out, put on his Nike Air cross trainers and went out for a long run. From his home, he crossed the river where his great-grandfather Hishka would have bathed. Micah trained not for the sake of body-fat reduction but to make himself worthy of a sort of nobility, an apostolic succession. "There's an old saying that the whale chooses the whaler," Micah said, "and I want to be honorable enough to be chosen by the whale."
Earlier this summer, Micah took a long hike north along the beach. He left late in the day and walked into dusk and then built a bonfire and catnapped before the growing flames. As the sun was setting, he heard an otter breaking open shells on its belly, and then he imagined ancient canoes and ancient hunters, and then he was just looking out over the ocean, over the horizon, looking, listening.
Along the hike, he found himself thinking about his own whale hunt and even picturing the whale, as he often does these days. "I was visualizing the scenario of the final approach," he said, "with the whale blowing its stack. I was visualizing plunging the harpoon. And I was wondering, Would it be an electrical charge from the animal to me? What will the animal feel in its heart? What would it be like? What would it be like to be there with the whale?"

HEADLINE: Taking a Flier on a Ferry

BYLINE: By ROBERT PACKARD; ROBERT PACKARD lives in Maine and New York City, where he has yet to ride the Staten Island Ferry.

 BODY:
AN unlikely vessel is racing through the waters between Bar Harbor, Me., and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, four times a day. This ship, nearly as big as a football field, travels up to 55 miles an hour. It can accommodate 762 passengers, 240 cars and 4 buses.
Named The Cat, it looks like a huge black sea beast with windows for gills. Its colorful pointed bow, high above the water, is shaped and painted to suggest dynamic flow, with a stylized cat leaping over the ship's name. The original catamaran, a narrow raft of parallel logs propelled by sails, has here metamorphosed into a 300-foot-long, 85-foot-wide, water-jet-driven behemoth. 
 The Cat was launched last September on the island of Tasmania and for a short time provided ferry service across Bass Strait between Melbourne, Australia, and Tasmania. It moved to Maine this spring. The old Bluenose ferry, which The Cat replaced, traveled at a service speed of about 19 knots (about 22 m.p.h), making the 118-mile trip from Bar Harbor to Yarmouth in six and a half hours. The new ship takes just two and a half hours and makes two round trips a day.
The Cat's speed is possible because it pierces the waves with four 9,500-horsepower engines and two wave-piercing hulls, augmented by a stabilizer between them.
As one who feels queasy in a canoe when a lake breeze causes a slight ripple, I was less than enthusiastic about embarking on The Cat. I spend my summers on a dead-end rural road in the bluest of blue-collar Maine communities, and life there offers precisely the tranquillity I seek. Furthermore, I had absolutely no reason to travel to Yarmouth. But my friends Beth and Jason persuaded me to take a one-day round-trip cruise with them on The Cat last month.
"There's a bar," Beth said.
"And a casino," Jason added, "along with a cafe."
"Don't forget the duty-free gift shop," Beth reminded me, although its contents in the purlieus of Yarmouth and Bar Harbor transcended my acquisitive imagination. Unpersuaded, I hesitated, but the phrase "hidebound and stuffy" somehow wafted in my direction. I packed my knapsack.
For some reason, it's de rigueur to rise at 5 A.M. in rural Maine, and thus we arrived at the Bar Harbor dock well before the 8 A.M. departure. By 7:15, more than 100 cars were lined up waiting to board The Cat. Those of us on the day-trip "cruise" parked near the administration office, where we purchased our tickets ($44.95 round trip).
The ship itself was distant enough to make taking the shuttle bus sensible. But on that chilly sunlit morning, we walked to the stairways near the ship's stern. The bow faced the island-studded sparkling harbor; the stern opened up to allow, on this Sunday morning, 141 vehicles to drive aboard.
We entered the passenger area of two top decks, accommodating close to 800 passengers (we were 436 on this trip) in long lines of seats, as many as 30 across, with tables that fold down from the back of the seat ahead. On the upper seating deck are rows of two seats abreast near the high windows. No portholes on this ship.
"Let's park ourselves and our gear right here," Beth said, indicating a short aisle row next to a window.
"Let's explore the ship before we take off," Jason said -- his airline terminology seemed entirely appropriate.
"Let's not," I said, as a formidable jet-propelled roar resounded.
With surprising ease and enormous panache, we began moving past the small islands outlying Bar Harbor and soon had attained a speed of some 40 miles an hour. I kept waiting for us to be airborne. My first erroneous expectation of this flight on the sea's surface envisioned wide-open decks, deck chairs and sun-drenched areas. Had that been the case, passengers would have been blown into the frigid Atlantic. My stock of sunscreen, sweaters and visor caps indicated my preconceptions -- not to mention my store of inedible squashed sandwiches.
Directly behind our seats, a door led to an open observation deck at the stern. Leaning on the rail, we were treated to a dazzling sight. Two jet-propelled spumes rose high in the air from the hulls. The spumes became mist as they ascended, and beyond them, the wake caused by the ship's speed left long white trails on the ocean's green surface.
There were heavy swells but no breaking waves. The ship developed a roll sufficiently pronounced that for anyone intrepid enough to walk about, holding onto seat backs and stair railings became a sensible tactic. Jason's complexion acquired a distinctly greenish hue. Beth went to the cafe for coffee. Queasy, I pretended to read my book's wavering print.
But the ship became steadier as we progressed. The surface of the sea was calmer, and we moved into a heavy fog (the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy specialize in fog).
We went our separate ways: Beth to take photographs; Jason to find a fresh-air spot on a slice of open deck up by the bridge; I to satisfy my curiosity by tormenting the crew with questions about their duties and facts about the ship.
The crew is mostly Canadian (the parent company of Bay Ferries Ltd., operators of The Cat, is on Prince Edward Island) and many live in the Yarmouth area. They work 12-hour days for a week, then have a week off. The ferry runs till the end of October. This winter, it may return to Australia for service.
In the course of the five-hour round trip, I covered the gift shop, the cafe, the vast underground decks where vehicles are parked and the bridge. The gift shop's best seller is liquor, which for Canadians is close to 50 percent cheaper. Next in sales are tapes of Nova Scotian musicians.
I bypassed the bar in the interests of sobriety, and the casino (slot machines, black jack and poker) in the interests of economy. I checked out the cafe.
In the interior's snugly welded garage decks, with a 240-vehicle capacity, the hypercautious driver of one car had attached his steering wheel safety lock against the prospect of a thief driving it through the hull and atop the waves; on the dashboard of another car, a white cat snoozed peaceably despite the jet's roar. Ken Winter, the purser, showed me the operation of the 10 inflatable life rafts (each with a capacity of 100 passengers), which can be activated within minutes.
The fog lifted. Yarmouth harbor appeared in the distance; I wished I had been on land to see us approaching. The sun shone. We debarked for 45 minutes; Jason's complexion improved on terra firma, and I marveled at the contrast between our Yarmouth landing area and that in Bar Harbor.
Yarmouth looked more like a Maine coastal fishing town half a century ago, while the backdrop of Bar Harbor's departure area consisted of upscale lodgings with tennis courts and swimming pools. From this limited perspective, Yarmouth appeared to be an unspoiled charmer, as natural and hunkered down as its rocky, pine-strewn, working-vessel environment; Bar Harbor, beyond its pleasure craft, looked sophisticatedly inviting, augmented by Acadia National Park, whose entrance is close by the ferry terminal.
On the return trip, we had mostly different passengers, different vehicles, a calm sea, breaking clouds and a fog-free skim atop the ocean at some 40 miles an hour.
"Try to savor the environment," said Beth, who was fed up with my scouring the innards of the ship. "Come up to the open deck rail by the bridge and see what you've been missing."
Both she and Jason are avid bird-watchers and sea-creature aficionados. With their help, I saw many storm petrels, a cormorant flying parallel to and at the same speed as The Cat, schools of harbor porpoises, some dolphins and I'd like to say a whale, but alas none appeared. Yet on the bridge, we observed through a window a woman who is conducting a five-day-a-week whale watch study on these trips.
The captain, David Doucet, sided by the navigator and chief engineer, occupies a bridge area whose radar and computer goodies rival those of a jet plane's cockpit. Captain Doucet shared a minute with me, and I learned that he had accompanied The Cat on its leisurely three-week trip up from Australia. They traveled at a moderate speed (30 m.p.h.), with stopovers in Tahiti and Panama. His enthusiasm revealed his pride and admiration of The Cat, with its maneuverability, unequaled passenger-ship speed and seaworthy capabilities.
What didn't I like about the ship? I'm too queasy to go on it if the sea were really rough, I wish that announcements on the public address system were more intelligible and that the video screen map of our progress were less indistinguishable. In other words, piddling complaints for an exhilarating experience.
"The next time," Beth told me, "try not to talk to so many people, interrupting their duties. And no more squashed sandwiches."
"Add a sprinkling of seasick remedy," Jason suggested, "to make them truly appetizing."
Next time they can bring their own.

 Shoving Off
Through Oct. 3, the Cat departs Bar Harbor at 8 A.M. and 3:30 P.M., and Yarmouth at 12:30 and 8 P.M. From Oct. 4 to Oct. 30, it leaves Bar Harbor at 10 A.M. and Yarmouth at 3 P.M. (These are local times; Yarmouth is in a different time zone from Bar Harbor, so a 12:30 departure from Yarmouth would be at 11:30 Bar Harbor time.)
 
 What's Aboard
The Cat has a cafe that serves snacks, rolls, muffins, fruit, coffee, and light meals, like chicken or lobster wraps ($6.45), chili ($4.50) and chowder. Seating areas on the cafe deck have a number of small tables.
There is a bar, the Wave Piercer; a casino with slot machines, black jack and poker; a duty-free gift shop with bargains on liquor and tapes of Nova Scotia regional music, as well as good-looking sweaters and T-shirts and postcards and placemats. Free children's movies are shown in the family area.
Seating areas and rest rooms are kept scrupulously clean, and there are changing stations for infants.

Rembrandt, by Rembrandt
 
 Q. I have heard that there will be an exhibit of Rembrandt's self-portraits next year, both at the National Gallery in London and the Maurits huis in The Hague. Do you know the dates? -- Jim Graham, Flint, Mich.
 
 A. Rembrandt wrote his autobiography with a paintbrush, creating 60 self-portraits -- the first at age 20 or 21, the last at 63, shortly before his death in 1669. The paintings, drawings and etchings help trace his stylistic development, from youthful self-confidence to the searching portraits of old age. 
 Rembrandt painted himself in many roles: as artist, in extravagant dress, as the Apostle Paul and at the feet of Christ during the raising of the Cross. This exhibit, which will first be shown in London before moving to The Hague, will study the significance of these varying depictions as well as the facial expressions the artist chose. It will include numerous paintings and about 30 of his etchings and drawings. In addition, a small selection of works by Rembrandt's students will show how their self-portraits were influenced by their teacher. The works will be on loan from the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, the United States and other countries.
 The show is first scheduled to run at the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square in London from June 9 through Sept. 5, 1999. Early plans are for 40 paintings and 35 etchings and drawings by Rembrandt to be on display. There will be an admission charge to the exhibition (the permanent collections are free), to be called "Rembrandt by Himself," but it has not been set yet. Information: (44-171) 747-2885.
The Mauritshuis, 8 Korte Vijverberg, The Hague, has chosen the simpler name "Rembrandt Himself" for the show, to run from Sept. 25, 1999, to Jan. 9, 2000. This exhibition will feature 25 paintings, fewer than the number at the National Gallery. Tickets for the Mauritshuis show will be available beginning June 1, 1999, and will be sold for specific entry times. Visitors will have a one-hour window in which to arrive and will be able to stay as long as they wish. For information, call (31-70) 302-3456.
 
Buenos Aires Hotels
 
 Q. My husband and I will be staying in Buenos Aires in November. We saw that one major American chain hotel costs $390 a night. Can you suggest something more moderate? -- Mary Jane Baker, Portland, Ore.
 
A. Here are three possibilities:
The Hotel Plaza Francia, 2189 Schiaffino, telephone and fax (54-1) 804-9631, has 50 smallish but cozy rooms in the elegant Recoleta district. Nearby are trendy shopping centers, outdoor cafes and major museums. Rooms at the front of the hotel offer views of the pretty tree-lined streets below. A double room is $152.46 to $175.45, including tax and Continental breakfast.
Overlooking the Libertad Plaza and two blocks from the Teatro Colon is the Hotel Bisonte, 1207 Paraguay Street, (54-1) 816-5770, fax (54-1) 816-5775. The 87 rooms are not overly elegant, but they are comfortable and are particular favorites for business travelers, with their computer ports and 24-hour room service. A double is $169.40, with tax and buffet breakfast.
If you want to go higher on the amenity (and price) scale, the Hotel Claridge, 535 Tucuman Street, (54-1) 314-7700, fax (54-1) 314-8022, is a traditional English-style hotel in the middle of the financial district. The 161 rooms are large and well-appointed, and there is an outdoor pool. The Claridge Grill is one of the city's better-known restaurants. Doubles: $290, with tax but no breakfast.
 
Airport Parking
 
 Q. I recently left my car in the Kennedy Airport long-term lot for a week. The cost was reasonable, but after leaving the lot, I noticed that my license plate number was on my credit-card receipt. How is this done and why? -- Leonard A. O'Connor, Watertown, Conn.
 
A. How your license-plate number gets on your receipt is fairly simple -- the cashier in the booth can see it thanks to a mirror (it's also recorded by a video camera) and enters it in the register. But the background is a little more complex.
Bill Cahill, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that operates La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark airports, said that in 1991 the authority installed a computerized revenue-control system for the daily and long-term lots at each airport. One problem at these lots in the 1980's was car theft, but the new system has helped reduce that. Each night, an employee with a hand-held computer records the license plate number and location of each car parked in these lots. Besides helping to reduce auto theft, it also helps the authority to find out where travelers like to park and for how long, data that can be used to improve customer service. If a customer has a complaint about a cashier, that employee can be identified. And if you come home from your trip with so many great memories that you forgot where you parked your car, the computer can find it for you.
Mr. Cahill also said that by the end of the year, the Port Authority planned to have at least one lot at each of the three airports that accepted payment with EZ Pass, the system now used at the authority's bridges and tunnels to automatically record toll charges for drivers.
 
Nevis Runway
 
 Q. I really enjoy the island of Nevis in the Caribbean, but it takes the better part of a day to get there since I must first fly to San Juan, then to St. Kitts, then switch planes for Nevis. The runway at the island's airport is being lengthened. How soon can I expect direct flights from, say, San Juan? -- John Wellenbach, Narberth, Pa.
 
A. The runway, which is being extended to 4,000 feet to accommodate larger jets, was originally scheduled to be completed this month, said Christine Walwyn of the St. Kitts and Nevis Department of Tourism, but the target is now early next year.
Unfortunately, neither American Airlines nor its subsidiary, American Eagle, plans to provide more direct service to Nevis after the project is completed. "It wouldn't make economic sense for either one of the airlines to do it at this time," said Mitch Baranowski, an American Airlines spokesman.
So for now, you will just have to keep taking those 10-minute flights from St. Kitts (there's also a 45-minute ferry trip instead), or try the longer flights from Anguilla, Antigua, St. Barts, St. Croix and St. Maarten. JOSEPH SIANO

HEADLINE: Portraits of the Past For the Mashantucket

BYLINE: By BESS LIEBENSON 

 BODY:
THE Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center has been much anticipated. Dominated by a tower and steel-ribbed glass abstraction of a wigwam, the $135 million, 308,000-square-foot center officially opens on Tuesday, but has already been selected for the 1998 American Architecture Award given by the Chicago Athenaeum.
The center steps down a hillside. Boulders and rock outcroppings deposited by glacial movement define the land. 
 "It's the only museum of its type in the world in terms of being about, owned and operated by indigenous people," said Steve Dennin, director of marketing and development for the center. "It has been over 20 years in the planning. Long before the casino, this tribe had the desire to tell its story . . . the story of an Eastern Woodland tribe, a story they felt had not been told, and to tell it in a thoughtful, carefully researched manner. The idea grew."
Along with creating housing, economic opportunities and pursuing Federal recognition, "The tribe has long wanted to foster research and education," said Dr. Kevin A. McBride, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Connecticut in Storrs and director of research at the museum. "The tribe wanted to redress several inaccuracies of Pequot history portrayed in history books -- for example that the Pequots were extinct. The museum tells the complete story of a people over a long period of time."
The journey begins at an imposing glass and steel Gathering Space -- an engineering feat of semicircular roof and suspended glass soaring 60 feet and floored with seashells imbedded in blue terrazzo, one of the building's three basic architectural elements. There is a research center and a library with archeological laboratories and archives.
The tour travels chronological paths -- moving from the last Ice Age to the present, recounting Mashantucket Pequot history, that of other tribes and of the region's environment. Broken into zones, the whole complex makes it easy at three different points to stop out for films in auditoriums or lunch at the restaurant, which beyond staples will introduce a changing selection of Native American cuisine.
The welcome sign -- "Listen here, go right in, the door is open -- this is my family" -- was written by a tribal member and is an invitation to all. For the visually impaired, there are talking signs with selected artifacts -- spearheads, fur clothing and tools -- to touch. The hearing-impaired will have access to closed-captioned films, computer interactives and videos.
Throughout, sounds and scents add realism. "You're kicked back 20,000 years into the glacial period," said Michael A. Hanke, principal of Design Division Inc. in New York, who in consultation with tribal members is responsible for the design of the 85,000-square-foot exhibit space. Visitors walk through an atmospheric ice blue undulating crevasse, feel chilling air, see and hear water cascading down a waterfall, then enter an exhibit showing how glaciers shaped modern-day land forms.
From there they encounter a 50 foot in diameter diorama with a broad blue sky and black spruce trees, reaching up. Life-size hunters (cast from real people) are shown throwing spears. One side depicts the kill, the other, the harvesting and butchering.
Viewers pass through changing social and natural environments 6,000 years ago, and on to the re-creation of a 16th-century coastal Pequot village. This is a high-tech 22,000-square-foot "immersion environment" showing daily life leading up to European contact. They walk among chestnuts, oak and maples, through wigwams and past handcrafted figures cooking, talking and working, sounds accompanied by aromas of woodlands and campfires.
Another setting introduces Dutch and English settlers and their impact, trade and mounting tensions. A 30-minute film "The Witness," dramatizes the Pequot war (1636-1638). Then a recreation of a farmstead house, circa 1780, invites visitors to a two-acre farmstead including orchards and gardens.
"Many people have misinformation and bias about native culture, past and present," Dr. McBride said. "We hope the museum will create awareness of native people, the Pequots in particular, and the complexity of their culture."
"It's intended as a noneditorial view of the history," Mr. Hanke said, "an attempt to get away from stereotypes."
 
The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center is at 110 Pequot Trail, off Route 2 and Route 214 near the Foxwoods Resort and Casino, in the Mashantucket section of Ledyard. It is open seven days from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. (860-396-6800).

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Spotlight Finds an Always-Moving Choreographer

BYLINE: By VALERIE GLADSTONE; Valerie Gladstone is co-author with Robert Maiorano of "Balanchine's 'Mozartiana': The Making of a Masterpiece."

 BODY:
THE choreographer Donald McKayle can be as difficult to locate as he is to classify. Instead of staying in one place, he shuttles between New York and California. Rather than create dances for just one medium, he regularly invents them for Broadway, television, film and the concert stage. He loves choreographing but enjoys teaching just as much. Moreover, these are not the only unusual aspects of his life. When he started his modern dance company in New York in 1951, Alvin Ailey, Arthur Mitchell, Lar Lubovitch and Eliot Feld were among its first members.
Although as a black choreographer and teacher, Mr. McKayle has greatly inspired young blacks, both Ailey and Mr. Mitchell achieved more recognition for their advancement of blacks in dance. And Mr. Lubovitch and Mr. Feld have won more renown as choreographers. Why? Most people in the dance world believe Mr. McKayle has not, until recently, received due recognition because he has refused to specialize in one medium or to be identified solely as an African-American artist. But in making those choices he was only being true to himself. 
 Now, at 68, Mr. McKayle increasingly finds himself in the limelight. "It's hard to keep up with all the awards and honors I receive," he said, sounding amused. "Next, they'll try to bronze me." In 1995, he won a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts to create a student dance company at the University of California at Irvine, where he has been a professor of dance since 1989. The next year, an award of $100,000 from the National Dance Residency Program made it possible for him to serve as resident choreographer of the Jose Limon Dance Company for two years. This support also gave him time to write his autobiography, "I Will Dance With You," which Gordon and Breach Publishers will bring out next summer.
Now Lincoln Center Out of Doors is celebrating Mr. McKayle. On Thursday and Friday and on Aug. 20 and 21, the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company and the Limon Dance Company will honor him with performances of his works. The programs feature "Games" and "Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder," two modern-dance classics, and the New York premiere of "Heartbeats," commissioned by the Limon company. "He's a master and among the most humane people in dance," says Jenneth Webster, the festival's producer.
Although Mr. McKayle spends more time on the West Coast than on the East, New York City holds warm memories for him. "I first fell in love with dance in the New York Public Library," he said. "As a boy, I went there to research my heritage and moved on to dance." Encouraged by his Jamaican parents, he continued his studies at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, where he found photos and books on major artists of the past. "It wasn't long before I went to a performance," he said. "That did it. Immediately, I wanted to dance myself."
IN 1947, at the age of 17, Mr. McKayle arrived at the midtown studios of the New Dance Group, where he encountered some of the most innovative figures in modern dance: Pearl Primus, Sophie Maslow, Jean Erdman, William Bales and Hadassah were all teaching there. No one style prevailed at the New Dance Group, so Mr. McKayle tried them all. Later he danced briefly with the companies of Martha Graham, Anna Sokolow and Merce Cunningham.
These disparate experiences left an indelible impression on Mr. McKayle. Although he often uses African-American traditions and themes, to call him an African-American choreographer would be as misleading as to label Balanchine a Russian one. He knows East Indian and flamenco styles as well as he knows African, and he incorporates all of them into his choreography. "I've never thought, 'This is my culture, and that is your culture,' in relation to anyone from anywhere," he said. "How could I? I'm too mixed. My middle name is Cohen, after my Jewish-English grandfather."
Mr. McKayle's "Games," his first major piece, set the tone for all his works. Made for his company in 1951, it deals with children at play in the city's streets. Calling upon his memories of the fears that haunt urban children, he shows how danger threatens their fun. "Long before child abuse became an everyday news story," said Joe Nash, a dance historian, "Donny made you feel its reality. He's a master of theater."
His next important dance, "Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder" (1959), depicts the suffering and hopes of a group of men on a chain gang. As in many of his works, his powerful, rhythmic movements convey the strong, archetypal emotions that drive human beings. "These became classics," said Judith Jamison, artistic director of the Ailey company, "because there's no dillydallying about the point. They touch the heart."
Mr. McKayle didn't work in a variety of mediums simply for self-fulfillment. As a husband and father of three children, he felt obliged to look for economic stability outside of concert dance, which barely sustains its members. Although his company achieved success with works like "Her Name Was Harriet" (1952), about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad, and "District Storyville" (1962), which chronicled the growth of jazz, he could not support his family on its earnings. Consequently, in 1969, he dissolved his troupe and went to California to choreograph for several television series.
Over the following decades Mr. McKayle also worked on films, among them "Bed knobs and Broomsticks" (1971), with Angela Lansbury, and "The Jazz Singer" (1980), with Neil Diamond and Laurence Olivier. At the same time, he managed to fit in Broadway, collecting Tony nominations for "Golden Boy" (1964), starring Sammy Davis Jr., and "Sophisticated Ladies" (1981).
"First, I took on projects just for the money," he said. "But once I got involved, I discovered I liked working with actors and singers. Every process feeds another. Frankly, being a purist would have bored me. If I ever got fed up with people in one field, I knew I could go someplace else." His forays into television, film and theater did not cost him his place in modern dance. He continued to choreograph for many troupes, including the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theater and Lula Washington's Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theater.
At Lincoln Center Out of Doors, Tamica Washington, a principal with the Washington company, will perform "Los Angelitos Negroes" from "Songs of the Disinherited" (1991). "I love Mr. McKayle's way of using bodies to make contours and shapes," she said. "Movement just flows from him. This piece especially affected me. It asks artists, 'Why don't you paint black angels?' "
Although Mr. McKayle often deals with serious subjects, his works never lack humor and romance. A passionate music lover, he came up with a group of deeply emotional songs from many countries for "Heartbeats." They convey everything from a young girl's musings on love to the anguish of a wartime separation. "Each song reveals a particular way of connecting to life," Mr. McKayle said. "I know so many. I always wake with a song on my lips."
Fame may have arrived late for him, but apparently joie de vivre did not.

HEADLINE: Habitats/Fran Reiter's Co-op at 11th Street and Second Avenue;
A Former Deputy Mayor Buys Into Her Family's Past

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL 

 BODY:
IN 1928, Fran Reiter's grandfather finished construction of the first luxury high-rise apartment building on the Lower East Side, a building that became a center for the Jewish intelligentsia and theatrical community that thrived in the neighborhood. It was so appealing that the family left its town house farther south to move into a nine-room apartment with high ceilings, a large foyer and an eat-in kitchen.
A year later the stock market crashed, and with it the economic well-being of many people who lived in the building. They couldn't pay their rent. Graciousness and kindness demanded that people be given a little leeway, because after all, who wants to make a neighbor homeless? 
 "His tenants were his friends," says Ms. Reiter, the president of the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau, and a former deputy mayor and campaign manager for Rudolph W. Giuliani. "When no one could pay their rent, they stayed -- which is a nice way of saying he lost my inheritance." Because, inevitably, her grandfather, Herman Bauman, could no longer make the mortgage payments, and in 1933 the bank took possession of the building.
The family stayed on, for although it was no longer rich it had the means to pay the rent. Now, 70 years after her grandfather built the building at 170 Second Avenue, Ms. Reiter has taken back a piece of it. A few months ago, she bought an apartment in the building, or rather she bought shares in the co-op that now owns it.
For Ms. Reiter, whose nonprofit organization is the official marketing agent for the city, the building at the corner of 11th Street has been home for almost all of her 44 years. To her, its mix of people, and its neighborhood filled with small shop owners who know most of their customers by sight, represent what is best and most important about New York. It is not anonymous and distant; on the contrary, it is as personal and interconnected as the mythical American small town.
She bought her apartment after living there as a tenant for 18 years. And she moved there after living upstairs with her parents and older brother from birth, except for a few years in college and a few months in Ohio. In something of an understatement, she explains, "I don't like to move."
Her roots in the building, across the street from Peter Stuyvesant's grave, are so deep that she says being an owner rather than a renter does not make her feelings any more profound. But the fact of ownership has made one difference. She wants to renovate the apartment, something she never did as a renter. And she wants to spiff it up.
After five years of working first in Mr. Giuliani's campaign and then in his administration, she says, her home life is a little tattered. "I haven't served a meal in five years," she says. "You do subjugate your life."
A collection of unusual teapots serves as a testament to a domestic -- and collecting -- urge. "I'll put in a new kitchen," she says, "and take down my 1970's bookshelves." She also plans to have the apartment painted and the wall-to-wall carpeting replaced.
AND if the work becomes bothersome, she will probably escape upstairs to the apartment where her mother still lives, and which her mother also recently bought. It's the apartment Ms. Reiter grew up in, although it's not the one her grandparents first took. As their children grew up and moved away, her grandparents moved into smaller apartments. Ultimately, Ms. Reiter's mother and grandmother, and then her mother and father, lived in the two-bedroom apartment where Ms. Reiter spent her childhood.
Upstairs in her mother's apartment, Ms. Reiter can show you the regular seat she had at the kitchen table, across from her mother, flanked by her brother and father. "All the important things happened around the table," she says. "I think the disintegration of family life started with the doing away with the eat-in kitchen."
In the 11- by 15-foot bedroom she and her brother, Jonathan, shared, she can show you how their territories were delineated by a wall unit that ran down the middle. (He now lives a few blocks away.) Their identical reading lights and their identical closets are still in the room.
Ms. Reiter went off to Boston University intending to work in theater as a director and producer, and she did for a while, but a temporary job in New York led her into the television syndication business, and she liked it.
In 1980 she realized that she was in New York for good, with no more theatrical road trips, and that she could no longer camp out with her parents. She and a friend looked for an apartment together, but in the perennial lament of New Yorkers found only sky-high rents. Just before total despair set in, salvation arrived, albeit sadly.
"All of a sudden, two people in this building died on the same day," she says. Having lived in the building forever, she was part of the "telegraph system" that alerts everyone to anything important. And she was friendly with the former superintendent, who had moved up in the organization and had some clout. He got her the apartment, which made the leap from the mid $300's to $400 a month when it moved with the vacancy from rent control to rent stabilization.
There was one problem, but she decided to get over it. "I was going to be living in the same building with my parents," she says. "As close as I am to my parents, well . . . , " she says, her voice trailing off, no need to state the obvious. "But it was too good a deal."
For her, it has proved to be a great deal. Her mother, Shirley, is upstairs, seemingly willing to put her up and feed her whenever necessary, and yet not desirous of invading her privacy. "To this day 18 years later, I can probably count on both hands the number of times my mother has been in this apartment," Ms. Reiter says. "She respects my space far more than I respect hers."
In fact, when Ms. Reiter first moved in, she quickly got into the habit of eating with her parents. Her roommate, an actress, was waiting tables at night and she didn't want to eat alone.
"I was forever going up there for dinner," she says, "until my mother stopped feeding me," which happened after her father, Louis, retired and her mother took a job as a secretary. Now her mother is widowed, and they more often go out to restaurants together.
MS. REITER, whose roommate left after two years, had a chance to buy her apartment 10 years ago, when the building became a co-op, but like most of the tenants declined because the maintenance far exceeded the rent. But in the last few years, more tenants have been buying as higher rents and lower interest rates have eroded the disadvantage of buying.
In addition, the company that turned the building into a co-op lost possession of its unsold shares, leaving most of the shares to a bank that was anxious to get rid of them. The bank offered the tenants deals they couldn't refuse, Ms. Reiter says. She declines to name the price she paid for her two-bedroom apartment but says she recently had it assessed at three to four times what she paid.
The neighborhood, Ms. Reiter says, is thriving after a long period of difficulty. In the 1980's, her work in the television business took her to many cities, and many of them seemed better than New York. "This is a city I really thought was on the decline," she says. Occasionally, she would think about leaving. But then things started to improve. And while she was working for the Giuliani administration, she grew to know it much better.
"When I became deputy mayor," she says, "I was 40, and I had never been to Jamaica, Queens. I had never been to Woodlawn, or Bensonhurst."
Her work took her everywhere, she says, "and it was wonderful. It was a revelation to me. I fell in love with my own city." And now, she says, "I certainly don't think about leaving."

HEADLINE: Where's the Blame In Lilco Buyout?

 BODY:
The politicians howled for the head of William J. Catacosinos -- and they got it. Until July 31, Mr. Catacosinos was chairman of Marketspan, a new corporate creature created from the remains of Lilco and Brooklyn Union Gas.
When the old Lilco board voted him a bonus of $42 million for the year, Governor Pataki and other pols put the heat on Marketspan to dump Mr. Catacosinos. Now the company has given in and pushed their $42 million baby overboard. 
 Mr. Catacosinos did not ask for the $42 million. He demanded $70 million. And no doubt about it, he was robbed. He is America's most underpaid executive, bar none.
For 12 years, the Suffolk County government paid me to investigate Mr. Catacosinos, beginning the day he took over Lilco. A quick review of my files on Billy Cat shows a man underestimated time after time.
Among the milestones of his decade and a half reign at Lilco: the state penalized the company $1.7 billion for mismanagement. The company paid $400 million to settle racketeering charges brought by the county government and an additional $50 million to settle claims of securities fraud. The state forced Mr. Catacosinos to close his unquestionably dangerous Shoreham nuclear plant, the most expensive plant ever built and never run.
Mr. Catacosinos first gave the public a taste of his unique management style when, in 1985, Hurricane Gloria left 750,000 homes in the dark. In response, the chairman ordered all workers off vacation, while he continued his Mediterranean cruise.
Mr. Catacosinos created what a former local legislator calls, quite accurately, "the highest priced, least reliable, most arrogant and, when they owned Shoreham, most dangerous electric company in America." Then he sold it to the state last month for more than $7 billion. Pure chutzpa, pure Catacosinos.
Investment bankers had valued the corporate mess called Lilco at substantially less. The windfall for Lilco shareholders will be tacked on to electricity bills over the next 40 years, with interest. Econometric models indicate the electricity surcharge will cost about 36,000 jobs.
Good for Bill. His job was to get the best deal for his stockholders and he got it.
But heads should roll. And its easy to identify whose. Mr. Pataki filed legal challenges to the Catacosinos bonus. But it was the Governor who cut the deal for the Long Island Power Authority to buy Lilco. It was Mr. Pataki who then shrouded over the bloated purchase price with accounting trickery. One of the Governor's degimmicks was to promise a bonus -- $101 in Suffolk and $232 in Nassau -- to every Long Island ratepayer as a benefit of the deal. He did not mention that the bonus was due from Lilco anyway, the final payments on the racketeering and other court settlements.
And it was the Governor who personally injected himself into negotiations and caved in to Mr. Catacosinos's every bullying (and brilliant) demand. The Governor called the $42 million for Mr. Catacosinos "an extraordinary secret act of greed." Hardly. Several analysts, myself included, warned his office that the giveaway from the public's purse would trigger Mr. Catacosinos's golden parachute and stock options, the source of the bonus. The bonus was neither extraordinary nor secret, but the takeover deal cut by the Governor was both.
Mr. Catacosinos's true crime was that the bonus for his success exposed the government's failure.
Mr. Catacosinos does not work for the public, but for his shareholders, whom he has served frighteningly well. But Governor Pataki is supposed to work for the long-suffering electricity customers. He has demanded the resignation of the man responsible for this costly mess.
That, Mr. Pataki, is an excellent idea.

Public/Private Deal Saves Hunterdon Farm

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE 54-acre Lane Farm on Pleasant Run Road in Readington Township, with its 156-year-old farmhouse, water tower and barn, has long served as a reminder of this Hunterdon County community's rural past.
But with increasing development pressure swirling around the 48-square-mile township the municipality, like others in the state, has stepped up efforts to preserve that past by conserving its open land, including parcels like the Lane Farm. While the development group that owned the farm could have built 18 single-family homes, the property is also bordered by other farms that the township feared could be amassed for a 150-home subdivision. 
 In June, after 18 months of planning and negotiations, Readington was not only able to keep the Lane Farm permanently protected, but also managed to preserve its historic buildings and create public access to township-owned recreational space. It did so with the help of the Morristown office of the Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit conservation group, which devised a creative three-way transaction between the township, the state and a private buyer.
The trust purchased the hilltop farm from its owner for $620,000. It then sold both five acres at the edge of the property, which will be used for a public trail, and the development rights on the remaining 49 acres to the township under the New Jersey Green Acres Program. The 49 acres then were sold to a private owner with deed restrictions requiring that the property be left open or farmed in perpetuity and that the structures be renovated.
The transaction marks the first time the state has used Green Acres funds to work with the combination of a nonprofit group, a municipality and a private party to protect and preserve historic and natural resources, said Kevin S. Richardson, principal planner in the Bureau of Green Trust Management within the state's Green Acres Program. Conservationists say the deal underscores the value of public-private partnerships and provides a method to achieve multiple preservation goals as well as to stretch public funds at a time when competition for such funds is fierce.
"Any tool that we can effectively use to preserve a meaningful amount of farmland and open space is an advantage," said Julia C. Allen, a Readington Township committee member, referring to the transaction. While the township -- whose population has increase by 25 percent to 16,000 in the last decade -- has preserved 2,000 acres of land, there are still 14,000 acres of developable farmland within its borders.
The 37-year-old Green Acres program has been the main source of funds to state, county and local government agencies for preserving open space. In 1991 it began offering nonprofit conservation groups matching grants, which have been used to buy land that would be kept open to the public.
In the case of the Lane Farm the township holds the deed restrictions on the 49 acres and on the five-acre parcel and the state, to protect its interest, holds secondary rights of enforcement on both. To provide the required public access the five-acre parcel will serve as part of a greenway leading through a cluster housing development to a township park and ballfields. Because it is along the banks of Pleasant Run Creek, which flows into the south branch of the Raritan River, it also helps preserve the waterway and offers a scenic view corridor to the public.
The Readington transaction shows that "towns don't have to buy an entire parcel to achieve their open space objective and the state's goal of public access," said Mr. Richardson, the Green Acres planner. In such cooperative projects "costs are shared, helping to leverage both of our funds," he said. Mr. Richardson said he already knew of at least three other nonprofit groups hoping to do similar transactions.
THE movement by conservation groups and municipalities to keep parts of New Jersey forever natural has strengthened in recent years as the pace of development, stoked by a strong economy, has gained momentum.
Late last month the Legislature passed a bill calling for a referendum in November on whether the state should spend $1 billion over the next 10 years to preserve a million acres of undeveloped land -- half of it as open space and half as farmland. The bill also poses the question of whether to amend the state constitution so that the state can dedicate up to $98 million a year in state sales-tax revenue over the next 30 years. The money would be used to buy the million acres and retire bonds. If the referendum were approved, it would also give the state the authority to issue an additional $1 billion in bonds for preservation purposes.
The referendum also would give New Jersey its first stable source of financing for open-space acquisition. In the last 37 years $1.39 billion for such acquisitions has come from nine voter-approved bond issues, which have permanently preserved 922,000 acres under two state programs. They are Green Acres and the state's Farmland Preservation program.
In Readington, the Trust for Public Land began working with the township in 1994 to help preserve land, like the Lane Farm, along three main stream corridors that run through the community. A year later it received a $500,000 matching grant from the state's Green Acres program to do just that.
Typically, the trust secures land and holds it until sufficient funds are raised for a public agency or nonprofit group to buy it. In Readington three entities were brought together to buy the Lane Farm.
"The benefit to the township is that it is preserving this property for about one-third of its purchase price while not having to take on the responsibility of managing the land and restoring the buildings," said Julie A. Enger, project manager at the trust's Morristown office. In addition, selling the 49 restricted acres to a private owner also keeps the property on the tax rolls, she said.
The trust negotiated a deal with Wilshire Farms L.L.C., a land investment and development group in Somerville, which owned the farm to buy it for $620,000, which Bernard Senger of Somerville, the managing partner, described as reasonable.
THEN the trust was able to sell the development rights on 49 acres as well as the five-acre greenway parcel to the township for $386,000. Half the purchase price was financed by $193,000 from the state Green Acres grant the trust received and the matching half came from the township's open space trust fund. The 49 deed-restricted acres were sold to Dr. Marcia M. Zweerink for $300,000.
The best way to protect the land was to put it into the hands of a private owner, said Ms. Enger, noting that the sale shows that there is a market for properties even with restrictions. The trust worked for six months with the state to come up with the deed restrictions that "are strict and binding, yet livable enough" to meet the needs of all three parties, she said.
Township officials agreed. "We didn't just want to save the land for its agricultural use but for its open space, scenic, historic, recreational and environmental value," said Mrs. Allen, the township committee member. The added hope, she said, "is that the adjacent farms now will be thrown into preservation as well."
James T. Wall, the Readington Mayor, said the transaction produced "quite a bargain" to the township given the number of municipal goals it achieved. He said the township hoped to repeat the transaction to preserve one or two other farms in the community.
For Dr. Zweerink, buying the farm was an opportunity worth taking. She said she and her companion, James Brightwell, who have lived in Readington for five years, had searched for four months for a farm.
"But with the value of land and the pressures of development," she said, "the price of a site this large was well beyond my means or too far away from where we work." She is senior director of information services at the research division of Merck & Company in Rahway; he is a computer programmer.
She said she also welcomed the deed restrictions because she had no intention of developing the farm. And despite the renovations required to restore the farm buildings, "the value of the house and barn after the restoration will be greater than what we will put into them," she said.
Eventually, Dr. Zweerink, who has two Morgan horses, said she would like to raise and breed such horses on the site and perhaps even train sheep dogs. Right now, however, the land will continue to be farmed, she said, adding that in the end "the township gets the land protected and we get a magnificent place to live."

HEADLINE: Life Stirs Again in A Theater Long Dark

BYLINE: By PEGGY McCARTHY 

 BODY:
AFTER nine years of darkness, the old Shakespeare Theater in Stratford is getting cleaned, painted, and repaired for reopening. New, lighted makeup mirrors hang in dressing rooms. Lanterns, helmets and the chaise Katharine Hepburn reclined on in "Antony and Cleopatra" are neatly organized in prop rooms. The brass water fountains and theater seats, relocated decades ago from the Ziegfield theater in Manhattan, are clean again. And there are modern additions, including handicapped access ramps and a web site (www.Stratfordfestival.com).
On a recent sunny morning, Louis S. Burke, the theater's artistic director who initiated the current project, was bursting with enthusiasm. "You can feel just how extraordinary this is," he said. "I want to see what I've been dreaming about come to fruition." Decked out in a wide-brimmed straw hat, a black shirt with white polka dots, slacks, and sandals, he recalled that when he first visited the theater in 1986, it was so musty that mushrooms were growing inside. 
 On April 16, Mr. Burke and his partners in what is now called the Stratford Festival Theater signed a purchase and sale agreement with the state, the property's owner. Since then, they have been working to get the theater in good enough shape for some performances before the end of this year and to launch a full season next June, Mr. Burke said.
The goal is to stage a production of "Twelfth Night" directed by Mr. Burke for student audiences this year, as well as offer performances by visiting companies, he said. Negotiations are underway for a one-woman performance by a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and visiting opera and ballet companies, Mr. Burke said.
Soundfest, an organization devoted to the Long Island Sound and not connected with the theater, has scheduled a festival on the theater property on Labor Day weekend. And the theater is the centerpiece of a planned $180 million development. On the 14.4 acre property, it would include two other theaters, a theater museum and a five-story addition to the main theater for rehearsal halls. In nearby neighborhoods, inns, hotels, restaurants and shops would be established. The nonprofit portion on the theater property is expected to cost $80 million.
The closing on the theater property is scheduled for Dec. 15 and is contingent on the buyers' meeting a list of requirements: compliance with building and fire codes, obtaining environmental permits, devising development, financial and site plans, submitting development and construction documents for renovation work, and obtaining title insurance, according to Richard K. Clifford, chief of outdoor recreation for the State Department of Environmental Protection.
So far, partners in the theater have paid the state $50,000, and an additional $100,000 is due at the closing with nine annual payments of $150,000 to follow, Mr. Clifford said. The buyers also made a $350,000 escrow deposit before execution of the purchase and sale agreement, and subsequent deposits to total $1.7 million are to be paid on a scheduled time frame, Mr. Clifford explained.
The agreement was entered into by the state as seller and the Stratford Festival Theater Inc. and Brickhill-Burke Productions Ltd. as buyers.
During the administration of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the state had authorized $3.5 million in bonding for the theater, but that was rescinded early in the administration of Gov. John G. Rowland.
State Senator George L. Gunther, Republican of Stratford, said he'd like to see the theater receive substantial financial help from the state as have other theaters, including Oakdale in Wallingford, the Shubert in New Haven and the Polka Dot Playhouse in Bridgeport.
"It's time for Stratford to get a little bit of its share," he said.
Meanwhile, the work of carpenters, painters and volunteers is creating a buzz among theater enthusiasts. Alan Alda sent a check when he heard about the effort, said Louis D. Pietig, resident director and secretary-treasurer of the theater. Sharon Challenger, a set designer who has been volunteering at the theater, reports visits from tourists interested in the work.
There hasn't been a full season at Stratford, which opened in 1955, since 1982. In 1989, a summer season was offered. Various efforts to revive the theater failed.
Paul S. Timpanelli, president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council and a member of the theater's advisory board, had expressed skepticism in the past about the current project's viability. But he is cautiously optimistic now. "There's some activity, so I'm assuming it's a good sign," he said.
The project is "important for the economic development of the town of Stratford as well as for the region," Mr. Timpanelli said.
Mr. Pietig said that the plan calls for completion of the entire project three years after the December closing. The state law that authorized the sale of the property requires a performance three years after the closing as well as a 20-year commitment to provide annual performances, including one Shakespearean play a year.
David W. Killeen, Stratford's town planner, said that town officials and theater representatives have begun discussions about boundaries for a theater district that would allow ancillary businesses to be established in nearby neighborhoods.
"The purpose of the entertainment district is to recognize that the theater by itself traditionally has not been self-sustaining," said Mr. Killeen. "In no way does it touch on tax breaks or anything of that nature," he said.
According to Mr. Pietig, the new complex would attract people for two to three days to attend performances in all three theaters.
"For there to be a real festival environment, you have to have more than one venue playing simultaneously," he said. He said projections are based on experiences elsewhere, such as Stratford on the Ontario in Canada where traditional audiences come from as far as Philadelphia and Chicago.
Mr. Burke said that the Ontario theater contributes $100 million a year to its local economy and predicted that the Connecticut theater would bring more to Stratford and the region because it is just 63 miles from New York City, a massive population base.
Dozens of prominent theater professionals have signed on as founding members of the revitalized theater, Liam Neeson, John Goodman, Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor, Natasha Richardson and Angela Lansbury among them.
Mr. Burke has spent years attempting to acquire the theater from the state. Now a Stratford resident, he is originally from South Africa where he ran the His Majesty Theater in Johannesburg. He was director and co-producer of "Meet Me in St. Louis" on Broadway in 1989.
Four years ago, the state chose a different preferred developer, only to rescind the choice later. Mr. Burke eventually prevailed with a $1.5 million purchase offer. He and Mr. Pietig have been joined in in the project by partners with development and financial experience including Jack Blumenfeld and John Cutler, from the BBC Development Corporation in Philadelphia.
Frederick B. Conze, a former officer of Citibank and member of the Darien Planning and Zoning Commission, is president of the theater board and Fred C. Frassinelli Jr. of Fairfield, who owns a construction management and consulting firm, is the board chairman. Cameron Clark Jr., of Fairfield, former president of Warnaco, is manager of the theater's capital campaign.

HEADLINE: Dissecting Data on Truck Accidents

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
ON the evening of June 14, a Sunday, a large tanker truck rig lumbered out of a petroleum storage complex in Bridgeport loaded with 8,500 gallons of gasoline, climbed up on Interstate 95, and headed east to make a delivery.
Traveling in the right hand lane, the driver rounded a curve onto the Moses Wheeler Bridge over the Housatonic River and found himself headed directly for a disabled car stopped in his lane. 
 Swerving left a beat too late, the truck hit the back of the car and overturned onto its side, miraculously without hitting any other vehicles. Only the truck driver was hurt, although not seriously. The accident left the tanker sprawled diagonally across all three lanes of the highway and gushing gasoline, which flowed into drains and poured into the river below, all 8,500 gallons of it.
The accident forced emergency personnel to close the highway's northbound and southbound lanes, creating long traffic jams in both directions and on Route 1, where traffic was diverted. It even temporarily shut down rail service on the main Metro-North and Amtrak lines, which cross the river on an adjacent bridge, for fear the gasoline might explode.
The next afternoon, another tractor trailer truck hit the interstate highway's median guard rail and flipped over in West Haven, a few miles east, causing traffic tie-ups in both directions that stretched through the rush hour. A week and a half after that, another truck exiting the highway in Bridgeport ran into the back of a small passenger car stopped on the ramp, crushing it, and seriously injuring the driver. There were also truck accidents on Interstates 84 and 91 around the same time.
These accidents, part of a sudden rash of mishaps involving large trucks, attracted the attention of State Representative Jacqueline Cocco of Bridgeport, a chairwoman of the state legislature's Transportation Committee. She and her colleague, State Senator Biagio Ciotto, the other leader of the committee, sent a letter to Gov. John G. Rowland appealing for an increase in State Police traffic patrols on interstate highways.
If State Police patrols increased, their higher visibility might make drivers slow down and drive more carefully, Mr. Ciotto said. "Just their presence will make a difference," added Mrs. Cocco. And in fact, up to 70 newly graduated troopers are scheduled to be patrolling the highways by late this month, state officials said.
But have trucks become more of a highway menace of late, or is it only a perception created by a statistically insignificant coincidence? The answer is there is no clear answer. Yes, there has been an increase in the number of accidents involving trucks, but no, the proportion ofaccidents involving trucks does not appear to have increased, according to Richard Martinez, Bureau Chief of Policy and Planning for the state Department of Transportation. "There's been an increase in total accidents," Mr. Martinez said.
Mrs. Cocco conceded that the recent cluster of accidents involving trucks might simply be a statistical aberration. "For four or five weeks, there was at least an accident every week," she said, but added, "Probably it was just a coincidence."
Mr. Ciotto wasn't so sure. "It's more than just perception," he said. "It's happening."
It's not, replied Mike Riley, president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, a trucking trade organization. "It's a perception," he said. "Police tell us in accidents with trucks, most of them were caused by car drivers."
One powerful factor influencing the public's perception is that traffic tie-ups tend to be worse when a truck is involved. Then too, because trucks are so much larger than passenger cars, the risk of serious injury to a car's occupant is increased. Impatient drivers stuck in a traffic jam reach the accident site, and seeing a truck they draw the conclusion that the truck caused it. "A truck accident is just going to draw more attention," observed Trooper Richard Alexande, of the State Police Public Information Office.
When the trucks are carrying hazardous materials, and even more so when there is a spill that requires clean up, accidents can create even longer highway closures and attract more news media attention.
Chris Bruhl, president of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford, cautioned against a reaction aimed solely at trucks. Mr. Bruhl is the chairman of the Coastal Corridor Coalition, a group of business, civic and environmental organizations trying to solve highway congestion on I-95 and the Merritt Parkway in Fairfield County.
"It's a dangerous thing to believe in a single cause, because then you look for a single solution," he said. "We need a broad solution, not a silver bullet."
He and others listed a number of causes. Normally, the late spring and summer are times of increased traffic, higher use of alcohol and more inexperienced teen-age drivers on the roads. But the general increase in highway congestion was the foremost cause in their opinion, and the improved economy has made congestion worse.
Mr. Martinez said highways in Connecticut have experienced annual traffic increases averaging 1.5 to 2 percent. During the recession years in the early 1990's, there were no traffic increases recorded at all. But since 1994, when the economy began to improve, traffic for commerce, recreation and commuting has increased by 3 to 4 percent a year.
Department of Transportation statistics seemed to confirm Mr. Martiniz's analysis. There were a total of 72,550 accidents in the state in 1995, and 78,383 in 1996, the last year for which statistics were available. Gene Interlandi, a department planner, noted, however, that 1995 had a mild winter while the winter of 1996 was the snowiest on record, something sure to cause more accidents.
Still, the 1,676 accidents involving trucks in 1996, about 75 percent of them on interstate highways, was only about 2.1 percent of the total accidents. In 1995, they accounted for only 1.9 percent.
Mr. Bruhl said the Department of Transportation's vigorous highway improvement program is another factor. Construction zones typically feature narrowed lanes, sideward lane shifts, and nowhere for disabled vehicles to pull out of traffic.
Combine this with high traffic volume and passenger car drivers who do not drive defensibly and there will be a predictable rise in the number of accidents. Trucks, which are not as maneuverable as passenger cars, are particularly vulnerable, he said.
Mr. Riley said accidents involving trucks and cars would decline if passenger car drivers would understand that trucks have blind spots, and drive accordingly. Truck drivers have no way to see a car that is tailgating them, because the trailer blocks their view from their cab's side mirrors.
Similarly, a car traveling alongside the truck's right side door or just behind and alongside the left side of the cab is also in a blind spot.
He was in favor of stricter police enforcement, but said it should apply to passenger car drivers as well as truck drivers.
Mr. Bruhl felt, as did many others interviewed, that a cluster of truck accidents during a period of a few weeks didn't constitute a trend. "In the law of large numbers, you get clusters of unique events," he said.

WHEN her son was 10 months old, Renee Malone left the streets of the Bronx and the perils that often haunt overcrowded inner-city neighborhoods for a better life in the suburbs. Signs of spring abounded that March day when she arrived in this village overlooking the Hudson River -- Chris Anthony Malone in tow. The season's first flowers were in bloom. The air was full of promise, and the chubby baby boy had already begun walking, she recalled recently.
Last month, almost 24 years after Ms. Malone moved to the working-class neighborhood of tidy homes and small gardens, she buried her firstborn, who died after being shot repeatedly on July 19 by police officers who were chasing him, according to accounts. In addition to his mother, Mr. Malone left behind two younger brothers and a 5-year-old son. 
In the days and sleepless nights since Chris Anthony Malone's death, Ms. Malone has asked over and over again how it happened and why her family's hopes wilted and blew away.
Ms. Malone is black, and for others like herself, raising a son can be a perilous business, figures indicate. The June 1997 Vital Statistics Report published by the National Center for Health Statistics, a Federal agency, shows that the overall death rate for black men between 15 and 24 is 249 per 100,000, with homicides and legal intervention -- 132 per 100,000 -- the leading cause. By comparison, for white men in the same age bracket, the death rate overall is 122, less than half, with accidents as the leading cause at a rate of 58 per 100,000.
For black men in Harlem, as an example, life expectancy is shorter than that for men in Bangladesh; nationally, black men who are 15 to 29 die at a higher rate than any other age group except those 85 and older.
In the weeks since Mr. Malone was shot and killed, many blacks -- other mothers of black sons, N.A.A.C.P. officials and religious leaders -- have also asked how such a thing could have happened, and why this young black man became yet another digit among the statistics. Whatever the series of events that led up to the shooting, the end result is that "another young African-American has been shot down," Derickson K. Lawrence, chairman of the Westchester Coalition Against Bigotry, a community-based organization, said after the shooting.
In Mr. Malone's case, what is known is that he was shot and killed by three white police officers in the early morning hours in a section of the village where tension between the mostly white police force and young black residents has been rising in recent months.
From 911 tapes, which officials had access to after the shooting, it was learned that Mr. Malone had a gun and fired it before the fatal encounter. Several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity -- two village officials and a member of the police team investigating the case -- said the 911 caller identified Mr. Malone by name, described what he was wearing (jeans and a T-shirt) and said he tossed the gun aside when a police officer rushed by and then quickly retrieved it.
The police consider the neighborhood where Mr. Malone died an area of "street-level drug activity," Lieut. Michael McElroy of the Ossining Police said.
The office of District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said that a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun with the serial number removed was recovered from the crime scene. Ballistics reports are being conducted.
A police statement issued after the shooting confirmed that three officers who were responding to the 911 report at 3:40 A.M. of an armed man chased Mr. Malone on foot. At one point, the police report said, Mr. Malone pointed a weapon at the three officers, and they in turn fired at him. He fell to his knees through a hedge in front of a small apartment building and died several hours later at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla.
The three officers and two others who joined them at the scene were placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting and have not returned to work.
Court reports show that Mr. Malone's case is not atypical and that he had a record of arrests and convictions beginning in April 1994. Almost 1 in 3 (32 percent) of young black men in the 20-to-29 age group is under some type of correctional control -- like incarceration, probation or parole. That compares with 1 in 15 young white men and 1 in 8 young Hispanic men, according to United States Bureau of Justice Statistics. Figures also show that the unemployment rate for blacks is more than twice that for whites.
In 1994, Mr. Malone was charged with second-degree assault with a knife on the corner of Spring and James Streets. That is the same spot where he was killed by the police. Four years ago, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in that incident and was placed on probation. In September 1994, he was arrested for criminal possession of stolen property, a misdemeanor. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was sent to the County Jail in Valhalla for 90 days.
A year later, he was arrested and pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a semiautomatic handgun, a felony, and was sentenced to a year in jail. Last April, Mr. Malone was again charged with criminal possession of a weapon after the police answered a call from his mother, who found a handgun and cocaine among her son's possessions, officials said. Mr. Malone was also charged with resisting arrest in that incident. Those charges were pending at the time of his death.
Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, said they doubted accounts from the Ossining Police Department that Mr. Malone was pointing a gun at the officers when he was shot. Mr. Kuby, who is representing Ms. Malone, said that there were witnesses who said the victim never displayed a weapon.
Mr. Kuby criticized the police for failing to make further public statements about what happened and questioned the veracity of any explanations they would offer in the weeks to come. "There's no doubt that the police will concoct some kind of story," he said. His office has not filed an official complaint.
While many blacks have agreed to suspend judgment until more facts in the case surface, many still say that in general the police are quicker to target blacks than whites.
"Being African-American puts a male at risk, particularly at night or in the early morning," Winston A. Ross, regional director for the Westchester Chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said. "The odds are against you."
It is feared that young minorities who feel spurned by the mainstream of society and have little opportunities for employment are increasingly turning to a life of selling drugs and earning easy money. "An entire generation is being lost," Maria Nonni, vice chairwoman of the Westchester Coalition Against Bigotry, observed. "What options do many young blacks really have?"
In Yonkers, a program to help minority youths develop self-esteem and follow positive role models is providing new hope for some youths. Jim Bostic, who oversees the Yonkers Midnight Basketball Program, said officials in his city developed a program that "pushes kids beyond the brink." At a boot camp at two sites in Yonkers, sponsored by the Midnight Basketball Program, youths are taught to recognize their survival skills and understand that they can succeed.
"We have learned a very tragic lesson in the Chris Malone case," Mr. Bostic said. "From the initial reports, it seems that he had brushes with the law. But someone along the line did not reach this young man and help him alter the course of his life."
Others were less optimistic. In New Rochelle, Napoleon Holmes, chairman of the Labor and Industry Committee of the N.A.A.C.P. chapter there, said that despite the good efforts of some, the impediments remain. Mr. Napoleon, who tries to find construction jobs for young black workers, said his efforts have proved disheartening. "It's difficult for blacks to get jobs, much less get ahead," he said.
Mr. Kuby said within a week after the shooting death, he was optimistic that Mrs. Pirro's office would conduct a fair investigation. "She is the only D.A. in New York to put a white police officer in jail for killing a black man," he said. "The community has a degree of trust in her."
On Wednesday, David Hebert, a spokesman for Mrs. Pirro, said the District Attorney's office was continuing to interview witnesses.
Mr. Kuby was referring to the prosecution of Richard D. DiGuglielmo, a former New York City police officer, who was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison last year for murdering Charles Campbell, a black man, during a dispute in 1996 over a parking space in Dobbs Ferry.
At the Star of Bethlehem Church here, the Rev. Myrtle Smith urged parishioners to avoid stereotyping Mr. Malone's death as a racial issue. "No mother, black or white, would want this woman's pain," she said.

HEADLINE: ATLANTIC CITY;
Poetry and House Calls

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
WHILE Atlantic City Medical Center celebrates its centenary this year, Dr. Joseph Linsk, its oldest practicing physician, has found this summer at the beach no different from the previous 74.
"I'm still writing poetry, I'm still reading and I still make house calls," Dr. Linsk said. "And my bookstore made it through its first year. Every time I think of retiring, this place looks better and better." 
 Before sitting down in his Old Curious Book Shop on Ventnor Avenue with a dusty copy of Dostoyevsky's "Idiot" ("my second time around for this one," he said), he had spent the morning making house calls, which he calls "the most enjoyable aspect of the practice of medicine."
"You get welcomed into a home," he said. "People show you how they live. The practitioners who complain about how unrewarding medicine has become should get out of the office and spend more time with their patients. It's so nice to be with the family. I try to tell the younger colleagues that they're missing something by chaining themselves to the office, but they're all tied up in technology."
He continues practicing "because I don't want to stop," he said. "Part of it comes from coming out of the Depression, when having a job, never mind how humble or exalted, was the most important thing and there was no excuse for not working."
Dr. Linsk poured himself a cup of coffee, which he gives away to browsers. "I can still remember my first house call," he said. "It was to the Marlborough Blenheim Hotel on the Boardwalk. I remember noticing how cold the air-conditioning was. It was a privilege to see a patient in some of those places. It was like stepping into another world.
"Most of my house calls nowadays are in nursing homes where my patients can't get to see me as easily as I can see them. I don't go into hotels anymore. I never made a house call at a casino."
The casino hotels have either house physicians or nursing stations that refer gamblers or employees to the medical center's emergency room. Dr. Linsk, who began specializing in cancer and blood diseases in the early 1960's, rarely sees emergency-room patients. "I am usually involved in diagnosis," he said. "My younger associates prescribe treatments. I try to stay in touch with as many patients as I can. No matter how much support they have from their families and friends, people who have cancer feel terribly alone."
Born in Philadelphia and reared in Atlantic City, Dr. Linsk lost his father to cancer. "I was less than a year old, so I never knew him, but I would always think about him," he said. "It was the Depression and times were very difficult, though it wasn't so bad in Atlantic City as it was in other cities. I remember the city printing scrip when it ran out of money to pay people. But there were always all kinds of odd jobs to do around the Boardwalk. I sold saltwater taffy and hot dogs, delivered newspapers -- you name it. A job and a book were enough to keep a young kid like me out of trouble. I fell in love with reading. When I was a kid, I wanted to read every book in the Atlantic City Public Library."
He married Doritt Newman, his high school sweetheart, and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in economics. After serving in the Army, he went to New York Medical College.
Atlantic City's only hospital "was pretty small back then," he said. "We only had one administrator, a nurse, who ran the place. A two-week hospital stay in the 1940's was something like $30, but there were some who didn't have that. I remember one fellow giving me a turkey in lieu of payment. A fisherman gave me a lobster."
He began specializing in cancer after his sister-in-law died of the disease in the 1960's. Later, the Linsks helped found the Ruth Newman Shapiro Cancer Foundation in her memory. Two of his four children have gone on to practice medicine.
Last year, Dr. Linsk opened the bookstore because "I wanted a place where secret poets like myself could read their work and not feel embarrassed," he said.
So far he has met few local poets. "But there have been other rewards. After that 100 Best Novels list came out, there was a run on James Joyce. A fellow asked me what kind of book 'Ulysses' was. I warned him that it wasn't your typical beach read, but he bought it anyway."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
The Mayor of Fort Dix

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

DATELINE: FORT DIX

 BODY:
ONCE a day, Col. James L. Snyder does something physical. He tries to give himself an hour for exercise while most of the 96,000 people, military and civilian personnel, at Fort Dix under his "influence," as he puts it, are eating lunch.
Now in his second month as post commander of New Jersey's largest military base, Colonel Snyder avoids the word "command." 
 "The traditional authorities are still there," he said, wearing the camouflage uniform that makes him even more recognizable on the post. "But my role has changed considerably. I now serve more as a mayor or a landlord."
Where once soldiers in olive drab marched at one of the Army's busiest basic-training camps, Fort Dix has, in military slang, "gone purple"; that is, it now houses functions of various military branches as well as civilian organizations. Since 1992, 15 tenants, most of them military, have renovated existing structures and built new ones at Fort Dix. These tenants, including divisions within the Coast Guard, the Navy and the Air Force as well as Federal and state prisons, pay rent to the Army for the privilege of being there.
Fort Dix would have stayed olive drab if not for reduced national military spending and consolidation of the armed forces' facilities. New Jersey politicians who in the late 1980's relentlessly fought to keep the base open and thus maintain the $200 million that Fort Dix and its support contractors contribute to the regional economy. Fort Dix's tenants pay about $29 million of the post's $128 million yearly operating budget.
As mayor, landlord and otherwise highest authority in this 50-square-mile chunk of Federally owned pine lands in Burlington County, Colonel Snyder, 48, uses his daily five-mile afternoon run as an unofficial patrol. Few of the soldiers he passes salute the trim, sandy-haired figure in nondescript shorts and running shoes as he plies the base's boulevards and unpaved back roads.
He chooses a different path every day and so far hasn't trodden the same ground twice. "I use it as a chance to check up on how things are going on the post without intruding or appearing in an official capacity," he said. "I look to see if people are happy, contented. I also look at the grounds, to see that the post is well kept, presentable."
A native of Kansas who originally trained to be a builder, Colonel Snyder was impressed with "how peaceful and beautiful it is," he said. "You're close to nature wherever you go."
He can trot along Fort Dix's sprawling golf course, where membership is not a privilege of rank. "My golf game isn't good enough," he said sheepishly. He can glance at the Boy Scout and Girl Scout clubhouses, duck between slumbering tanks and artillery, cut through the parking lot of the post hospital, note what's playing at the movie theater, observe training exercises on any of the post's 50 rifle ranges or watch jets roar off from McGuire Air Force Base.
There is one place he visits on nearly every run, rain or shine: the parade ground at Eighth and Pennsylvania Avenues. The plot of land officially known as Infantry Park holds a collection of monuments to soldiers who have trained at Fort Dix and gone on to fight and die elsewhere. The park is dominated by a larger-than-life bronze of a charging infantryman that was created by Fort Dix personnel in 1959. In 1990, while rumors of Fort Dix's closing brought panic to the neighboring towns of Pemberton, Wrightstown and Browns Mills, the statue was recast and placed on a black granite pedestal. Carved in the base of the statue is the legend "If they are not there, you don't own it."
"I look at that," Colonel Snyder said, "and remember that that is, ultimately, what we're all about."
Daniel Zimmerman, curator of the Fort Dix Museum and historian of the post, agrees. "What's happened in the last six years is essentially that Fort Dix has come full circle," he said. "It has gone back to what it was between World Wars I and II -- that is, a staging and training facility for the Army Reserve and National Guard."
The fort's reputation as a basic-training camp developed "because of all the soldiers moving through it on the way to or from wars," Mr. Zimmerman said. "It still is a major staging area on the East Coast; troops moved through her during Desert Storm, Ethiopia and now Bosnia. But that's tended to obscure the post's long-term function, which has been to maintain the Reserve components in a state of readiness."
Colonel Snyder is the post's 66th commander since 1917, but his installation on June 30 was especially significant, Mr. Zimmerman added, because he is the first commander in the post's history to have come from the ranks of the Army Reserve, in which he has been on active duty for 15 years.
"Though the distinction might not be seem important outside the military, it's very significant in terms of the post's peacetime mission," Mr. Zimmerman said. "Having a commander at a Reserve training post who was brought up through the Reserves is sort of like electing a mayor of Newark who was actually born in the city, as opposed to someone who was born and raised in another town 15 miles away. The assumption is, the experience and familiarity are going to give you leadership more in line with the interests of the people the leader is supposed to serve. The Reservists can look at him and say, 'He's one of us.' "
Each week, Fort Dix is visited by as many as 10,000 members of the Army Reserve and the National Guard, who train in classrooms and in simulated combat situations. The complexity of military technology, as well as cultural changes within the armed forces, are changing the roles these weekend warriors play.
"The training has never been more important than it is now," Colonel Snyder said. "The old days of thinking about the Guard and the Army Reserve -- that you come back to the post two days a month and two weeks year -- are well in the past.
"In Desert Shield and Storm, the Army Reserves were among first personnel to arrive in Saudi Arabia, serving in direct support of the regular Army. I happen to know a little bit about that because as a reservist, I served with the Third Army in in both missions. I've been trained as an engineer, and I assure you that the construction, planning and logistical work that's done to keep an army at its maximum strength is extremely complex, regardless of the size of the mission. What we have to do is make sure that the reserve component from New York to northern Virginia can go and supply that support anywhere in the world, at the moment it is needed."
He also has a larger responsibility of the Fort Dix's presence in South Jersey. "The Army is not in the business of being an island unto itself, if it ever was," Colonel Snyder said. "When the national base closure proceedings were going on 10 years ago, a lot of people realized that the regional impact of a military installation was more than economic, and that a military presence in or a near a community comes with many quality-of-life issues that have to do with raising families and making intelligent decisions about the environment and recreation. That's where I see myself more as a mayor. There is a social aspect to command. Both myself and my wife, Kimberly, feel that this post should represent, as best as we're able, the most important American values."
The programs that represent those values, ranging from substance abuse counseling to Fourth of July fireworks and clean-ups of the few remaining Superfund toxic waste sites on the post have been mostly the work of Colonel Snyder's predecessor, Col. Timothy A. Peterson, now serving with the Army Congressional Liaison Office in Washington. Colonel Snyder credited Colonel Peterson with "leaving me with a pretty tight, well-functioning operation" but added: "It will be especially challenging for us to maintain his commitment because, the way defense funding is going, each year we're obligated to do more, in terms of services and quality of life provisions, with less. I can foresee some hard decisions ahead, though I'm still too new to the post to talk about what they might be."
Until then, he savors the complexities of a command that "keeps me wearing different hats for so many different people."
His favorite hat?
"One of the duties in being a staging area is providing a place for troops to enter the United States after they've served abroad, before they go back their loved ones," Colonel Snyder said. "It's a very emotional moment, for me, to be here to welcome them home."
 
Many Rms, Pine Vu: The Tenants at Fort Dix
 
GOING purple is military slang for moving numerous branches of different armed services, as well as civilian government organizations, to single installations. In the last six years, Fort Dix has changed from an Army Reserve training center to one of the deepest-purple Army posts in the country. Many of its 15 tenants are connected to neighboring McGuire Air Force Base, paying rent to the Army to use Fort Dix facilities.
Aside from the Army Reserve, these organizations now call Fort Dix home:
 * The Naval Reserve Readiness Command Region 4, which coordinates Navy Reserve units in Northeast.
* The Northeast Army Reserve Intelligence Support Center.
* The Air Mobility Warfare Center, an Air Force educational center.
*The Defense Energy Office, which oversees distribution of fuel for military installations in the Northeast.
* The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Newark and New York divisions.
* The Federal Correctional Institution, a minimum-security Federal prison with 3,800 inmates.
* The Mid-State Correctional Institution, a medium-security state prison with 500 inmates.
* The Coast Guard Strike Team, the environmental response team for the Northeast.
* Walson Air Force Medical Facility, an a clinic serving McGuire Air Force Base.
* The Veteran Affairs Medical Clinic, which treats veterans.
* First Union Bank branch.
* American Red Cross, Fort Dix Chapter.
* 514th Air Mobility Wing Medical Unit, an Air Force training unit. BILL KENT

HEADLINE: Nissan Gives a Glimpse Of Its Plan for Recovery

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB 

 BODY:
ITS advertising slogan notwithstanding, Nissan has not been enjoying the ride. Now, it is counting on some new models to get it down a very bumpy road.
In Japan, where the company has historically been No. 2 to Toyota, sales have fallen in a slumping economy while its debt has soared to $30 billion. Nissan posted a net loss of more than $100 million last year. 
 In the United States, sales plunged 28 percent in the first half of 1998. Sweet leasing deals of years past have produced a glut of used cars, overvalued on the books, that haunts new-car sales today. With 215,000 new vehicles unsold at midyear -- despite discounts of up to $2,500 -- Nissan cut output at its plant in Smyrna, Tenn., by 25 percent.
Once known as sort of a Japanese BMW, thanks to durable, fun-to-drive cars like the Datsun 510, Sentra SE-R and Maxima, Nissan took chances on innovative designs, like the 240Z that created a new market for moderately priced sports cars. But many recent Nissans have lacked flair, though the vehicles' quality ratings remain high and their performance is competitive.
With the axing of the 300ZX sports car two years ago, dealers were left without an image-builder to lure shoppers. And Nissan's Japan-centered decision-making showed a failure to understand changing American tastes: The company still lacks a small sport utility, and it is trying to sell a revamped Frontier pickup with four cylinders, two doors and a cramped cabin to Americans who want big engines, multiple doors and lots of space.
With dealers anxious and the financial community suggesting that Nissan might become a takeover target -- possibly for a newly merged DaimlerChrysler -- the company gathered its top executives last month for an American tour before dealers, financial analysts and automotive journalists. In an unusual move, it also offered a peak at future products and prototypes.
 On the business front, Nissan reiterated its plan to reduce its debt by 25 percent within three years and to consolidate its two North American units to streamline decisions. It plans to reduce the number of platforms -- the costly basic building blocks of cars and trucks -- from 25 currently to 10 by 2003 and to slash $1,000 a car from its production costs, which are now higher than Toyota's or Honda's.
Significantly, the company's design studio in California is getting more responsibility to develop models for North America. In the past, American designs were often pushed aside in favor of more conservative vehicles from Japan that failed to catch on.
Some analysts said that while Nissan's coming products would help, they did not go far enough. "For Nissan to really change the image of the brand, they need the coupes and convertibles and fun-centered concepts," said Susan G. Jacobs, an automotive analyst in Rutherford, N.J. "Most of its competitors will be coming out with fun cars, while Nissan will be focused on sedans, wagons and trucks. It's very hard to change a brand with sedans and wagons."
Nissan executives say they're building a base for the future. "There's nothing like a good jolt of fear to release the creative juices," Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design International, said in New York as he took the wraps off these vehicles:

2000 SENTRA -- More expensive-looking than the current model, the next Sentra has a stylish rear end evocative of the Audi A4. Mr. Hirshberg called it an entry-level car "people don't have to apologize for."
 
2000 MAXIMA -- In a bid to revive the Maxima's sporting image after the last redesign produced a more mainstream family sedan, the prototype of the next Maxima appears larger and jazzier, with styling that emphasizes the wheels. Prominent, round taillights are set into a tapered, Jaguar-like tail.
 
FRONTIER FOUR-DOOR -- Nissan's slow-selling pickup will get a V6 this fall; next fall, it will be available with four full-size doors.
 
SMALLER SPORT UTILITY -- Based on the Frontier, this yet-unnamed truck is likely to be priced around $20,000. But in contrast to the car-based Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, the Nissan will be defiantly rugged, with body-on-frame construction, a two-step roof like the Land Rover Discovery's and higher "theater seating" in the rear.
Aimed at young buyers -- "people who need places for lots of stuff," Mr. Hirshberg said -- the vehicle will have many nooks, crannies and cubbyholes, including a "backpack" built into the inside of the tailgate.

SPORT UTILITY TRUCK -- Also based on the Frontier, the "S.U.T." has the look of a miniature Hummer. Mr. Hirshberg cited surveys showing that truck owners use the cargo bed less than 70 percent of the time, and even then, they use only 20 percent of the space. Nissan would substitute a small bed for a utility vehicle's usual cargo area, with a twist -- to accommodate objects too large for the truck bed, the back seats could be folded and the rear of the cabin opened.
Initially viewed as a design exercise, the utility truck now seems likely to be built, since it would cost little to produce.

LATTER-DAY 'Z' CAR -- To come up with an image-lifting car for the future, Nissan designers turned to the past, producing an updated concept version of the Datsun 240Z of 1970 that meets modern safety standards.

Inflation Intrudes on the Cocktail Hour

BYLINE: By EDWARD LEWINE 

 BODY:
HOSSEIN AIMANI opened the vault of his Long Island City warehouse, releasing a luxurious fishy smell. Inside were two tons of caviar packed in blue four-pound tins. Total street value? One million dollars, and possibly more soon.
Many in the caviar business say there will be shortages and price inflation this fall because the populations of sturgeon that produce the eggs known as caviar are declining and because new regulations will limit how much caviar can be imported. 
 "Based on the inventory, I'm not worried," said Mr. Aimani, who founded Paramount Caviar in 1991. "We have caviar stored in Europe. They are bringing in product as we speak."
It may be no more than slimy eggs extracted from the bellies of various kinds of sturgeon, especially those in the Caspian Sea, the mammoth lake between Russian and Iran, but caviar is big business in New York City. Two thirds of the 60 tons or so of caviar legally imported each year comes through New York, according to the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service.
"The bulk of it is bought and sold by New Yorkers," said Charlie Gagliardo, a manager of Citarella, the fish store with locations on the Upper West and Upper East Sides. "Go to Ohio. They aren't going to pay for it. They don't even know what it is."
These days caviar dealers operating in New York are bracing themselves. Some 90 percent of imported caviar comes from Russia. But because of rampant overfishing since the fall of the Soviet Union, last spring the sturgeon were officially declared to be endangered. Caviar prices have already begun to inch up, and dealers expect a steeper rise in the coming weeks and perhaps an even worse one over the winter holidays, peak caviar time.
"I'm fearful of this holiday season," said Saul Zabar, whose mega-deli, Zabar's, is one of the biggest retailers of caviar. "Either we won't have product or we'll have the product but at bizarre prices."
Several companies in New York import caviar, and the five that are widely considered major forces in the business all say they get their stock directly from Russia. They all sell retail through catalogues and "800" numbers and wholesale to restaurants and hotels. Some have multiton contracts with air and cruise lines. Some, like Petrossian, Caviarteria and Caviar Russe, have their own restaurants. Others, like Paramount Caviar and Urbani Truffles and Caviar, operate out of warehouses.
Caviar dealers have a reputation for being tight-lipped. "It is a business that is so full of mystery," said Susan Friedland, author of "Caviar" (Scribner, 1986). "It is so hard to prove the provenance of a pound of caviar." Dealers agree, at least when it comes to their competitors.
"I always thought that this industry was made up of an incredible group of car salesmen," said M. David Magnotta, the managing director of Caspian Star Caviar, which owns Caviar Russe.
Caviar was not always so mysterious. Ms. Friedland said that during the 1800's American waters were so full of sturgeon that New York bartenders offered the roe free with beer. Pollution and fishing wiped out local populations around the turn of the century, and dealers began importing caviar from Russia. In the Soviet era, prices rose drastically because the Communists placed tight controls on the sturgeon catch. The caviar was of uniformly high quality then, dealers said, but the quantity was roughly half what it is today, and prices were much higher.
Then the Soviet Union fell, and the sturgeon were left unprotected. In the 90's, caviar of varying qualities and from various sources poured into the United States. Prices dropped. "Without controls it was every man for themselves," said William Donato, an agent with the Fish and Wildlife Service in New York.
But now over-fishing and pollution is threatening to wipe out Caspian sturgeon. According to the Federal Government, the number of mature Caspian sturgeon has declined 70 percent since 1978. Last year, the sturgeon were placed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. There will now be limits on the Caspian sturgeon catch and on the amount of caviar allowed in the United States. All imported caviar will now need documentation on its origin and will be subject to random DNA testing. Caviar that doesn't match its papers will be sent back, almost insuring that it goes bad, or seized.
"I think it is going to go back to the 80's when the Russian Government controlled caviar," said Rosario Safina of Urbani. "The price is going to double or triple."
The important spring catch was tiny this year, dealers said, and prices have already gone up slightly, by up to 5 percent. But that, dealers say, is just the beginning. In addition to the new limits on the sturgeon catch, a 15 percent customs duty on all Russian imports, which went into effect June 30, will have an impact on prices.
But as one dealer put it, caviar has always been a matter of luxury, and an expensive price tag never hurt a luxury item. "There are people who will pay any price," Mr. Magnotta said. "Some people will drop out, others will pay more, and it will balance out."

Table: "SHOPPING LIST: The Price of Eggs"
New regulations intended to slow the depletion of sturgeon in the Caspian Sea are expected to increase the retail price of caviar. But prices now are relatively low compared with seven years ago, dealers say. Price can also depend on the quality of the caviar, the wholesale price a store pays and its markup. Here are prices for one ounce of three types of caviar, a generous portion for one person, at some sellers around the city:
 

	Beluga	Osetra	Sevruga	Caviar Russe (1.1 oz.)	$48.	$30.	$24.	Caviarteria	50.	29.	28.	Citarella	22.70	14.15	12.45	Paramount Caviar	36.	22.50	14.50	Petrossian Paris (1.1 oz.)	70.	45.	34.	Urbani Truffles and Caviar	26.50	20.00	16.25	Zabar's	22.50	14.50	12.50

HEADLINE: Two's Company, Three's a Society

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
NEW YORK often seems like individuality run amok. So in a city with a statue dedicated to liberty, why not groups devoted to a peculiar pursuit of happiness? Thumb through the Yellow Pages and the Encyclopedia of Associations or click around the Internet and you'll find eccentric New York societies, associations and clubs galore.
Out march the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, who encourage the growth of democracy in Spain, the Vlamingen in de Wereld en New York, who encourage everything Flemish, and the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, founded in 1953 to stop the draining of Israel's wetlands. But a phone call won't necessarily get you the Society for the Advancement of Christian Art. "Everyone is on vacation," a female voice barked last week before hanging up. 
 Then there is the Disabled Veterans Key Chain Tag and Chauffeur Badge Collectors Association. The group is pretty much Edward H. Miles and about a dozen other New Yorkers (there are about 150 members nationwide). An optometrist who grew up in Brooklyn and now lives in Gramercy Park, Mr. Miles, 62, used to collect stamps. But around 1968, he noticed chauffeurs' badges for sale in a stamp catalogue. Shiny, oval, about the size of a chocolate-chip cookie, the metal badges were required by New York State, beginning in 1904, for anyone who wanted to drive a taxi, limousine or bus.
"They were big, they were colorful, they were more fun than stamps," Mr. Miles said. He now has more than 2,000 of them, which he bought at prices ranging from 15 cents to $100 (for badges from the World War II era, when metal was rationed).
That led to collecting validation stickers for license plates (more than 1,000 from every state and American Samoa), at prices ranging from a few cents to $10. And that led to collecting key chains made by disabled veterans between 1942 and 1975 (when the practice was discontinued). Mr. Miles has more than 10,000 of those, for which he paid from 50 cents to $100. Somewhere along the line he also picked up nearly 1,000 license plates. He displays about 20 of them in the window of his optometry office on Eighth Avenue near 52d Street.
"It's like being a very thorough historian in the company of other very thorough historians," Mr. Miles said of himself and his fellow collectors.
At the Society of Mayflower Descendants in the State of New York, with headquarters on East 58th Street near Park Avenue, history is second nature. Membership is open only to those who can prove direct descent from one of the more than 100 passengers on the Mayflower, which set sail in 1620 from Plymouth, England for what was to become Plymouth, Mass.
Rowland Folsom Pease, 76, a writer who grew up in Newton, Mass., and joined the Mayflower Society in New York in the 1950's, said he was aware of criticism that such societies were elitist and racist. "Frankly, there are people who are frightful snobs, who want to elevate themselves above everyone else," Mr. Pease said, "but really I joined out of patriotism and a sense of history." He was, he said, "a lowly private during D-Day."
He delights in describing his Mayflower ancestor, on his mother's side, as "John Howland, 16 years old and an indentured servant, who fell overboard and was then fished out, to the great future relief of his descendants."
Esperanto, the artificial language created by Ludwig Zamenhof, a Polish eye doctor, in 1887, is more than a historical pastime to Jim Medrano, 38, a computer graphics specialist, and his wife, Nancee Medrano, 37, a secretary. To them, it is a growing contribution to world amity. The couple head the Esperanto Society of New York, at United Nations Plaza, and often house visiting Esperantists from around the world.
The couple first encountered Esperanto, a simplified language based mainly on European languages like French and Italian, while students at Queens College, but began studying it in earnest at Stuyvesant Adult Education Center in 1983. They try to speak it a few hours every day.
Mr. Medrano said he has read more than a dozen books in Esperanto, including a translation of Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream." At an Esperanto Society picnic in Riverside Park in June, adults and children sang the song "Guantanamera" in Esperanto.
"The beauty of Esperanto is that no one has to learn the other person's language," Mr. Medrano said. "You can meet each other halfway and that's got to help reduce world conflict." He estimates that there are more than 100 Esperantists in New York. "For us, and our little circle, Esperanto has taken off," Mr. Medrano said. "If no one else learns it, that's O.K."
But for the Young Communist League U.S.A., the branch of the Communist Party U.S.A. for Marxist-Leninists 14 to 30, expanding its circle is crucial. In the 1980's and most of the 90's, the party seemed to be headed to the ash heap of history. Then came the World Wide Web. Noel Rabinowitz, 28, the national coordinator for the league, whose headquarters are on West 23d Street, said that since the league's Web site (http:/ /www.yclusa.org/yclusa/home.html) went up in March 1997, it has signed up more than 1,600 members by E-mail. "With the Internet, it's not about us finding them, it's about them finding us," he said.
Mr. Rabinowitz, whose parents and older brother are Communists, said his non-Communist friends introduce him at parties as Noel the Commie. He said he's used to hearing people say, "I didn't know there were any of you guys left."
Like other American Communists, he is undaunted by the collapse of the Soviet Union, China's embrace of capitalism and the foundering economies of Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam. "Maybe Communism is a lost cause and I'm just not aware of it," Mr. Rabinowitz said. "But Communists are pretty optimistic people."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/1999 Nissan Quest;
Growth Spurt for a Mini Mini-Van

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
FIFTEEN years ago, as millions of baby boomers were settling down to raise families, Lee A. Iacocca played midwife to the Chrysler Corporation's own promising, strapping newborn, driving the company's first boxy mini-van off the assembly line. It was the right product at the right time, and it virtually supplanted the station wagon as family transportation.
Chrysler still holds 40 percent of the 1.2 million mini-van market, even as every major manufacturer has crowded in. But the next wave of competition is sweeping in, with an all-new, bigger Honda Odyssey arriving in October and redesigned vans from Ford, Mazda, Nissan and Mercury. 
 For 1999, the Nissan Quest and Mercury Villager are getting their first substantial makeover since they were introduced as 1993 models. As before, they are nearly identical, and they are still produced through a joint venture of Nissan and Ford: the engine, transaxle and body stampings come from Nissan's nonunion operations in Smyrna, Tenn., and the vans are assembled by United Automobile Workers members at a Ford plant in Avon Lake, Ohio.
The Quest and Villager are on the small side among mini-vans, with a wheelbase 7 inches shorter than the Dodge Grand Caravan's. They are thus more nimble and carlike than most of the competition.
Since 1992, the mini-vans had received only minor tweaks and fell behind in competitive features like a fourth door. The redesigned Quest keeps its old body structure and retains its relatively agile handling, but it gains another door and adds horsepower and cargo capacity.
 For 1999, the Quest's wheelbase is unchanged at 112.2 inches, but the body has been stretched nearly 5 inches and it is about an inch wider. The interior capacity has grown by about 10 cubic feet.
Styled at Nissan's American design center in California, the Quest has a fresher appearance. Every body panel is new, but the most noticeable change is up front, where a prominent oval grille protrudes like a snout. Other than that, the appearance is mainstream, a plus with mini-van buyers who seem to like blending into the crowd.
For owners, functionality is all-important, and a second sliding door, this one on the driver's side, is now seen as essential. The extra door is standard on the Quest, and it comes in handy for unloading children away from traffic or loading shopping bags without having to walk to the passenger side.
Just as important as the extra inside space are features that allow more versatility. The second-row seats can be easily removed. The third row slides forward or back on rails. You could, for instance, remove the second-row seats and slide the third row all the way back to provide maximum room for long-legged teen-agers or to carry adults limousine-style.
Behind the third row, Nissan has added a cargo shelf that can be set at one of two levels, or removed entirely. The shelf is useful for lining up two rows of grocery bags, for instance -- one on the floor and one on the shelf above -- and nothing gets crushed. Or, you could load a stroller, golf bags or luggage underneath, and line the shelf with shopping bags.
Despite the extra space and added versatility, cargo capacity still falls far short of larger vans'. With my two children strapped in, I drove a '98 Quest to a rented cottage in northern Michigan, loaded with paraphernalia for a week's vacation. Space was tight, so I couldn't imagine how the van would accommodate a larger family on such an outing, unless they pack more economically.
On my return, I picked up the '99 model. Although it is not vastly larger inside, space is used better and storage compartments are more plentiful. Other ergonomic features have been improved. The audio controls, for instance, are now situated above the heating and air-conditioning controls that are used less often. My children most appreciated the improvements in the cup holders. In front, they pull out of the center dash and are sturdier than the wobbly gadgets that folded down from the side of the seat in the '98 model.
Options include an integrated transmitter that opens garage doors and security gates, and driver's seats that memorize preferred positions. New is a sportier SE model with 16-inch wheels and a stiffer suspension. The Quest also comes with a standard security system, less forceful dual air bags and four-wheel anti-lock brakes.
The Quest's most significant improvement is under the hood, where a 3.3-liter V6 producing 170 horsepower has replaced a 3-liter V6 with 151 horsepower. While a difference of 19 horsepower may not sound like much, back-to-back comparisons of the old and new versions showed the '99 to be much livelier. The 1998 Quest, albeit loaded with gear, had chugged up hills out of breath. Even empty, it gave me pause when passing. In contrast, the '99 stepped smartly away from traffic lights and confidently passed other vehicles on two-lane roads.
Prices have not been announced, but they are expected to remain in the range of the current model, from $23,589 to $29,087. The Villager is priced about the same, and differs mainly in its front styling, available colors and optional trim.

HEADLINE: At 38, He Runs A Hotel Giant (Jealous Yet)

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
WHEN Richard D. Nanula is not in the middle of changing jobs and moving, he likes to unwind by watching five television sets at once, using a customized touch pad to change channels quickly and adjust the sound. Oh, and he sometimes reads at the same time.
"I'm a multiprocessor," he said. 
 And listening to Mr. Nanula, 38, talk about his life is also like watching several channels at once.
There he is at the Walt Disney Company, which hired him out of Harvard Business School 12 years ago and named him chief financial officer at the age of 31. He quickly made his mark, negotiating long and hard to get the troubled Euro Disney theme park on firmer financial footing, handling more than $1 billion of financing for Disney films and issuing rare 100-year bonds.
And there he is pursuing his second career as one of the world's greatest sports fans. He once moved intensive business negotiations to the Super Bowl so he wouldn't miss the game. When he learned that Shaquille O'Neal, the Los Angeles Lakers center, had moved into his Beverly Hills neighborhood last summer, Mr. Nanula got his wish for a pick-up game with him.
And there he is again, in a T-shirt, sunglasses and a baseball cap, on the back cover of the menu at the recently opened ESPN Zone restaurant in Baltimore. The restaurant is a Disney property, and executives who knew of Mr. Nanula's passion for sports agreed that he should be the poster boy for serious fandom.
"It's one of my favorite things I've ever done," Mr. Nanula said of the menu.
Now Mr. Nanula (pronounced na-NOO-lah) faces perhaps the hardest thing he's ever done, taking over as chief executive of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, the world's largest hotel company.
Consider his challenge. By acquiring Westin Hotels and ITT, Starwood has become, in a way, a $16 billion start-up. And Mr. Nanula, who became its chief on June 1, must now assemble a team to run Starwood's many distinct parts -- including the Caesars World casinos and the company's Sheraton and luxury hotels -- and assemble three companies into one at its new headquarters in White Plains.
To cut costs, he is using the company's size to renegotiate contracts for its 650 hotels on everything from mattresses to shrimp to long-distance service. He hopes to raise revenues by, among other things, stitching together reservation systems and frequent-guest programs.
All the while, Starwood is growing, with 125,000 employees and $1 billion of projects in the pipeline, and it is starting a new brand, W Hotels, to compete in the so-called boutique hotel market.
Lest Mr. Nanula's job grow too dull, he must also develop a new corporate structure for Starwood, which recently lost a battle with Congress and the White House to extend the tax advantages of its unusual corporate structure.
The company's stock price, meanwhile, has sagged, along with others in the lodging industry; Starwood shares have fallen 5.7 percent over the last year, better than the 6.4 percent drop in the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of real estate investment trusts but well below the 16.7 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500.
"I'm not sure anyone has tried to pull off what we're doing here," Mr. Nanula said during three hours of interviews squeezed into his schedule. "It is a big and interesting challenge."
 ALSO at stake is the reputation of Barry S. Sternlicht, a longtime friend of Mr. Nanula. Mr. Sternlicht, who is 37, built Starwood at breakneck speed and is now its chairman, but he acknowledges that he lacks the operational skills to make it all work. Mr. Nanula's efforts will go a long way toward determining whether Mr. Sternlicht will be regarded in coming years as a savvy deal maker or as someone who paid too much to create an unwieldy corporate giant.
"What you see today is a company operating on 2 of its 12 cylinders," Mr. Sternlicht said.
Many people on Wall Street are betting that Mr. Nanula can make Starwood hum, though no one minimizes the enormity of his task.
"For Richard Nanula to have left his job at Disney says a lot about what he believes is the potential for Starwood," said Jason N. Ader, an analyst at Bear, Stearns. "But he's got to focus to manage the assimilation process."
Mr. Nanula's route to Starwood can be traced, in part, to his penchant for juggling several tasks.
On his first day at Harvard, in 1984, he took a seat in the lecture hall at the end of the last row -- or "skydeck," as the students called it -- so he could read newspapers and magazines or do course work when class discussions bogged down.
Two seats away sat Mr. Sternlicht, another multitasker. "I'm really good at doodling and listening at the same time, which drives people crazy because they don't think I'm listening," he explained recently.
The two had pursued different academic interests. Mr. Sternlicht was a liberal arts major at Brown University in a program called Law and Society (or "Lost in Society," as he called it). Mr. Nanula studied economics at the University of California at Santa Barbara and was a certified public accountant.
 BUT the men soon found common ground. They spent many Sunday afternoons watching football together. During intramural basketball games, Mr. Sternlicht played point guard, often setting up Mr. Nanula, who is said to have a pretty good outside shot.
Mr. Sternlicht also helped Mr. Nanula land his first job. In their second year, Mr. Sternlicht organized a field study project at Disney, in part because he had a good contact there, but also because Disney was far away from the chilly Northeast. He recruited four classmates, including Mr. Nanula, to study the feasibility of a new theme-park attraction of mini-factories showing how things like bread and cheese are made.
Mr. Nanula made a quick impression on Disney executives and was hired into the strategic planning department even before the students made their final presentation.
Mr. Sternlicht was not jealous, he said, because he preferred to work in a smaller company. "I didn't like hierarchy," he said. "My goal was to do deals, to learn to negotiate."
Mr. Nanula, though, was drawn to the breadth and complexity of a large corporation. He was also following in the footsteps of his father, who had run companies that made products ranging from cooling towers to automatic sprinkler systems (and, on occasion, was known to read a book in front of the TV).
Though fast friends, Mr. Nanula and Mr. Sternlicht assumed that they would never work together. But they soon found themselves sitting across from each other at a negotiating table. Mr. Sternlicht landed a job at JMB Realty in Chicago, and he and Mr. Nanula haggled over the sale to JMB of the real estate assets of Disney's Arvida subsidiary.
They stayed in touch -- Mr. Nanula sometimes called Mr. Sternlicht to needle him about the California weather -- and they often went on vacations and attended the N.C.A.A. Final Four together. But their career paths were very different.
Mr. Sternlicht's trajectory dipped sharply early on. He led a team that analyzed the finances of Randsworth Trust P.L.C., a British real estate company, before JMB and some American pension funds bought it in 1989. Randsworth collapsed two years later, for a loss of more than $425 million. Mr. Sternlicht has said he was made the scapegoat for the debacle.
But failure, he said, "teaches you intellectual discipline and humility."
In 1991, after he left JMB, Mr. Sternlicht started Starwood Capital with investments from the Ziff publishing family and others.
In 1993, Starwood, named for the community near Aspen, Colo., where it was assembled, bought its first hotels. The company took off in 1995, when it acquired Hotel Investors Trust, a real estate investment trust and standard operating company that traded as a single stock -- a so-called paired-share or stapled REIT.
Armed with its special structure, Starwood stormed the industry, acquiring properties and companies that today give it hotels or casinos in 70 countries. For most of that time, Starwood's stock has performed well, far surpassing the average for hotel companies and REIT's. It has risen 284 percent in the last three and a half years, despite its recent drop.
At Disney, meanwhile, Mr. Nanula rose quickly. As chief financial officer, he not only handled the negotiations over Euro Disney, now known as Disneyland Paris, but also revamped the way Disney financed its films, making the terms not quite so favorable to outside investors. He learned Disney's businesses, from theme parks to films to retailing.
Mr. Nanula also picked up a few things that would come in handy at Starwood. For one thing, Disney has about 25,000 hotel rooms. And Mr. Nanula has some familiarity with casinos, having made regular trips with friends to Las Vegas.
 AS chief financial officer, Mr. Nanula was known to push colleagues time and again for more analysis to back up recommendations to invest in new ventures.
"He was very good in a company where risk is part of the culture, but where you have to manage risk in a conservative fashion," Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman, said in a recent interview. "He has pretty good antennae for spotting problems in advance of everyone else."
Mr. Eisner made Mr. Nanula president of the company's Disney Store Worldwide unit in November 1994 to give him operating experience. Without it, Mr. Eisner said, "he wouldn't have been able to go all the way."
When Mr. Nanula's replacement as chief financial officer, Stephen P. Bollenbach, left in early 1996 to become chief executive of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, Mr. Eisner named Mr. Nanula to the job again, to help integrate Disney's $19 billion acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC.
Mr. Nanula's accounting for the purchase was questioned in a lengthy article in Barron's in March of this year; it said Disney had created an undisclosed reserve of as much as $2.5 billion to absorb expenses related to the merger without reducing its reported earnings. When asked about this, Mr. Nanula said, "Nobody who was up on accounting standards ever questioned the accounting."
For 12 years, Mr. Nanula immersed himself in the life of a Disney executive. He stared down the difficult decision of which character's costume to wear for a stroll through Disney World as part of a theme-park orientation. (He chose Tigger, Winnie-the-Pooh's sidekick). He met his future wife at Disney -- Tracey Hart, an executive assistant in strategic planning.
And his wealth rose. The 1997 Disney proxy said Mr. Nanula was paid a salary of $632,692, plus a $1.3 million bonus. His exercisable optionshad gained about $15 million in value. Options that he lost upon leaving the company were worth an additional $30 million or so.
(Starwood has not released details of Mr. Nanula's pay package, including the degree to which he was compensated for what he gave up, though he has invested about $500,000 in Starwood stock. Besides nurturing his own holdings, Mr. Nanula will now play an important role in sustaining his friend's wealth; Mr. Sternlicht owns Starwood stock worth about $400 million, plus options worth $80 million at the end of last year.)
Disney executives grew to rely on Mr. Nanula to add levity to meetings. If someone proposed an idea that no one liked, Mr. Nanula might break the silence by saying: "That's a great idea. It would put us out of business in three days. But that's a great idea."
"Being the C.F.O., or the C.E.O., you've got to say 'no' a lot without having everybody hate your guts," Mr. Nanula said. "You want them to keep coming up with good ideas."
Mr. Nanula built a collection of 50 Disney neckties and appeared to be settling in for the long haul. He was often mentioned as an eventual successor to Mr. Eisner. "I never thought a minute about leaving Disney," Mr. Nanula said.
But, ever multitasking, Mr. Nanula often offered Mr. Sternlicht advice -- on everything from takeover tactics to dismissing executives. "I'm not good at firing people," Mr. Sternlicht said. "When I had to let somebody go, Richard and I would rehearse what I was going to say."
They also helped each other through difficult personal times. Last year, Mr. Sternlicht learned that his youngest son had juvenile diabetes, and Mr. Nanula's twin daughter and son were born 15 weeks early, weighing only one and a quarter pounds each. (Mr. Nanula's children are now fine, and Mr. Sternlicht has joined the board of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.)
As Starwood grew, Mr. Sternlicht mentioned the possibility of turning his friendship with Mr. Nanula into a business partnership. But Mr. Nanula politely waved off the idea. When Mr. Sternlicht closed in on the $13.3 billion deal to acquire ITT, however, he raised the issue again. This time, Mr. Nanula had a different answer: He would consider it.
Mr. Sternlicht was certain that his friend would be the best candidate, even though working so closely together would put their friendship at risk. But the decision to hire a chief executive would have to be made by Starwood's directors.
There were other candidates. Buying some of them out of option-laden contracts, however, would have been too costly. One even demanded that he be given the chairman's title after a year. "That's a little overreaching, I'm afraid," Mr. Sternlicht told him.
The board settled on Mr. Nanula, in part because of his skills, which complemented Mr. Sternlicht's, and in part because of the chemistry between them.
Though they walk into each other's offices at least a dozen times a day to run through decisions, in the kind of shorthand that develops between friends, Mr. Nanula and Mr. Sternlicht are still adjusting. "It's just very different having him next to me," Mr. Sternlicht said.
But Mr. Nanula is often on the road, flying in a Gulfstream IV jet to visit the company's many operations, refining goals for managers and setting a tone for the company.
He likes meetings with free-wheeling discussions, like those he had at Harvard and Disney. "There's no teacher," he said, "just a bunch of us in the room figuring out what to do."
But Mr. Nanula has little patience for people who are unprepared, and he will direct a manager to do more homework before setting up another meeting or phone call with him.
"Frank Wells was that way," he said, speaking of Disney's late president. "He would simply say, 'Go get the answers, and we'll make the decision when you get them.' "
Occasionally, Mr. Nanula calls managers far down the ladder to get front-line perspective. And he often sends managers handwritten notes with a simple happy face or frowning face sketched in the corner, for a quick take on his mood.
This approach, he said, "takes the edge off a little bit" -- an edge that is likely to exist when older executives find themselves reporting to a thirtysomething boss. But former ITT executives who are the resident graybeards at Starwood say that, after the first few weeks, they like working for Mr. Nanula.
"You can tell by the way he asks questions that he wants to gather all the facts," said Daniel P. Weadock, 59, a special assistant to the chairman after working for ITT, in one stint as president of its hotels, for all but one of the years that Mr. Nanula has been alive. "They do take the input I give them."
 MR. NANULA grew up in Pasadena and Santa Rosa, Calif. He held a number of jobs as a teen-ager, waiting on tables many a summer -- "good, general people training," he said.
His parents said they were at times concerned that Richard had too many irons in the fire, his schoolwork competing with jobs, sports and dating.
But Mr. Nanula grew into a serious student at Santa Barbara. With many fellow students pursuing majors in partying, Mr. Nanula saw an opportunity. "If I was the only one studying," he said, "I could probably get A-pluses and get into any business school I wanted."
In fact, he did, though Harvard deferred his acceptance, so he went to Deloitte, Haskins & Sells in Atlanta for two years, becoming a C.P.A.
Mr. Nanula, whose father is white and mother black, said he rarely encountered racism growing up in mainly white neighborhoods, perhaps in part because his light skin color made many people think he was Hawaiian or Egyptian. "Thankfully, nobody really cared," he added.
And today, he said, he does not often think about being one of the few blacks in the highest ranks of corporate America. "I do believe in being a good role model," he said. "But I've generally just operated on doing my job, and race and age and background has never really played into it very much, so I've just not focused on it."
These days, as he waits for his new house in Greenwich, Conn., to be renovated, he is focusing on Starwood during long workdays, though he tries to be at home to help put his children to bed and spend time with his wife, as well as to see his two golden retrievers. He generally brings home a briefcase of work for the weekend. There is not much time to watch even one television set.
He and Mr. Sternlicht have talked about working out together again, playing basketball or taking a "spinning" class -- Mr. Nanula said he is a "gigantic fanatic" about riding an exercise bike to pounding music for an hour.
"We haven't found time to do either one of them yet," he said. "But we'll do that."
