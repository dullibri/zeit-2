Adjustable Is Attractive

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:

When adjustable-rate mortgages were introduced in the early 1980's, they were promoted as a lower-cost alternative to fixed-rate mortgages. Now, even with fixed-rate mortgages at their lowest rates in years -- an average of 9.41 percent -- adjustable mortgages, with initial rates averaging about 7.43 percent, are still cheaper. The rate on a variable-interest mortgage rises and falls with a particular financial index. Each lender selects its index based on an analysis of what best protects its own loan portfolio. Almost half of all adjustable-rate mortgages are tied to Treasury securities that are traded daily and mature in one year. In shopping for a mortgage, be aware that other choices are available, like two-step mortgages, which let the lender reset the rate once. Here are the more commonly used indexes, which borrowers may use as a guide in estimating how their present adjustable mortgages may change, or in seeking the best deal:

Index	Current	Rate		Rate	A Year Ago	One-year Treasury	 	 		 	 	(estimated return)	6.41%	8.35%	 	 	 	11th District cost of funds (aver	 	 	age yield paid on all savings by	 	 	California savings institutions)	7.85	8.36	 	 	 	National cost of funds (average	 	 	yield paid on all savings by sav	 	 	ings institutions nationwide)	6.54	7.92

The 'Barefoot Doctors': Shod, but Still Footsore

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANBOXINZHAI, China

 BODY:
Dr. Su Ke faces little risk of malpractice suits, but there are other hazards of working as a doctor in a remote Chinese village like this one.
"When we go out and try to inoculate babies, some of the peasants are very frightened and hide their kids," Dr. Su, a 46-year-old man with a graying crew cut, explained in a tone of sorrow. "Or they turn their dogs on us to bite us and drive us away." 
 Even if Dr. Su manages to get his needle into the derriere of a local child -- a task made easier since none of the village children wear clothes -- then he is as likely to win censure as gratitude.
"We give them injections against measles, and then the kid gets a cold and they come and complain," he said. "They say, 'You promised that my child wouldn't get sick!' "
Dr. Su and hundreds of thousands of people like him are the inheritors of the legacy of the "barefoot doctors" who charmed the West in Maoist days. These days they wear sandals, and they are far better trained than in the past, but fundamentally the task is the same: to transport medicine from the textbooks and laboratories to the villages, where three-quarters of Chinese live.
 
Chicken Pox, Chest Pains
 Here in Manboxinzhai, a village of 400 in the Xishuangbanna district of southwest China, Dr. Su worked out of a small medicine box one day recently to minister to a variety of patients. There was a little boy with chicken pox, a young man with a swollen leg and an older man with chest pain. On the way to this village, he has stopped off to pull a young woman's tooth.
Dr. Su runs a small clinic 20 miles away, but he and the other doctors periodically hike off into the distance to treat peasants in the villages. Sometimes these "house calls" can last weeks and take a doctor from village to village.
China has made enormous strides in medical care in the four decades since the Communist Revolution, and in some ways the health profile of the population resembles that of a developed country more than that of a country with a per-capita income of $300 a year. The World Bank lists life expectancy among Chinese at 70 years, compared with 76 in the United States and 58 in India. But there are some indications that the gains in health care have slowed in the last dozen years, at the same time that China has opened to the world and doubled its per-capita income.
 
'Barefoot Doctors'
 By some counts, for example, infant mortality has shown little improvement in recent years. At last count, 31 Chinese infants out of 1,000 die before the age of 1, compared with 10 in the United States and 97 in India, according to World Bank statistics.
The main reason for the slowdown in health-care improvements in recent years appears to be the collapse of the commune system, which used to provide rudimentary health care, usually free of charge, throughout rural China. After the communes were dismantled in the early 1980's, some "barefoot doctors" returned to their farm work or started businesses, and many villages were left without adequate health care, or else had to pay more for it. It also became more difficult to mobilize people for large preventive medicine projects.
"Everybody participated in inoculation programs or hygiene projects in those days, because if you didn't then they'd be docked work points," Dr. Su said. "But these days it's hard to do public projects, like mosquito extermination to reduce malaria."
The problems of rural health care can be seen in the life of Mi De, a 29-year-old woman who lives in this village. She sat barefoot on a bench weaving cloth for clothes as she described in a matter-of-fact tone how her first child died soon after birth seven years ago. Her 5-year-old son has not had a medical check-up since he was 13 days old, but as the boy looked on with a solemn face she explained that this was not a problem.
"He's been very healthy, so he doesn't need to see a doctor," Ms. Mi said, adding that he had been inoculated against several diseases. In another concession to modernity, a midwife was present when Ms. Mi gave birth to her third child, a son, in December. In the past, only her mother was present when she gave birth. But throughout her pregnancy last year, Ms. Mi never saw a doctor.
As he makes his rounds, Dr. Su tries to combat traditional attitudes as much as diseases themselves. He scolded two 18-year-old women who are cradling their newborn babies, complaining that they are too young to be raising families. And he reproached the village's health officer, Sha Piao, for failing to implement a new policy for prenatal checkups.
"You're too busy getting ready to build your new house to look after the pregnant women," Dr. Su said sternly. Mr. Sha smiled wanly and explained that he would get to it in the next couple of days. "What with building the new house, I'll be too busy to do the health work this year," Mr. Sha said.
 
Family Planning
 The new program that Mr. Sha promised to begin calls for registering all pregnant women and charging them an obligatory fee of $2. They then are to receive three prenatal checkups. Gynecologists will go from village to village to perform some checkups, and in other areas many women may have to go to the clinic for their checkups.
When it is time for the birth, the woman is encouraged to use a midwife with Government training. If she does, the Government will pay the midwife's 40-cent fee and return $1.60 to the mother as a bonus. But if she does not use the approved midwife, then her $2 fee is forfeited. In some areas, this will also help the Government track pregnancies for its one-child family planning policy, but here in the ethnic minority areas of southwest China the family planning programs are implemented very loosely.
One difficulty that doctors have in this part of China is that urinary tract and gynecological problems are common, but are commonly attributed in the local folklore to promiscuity. So women are sometimes humiliated and furious when they are told they have such problems.
"So when we make our diagnosis," said the long-suffering Dr. Su, "they are outraged and do nothing but yell at us."

HEADLINE: Farmers Get Price Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Prices that farmers receive for raw products rose 2.1 percent in March from February, the first monthly increase since May 1990, the Agriculture Department said today.
Despite the gain, the department's "prices received" index for farm commodities was 1.3 percent lower than a year earlier. 
 Higher prices for eggs, oranges, cattle and upland cotton were mostly responsible for the March increase, the department said. But lower prices for milk, sweet corn, celery and strawberries partly offset the gains. Prices for cattle and calves were at record levels for the second consecutive month.
"Higher citrus prices reflected shorter supplies caused by the December freeze in California and also higher-quality Valencia oranges moving to market," the report said. "Egg prices reflected a strong seasonal demand."
The cotton price was the highest since January 1981, while corn, oats and sorghum prices increased slightly during the month. Crop prices collectively rose 3.3 percent from February but were 2.3 percent below March of last year.
Most prices are mid-March averages that will be revised next month.
Department economists forecast that 1991 consumer food prices will climb an average of 2 percent to 5 percent, compared with a 5.8 percent gain in 1990.

HEADLINE: Can 'Image' Cars Help Detroit?

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 29

 BODY:
Can one sexy car model make a whole company look good?
Detroit has gambled for decades that the answer is yes and sometimes it has been right. The GTO revved up Pontiac's stodgy image in the 60's, much the way the Shelby Mustang put some pizazz behind Ford. There have not been many successes since then. In the mid-80's, the Pontiac Fiero, a two-seat sports car with a glass fiber body caught the eye of showroom shoppers until its engine developed a tendency to catch fire. 
 The most recent flop was the Buick Reatta, the two-seater luxury roadster that General Motors canceled this month after four years of dismal sales. The Reatta's track record was not all that different from a string of high-concept, high-priced cars by Cadillac and Chrysler that have not fared well in recent years either.
While car makers aim to sell at least a few thousand of these "image cars," as the industry calls them, their real hope is that the cars will attract other buyers to more prosaic models in the company's lineup. The theory is that customers will be attracted to showrooms by a Cadillac Allante but drive away in a less expensive model, like the Seville.
That approach may have worked with the GTO and souped-up Mustangs a generation ago, but marketing experts say today's car buyers are more sophisticated. These shoppers are more prone to choose a model based on its attributes and are not as easily lured to showrooms merely to ooh and ahh over the fancy sheet metal on a roadster, they say.
The idea that image cars pull more people into showrooms and lift overall sales "has largely proven to be nonsense," said John Schnapp, who heads the motor vehicle industry group at Temple, Barker & Sloane Inc., a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. "There's no evidence going back that any image car really transformed a nameplate."
With record losses and the worst auto sales slump since the last recession, car companies can ill afford to keep slow-selling models like the Reatta in their stables.
"In the middle of a recession, in the middle of declining market share due to lack of quality and reliability, the spill-down image from a hot car won't solve those problems," said Thomas C. Kinnear, a professor of marketing at the University of Michigan business school.
 
 Quick Start for the NSX
 Foreign auto makers have had some success in adding cachet to their entire product lines with extravagant, high-priced, low-volume cars. The Honda Motor Company has its attention-grabbing Acura NSX sports car and Nissan has its 300 series sports cars. BMW and Mercedes-Benz both offer powerful top-of-the-line models that are engineering showcases but which few people can afford.
But image problems beget image cars, and managers and engineers often justify building an expensive image car by offering it as an advertising campaign on wheels. Among the Big Three domestic auto makers, bringing out a hot car remains a time-honored tactic for adding panache to a warmed-over product line or for trying to change the way buyers think about a brand.
At Buick, "We introduced the Reatta as a 'halo' car to attract customers who may not have considered Buick before," said Buick's general manager, Edward H. Mertz, when he announced last week that G.M. would stop building the cars in May.
But analysts say that the Reatta halo never lighted up the rest of Buick's line. "Reatta reflects an era when Buick did not know what it was," said Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst with Furman Selz Inc. in New York. "If Buick is going back to its heritage of selling larger, more conventional cars, there's no place for Reatta."
General Motors continues to produce the Cadillac Allante, a $57,200 two-seater with an Italian-made body that has floundered in the luxury marketplace. G.M. has sold only about 3,000 Allantes a year since the car was introduced in 1987.
The Chrysler Corporation re-entered the image car game in 1989 with its TC, a $37,000 convertible designed and built by Maserati in Italy. The idea behind TC was to spread a richer, more luxurious patina over a basically pedestrian fleet, though the TC bears a striking resemblance to Chrysler's less expensive Le Baron convertible. But the No. 3 domestic auto maker declared victory and then retreated when it canceled the program in December after its dealers sold fewer than 7,200 TC's.
Despite its experience with the TC, Chrysler is betting heavily that image cars remain a useful way to draw buyers. The company has invested hundreds of millions of its scarce dollars to develop two new image cars: the Dodge Viper and Spirit R/T models. Chrysler is also spending heavily to market a third image car, the Dodge Stealth, which is built by the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation.
Unlike its domestic competitors, the Ford Motor Company has steered clear of image cars in recent years. Paradoxically, the company garnered one of the industry's biggest image coups in the 1980's with the Taurus, a mid-sized family sedan with styling that was ahead of its time.
 
Another Japanese Success

By and large, foreign car companies have learned how to make their image cars pay for themselves. Japanese manufacturers, in particular, developed ways to make several models on the same assembly line, keeping their investment in new tooling to a minimum.
Consider Honda's NSX. The low-slung two-seater has garnered a great deal of praise from auto enthusiast magazines. Its list price is $61,000, but buyers eager for prestige often pay thousands more. The Japanese plant that makes the car's engine also makes four other Honda engines.
"It won't take long for Honda to make money off the NSX," predicted Ron Harbour, an automotive manufacturing consultant in Troy, Mich.
But for American car makers, financial constraints "made it tougher for product guys to sell image car programs" to top management, said Ralph Sarotte, marketing manager for Dodge. The value to Chrysler of a car like the Viper, which is expected to go on sale next year at about $50,000, can be viewed as equal to the cost of a couple of major advertising campaigns, Mr. Sarotte said.
"If the Viper sells in low volumes but becomes the center of a new Dodge image, it takes us a long way as far as how much we have to spend on advertising to establish Dodge's performance credentials," Mr. Sarotte said.
G.M. executives argue that the Reatta did add luster to the Buick line and drew buyers to other models. They cite Buick's increased sales and market share during the last four years. General Motors executives say they canceled the Reatta only reluctantly, not because the car failed to meet expectations, but because the market for two-seat luxury cars collapsed.
Automotive analysts estimate that General Motors spent about $500 million on the engineering, design and tooling for the Reatta, and earned back a fraction of its investment through the sale of about 20,000 cars.
Some industry analysts argue that the Reatta was poorly conceived from the start. Priced at $29,300, the roadster was supposed to draw affluent, middle-aged customers out of imported sports sedans and into Buick dealerships. But Buick planners wanted enough of the familiar comforts of an expensive American sedan to make traditional Buick customers feel at home.
The result was a tight, sensuous exterior paired with a boxy interior that was lifted from the Buick Riviera to save money. The car was loaded with features, with the only options being a 16-way adjustable driver's seat and a power sunroof. But enthusiasts carped that G.M. engineers had left out a five-speed manual transmission that seemed a natural.
"I still think image cars are a wonderful idea," said David E. Davis, editor of Automobile magazine. "But it's important that the car have an image. The Reatta had no personality whatsoever."

HEADLINE: Treasury Securities a Big Hit With Americans Last Year

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Individual American investors bought a record $120.5 billion worth of Treasury securities last year, according to data from the Federal Reserve Board. The purchases by individuals came to nearly 45 percent of the more than $272 billion in securities issued in 1990 to finance the budget deficit.
"That is an eye-opening number," said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America. "But in the aggregate, individuals are more intelligent making investment decisions than the professionals who manage money. And there were lots of good reasons to be in high-quality securities last year." 
 The Fed's numbers showed that household purchases of Treasury securities were biggest in the first and fourth quarters of the year as depositors appeared to shift money out of savings accounts and other bank instruments at times of marked concern about the stability of the financial system.
Not coincidentally, fears about the savings and loan industry heightened during the first quarter. And in the fourth quarter, concern about the health of some big banks added to the nervousness of investors after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
"The first and fourth quarters were periods when the backdrop was unsettled, and concerns about the financial system were at their height," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation.
For a year at least, the Fed's numbers put to rest the notion that strong demand from foreigners was required to sell Treasury securities.
Attracted by higher interest rates elsewhere, foreign purchases of Treasury issues were essentially flat last year, compared with the levels for 1989, at around $30 billion. That level is down sharply from 1988, when foreigners bought $62 billion.
The Fed's numbers for household purchases are estimates, and include purchases made by personal trust accounts and nonprofit organizations. They do not include purchases of Treasury securities made by mutual funds or money market funds, often owned by individuals.
Because the increase in household purchases rose so much -- to $120 billion, from $48.5 billion in 1989 -- some private analysts assumed that the Fed had piled securities into that category because it had no idea where else to put them. Fed officials, who asked not to be identified, conceded that was the case.
But the officials said that since they collected hard data on purchases by other major groups -- banks, savings and loan associations, mutual funds and money market funds -- and knew how many securities were issued, it became a simple matter of subtraction.
"If market interest rates appear high compared to bank rates," Mr. Soss of First Boston said, "you will take money out of the bank and put it into bills or notes."

HEADLINE: U.S. Shifts Complaints On Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has found fewer trade barriers in Japan than it did last year, but more in the European Community, Canada, Mexico, China, South Korea, India, Australia and Thailand, according to a special trade report published today.
But the Administration still listed more trade complaints against Japan than against any other nation. 
 Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said the sixth annual inventory of trade barriers "underscores the tremendous amount of work that still needs to be done" in trying to open markets.
As coordinator of Administration trade policy and head of the trade office that negotiates with foreign governments, she was in charge of preparing this year's catalogue, called the National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers.
 
 Soaring Deficit With China
 Particularly sharp attention was drawn to China, where the United States trade deficit almost doubled last year, to $10.4 billion. Trade officials said they believed the deficit with China would continue rising this year, to become second highest after that with Japan.
Last year, the deficits of $41 billion with Japan and $11 billion with Taiwan were the main components of the overall $101 billion trade gap between the United States and the rest of the world.
The principal complaints against China involved its system of import bans, covering 80 types of products, mostly consumer goods, as well as its licensing regulations and patent, copyright and trademark piracy. The Government says these measures cost American business billions of dollars a year.
 
 Effect of Accords With Japan

The reason for fewer citations against Japan was the conclusion in the last year of market-opening agreements covering supercomputers, satellites, wood products, sound recordings and metal alloys for electrical distribution transformers.
The annual report is required by Congress as a way for the executive branch to shed light on trade policy directions over the coming 12 months.
For the first time since the series began in 1986, there was a discussion of trading and economic conditions in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe -- a sign of the recent varied and halting efforts of these countries to join the world trading system.
Of the Soviet Union, the report summed up the bleak conviction of many in the Administration that "comprehensive reform had come to an end" and that the Government was still "attempting to achieve market performance through administrative solutions."
 
 'Not an Exercise in Name Calling'
 Although the report lists specific barriers and attempts to assess their impact on American exporters, Joshua Bolton, general counsel of the trade office, said it was "not an exercise in name calling" but rather a "resource for us to use in assessing where we are and where we ought to be going with each of our trading partners."
The report was longer this year than last year -- 257 pages against 216. The first report in 1986 was 300 pages.
Asked whether the size of the report this year should be read as a sign of failure of Government programs to open markets, Mr. Bolton said there had been "notable successes," citing resolution of some disputes with Japan and with South Korea. Washington concluded market access agreements in beef, wine and telecommunications with Seoul last year.
But Mr. Bolton warned that the trade reports would never get much slimmer until the 108 member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade reached an accord in their talks on new rules.
Those talks, which began five years ago, broke off in December amid a dispute over farm subsidies that pitted the European Community and Japan on one side against the United States, Canada, Argentina and other food exporters on the other.
The talks have resumed, but for them to be concluded Congress has to approve an Administration request for an extension of negotiating authority. Congress is expected to vote sometime before the present authority expires on May 31.
 
 Mexico's Restrictions
 Mexico, with which the United States is seeking a free-trade arrangement, was cited for a variety of restrictions, including high tariffs and import licensing rules. Mr. Bolton said many of these problems could be resolved under a free-trade pact.
One country was added to the list this year, Singapore, where the United States trade deficit in 1990 was $1.8 billion, or $223 million higher than in 1989.
Although Singapore imposes few tariffs, it has major restrictions on imports of cigarettes, and its state-owned telecommunications authority severely limits access by American companies.
The trade office is expected to follow up this largely informative report with another on April 26 naming major violators of intellectual property rights. That report could lead to some specific trade action -- the citing of countries for "priority" negotiations under a 1988 trade law that could lead to trade retaliation.
The International Intellectual Property Alliance, which represents the film, recording, publishing, music and computer software industries, said it wanted four nations cited: China, India, Thailand and Indonesia.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Show Biggest Gain in 5 Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Sales of new homes surged 16.2 percent in February, the biggest advance in nearly five years, the Commerce Department reported today. Analysts attributed the upswing to lower mortgage rates and the end of the war in the Persian Gulf.
The department said the February gain, the first since November, was paced by a huge advance in sales in the Midwest, although all regions enjoyed increases from an extremely depressed January level. 
 The February increase still left sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 467,000 units last month, 22.9 percent below the level of a year earlier.
The report was the third piece of evidence that the housing industry is beginning to rebound. Sales of existing homes were up 7.9 percent last month, also the biggest rise in nearly five years. Also, construction of new homes and apartments rose, and applications for new building permits posted the first gain in eight months.
 
 Only One Month's Data

"One month's statistics should not be overemphasized, but the trend toward an upturned market is definitely very real," said John Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. "People are back in the market due to low interest rates and postwar euphoria."
Fixed-rate mortgages fell to a four-year low of 9.25 percent in February but have since climbed back up a bit as financial markets have begun to express concerns about inflation.
But economists forecast that rates should begin to back off in coming months as inflationary worries subside and the Federal Reserve loosens credit further to end the recession.
David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, said he looked for fixed-rate mortgages to return to around 9.25 percent, and possibly as low as 9 percent.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported today that rates were falling in the past week with fixed-rate mortgages edging down to 9.52 percent, from 9.59 percent the previous week.
The rate for one-year adjustable mortgages, which was already at a low, fell even further, to 7.41 percent from 7.44 percent.
 
 Prices Rise, Too
 The Commerce Department report showed that the upswing in new home sales in February was accompanied by a rise in prices to near-record levels.
The median selling price climbed to $127,500. That was up from $120,000 in January and was the highest since a record of $130,000 in April 1990. The median is the point at which as many homes sell for higher prices as for lower. The average price was up as well, rising to $156,800, the highest since a record $158,600 set in September 1989.
Thomas Holloway, senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said large backlogs of unsold houses would exert downward pressure on prices for some months to come.
The 16.2 percent rise in new single-family home sales followed a 12.6 percent decline in January and was the biggest one-month gain since a 21 percent jump in March 1986.
The Midwest enjoyed the biggest gain of any region, a record 70.3 percent increase, but analysts said it was unlikely to last.
Sales in the South were up 9.1 percent, to an annual rate of 192,000 units, and sales in the Northeast rose 5.9 percent, to a rate of 54,000 units. Sales in the West posted the smallest gain during the month, a 1 percent rise, to a rate of 113,000 units.

HEADLINE: ECONOMY INDEX UP, SPURRING OPTIMISM ON RECESSION'S END

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
In a sign that the recession may be approaching an end, the Government said today that its main economic forecasting index climbed 1.1 percent in February, the first advance since June and the biggest in more than two and a half years.
Even though the bulk of the rise in the index of leading indicators was caused by financial and psychological factors, many analysts regarded the Commerce Department report as evidence of an impending upturn in the economy after a half-year or so of contraction. 
 "Things are coming around," said Kenneth T. Mayland, chief economist at the Society National Bank in Cleveland. "The recession's not going to last too much longer."
 
Caveats About a Prediction
 Some experts said, however, that it was still too early to predict a recovery with confidence, since the index has often proved unreliable, even when for three or more months it appeared to be calling a turn in the economy. Moreover, the lag between a correct signal and an economic revival can be quite long, as it was in 1982 when the index rose an average of 1.2 percent in February and April and the recession continued until almost the end of the year.
"The sharp rise in the leading indicators may represent a false positive reading," cautioned Gordon Richards of the National Association of Manufacturers. "It would be premature to forecast an early end to the recession."
The Commerce Department also reported today that sales of new single-family houses rebounded 16 percent in February, further evidence of some quickening in housing activity. [Page 29.] Groundbreaking for new homes and sales of existing homes have been previously reported as moving up last month from depressed levels.
Although soaring stock prices and a surge in consumer expectations dominated the increase in the index of leading indicators, analysts noted that five other components also rose. Only 3 of the 11 elements declined, with vendor performance -- the speed with which companies obtain goods from their suppliers -- unchanged last month.
The index of coincident indicators, which is intended to gauge current economic conditions, fell six-tenths of 1 percent last month, the department also reported. That was the eighth straight decline for the index, but the smallest drop since August.
The advance in the leading index, which was somewhat larger than most analysts had expected, followed a revised decline for January of five-tenths of 1 percent. New factory orders for consumer goods were lower than originally estimated when the department initially reported a January decline of four-tenths of 1 percent.
Rising stock prices, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index, accounted for more than half of the increase in the leading index. Other sizable contributions came from the jump in the University of Michigan's survey of consumer expectations, an advance in building permits and a higher M-2 money supply.
Small positive impetus came from higher factory orders for consumer goods, higher factory backlogs of unfilled durable-goods orders and higher prices for materials that are especially sensitive to business cycles, like copper.
 
 Other Economic Measures
 Holding the index back were a surge in initial claims for state unemployment insurance, a reduction in the length of the workweek and a decline in contracts and orders for plants and equipment.
The 1.1 percent overall increase was the biggest since a 1.6 percent gain in June 1988.
The department's index of lagging indicators, which includes such data as the prime lending rate and the average duration of joblessness, declined two-tenths of 1 percent in February after two months of increases averaging six-tenths of 1 percent.
This helped push down the ratio of the coincident indicators to lagging ones -- an alternate forecasting tool -- for the sixth straight month.
Two privately constructed predictors showed increases similar to that of the Government's leading index. The Macroeconomic index compiled by Jesup, Josephthal & Company was calculated at minus 92 for February, up from minus 112 in January and from minus 118 at the trough in November.
Safian Investment Research, another New York firm, said its index had risen 1.6 percent, with 13 components up, 9 down and one unchanged. With stocks and monetary components removed, the Safian index fell one-tenth of 1 percent.
"You're seeing a definite bottoming in economic activity," said Kenneth Safian, the head of the firm.

HEADLINE: Four Bid for Units of Bank of New England

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced yesterday that three banking companies had offered to buy the three failed banks once owned by the Bank of New England Corporation, while a fourth group had offered to buy just one of the failed banks.
A larger field of potential bidders shrank in recent weeks amid uncertainty over the immediate prospects for the New England economy and the enormous task involved in taking on such a large and troubled institution. 
 The Bank of New England, once the second-largest banking company in New England, today has $20 billion of assets and 320 branches in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine. Its collapse is expected to cost the Government $2.3 billion, making it the third-most-costly failure of a banking company, after the failures of the First Republic Bankcorporation and MCorp, both of Dallas. The winner of the bidding will be announced on April 16.
The largest bidders are the BankAmerica Corporation, based in San Francisco, the nation's second-largest banking company, and the two largest banking companies in New England: the Bank of Boston, the largest, and the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group of Providence, R.I. These three companies are expected to bid for all three of the Bank of New England subsidiaries, but the three companies and the F.D.I.C. would not provide details of their offers.
An investor group led by Marco F. DeSalle, a businessman in Portland, Me., and a former banker, offered to buy the failed Maine bank, with $1 billion of assets, the smallest of the three banks offered for sale.
BankAmerica was the first to show interest in the Bank of New England, and was talking with the F.D.I.C. about an acquisition even before the Boston-based company collapsed in early January. Profits of more than $1 billion in the last two years have made BankAmerica strong enough that it has been actively buying savings institutions in California and nearby states.
 
 Bank of Boston's Bid
 For the Bank of Boston, which analysts said had arranged for fresh capital to be supplied by other investors if its bid was accepted, an acquisition of the Bank of New England would be an opportunity to sharply reduce the costs of operating the two companies by closing duplicated branches and computer operations. Without additional capital, the Bank of Boston satisfies the minimum standards set by regulators, but would fall short of the extra-strong capital position regulators would expect of a buyer.
Fleet/Norstar, which has also suffered loan losses since the New England economy stumbled, has combined forces with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the Wall Street buyout firm.
It is expected that the winning bidder will pay more than the $750 million the Government invested in the three banks when they were seized in early January. To protect themselves from losses on bad loans made by the Bank of New England units, bankers are expected to insist on the right to return bad loans to the F.D.I.C. Bankers who have talked with the F.D.I.C. say the agency is willing to give banks a three-year period during which bad loans might be returned.
 
Terms of Deal

In selling the failed banks, which it has been operating since they were seized in early January, the Government will transfer to the buyer the loans and deposits of the failed banks. But because the amount of good quality loans is expected to be less than the deposits, the F.D.I.C. must provide cash or short-term notes to make up the difference. The amount of the cash or notes, adjusted for what the F.D.I.C. makes on bad loans, which are not part of the purchase, determines its loss.
At the end of 1990, the Bank of New England said it had about $3.3 billion of loans more than 90 days past due, or so deeply troubled that it did not expect full payment. The company has more than $2.5 billion of additional loans that have been criticized by examiners and are considered highly risky by bankers.
Since early January, potential bidders have been circling the troubled bank. But in the last few weeks, some of the nation's best-known banks have dropped out of the bidding.
The Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, which acquired MCorp in 1989, said this week it would not bid because of worries that the New England economy had not bottomed out, and that it expected more attractive acquisition opportunities to come along. The Chase Manhattan Corporation said it would not bid when it became clear that the F.D.I.C. wanted to sell the three banks as a unit, or as single banks, and not split off the southern Connecticut branches that interested Chase. Others that dropped out included the U.S. Trust Corporation of Boston and the Corestates Financial Corporation of Philadelphia.
Bert Ely, a bank analyst in Alexandria, Va., said he was not troubled by the smaller number of bidders but was far more concerned about whether a strong, newly capitalized Bank of New England would be so competitive it might push other regional banks into insolvency.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C., has said that when the bids are evaluated he will consider the impact on other banks in the area -- and the cost of their failure to the F.D.I.C. insurance fund -- when deciding which bid results in the lowest cost to his agency.
Ira Stepanian, chairman of the Bank of Boston, says that Federal regulators should give preference to bids from banking companies already in the region. Local comapnies will do most, he contends, to increase the availability ot credit to local businesses and help to revive the region's economy.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Assails Gorbachev Rule For 'Stagnation'

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 29

 BODY:
Flush with the victory of his followers against the Kremlin's strong show of force a day ago, Boris N. Yeltsin assailed the central authorities today for seeking to restore the "period of stagnation" that preceded perestroika.
Mr. Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, issued the attack in a 90-minute report to a special session of the republic's Parliament. The meeting resumed today after the Kremlin withdrew the cordon of military vehicles and troops that was placed around the city center on Thursday in an attempt to block a demonstration by Yeltsin followers who took to the streets anyway, rallying peacefully in a crowd of more than 100,000. 
 After that setback for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin's chief target, the contest today featured intensive parliamentary scuffles between Mr. Yeltsin's Democratic Russia bloc and its Communist-led opposition.
 
Victories for Both Sides
 The voting seesawed between the two sides, with both scoring some tactical victories. Mr. Yeltsin's most significant triumph came in such a vote, which demonstrated that his opponents are not likely to muster enough votes if they try to oust him as president of the republic's Parliament.
Mr. Yeltsin's report was a sustained attack on the Communists and the central Government and a broad reaffirmation of his program of radical economic and political change, based on the "500-day" program for a transition to a market economy that Mr. Gorbachev rejected last fall. In referring to the "period of stagnation," Mr. Yeltsin turned a phrase back on Mr. Gorbachev that the Soviet leader has often used to refer to Leonid I. Brezhnev's nearly two decades in power from 1964 to 1982.
The speech, however, gave no timetable or specific plan for putting the programs in effect, underscoring the fundamental fact of the political contest in Moscow -- that Mr. Yeltsin has considerable popularity but not the levers to achieve his will, while Mr. Gorbachev holds huge formal powers but lacks the mandate to wield them.
Mr. Yeltsin did not directly reiterate his call last month for Mr. Gorbachev's resignation, but the demand was implicit in his insistence that the existing central government had demonstrated itself incapable of any significant reform.
"The objective results of the past six years demonstrate that what we have been witnessing is not perestroika, but rather the last phase of the period of stagnation," he declared.
Mr. Yeltsin won the loudest cheers when he called on all political forces, including the Communists, to gather in "round table" discussions on the future of the Soviet Union, much as the East Germans or the Hungarians did.
 
Posing the Issues
 He declared that two directly opposed policies were contending in the land. One was to "achieve thorough change in every aspect of life, to drastically renew the U.S.S.R. and transform it into a union of sovereign states."
The other, he said, was "to preserve and even enhance the economic monopoly of the center" and thus bring economic catastrophe.
The notion of two competing policies was hardly surprising to the delegates gathered in the Kremlin after the tense confrontations on Thursday and after the entire morning session was taken up by political maneuvering over the agenda.
The skirmishes indicated that the five-day session of the Russian parliament was not likely to achieve much beyond fanning the political feud between the forces arrayed behind Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev. But it did show that the fledgling parliament of the Russian federated republic, the largest and most powerful of the nation's 15 constituent parts, had come to appreciate some parliamentary traditions.
Legislators from both sides shouted and interjected as lustily as any British member of Parliament, and sharp tactical maneuvers were concealed behind arcane procedural motions.
One vote was whether to term Mr. Yeltsin's address a "report," which would indicate a presidential survey of the state of his republic, or an "accounting," which would imply a response to the accusations of the opposition. "Report" won by 612 to 341, demonstrating that a majority of the legislators stood behind Mr. Yeltsin.
At the same time, the parliament showed that Mr. Yeltsin did not have the two-thirds majority necessary to amend the constitution and create the office of a popularly elected president, even though a majority of voters in the Russian republic, which has more than half of the nation's population, approved the idea in the recent referendum. On a procedural vote to discuss the consequences of the referendum, Mr. Yeltsin mustered only 508 legislators, less than the half of the 1,068 total votes required for passage.
 
Move for Special Session
 The special session was initially demanded by Mr. Yeltsin's opponents to censure and possibly impeach him for calling on Mr. Gorbachev to resign. Mr. Yeltsin's followers then called a demonstration for the start of the session, upon which Mr. Gorbachev decreed a ban on all mass gatherings in Moscow for 20 days.
Reporting on the handling of the rallies to the nation's Parliament, Interior Minister Boris K. Pugo insisted that all 50,000 troops used in the operation were "permanently deployed in Moscow," and that "neither the Interior Ministry nor the Soviet Army sent additional troops to Moscow." He also denied that military equipment was used to block any streets or squares.
The statements contradicted what large numbers of Muscovites saw for themselves, that troops were brought in from outside the capital, and that large military trucks parked bumper-to-bumper were used to block streets.
The pro-Gorbachev majority at the Soviet Union's Parliament, which is meeting concurrently with the Russian Parliament, adopted a resolution that "gave a positive assessment of law-enforcement bodies' activities during rallies on Thursday," Tass reported.

HEADLINE: Corporate Underwriting Set Record in Quarter

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Despite the recession, American corporations sought huge amounts of cash from the public markets in the first quarter of 1991, with the volume bringing slightly increased fees to Wall Street.
For the quarter, corporations issued a record $104.5 billion in domestic securities, up 30.7 percent from the $79.97 billion raised in the first quarter of 1990, according to the Securities Data Company, a New York research firm. 
 The determining factor in the push to raise capital was the decline of interest rates during the quarter, underwriters said. Many companies had been holding out for lower rates for as long as a year, and, when the drop came, they plunged into the markets.
"After the war began in mid-January without the world falling apart, and then when we got attractive absolute rate levels, there was a huge flow of deals," said Grant Kvalheim, a managing director on the capital markets desk at Merrill Lynch & Company.
Despite the success in the Persian Gulf, lower interest rates and a healthy stream of deals, fees for underwriters did not pick up substantially, although they rose enough to help the troubled financial services industry.
Total fees for the quarter were $625.9 million, a small 5 percent increase from the period last year.
Merrill Lynch was the biggest underwriter for the quarter. In 1988, Merrill moved past Salomon Brothers, which had long held the top spot in underwriting, and has been building a steady lead in the business ever since.
For the quarter, Merrill underwrote $21.59 billion in domestic securities, giving it 20.7 percent of the market, according to Securities Data. Goldman, Sachs & Company was second, underwriting $13.53 billion for a 13 percent share. Next came the First Boston Corporation and Morgan Stanley & Company.
 
Initial Offerings Down
 While a large amount of capital was being sought, much of the cash was raised through debt securities, even as the Dow Jones industrial average surged by 10.8 percent since the beginning of the year.
Initial public offerings did particularly poorly, with only $2.7 billion issued, according to Securities Data. That is down 37 percent from the volume in the first quarter of last year, and a drop of 68.9 percent from the peak volume during the fourth quarter of 1986.
The total for all equity issues was also down, with $6.8 billion in underwritings, compared with $7.1 billion a year earlier. But the figures indicate that with the uncertainties caused by the gulf war resolved, equity underwritings could strengthen. More than half of the volume, about $3.4 billion, came in March alone, after the war, according to IDD Information Services, another New York research firm.
One exception to the surge in debt securities was "junk bonds," where the market collapsed early in the year.
Indeed, some underwriters said that, with the threat of a junk bond-financed takeover unlikely, and with interest rates at a favorable level, the appetite for investment-grade debt climbed, fueled by the Federal Reserve's repeated cuts in interest rates.
In the first quarter, $41.8 billion in corporate debt was issued, up 36.1 percent from $26 billion a year ago. According to Securities Data, more than 88 percent of this debt was issued without call provisions, which would allow the issuers to repurchase the bonds at a fixed price, indicating that corporate treasurers are confident in this market.
After booming for many quarters, the markets for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities showed tentative signs of slowing growth in the first quarter. The mortgage-backed and asset-backed issues made up 49 percent of the total domestic market, compared with 56.5 percent at the end of 1990. New issues reached $51.3 billion, up 12.2 percent from the 1990 period.
The winner in fees was Goldman, Sachs, which received $120.1 million in the first quarter for underwritings. The first-quarter fees of the firm equaled 49 percent of the $244.2 million it received in all of 1990, Securities Data said.

HEADLINE: Bank Insurance in S.E.C. Study

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
A Securities and Exchange Commission study indicates that the Federal Government supplies banking deposit insurance far below what it is worth.
The study, released on Thursday by the S.E.C.'s Office of Economic Analysis, was requested by the commission's chairman, Richard C. Breeden, who was a key figure in the savings and loan bailout strategy two years ago when he was a White House aide. 
 Concerns about the adequacy of existing bank deposit insurance have been heightened by the enormous taxpayer costs of the savings and loan bailout and a sharp decline in the insurance fund's reserves.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which guarantees bank deposits, is running short of money because of record bank failures in recent years and will have to borrow Federal money to bolster the fund. The Administration has proposed that the F.D.I.C. be allowed to borrow $25 billion from the Federal Reserve.
The S.E.C. study concluded that the value of deposit insurance was three to five times greater than the premium being collected from banks.
The flat-rate premiums paid by all commercial banks, the study concluded, lead to safer banks cross-subsidizing riskier banks, which "greatly underprices the aggregate risk" assumed by the F.D.I.C. But the study said a substantial premium increase would not necessarily solve the problem.

 BODY:

The Economy
The Government's main economic forecasting index climbed 1.1 percent in February, signaling that the recession may be nearing an end. It was the first rise in the index of leading economic indicators since June and its biggest in two and a half years. [Page 1.] 

 Sales of new homes surged 16.2 percent in February, the biggest advance in nearly five years, the Commerce Department reported. Analysts attributed the upswing to lower mortgage rates and the end of the war in the Persian Gulf. [29.]
Trade barriers in Japan have declined from last year, the Bush Administration has found, although there are still more trade complaints against Japan than against any other nation. But a special report cited increasing barriers in the European Community, Canada, Mexico, China, South Korea, India, Australia and Thailand. [25.]
The Administration said it would appeal a tariff ruling that requires the U.S. to lift $18 million of punitive duties on imports of Canadian pork. The ruling by a binational dispute-settlement panel in January caused a storm of protest in the Farm Belt. [25.]
 
Companies
Three banking companies bid for failed banks in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine that were once owned by the Bank of New England, the F.D.I.C. said. They are BankAmerica, the Bank of Boston and Fleet/Norstar of Providence. An investor group led by a Portland business executive offered to buy the failed Maine bank. The winner is to be announced April 16. [25.]
An offer to buy out Trans World Airlines was agreed to by the carrier's unions, which would offer cost savings of $137 million a year, and the West Coast financier, Kirk Kerkorian, who would put up $250 million. The plan will die if the Transporation Department gives final approval to the sale of T.W.A.'s London routes to American Airlines. Both sides have yet to discuss the tentative plan with Carl C. Icahn, T.W.A.'s chairman. [27.]
Alcoa said it would have to deduct $1 billion from its earnings because of a change in how companies must account for retiree health-care benefits. Alcoa disclosed the amount in its annual report but said it had not decided on the form of the deduction. It can be taken either in a lump sum or over 20 years. [27.]
 
Markets
Individual American investors bought a record $120.5 billion worth of Treasury securities last year, according to the Federal Reserve Board. They shifted money out of savings accounts and other bank instruments at times of marked concern about the stability of the financial system and bought nearly 45 percent of the $272 billion in securities issued by the Treasury in 1990. [25.]
American corporations sought huge amounts of cash from the public markets in the first quarter of 1991, issuing a record $104.5 billion in domestic securities, up 30.7 percent from the first quarter of 1990. The big underwriting volume at a time of dropping interest rates brought slightly increased fees to Wall Street. [26.]
Prices of Treasury securities were essentially unchanged in extremely light dealings. With New York Treasury dealers closed for Good Friday, along with most European financial centers, there were few transactions. Stock and commodity exchanges and corporate and tax-exempt bond markets were all closed. [28.]
The dollar slipped in New York but rose in Tokyo in extremely thin trading. Gold markets were closed for Good Friday. [29.]
 
Today's Columns
Taxpayers can reduce their tax bite for 1990, even at this late date, by making the right filing choices, being alert to recent tax-law changes and contributing to an I.R.A., if eligible. The "kiddie tax," on income from investments held in the name of children under age 14, is a prime example. Your Money. [26.]
Two California entrepreneurs have patented a building alarm that could give people a few seconds to run for cover when an earthquake is about to strike. Patents. [26.]

HEADLINE: Building Plans for Foley Sq. Are Unveiled

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF

 BODY:
Proclaiming that their project will help lift New York's sagging development industry, Federal officials unveiled the final models yesterday for a new Federal courthouse and office building on Foley Square in lower Manhattan.
The project -- a 27-story courthouse and a 34-story office building -- will cover the sites of three small buildings and two parking lots and probably cost $1 billion by the time it is completed in late 1994. The size of the project, nearly 1.9 million square feet, makes it a major civilian undertaking for the Federal Government. 
 "Look at this way," said Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, who has been the leading backer of the project. "It will be two-thirds the size of the Pentagon."
If nothing else, anticipation of the room the huge undertaking will provide should relieve a cramped judiciary, and the dollar signs that go with it promise to invigorate Foley Square, the heart of the city's legal community.
 
City Has Second Thoughts
 At the unveiling, attended by Senator Moynihan and several Federal judges, Mayor David N. Dinkins said that $1.5 million of the $104 million the Federal Government had already paid the city had been committed to the renovation of the square itself. That will probably include the elimination of some roads, creating a plaza in the middle of today's vale of concrete criss-crossed by asphalt.
The city, though, has apparently had second thoughts about occupying half the office building. In the slumping real-estate market, it has found space in other downtown buildings at lower rents, said William J. Diamond, regional administrator of the Federal General Services Administration.
But Mr. Diamond said the space would be filled easily by moving in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the General Accounting Office and other Federal agencies that now have offices throughout the city.
The Government began planning the project years before the current slump began, Mr. Diamond said, and in any case, it needs office and courtroom space in the area, not in an uptown building, where space might be going begging. Other offices will remain in the existing Jacob K. Javits Federal Office Building, next to the new one, which will be bordered by Broadway and Duane, Reade and Elk Streets.
The new buildings have generated local opposition. Some Chinatown residents say the courthouse, on Chatham Square between Worth and Pearl Streets, will further encroach on their neighborhood, which has nearly no open or park space nearby. Officials of Community Board 1 in Manhattan say they resent the way the project was approved without consultation with them.
In 1989, worried that public hearings could derail their plans, the Federal government and the city agreed to a Federal "friendly condemnation" of the city-owned sites, which allowed officials to bypass the community board, the the City Planning Commission and the Board of Estimate.
 
In a Parking Lot
 "We don't necessarily object to the new buildings," said Paul Goldstein, district manager for Community Board 1. "But we do object to the fact that the public was denied input."
The $241 million contract for the new courthouse, which will stand on what is now a parking lot behind the State Supreme Court at 60 Centre Street, was won by the development company BPT Properties for a design by the architects Kohn Pederson Fox.
The entrance will not look out on Foley Square because it is blocked by the state court, but the building is designed to "bring the square together" by blending with older buildings, said Eugene Kohn, one of the architects.
The courthouse and the new office building will have both classical and modern details. Both will be of "buff-colored granite with decorative banding" and have glass roofs illuminated from inside at night.
Steven Flanders, head administrator for the Second Circuit of the Federal Appeals Court, said the new courthouse will add badly needed space so that files will no longer be stacked in basement corridors and judges will not have to scrounge for courtrooms on busy days, as they do now. It will have 43 new courtrooms, one ceremonial one, and 42 new judges' chambers.
The office building, designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, will be built by The Linpro Company. The 974,000 square feet will have space for 4,200 workers and will include a day care center, a four-story glass-enclosed galleria, a three-story rotunda and 14,000 square feet of retail space.

HEADLINE: Chicago Journal;
To Lessen Their Pain, Mexicans Relive Christ's

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 29

 BODY:
On this bit terly cold day far from the sands of Jerusalem, an unemployed laundry worker donned a white tunic and a crown of thorns and dragged a wooden cross past the cantinas and tortilla factories of Chicago's Mexican neighborhood.
Young mothers held their babies up to tenement windows and restaurant workers climbed on top of fences to see the recreation of Jesus, surrounded by apostles and Roman sentries, walking to his death. 
 For many of Chicago's 300,000 Mexican-Americans, Good Friday is the most solemn day of the year. Despite the blight of drugs and gang violence, they are held together in part by their staunch belief in a prophet who lived as humbly as they do.
While the Passion play is depicted throughout the world at with more pomp and circumstance, often in the original Latin and with music by Bach, this one is a grass-roots version, imported from poor villages in Mexico to Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood in the shadow of the Loop.
The Mexican-Americans here, who make up the city's largest Hispanic group, have carved out a life for themselves amid the shootings and drug dealing of the neighborhood's half-dozen gangs. For the last 15 years, residents have come together for the Via Crucis pageant, or Way of the Cross, as a way of pulling the community together.
"It means remembering your roots, your faith, your traditions and being proud to be a Mexican again," said the Rev. Manuel Myvett Diaz, a pageant organizer. "It's something where nobody puts you down. You're not under the Americans. It's a time to celebrate being Mexican and Catholic."
The pageant is unpretentious and distinctly Mexican. "This is closer to the people," said Alejandro Aquilera, a factory worker who played the apostle Simon in a previous production. "Just look at who Jesus is."
Salvador Moreno, who played the role of Jesus this year, is 35 years old and has been laid off from his job at a laundry. He is a quiet, modest man with no acting credits, but he was chosen by the pageant's organizers because he is a faithful parishioner and because they knew it was unlikely he would be seen staggering out of the corner cantina the next night.
"No one with his five senses would really want to do it," said Father Diaz. "No one is worthy, but we look for someone who is most worthy, humanly speaking."
Even after Mr. Moreno was chosen, many would-be Jesuses came forward and begged to play the part. But the role is a hard one to live up to, Mr. Moreno said. "You live in the community and they watch what you do," he said. "You're really living the part that you're playing."
Indeed, today he hauled a 150-pound cross in a bitter wind for most of the two-mile route to the crucifixion site, his face weary and stained with mock blood. The crush of onlookers, clutching their scarves and coats, swelled with each passing block as the faithful walked by his side singing "Perdona Tu Pueblo, Senor," or "Forgive Your People, Lord."
Jorge Nieto, a 40-year-old factory worker, portrayed Jesus four years ago and remembers feeling unworthy and overwhelmed. "I was trembling up there on the cross," Mr. Nieto said. "I remember it, and it gives me the chills."
This year, after a series of gang killings, residents used the pageant as a means of praying for an end to the violence. They walked past the beauty shops and the bakeries selling canastas and tostadas and past the driving schools named after Mexican towns but defaced by gang grafitti. The procession paused for prayer at a cantina where some gang members were killed recently.
Some wondered what difference it might make. "The people who are praying are not the ones in the gangs," said Raquel Lavala, a neighborhood resident. "But who knows. Maybe they are among us."
The processional ended on a hill at a community park carpeted with thousands of people. Mr. Moreno was affixed to the cross and promised that one of the thieves next to him would be with him in Heaven. Then his body went limp.
Onlookers wiped their eyes and looked away. Children pointed and said, "Mira, mira," or, "Look, look," at the spectacle before them.
Mr. Moreno was then wrapped in cloth and carried toward the recessional as ceremoniously as the day had begun, and the crowd dispersed.
People went back to work and to their lives. And the streets of Pilsen returned to the men standing idle on street corners, to the homeless people scavenging for something to sell, and to the children, their noses pressed against bakery windows.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Officers Testify That Motorist Acted Oddly

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 29

 BODY:
Police officers present at the videotaped beating of a black motorist told a Los Angeles County grand jury that his behavior after he was stopped made them nervous, a reaction that one defense lawyer said today could have contributed to the actions of the officers.
Transcripts of four days of grand jury testimony, made public today, include statements from two officers who witnessed but did not participate in the beating and who said the behavior of the motorist, Rodney G. King, was unlike anything they had seen before. 
 The videotape, made during the early hours of March 3 by a nearby resident, shows Mr. King, an unemployed construction worker who was stopped for speeding, being clubbed and kicked more than 50 times.
Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officers Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. Briseno have pleaded not guilty to charges of assault.
Today Officer Briseno's lawyer, John D. Barnett, said of the officers' statements, "I think it is a fair reading of those witnesses' disclosures that they observed extremely bizarre behavior prior to the physical contact."
Asked whether that behavior could have contributed to the reactions of the officers, he said, "I think that is a fair reading of that testimony."
Local statutes require that transcripts of grand jury testimony be kept private for 10 days, unless lawyers ask for an extension.
Officer Melanie Singer of the California Highway Patrol, who stopped Mr. King and handled the arrest until it was taken over by the Los Angeles officers, testified that Mr. King did not seem to be taking his arrest seriously and seemed slow to follow her commands.
"Once he exited, the first impression when I saw him, he appeared almost happy -- well, he was smiling," she told the grand jury.
She said he complied with her command to place his hands on the roof of his car. "He then looked up and smiled at the helicopter and began to wave and then more or less dance around with his feet, like a pitter-patter step," she said.
All the while, she said, "He wasn't laughing like, 'Ha, ha,' to that effect. He was laughing like a smirk, smirking."
Officer Singer said that after she ordered him to lie on the ground, "I seen one of his hands -- I don't know if it was his right or his left, but I believe it was his right hand -- by the rear portion of his butt.
"I told him, 'Get your hands away from your butt.' And at that time he grabbed his right buttocks and turned to me and shook his butt in front of me."
At this point, she said, she unholstered her pistol and pointed it at him and said: "Hit the ground. Get your face on the ground. Spread your arms and your legs."
Asked why she drew her gun, she said: "The way he was acting, I didn't know, when he had done this, exactly what his demeanor was. I didn't know, you know, I had never come into contact with something like this."
Throughout, she said, he complied with commands only slowly and partially, and when he finally lay prone on the ground as instructed, he kept his hands by his chest and his knees slightly bent.
Local residents who witnessed the beating did not describe similar behavior to the grand jury. Nor did such behavior appear on the seven-minute videotape, which began later.
Mr. Barnett, the lawyer, said Officer Singer's testimony painted an unusual picture of a man under arrest.
"Pinching his buttocks, waving his buttocks, waving at the helicopter, laughing, dancing in that particular situation," he said, "if he was on a dance floor it would be different. But he was on the street with a bunch of policemen telling him to get down."
 
Second Officer's View
 Another officer, Paul James Beauregard of the Los Angeles school district's police force, testified that Mr. King had an unusual reaction to shocks from a police stun gun.
"I never saw a person being Tasered twice and struck at least nine times without having some more effect than that," said Officer Beauregard, who had arrived on the scene by chance. "And I was getting a little nervous myself."
A Taser is an electric shock device that fires darts attached to long wires. On the tape, Sergeant Koon is seen manipulating the wires as Mr. King rolls on the ground under the beating.

HEADLINE: JAPAN EXPECTING TALK WITH SOVIETS ON DISPUTED ISLES

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said he wants to address Japan's claims to a group of Soviet-held islands when he travels to Tokyo next month, a leader of Japan's governing party said today.
The dispute over the islands, which the Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II, is the most important irritant in the uneasy Soviet-Japanese relationship. The Japanese official, Ichiro Ozawa, described Mr. Gorbachev's position in an interview here after visiting Moscow to prepare for the Soviet leader's trip to Tokyo on April 16. 
 American officials, who support the Japanese claim to the islands, have said a resolution of the issue would help insure stability and expand trade and prosperity in the northern Pacific.
 
Seeking Siberian Development
 Some Soviet leaders are said to hope that a warming of relations with Tokyo could open the way for large-scale Japanese investment in forestry, mining and oil exploration in Siberia. Other Soviet officials argue that the trade and investment benefits are not worth giving up the islands, which lie at the southern end of the Kurile chain, just north of the Japanese archipelago.
Mr. Ozawa, Secretary General of the Liberal Democratic Party and an adviser to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, said the Soviet leader "was very enthusiastically desirous of breaking the impasse in the present Japanese-Soviet relationship."
"For the first time, officially, the territorial issue has been recognized as the agenda item for the two nations," Mr. Ozawa said.
 
Instability a Problem
 But he warned that Mr. Gorbachev's ability to negotiate a settlement might be hampered by "the unstable politics" surrounding the Kremlin now.
The shift in the Soviet position was signaled in September when Eduard A. Shevardnadze, then the Soviet Foreign Minister, visited Tokyo and announced that Moscow was willing to negotiate the Kuriles dispute. But Mr. Shevardnadze insisted that any border "amendments" would be considered only as part of an overall improvement in relations as the two nations negotiate a peace treaty formally ending their hostilities in World War II.
Mr. Ozawa said today that the island issue would be a primary concern raised during Mr. Gorbachev's trip, the first by a Soviet leader to Japan. He added that he expected Mr. Gorbachev to publicly express his desire to resolve the issue, but cautioned that he did not think there would be a negotiated settlement soon.
Mr. Ozawa, who is widely considered a powerful political force independent of the Prime Minister, arrived in Washington on Wednesday to prepare for Mr. Kaifu's meeting with President Bush in California next Thursday.
His conciliatory position toward the Soviet Union has attracted criticism from some senior officials in the Japanese Foreign Ministry, who have said repeatedly that there can be no improvement in relations until Mr. Gorbachev unconditionally forfeits the islands.
In Tokyo, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, is meeting today and on Saturday with his Japanese counterpart, Taro Nakayama, to hammer out details of accords on trade and technology that could be signed when Mr. Gorbachev visits Tokyo next month. The draft agreements also reportedly call for cooperation in aiding victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and for cultural exchanges.
The Japanese press in recent weeks has speculated that Japan is preparing aid packages for the Soviet Union valued at $10 billion to $30 billion to persuade Moscow to compromise. The Foreign Ministry has denied the reports.
The islands at issue are called Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group by the Japanese. The Soviet names for the first two are Iturup and Kunashir.
The Soviet Union seized them shortly after Japan surrendered to the United States on Aug. 15, 1945. Japan says that the act was illegal.
A State Department official who monitors Japanese-Soviet relations said the possibility of a settlement on the islands was "better than it has ever been before, because the two sides are specifically discussing the issue now." He said "all sorts of scenarios" exist for a settlement, including the transfer of two or three of the islands over time.
But two questions, he said, are "how willing is Gorbachev to put his imprimatur on a deal, and how able is he to implement a deal?"
The Soviet position is that the islands were ceded to the Soviet Union in the Yalta agreement, in which Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill charted the postwar order. But the State Department official said the language of the Yalta accord was far from clear on the status of the islands. In any event, Japan was not party to the accord.
Mr. Ozawa said the Kurile dispute and possible future Japanese investment in the Soviet Union "are separate issues." But he added, "If the territorial-political obstacle is removed, economic cooperation, cultural interchange and technical exchange can start simultaneously.".
 
Companies Sound Out Soviets
 He said several Japanese companies were involved in preliminary discussions with Soviet agencies on investment issues.

HEADLINE: Products That Are Wrapped in Messages

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Companies are increasingly turning to environmental themes to sell products. But now some have taken that trend a step further: they are using packaging and other promotional material for political purposes.
The effort involves, among others, Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., the ice cream producer; Body Shop International , a maker of cosmetics, and Rhino Records Inc., a record distributor, who have banded together in a group called Act Now. The group's first project: to support Federal legislation sponsored by Senator Richard H. Bryan , Democrat of Nevada, that would require automobile makers to improve fuel efficiency significantly. 
 "We are companies that are consumer-oriented and want to use their communications power to affect social change," said Bennett Cohen, the chief executive officer of Ben & Jerry's, which is based in Waterbury, Vt. Other companies involved include Stonyfield Farm Inc., a yogurt producer; Smith & Hawken and Seventh Generation Inc., both mail-order distributors; the Utne Reader , a magazine, and the Calvert Funds and Working Assets , two financial services companies.
Act Now's immediate goal is to compile public petitions in support of the Bryan measure, which would require that new cars sold in this country achieve an average fuel efficiency level of about 40 miles per gallon by 2001. Currently, Federal law requires that automakers sell cars that get an average of 27.5 miles per gallon.
 
Car Makers Are Opposed
 The bill is opposed by car makers and some Government officials and car-safety advocates who say that the bill will cause producers to make smaller cars that will be more dangerous.
"We think that fuel economy is a great idea, but the environmentalists just have not done their homework on safety," said Chuck Hurley, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an industry-supported group in Arlington, Va.
Many of the companies involved in Act Now have long promoted their involvement in environmental and social issues. Ben & Jerry's has been among the most active, using its ice cream cartons to promote public interest in topics ranging from rain forest protection to opposition to bovine growth hormone, a genetically engineered hormone intended to increase milk production.
But a year ago, the companies involved in Act Now decided to join together with the aim of affecting Federal legislation through their customers.
"We wanted a way to have a measurable impact for our efforts and the way to do that is to affect Congress," said Alan Newman, president of Seventh Generation, a mail distributor of household products in Colchester, Vt.
Mr. Newman said the group discussed several proposal campaigns, including one to end funding for the Stealth bomber. But with the breakout of hostilities in the Persian Gulf, the group settled on the Bryan measure because its aim of reducing fuel consumption could have environmental benefits like lowering oil demand and reducing air pollution. "It seemed like a natural for us," he said.
Businesses routinely lobby Congress on proposed legislation that affects them. And in the past, some companies have tried to rally consumer support for or against laws in which they had a financial interest, as when cigarette producers called on customers to oppose laws that would restrict smoking. But none of the companies involved in the Act Now campaign seem to have a financial interest in fuel economy issues.
 
Labels and Inserts
 Some of the companies, like Ben & Jerry's, Seventh Generation and Smith & Hawken, will distribute postcards urging support of the Bryan bill through their stores or mail-order operations. Stonyfield Farm will print messages on yogurt containers urging consumers to call a 900 number to voice support. Rhino Records will insert a similar message on cards put inside CD packages.
Seventh Generation, which began its campaign several weeks ago, is getting responses from about 15 to 20 percent of its customers, Mr. Newman said. Other companies, like Rhino Records and Stonyfield Farms, expect to start their efforts soon.
While company executives are entering the campaign enthusiastically, some believe they shouldn't go to the political well too often with their customers. "We have to be careful about our credibility or else we become one of the usual suspects," said Gary Hirshberg, president of Stonyfield in Londonderry, N.H.
David Hopkins, a spokesman for Senator Bryan, said that major fuel-economy achievements can be realized without making cars smallers, the prinicipal complaint of opponents of the bill. "It can be done with technology that is on the shelf," Mr. Hopkins said.
Officials of the Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration say they will urge President Bush to veto the bill if it passes. That prospect is uncertain: the bill was killed in the last session of Congress on a parliamentary vote and currently has only 34 Senate sponsors.
Act Now members do not seem disturbed by the weighty opposition. And some company executives see the effort as more of a test, a way of determining which Act Now strategies will prove effective in galvanizing customers' interest for future campaigns involving energy-related legislation.
And what if General Motors should decide to retaliate by urging its employees to boycott Ben & Jerry's Rain Forest Crunch or lobby for legislation requiring explict cholesterol labeling on ice cream products?
Mr. Cohen, for one, does not seem bothered. "The only people who don't support the Bryan bill are car manufacturers and the oil dudes," he said. "And they are the ones who are using their disproportionate clout to affect the outcome."

HEADLINE: House Prices Are Down: It's a Good Time to Rent

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Anyone who wants to rent a single-family house will find a lot to choose from these days. That is largely because many homeowners who want to sell aren't doing so because they can't get the prices they want. Some put their houses up for rent, and that can mean a good deal for the renter.
About a third of all single-family homes have traditionally been rentals, but in most parts of the country that proportion has increased, said H. James Brown, the director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. 
 "Now is a very good time to rent a house," said Herve Kevenides, the president of the Metropolitan Analysis and Forecasting Corporation in Red Bank, N.J. "Renting is a very good investment when property values are not increasing."
Mr. Kevenides offered, as an example, a person who rents a $150,000 house rather than buying one and therefore does not have to make a down payment of 20 percent, or $30,000. That $30,000, invested at 8 percent annually, would bring $2,400 a year. On the other hand, a buyer would have no return on a house whose value did not rise, and might even suffer a loss if its price declined.
 
Avoiding Misunderstandings
 For renters who have lived only in apartments, there are special advantages and some problems in house rental. "Renters are going to be dealing with homeowners who are not in the business of renting, and therefore renters need to be very careful in minimizing misunderstandings," said Prof. Susan Wachter of the Wharton Real Estate Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Brown added: "The real difference with renting a single-family home is that the renter takes a lot more responsibilities, similar to those of an owner. There isn't usually a superintendent on site, and you need to worry about mowing the lawns, snow clearing and some of the exterior repairs."
Unlike many apartment dwellers, house renters also normally pay for heating and perhaps even for garbage collection, as well as for basic utilities like gas and electricity. The tenant might have to provide certain appliances, too. And houses are generally larger than apartments, so utility costs are likely to be higher.
Renters who hope someday to buy a house should keep in mind that house prices now seem to be starting back up in many areas, so this might also be a good time to buy. But renting is a good way to experience home ownership before taking the plunge.
Most house renters get more room and comfort than in an apartment. Some owners hire management companies to oversee the property and respond to tenants' complaints. House renters willing to commute longer distances to work may also have a greater opportunity to enjoy the outdoors and to have a greater choice in the schools their children attend. In addition, house leases are typically written for longer periods than for apartments because tenants often want assurance that their dwellings will not be sold from under them.
"Regardless of the lease period, you should ask the owner whether the rental is viewed as long term or short term," said Martin Rueter, a senior vice president of Century 21 Real Estate at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. "If his intention is to sell the house, maybe you would like to have an option to purchase it."
 
Options Have a Price Tag
 A lease option, like all options, gives you the right, but not the obligation, to take a particular action: in this case, to buy the house at a set price within a set time, generally six months to two years. You pay for this option, frequently in two ways: an initial payment of up to 5 percent of the house price, and a monthly payment of up to $300 added to the rent. If you exercise the option, all of these extra payments are subtracted from the purchase price; if not, the money is not refunded.
Like apartment renters, house renters are advised to buy rental insurance to protect their personal property against loss or damage and to cover their potential liability to others, even though the homeowner already has a homeowner's policy for the structure. Insurance companies sell a tenants' policy known as Form HO-4 that provides coverage for personal belongings, liability and additional living expense when the home cannot be occupied because of damage. The Insurance Information Institute, a trade association, said premiums depend on the type of coverage and where you live.
For instance, the annual premium is $325 for a standard policy sold by the Kemper Group with $50,000 coverage for personal property and $100,000 liability for a rental house in Queens. Liability coverage of $200,000 would add $8 to the premium. "If you live in a $200,000 home, you should normally have $200,000 worth of coverage," said Barry McCall, a property underwriter at Kemper headquarters in Long Grove, Ill.

HEADLINE: A Mean Army, Made Leaner

 BODY:
America's victory in the Persian Gulf war brought glory to all branches of the armed forces. But it provided special vindication for the U.S. Army, which brilliantly exploited its firepower and mobility and in the process erased memories of its grievous difficulties in Vietnam.
The question now is how the Army chooses to capitalize on success. Will it waste time and energy in a futile struggle with the Defense Secretary, who is starting to put the cold war behind him and hold down spending? Or will it take a wiser course -- addressing weaknesses that remain, particularly in its reserve units, to maintain its strength? 
 Vietnam left America divided and disturbed, and left the Army even more so. The Air Force and Navy fended off most of the blame; the Army absorbed most of the casualties and costs. It spent years begging for funds to attract qualified recruits and to modernize its weaponry.
Compared with high-tech weapons, recruitment, readiness and logistics lack glamour and cost plenty. Most members of Congress would rather watch missile launches than maneuvers. Still, the Army persevered. And that paid off in the gulf. True, the gulf wasn't Vietnam, where the Army was ill prepared for counterinsurgency warfare. Iraq, with its Soviet-style strategy and Soviet-made arms, was the kind of opponent the Army has spent decades preparing to fight.
The Army also put the Reagan years of budgetary excess to good use. It took advantage of the pay raises and recession of the early 1980's to recruit and train qualified volunteers. It spent billions on exercises that devour equipment and ammunition but yield huge dividends in terms of readiness. And it beefed up its ability to deploy forces to remote spots and keep them supplied. Meanwhile, the Army broadened the social base of its leadership, with the Reserve Officers Training Corps securing at least equal billing with West Point.
Colin Powell typifies the new general officer. He was born in the Bronx to Jamaican immigrants and graduated from City University -- and is the first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to receive his commission from the R.O.T.C. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf took a more traditional path to the top, by way of West Point. But Gen. Gus Pagonis, who directed the massive gulf supply effort, earned a B.S. in transportation and traffic at Penn State, along with a reserve commission.
Oddly, the reserves themselves have been neglected. The reserves provide many of the Army's specialists, from doctors and nurses to supply officers. Yet if the Army of the future is to be as successful as it was in the gulf -- with reduced Defense spending -- the reserves will also have to fill out the fighting units.
At the moment, they're not up to it. Three brigades of combat reserves in the National Guard stayed home because the army judged them unready for the gulf war. That's because the top brass has preferred to beef up the regular army.
The Army's first response to victory was not encouraging. It continued to fight planned manpower cuts as though the Russians were still coming. Mr. Cheney wisely stood his ground. Even after the cuts, the Army will have 18 divisions in 1995, 12 on active duty. It sent about eight divisions to the gulf, more than most third world contingencies would require. Reserve units, kept in tip-top shape, could provide ample insurance. Instead of greener, tomorrow's Army is better off meaner, and leaner.

'The Complete Other Side of the World'

BYLINE: By A. G. Mojtabai; A. G. Mojtabai's most recent book is "Ordinary Time," a novel. She is a writer in residence at the University of Tulsa.

 BODY:

TYPICAL AMERICAN
By Gish Jen.
296 pp. Boston:
Seymour Lawrence/Houghton Mifflin Company. $19.95. 
 Migration and mutation form a persistent, characterizing theme of our unsettling time. In her first novel, "Typical American," which explores the transformation of Chinese immigrants in the United States, Gish Jen has engaged this theme with distinction. More than that, she has given us "natives" (that is, the less recently settled) back to ourselves with a jolt of sharpened self-recognition.
"It's an American story," so the tale begins. "Before he was a thinker, or a doer, or an engineer, much less an imagineer like his self-made-millionaire friend Grover Ding, Ralph Chang was just a small boy in China, struggling to grow up his father's son."
The novel charts the progress of "Ralph" (an Americanization of Lai Fu -- "Come Fortune"), who leaves China in 1947, amid the "wreckage, and inflation, and moral collapse" that follow the war with Japan. Ralph's aim is to pursue engineering studies in New York.
He has six subsidiary goals, carefully listed. Two are resolutions to cultivate virtue and bring honor to his family. The succeeding four, culminating in a resolve to have nothing to do with girls, are abandoned without recall as Ralph comes to realize that he is alone, that he has journeyed "to the complete other side of the world."
It is during his first year abroad that Manchuria falls to Communist control -- the opening in a series of moves that will utterly transform China, sundering Ralph's link with his parents and ancestral traditions and leaving him unmoored, adrift in a new world.
Then, one day, Ralph is found slumped on a park bench, in the depths of despair. The finder is none other than Theresa, his long-lost older sister, who had emigrated before him. " 'Was miracle.' This was Ralph's version of the story. 'Miracle!' " There's yet another miracle in store: Theresa happens to be rooming with a beautiful young Chinese woman named Helen, who is destined to become Ralph's wife. Together Ralph, Helen and Theresa set up housekeeping and, as they progress from permanent residents to citizens, each -- in his or her own way -- begins to undergo a sea change.
It is greed that most powerfully transforms Helen and Ralph. From their former playfully defensive recital of "typical American" characteristics ("typical American no-manners," "typical American no-morals," "typical American use-brute-force," "typical American wasteful") comes a new chant. Helen's is a litany of enraptured consumerism; Ralph's, of high-venture capitalism. Hers: "Double garage with separate entrance. Finished basement. Sliding glass doors. . . . breakfast nook with built-in benches. . . . wall unit. . . . extras galore." His: "Got to spend money to make money. . . . What you can conceive, you can achieve. . . . The whole trick is. . . . Sky's the limit. . . . Can do, can do, can do!" And, in time, as his own restaurant -- Ralph's Chicken Palace -- takes tangible shape, Ralph's dream of America as "every wish come true" seems to be realized.
I won't reveal what comes next, although no mere plot recital could possibly spoil the rest. No paraphrase could capture the intelligence of Gish Jen's prose, its epigrammatic sweep and swiftness. There's no pause, no underlining, no winking aside to the reader to signal how clever this is, how humorous that is. The author just keeps coming at you, line after stunning line. Even her incidental description seems new-minted -- purely functional, bone clean yet lustrous -- whether it's focused on the wilting of an elaborately curled hairdo in a discouraging social situation, or on children facing their first move, kissing the walls of their old apartment goodbye, or on death threatening one of the family members as "a man to sit at supper and never eat -- a man with his eye on everyone."
Here is Theresa, succumbing to the seduction of a pair of highly colored, voluptuously curved new shoes:
"These shoes had snagged her -- so vital, there in the store window, that they did not look like shoes so much as some highly adapted life form, mimicking shoes the way lizards mimicked desert rocks. Whereas the shoes she'd had on were plainly the real thing: worn out, dried up, cracking. Like their owner -- her reflection in the window was spindly and stiff, separated just this way, by a pane of glass, from some more vibrant world. At the center of her image, the red shoes had seemed to pulse, like her own true heart."
My only quarrel with this book is a backhanded tribute to its virtues, to the interest created in character and situation. There were times when I wanted to know more -- deeper and more -- moments when Helen and Ralph's capitulation to all-American greed seemed too easy, too headlong, verging on the simplicity of fable. This simplicity is clearly not wrong in itself, but it struck me as fundamentally at odds with the complexity, the multifaceted richness, of the novel as a whole.
Were there no contending forces? No dim remembrance of Confucian harmonies or Buddhist detachment before Ralph's obsession gained full sway? Wouldn't even passing reflection on the austerities of life under a Communist regime in China have raised a little point-counterpoint, exerted a chastening influence? There were numerous references to church (Ralph, unconverted, attending with Theresa), rosaries, prayers, parochial school for the Chang children, yet not a word of admonition, not a whisper, concerning thralldom to material things. Was the church completely captive to culture, then? It would seem so. Two perfunctory lines -- slogans, really -- from a homily ("Risk faith. Doubt doubt.") would suggest that the priest speaking was well attuned to typical American one-sound-bite attention spans. I wanted to know more.
It may be that this reader's lingerings and wonderings stem, in large part, from just plain reluctance to close the book on the Changs. For I came to care about all of them -- Theresa at first meeting, Ralph belatedly. And as the Changs seemed so hopelessly to drift apart, each one off in pursuit of some bright fragment of the American dream, I waited eagerly for them to return -- quan jia tuan yuan, the whole family together -- quite as if they had become my own family.

 
 
'I DREW ON WHAT I KNEW'
 Gish Jen was once asked if the publishers of her first novel, "Typical American," had pressured her to change her name to something sounding less Chinese. "My real name is Lillian," she said, laughing, in a telephone interview from her home in Cambridge, Mass. She playfully adopted Gish -- as in the actress -- in high school. "It was part of becoming a writer," she said, "not becoming the person I was supposed to be."
That person was the dutiful daughter of Chinese immigrants, who expected her to get a practical job. Ms. Jen did attend business school briefly, and even took a typing test after marriage and house renovation had led her to put fiction aside. But before she became a secretary, Ms. Jen, an alumna of Harvard and the Iowa Writers' Workshop, successfully applied for a fellowship at Radcliffe's Bunting Institute. Her submission -- a story about the immigrant Changs -- grew into "Typical American."
"I drew on what I knew," she explained. "But even though I can see the elbows and knees and noses of people from my past, the relationship is like that between a dream and life. It's similar, but highly transformed."
Ms. Jen, who is 35 years old, once lived in Yonkers, where her family was called names and pelted with stones. But the experience, she said, did not define her childhood, and she refuses to emphasize it. In fact, the comedy of "Typical American" came most naturally. "I felt like a stereo with no bass," she said. "I had to learn to hit the low notes."
Although "Typical American" does include sadness, Ms. Jen still feels it is upbeat. "Not everyone has to be like Ralph," she said of her hero. "You can use the freedom of America differently."
When asked if she was working on a new book, Ms. Jen, who is now pregnant, replied simply: "I'm hatching." -- LAUREL GRAEBER

A HISTORY OF THE ARAB PEOPLES
By Albert Hourani.
Illustrated. 551 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $24.95.  
 With his customary modesty Albert Hourani announces this major work as intended for beginning students and general readers. He does not even add the hope, so often expressed in such cases, that the book may be of some interest to specialists.
Let us set the record straight: This book by one of the most distinguished scholars of the Arab world and the Middle East is a splendid achievement that can be read with profit by rank beginners and jaded specialists. It is, moreover, written with the grace and wisdom that those who know Mr. Hourani's works have come to expect.
General readers will need to give the story their full attention, however. The book is the literary equivalent of a Canaletto painting in all its intricate detail. Only in such detail can the author faithfully convey 14 centuries of history for a people who today number some 200 million and inhabit lands roughly double the area of the contiguous United States.
Mr. Hourani's approach is good, old-fashioned narrative history, starting with the Arab world as it existed just before the advent of Islam early in the seventh century, and ending with the Arab world through the 1980's. This is no chronicle of kings and battles, how ever. Political events are presented only to the extent necessary to set in context the rich history of an entire people and culture.
"A History of the Arab Peoples" is divided into five parts, treating the 7th through 10th centuries, the 11th through 15th centuries, the 16th through 18th centuries and what Mr. Hourani calls "The Age of European Empires (1800-1939)" and "The Age of Nation-States (Since 1939)." This very breakdown indicates an important way in which his interpretation of Arab history corrects misperceptions and half-truths once held by many scholars and still often embraced by the general public. Conventional accounts tend to concentrate on the Arab period of early Islam and then switch to modern times, showing the Arabs struggling against first Ottoman and then Western colonialism, the intervening millennium being deemed an unfortunate interlude. Not so Mr. Hourani, who devotes twice the number of pages to the period from the 11th through the 15th centuries than to the four previous centuries. Rightly so. Even though the early Islamic period is important and a proper source of Arab pride to this day, many of the most distinguished accomplishments by Arabs and others associated with Arab culture (everything from architecture to philosophy and even theology) came later.
Mr. Hourani also integrates Arab and Ottoman history in accounting for the roughly four centuries in which almost all of the Arab world was part of the Ottoman Empire; he writes of the development of "an Arab Ottoman culture." In this way, anachronistic treatment of modern phenomena, such as Arab nationalism, is avoided. Ottoman rule was not a matter of alien Turks ruling over colonized Arabs. Instead, Arab nationalism, and for that matter Turkish nationalism too, arose in response to the encroaching West.
Mr. Hourani also corrects the stubbornly resistant Western notion that almost everything Arab can be traced back to bedouin origins. He demonstrates the rich urban legacy of Arab culture from the rise of Islam to the present. Mohammed himself was an urbanite from Mecca. And the political geography of the Muslim world, including its Arab portions, reveals a network of cities and their sedentary hinterlands linked -- politically by the age-old Western Asian institutions of bureaucratic empire, economically by elaborate long-distance trade and culturally by ideas transmitted among such major cities as Fez, Tunis, Cairo, Damascus and Mecca. Nomads or mountaineers, always on the margins of the urban-centered world, could at times offer political and military challenges that might well overthrow regimes, but the victors would then replace the vanquished in the conquered cities.
This is a pattern of interpretation as old as Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406), and Mr. Hourani uses the ideas of that master philosopher of history from the Maghreb. Indeed, in his prologue he evocatively sketches Ibn Khaldun's life as an epitome of the cosmopolitan high cultural tradition of the medieval Arabic Muslim world. On this point it might be added that a major strength of Mr. Hourani's history is his ability to draw upon and blend into a coherent account the contributions of countless other scholars, medieval and modern. In a word, "A History of the Arab Peoples" is to be valued not as a revolutionary or revisionist interpretation but as a brilliant bringing together of disparate scholarly parts into an ordered whole.
Mr. Hourani handles the unit-of-analysis problem with skill. Why Arab history? Why not Muslim history? Middle Eastern history? A history of an individual country like Egypt? Or of regions, such as the Fertile Crescent? A case can be made for any of them. The challenge is to avoid distortion in the choice made. The linguistic and cultural unity of today's Arab world did not exist in the seventh century nor did Arab nationalism in the 17th. In tracing this historical evolution Mr. Hourani keeps clearly in focus the extent to which Arab history is one part of Islamic history; the Arabs draw from the Western Asian and Mediterranean reservoir of ideas and institutions, become part of the Ottoman world in its time, and share in modern times the fate of much of the third world. By choosing as the subject of his book the Arab world as presently constituted, "from the ocean to the gulf" in the contemporary Arab slogan (that is, from Morocco on the Atlantic to the eastern borders of the Arabian peninsula), Mr. Hourani is able to offer equal treatment to the Arabs of Africa (the clear majority) and the Arabs of Asia. The result is a balanced treatment of Maghreb and Mashriq, of the Arab West and the Arab East.
Mr. Hourani, the author of the classic "Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age," is strong on the evolution of political, theological and philosophical ideas in the Arab world from the seventh century to the present. Anyone seeking a short, clear appreciation of such recondite thinkers as al-Ghazali, al-Farabi and Ibn Taymiyya (the last is important to understanding the thinking of present-day Muslim fundamentalists) should turn to this book. Yet, he gives almost equal space to social and economic developments, especially to the texture of city life and urban ties to the countryside (strongly tilted in favor of the former) and to the evolving role of women throughout the centuries.
Somewhat like the French scholar of the Arab world Jacques Berque (whom he rightly admires), Mr. Hourani has a good eye for the kind of seemingly prosaic detail that indicates major social trends. Two examples: discussing the impact of Western ways on modern Arabs he writes about changes in taste and attitude, including "different ways of furnishing a room, hanging pictures on walls, eating at table, entertaining friends; different modes of dressing." Or, concerning the post-colonial Arab states, he writes, "To drive a wide boulevard through a quarter of the old city became almost a symbolic act of modernity and independence."
The coverage of more recent Arab political history seems a bit breathless, with a few assertions about the politicized present that will not sit well with some. But that is the problem of taking a centuries-long account of a people right up to yesterday. Sir Walter Raleigh put it well, warning that "whosoever, in writing a modern history, shall follow truth too near the heels, it may haply strike out his teeth." Those who might be tempted to kick at this point would be well advised to look to the larger picture being presented.
At one point the author does speak of a recurrent pattern in Arab history, but he seems reluctant to highlight such possible patterns. One example is the venerable tendency in Arab and Muslim culture to separate the elite from the masses, the knowledgeable from the unlearned, the rulers from the ruled -- all this existing in uneasy juxtaposition with the strong Muslim precept concerning the equality of all believers. One would like to see Mr. Hourani address this question directly.
Also, the book lacks a real conclusion, a summing up of the 14 centuries covered. Yet, on balance, such is the Hourani style. His is not a history that presents a grand design, an unfolding of God's or Nature's plan. It is worth recalling that Mr. Hourani, the gentlest of scholars, years ago wrote an uncharacteristically severe criticism of Arnold Toynbee, with his penchant for finding patterns in history. To Mr. Hourani as to the great 19th-century historian Leopold von Ranke, every age is equally important, equally close to God or to truth.
Finally, in reviewing a book representing a lifetime of scholarship it may seem inappropriate to link it too closely to current events. Yet, Americans can hardly turn a blind eye to the way in which politics and public perceptions, beginning as long ago as the 1950's, have produced a dangerously distorted image of the Arab world, distortions made perhaps even worse by well-intentioned but inaccurate earlier romanticized notions of Arabs. "A History of the Arab Peoples" is a scholarly account, not an apologia for the Arabs but a book written with just the right mix of empathy and sensitivity, and a feel for the irony of human history. This is history in the grand style. It can lead to a better understanding of the Arabs, past and present.

HEADLINE: Inside Gitmo

BYLINE: BY ANN BANKS; Ann Banks has written extensively on military families; her book "First Person America" has just been reissued by Norton.

 BODY:
SUBTRACT THE PROPS, AND THE FACE ON the T-shirt could be Milton Berle. But with the fatigue cap, wooly beard and jumbo Havana cigar, it's clearly Fidel Castro, the man who rules all Cuba -- except, that is, for the 45-square-mile stronghold on the shore of Oriente Province where the T-shirt is sold. For more than 90 years, ever since the Spanish-American War, this tip of the island has been under the jurisdiction of the United States military -- which is the point of the T-shirt. In the caption under the caricature, Fidel demands indignantly, "Where the hell is Guantanamo Bay, Cuba?"
The Maximum Leader would have no trouble finding the American naval base, of course. He and his guerrilla fighters launched their revolution from the Sierra Maestra Mountains overlooking Guantanamo Bay. Cuban employees sympathetic to the cause smuggled weapons from the Naval Supply Depot to the rebels' mountain camp. When Castro's supporters raised their flag in Havana 32 years ago, Guantanamo became a cold-war curiosity: the only American military installation in Communist territory. Castro called the base "a dagger plunged into Cuban soil." 
 Today, with the decline of Communism elsewhere around the globe, Guantanamo has grown curiouser still. Gitmo, as it's familiarly known, is nearly the last preserve of the Red Menace mentality -- a geopolitical equivalent of the Galapagos Islands. Chunks of the Berlin Wall can be purchased in art galleries, but on Guantanamo's heavily fortified perimeter fence, marines in battle dress stand 24-hour guard.
The fence is discussed incessantly on the base. When I visited recently, the first question everyone asked was: Had I been to the fence yet? It is considered so enlightening to behold that schoolchildren are taken there on field trips. Actually, the entire base, together with its Cuban surroundings, is something of an instructional marvel -- an authentic, impeccably preserved, perfectly functioning scale model of the cold war.
Guantanamo is harder to get into than Havana. No American can go either place without the official O.K. of the United States Government, but the Navy imposes special restrictions on who may visit the base. Access is particularly tight for journalists. Formal letters of application are submitted, follow-up calls made, months pass. All this to get permission for a two-and-a-half-day stopover: the Navy charter flight to Guantanamo departs from Norfolk, Va., on Tuesday and returns on Friday. During the prescribed quick tour, visiting journalists are accompanied everywhere by a Navy minder.
For my excursion to the fence, I also got a special escort, Marine Col. Gary Blair. He relishes conducting fence-line tours -- those are his men out there -- and he brings a sense of drama to the task, strapping on a 9-millimeter pistol before we set off. "I don't like to take people out on the fence without a weapon," he says. He makes sure I'm seated on the side of the jeep away from Cuban territory. "They'll be taking your picture, so why not make them work a little harder?" he explains.
We climb 79 steps to the top of Tower 21. There, on a 10-by-10 wooden platform, Timothy Fulps, a marine from Indiana, is midway through an eight-hour shift observing a postcard panorama of fluffy clouds, distant purple mountains and bright Caribbean Sea. On request, Fulps recites the Rules of Engagement that sentries must follow: "Shots will not be fired across the perimeter fence line. The only exception is self-defense." A few sentences later he fumbles the exact wording, but the gist is simple enough: don't shoot at them unless they shoot at you, and sometimes not even then.
"They" are Cuban soldiers -- members of the elite Frontier Brigade -- who occupy their own watchtowers on the other side of the barbed wire. I take a turn with the binoculars, but across the fence nothing much is happening. Nights are better, according to Fulps. "Sometimes they have parties and you can hear the music," he says rather wistfully. As Colonel Blair and I climb down from the tower, I recall a line of dialogue from "A Few Good Men," the recent Broadway play set at Guantanamo. Onstage, Blair's fictional counterpart slams down a fist and declares: "We live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns."
 THE RIDE BACK TO town is a hilly drive of no more than 10 minutes. On the way, Colonel Blair points out another of Guantanamo's claims to fame. Lining the roadway are triangular red signs that caution in English and Spanish "Danger, Peligro, Mines, Minas." These warn the base's 7,000 residents away from the nearly 50,000 mines that ring its boundary. The Guantanamo mine field is the largest in the world, Colonel Blair declares. The mines, laid down by the United States during the Cuban missile crisis, have claimed numerous casualties over the years: five seamen on shore leave, a dozen marines from the Mine Field Maintenance group and as many Cuban "fence jumpers," several identified in histories only as "skeletal remains."
To hear many residents tell it, Guantanamo is the most secure and sheltered place in the hemisphere. They picture it as a perfect American small town, the kind that vanished 30 years ago back home. The streets are almost shockingly safe. It isn't unusual to see kids hitchhiking. Parents dread the day when they must return to the States and instill fear in their offspring. Says one contented Gitmo-ite: "You get spoiled. There are no drugs, no crime. Every once in a while, a kid gets into trouble, but there's nobody shooting at each other, nobody killing each other, nobody really hurting each other."
Nearly all the traditional institutions of American community life can be found here. Yellow school buses ferry children to a cheerful elementary school where cutouts of apples decorate the bulletin boards. High-school students run a student council and a prom. (Last year, the school organized two competing football squads, but gave up when it became clear that nobody much cared who won.) The family houses range from pristine suburban to Caribbean ramshackle; swing sets and backyard barbecue grills abound.
A white-steepled chapel holds Sunday school classes and religious services for worshipers of various denominations. The base has a hospital, a well-stocked library and a Christian coffeehouse. This being a military installation, there is no shortage of places to buy a drink, including a West Indian-style officer's club with ceiling fans and a clay-tiled veranda overlooking the bay. The Guantanamo Daily Gazette reports on the doings of base organizations as diverse as the Boy Scouts, the Bridge Club, the Little Theater, Alcoholics Anonymous, the Knights of Columbus and the Women's Bowling Association. And, of course, there is a McDonald's, just like the ones back home, except that it's partly staffed by off-duty marines whose other job is fenceline duty.
So many and varied are Gitmo's claims on one's leisure time, jokes Bill Dougherty, the base's assistant public affairs officer, that "it can get to the point where your job becomes an interference with your life style." The landscape is dotted with tennis, racquetball and basketball courts, swimming pools, fitness centers, outdoor movie theaters and hobby shops. For $6 an hour you can rent a horse at the corral or a pontoon boat at the marina. (A special license is required, certifying that you know enough not to stray into Cuban waters.) No less an authority than Jacques Cousteau has extolled the bay's marine life, and hundreds of base residents scuba-dive among the sea turtles and manatees.
Nothing quite matches the local brand of golf. According to Jack Kennedy, Gitmo's athletic director, the 18-hole Yetera Seca Golf Course was once among the finest in the Caribbean. Now it's the strangest -- a parched casualty of the cold war. Water piped in from Cuba greened the course and the rest of arid Guantanamo before the revolution. But Castro turned off the supply in 1964, and since then the base has depended mostly on less-than-reliable desalting equipment. In the worst of times, officially known as Water Condition Bravo, rationing was so stringent that family quarters were without water during the day and laundry could be washed only on alternate nights. At best, there has been only enough water to keep Yatera Seca's greens and tees green. The fairways are moonscapes of crushed coral and limestone, with the odd cactus or mango tree for vegetation. To simulate a grassy surface, players carry a foot-square piece of Astroturf and take their shots on that. The pro shop carries a supply of the green squares, but dedicated Gitmo golfers use their own artificial-grass doormats, purchased in the States.
Guantanamo itself is like Astroturf -- a portable square of artificial America plunked down on foreign soil. To furnish this illusion, a supply barge arrives twice a month from Florida. Next to mail call (which the post office signals by hoisting a happy-face flag), the barge's appearance is the most eagerly awaited event on the base. It bears to Cuban shores the material culture of late-20th-century American life: Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtle toys, distributor caps, frozen waffles, disposable diapers, home pregnancy tests and plastic Christmas trees that retail for $180. A popular Gitmo T-shirt spells out in bold letters, "It's on the barge," which is the local way of saying, "Don't hold your breath."
Presiding over this queer (residents say unique) outpost is Navy Capt. William McCamy. Everyone calls him "the Skipper." A progressive man, McCamy would like to be remembered as the commanding officer who improved Guantanamo's quality of life. "I want to cut down on the red tape that drives people mad," he says. McCamy compares his job to that of small-town mayor. But since he commands a garrison over which the military has sole jurisdiction, he's considerably more powerful.
In his regular column for The Guantanamo Daily Gazette, McCamy recently exhorted residents to be more security conscious. Calling the fence line a "last vestige" of the walls of Communism, he reminded Gitmo-ites of the upcoming Defense Exercises, one of several mock invasions the Navy stages each year. These drills call for nonmilitary personnel to pack a suitcase and prepare to leave pets tied in the yard with food and water. (When military dependents were evacuated during the Cuban missile crisis, their house cats ran wild, and today scores of feral cats roam the base.)
Hardly anyone admits outright to fearing Cuba, but it isn't hard to detect tremors of vulnerability in local scuttlebutt. Gitmo has a rumor mill that rivals wartime Casablanca's. The precarious supply link to the mainland is a common theme. Not long ago, word got around that all the food on the barge had spoiled. It was due on Monday, and lines at the commissary were backed up all weekend. "We just couldn't convince people that it wasn't true," says the store manager.
Jolynn Wiley, a Navy wife who teaches first grade, says she was "scared to death" when she first arrived, but has come to feel more secure in her two years on the base. "I have faith that if there was the slightest danger, we'd be evacuated before anything happened," she says. "Of course, you can look at that two ways: that I really believe it or that I have to believe it because I'm raising a child here."
Wiley waited a year before visiting the fence line. "I found the courage to go because I took my class there on a field trip," she says. "The kids played Frisbee near the fence with some of the marine guards. It made me feel funny that the Cubans could see us. What if the Frisbee went over? Would it be an incident? Of course, you know it wouldn't, but you worry anyway."
Wiley admits to wondering "how I would protect the children if a Cuban showed up at the door of my classroom with a gun." For her own peace of mind, she does her best to tune out the constant rumors, but it's impossible to escape them altogether. Recently, Wiley stopped by her baby sitter's house and found packing boxes everywhere: "She told me she'd packed her grandmother's quilt and her photo albums and was sending them to her mother. She'd heard that Castro's men were coming over the fence and that at any moment dependents would be sent home."
 GIVEN PRESENT conditions in Cuba, that scenario is less likely now than at any time in the past three decades. The island's worsening economy is reflected in logbooks of fence-line activity, where Marine sentries report diminished truck and ship traffic on the other side. Another index of Cuba's poverty, I was told, are the banana rats. The unlovely creatures, officially named hutia, look like overgrown guinea pigs. Gitmo may resemble a "Leave It to Beaver" set, but the banana rats add a David Lynch touch. "They leave droppings all over the place," Captain McCamy says. "When it's really dry around here, the smell outside is of banana-rat feces."
On Guantanamo, hutia are a quality-of-life problem; in Cuba, they are said to be dinner. According to Colonel Blair, "We've had reports that, because of the shortages in Cuba, banana rats are now a regular part of the diet." True or not, this story is widely believed and sometimes offered in explanation of the recent banana-rat population explosion. They invade the base to evade the skillet, the theory goes. Bill Dougherty even claims to know the recipe for hutia stew: saute with green peppers, onions, tomato sauce and lots of garlic.
The most compelling evidence of hard times across the fence is the unceasing flow of refugees. Some say this is at its highest level since the early years of the revolution, when thousands of Cubans escaped to the base. "There have been many more swimmers lately," Colonel Blair admits. Given the well-known deadliness of the land mines, most of those who flee swim down the Guantanamo River from Cuban-controlled territory, a distance of as much as 10 miles.
Officially, the United States keeps quiet about the refugees. Those who make it remain at Guantanamo "until such time as the intelligence people get the information they need," says Colonel Blair. Then they're transfered to the States. Meanwhile, they are grist for the rumor mill. Elaine Frazier, a high school senior, heard that a dripping-wet Cuban swimmer walked up to the door during a prom party last year.
Though some Cubans risk death to reach the base, for a handful of others commuting across the fence is a daily routine. Twenty-nine are employed at Guantanamo -- the remnant of a labor force that once numbered in the thousands. They pass through the heavily guarded northeast gate on their way to and from jobs they've held since before the revolution. (As their ranks have dwindled, non-Cubans -- mostly Jamaicans -- have replaced them as civilian employees.) The Navy discourages journalists from talking to these men, since it might cause them to fall under suspicion on the other side. For the same reason, a Cuban exile who has lived on the base for 30 years never so much as acknowledges his commuter brother when they run into each other on the street.
A bizarre ritual takes place when a commuter reaches retirement age. On his final crossing of the fence, he is permitted by the Cuban Government to bring as much as he can carry. Typically, he loads a hand cart with consumer goods -- a stereo, television set, even a refrigerator. As friends from Guantanamo serenade the departing man, fellow commuters help push the cart up over the hill and into the Republica de Cuba.
 UNTIL RECENTLY, IT wasn't hard to foresee the day when the last commuter retired and the gate would be permanently sealed. But the decline of cold-war tension elsewhere has given rise to the opposite hope: that the "cactus curtain" will go the way of the iron curtain. Captain McCamy expresses a popular base sentiment when he says, "I would be very excited to see us shake hands again."
But such a turn of events could presage the end of the United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay. Both Castro and American military experts agree that the base has no real strategic importance. Under the terms of an indefinite lease negotiated in 1934, the land reverts to Cuban control only if abandoned or by mutual consent. Castro, who maintains that the lease is invalid, doesn't cash the $4,085 rent checks the United States sends each year.
When he or his successor finally sits down to negotiate with the United States, the future of Guantanamo Bay will be high on the agenda. The most powerful rationale for the United States to hang on to Guantanamo has already evaporated. Navy officers used to justify the expense of the base ($34 million last year) on the grounds that America needed to keep it out of Soviet hands. Since the Russians have gone home, one is more likely to hear about Guantanamo's virtues as a training site. For navigational reasons, it's considered ideal -- ships can go from pier to deep blue water in just 30 minutes. Every year, about 80 warships come for four to six weeks of intensive training.
There are those in Congress and in the Pentagon who contend that the same training could be accomplished more cheaply elsewhere. So the Navy's immediate challenge is to find a post-cold-war rationale for continuing to pour tax dollars into Guantanamo. I saw a memo while I was on the base that framed this problem in public relations terms. The basic point: since it no longer makes sense to portray Guantanamo as a bulwark against Communism, the spotlight should be directed at its fleet-training mission. Meanwhile, to improve morale on the base, the "welcome to Gitmo" slide briefing should depict "happy people working in a beautiful, tropical, sun-splashed environment."
The evocative tone of this description suggests another possible disposition of the base. Should the United States ever return the property to Cuba, it could play a part in the crash program recently announced by the Cuban Government to bolster tourism. There is a particular vacation niche that the Guantanamo complex could fill -- possessing, as it does, functional architecture, extensive facilities for organized recreation and great natural beauty. Now that the Soviets are no longer poised for the grab, one can easily imagine Club Med moving in. Picture tourists drinking Cuba libres on the veranda of the Gitmo officers' club -- and paying the tab with pop-beads.

HEADLINE: Cuba's New Hotels Dream of Dollars

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH; HOWARD W. FRENCH is the Caribbean correspondent of The New York Times.

 BODY:
EACH winter the number of jets unloading Canadians, Germans, Spaniards and Italians for stays in the hotels and bungalows that are sprouting all over Cuba seems to increase. Many of the visitors head for the seaside resort of Varadero, which has become the center of Socialist Cuba's headlong rush to develop a mass tourism industry. So far, this expansion has worked well. Over 320,000 tourists visited the republic in 1989 -- more than in any year before Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 -- and the annual growth rate over the past six years has been close to 10 percent.
Americans, however, are largely absent from the crowds of bronzing foreigners who lounge on long stretches of white powder beaches by day and dance to fast-paced rumbas at night. In the 1950's, nearby Cuba was the favorite tropical vacation destination for many Americans. 
 Because of Treasury Department regulations that effectively ban leisure and business travel to Cuba, Americans curious to visit one of the world's last redoubts of Communism, or simply relax in a highly affordable setting that offers a mixture of typical Caribbean resort diversions, as well as a wealth of historical and cultural attractions unmatched in the region, have had to bend or break the law by traveling through Canada.
Visitors to Cuba these days are finding thatthe hotels can be neatly divided into two groups: the old and the new. At the older establishments, like the Havana Libre, a vast high-rise that bore the Hilton logo before the Communist revolution, telephone lines crackle, water drips rather than gushes from faucets, elevators creep and dowdiness is the watchword. At the newer hotels, like the rebuilt Comodoro in Havana, or the Sol Palmeras in Varadero, if it weren't for a few relatively minor details, it would be hard todistinguish the accommodations from medium-size resort hotels elsewhere in the Caribbean. Guests at the Mediterranean-style Comodoro, for example, occupy terraced three-bedroom bungalows, with kitchens and room service, next to a large pool. They can swim up to their patio door. The bungalows rent for $150 a night.
For some travelers, however, the details can be irksome. Direct-dial international calls, for example, are impossible in a country where a premium is placed on tight political control. In the gift shops, the selection runs prosaic, from cigars, cigars and more cigars, to pictures of Ernesto (Che) Guevara, the revolutionary leader, and the collected speeches of President Castro.
Canadian visitors amid the marble and glass of the Sol Palmeras, which opened last year, said their weeklong package deals including air fare and two meals a day cost $700 a week. For a few extra dollars they were also indulging in the sort of activities that vacationers enjoy on other islands: hang-gliding, water skiing, tennis lessons, massages, martial arts courses and fishing.
Restaurants that cater to tourists tend to emphasize seafood. At the Hemingway Marina, a seaside spot on the outskirts of Havana, huge lobsters and shrimp (foods few Cubans ever see because of their high export value) are grilled nicely and served along with European wines. A good lobster dinner can be had for about $20, including wine.
And for night life, there is the standby from the 50's, a side trip to the Tropicana for a flashy night of sequined and elaborately choreographed song and dance.
The Cubans have good reason to court tourists. Left strapped for cash as never before by a reduction in aid from the Soviet Union, Cuba desperately needs reliable new sources of foreign exchange. Many tourism experts believe, however, that the country's ambitious expansion plans for tourism cannot succeed without a sizable increase in the number of Americans tourists.
While the State Department does not formally forbid Americans to travel to Cuba, the Treasury regulations prohibit private trade and investment by United States companies or citizens. An American can go to Cuba, but cannot spend any money there -- whether for a hotel room or a roadside lunch -- unless he or she is a scholar, journalist or Cuban-American visiting relatives on the island. The penalties range up to 12 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
Some Americans flout those regulations by going to Canada, Cuba's biggest source of tourists, and joining one of the tour companies there that offer low-cost packages. The major operator is Air Canada Vacations, the tour arm of Air Canada, which runs one-week trips from Toronto and Montreal throughout the year, using the airline's scheduled services to Varadero. Other American visitors may be taking advantage of an increasing number of flights to Cuba from nearby Caribbean islands. Jamaica, for example, has begun to offer visitors to Montego Bay daylong excursions to the Cuban city of Santiago.
Although Cuban officials will not provide figures on the number of Americans who fly to Cuba via Canada or any other country, they say that the total has gradually increased in the past few years.
"This blockade is really an inefficient thing," said Luis Lieva, an official of Cubanacan, a state tourism agency, referring to United States sanctions. "If you want to come here to relax we will greet you without stamping a visa in your passport. We just give you a piece of paper at the airport that says you have entered the country legally."
A Treasury spokeswoman said the department had not prosecuted any Americans who traveled to Cuba on tours from Canada.
Cuba gets plenty of European and Canadian tourists, and travel agents say that a major reason for its popularity, aside from its novelty or historical assets, has been competitive package rates. They make the island cheaper than many Caribbean destinations for Canadians, and affordable even for Europeans, even with their air fare. The Canadian packages -- air fare, seven nights' hotel and airport transfers -- cost from about $545 to $680 a person.
 The Cuban Government has pledged, by 1992, to more than quadruple the number of hotel rooms devoted to Western-style tourism. In addition to Varadero and Havana, each of which is undergoing major expansion, tourism centers are being created virtually from scratch in various parts of the island. So far the north coast has received the greatest attention, with joint ventures with European developers under way in places like Santa Lucia and Holguin. One investor is SuperClubs, the operator of five all-inclusive resorts in Jamaica and one in St. Lucia. It is renovating Cuba's 160-room Cactus Hotel, which it acquired last December, and plans to break ground this June on a 250-room Cuba Cuba. Both properties will be all-inclusive and share a site on Varadero Beach.
Cubanacan says it has already formed six joint ventures, with hotel companies in Spain, Italy, Austria, France and Finland. Because of the Treasury Department restrictions, United States developers have not been involved in any of the projects.
Western economists, and travel agents who specialize in trips to Cuba for the Cuban-Americans who are allowed to visit each year, say that Cuba has had encouraging results with its new resort hotels. Francisco G. Aruca, president of Marazul Charters, a New York-based travel company that operates flights between Miami and Havana, believes the investment is very much a long-term strategy.
"They'll draw enough visitors so that they won't be losing large amounts of money," he said, "but people are really holding on for when the situation changes and they can make a killing." (Marazul offers Cuban-Americans two flights a week on chartered 747's; the round-trip fare is $225.)
 In interviews, European hotel industry officials involved in Cuban projects declined to speak on the record. However, they say privately that although there are no signs of collapse, beyond the shortages and economic hardship faced by most Cubans, the Castro Government, like those of his former Communist allies in Eastern Europe, could fall after two or three years, leading to a boom in foreign investment and in tourism.
The business executives say that dramatic policy changes in Cuba recently have resulted from the island's economic difficulties. The changes allow majority foreign ownership of new construction and complete discretion over management practices. More changes, particularly in the area of political freedoms, they hope, could encourage the United States to relax its trade restrictions. A State Department official declined to comment on whether the regulations limiting trade with Cuba are likely to be relaxed.
ANOTHER hope is that Cuba will lift its own limitations on the number of Cuban-Americans allowed to visit their relatives on the island. In 1979, more than 100,000 Cuban-Americans were given visas, but then Cuba began refusing many visa applications and has reduced this traffic considerably. For their part, Canadian and European tourists are experiencing their first, and sometimes awkward, encounters with a society that has lost many of the reflexes of the service economy.
Visitors cannot find Western-style entertainment or casinos or buy good quality clothes, cameras, jewelry and watches. Despite official pledges of openness and free exchange between visitors and residents, tourists repeatedly tell of the feeling of being trailed in their wanderings around towns, and of feelings of fear and suspicion conveyed by the Cubans they manage to meet.
"People wanted very much to come up and meet us; they wanted information about the outside world, but they were afraid," said Birgit Kraus, a 26-year-old German visitor. "It is natural to want to meet people and share experiences with them, but things have not yet relaxed to that point."
For years, Cuba championed what officials called social tourism, in which ideologically sympathetic Westerners and Communists from all over the world were invited to visit and offered tours of model communes, sugar plantations and other workplaces where the achievements of Socialism were put on display.
Eager to generate foreign exchange like never before, Cuba has dropped social tourism from the lexicon and embraced hedonism. In the lobbies of all the newer hotels, bulletin boards are stuffed with notices about activities -- exercise classes, diving, helicopter tours -- that are always available for a dollar fee, for the German or Canadian or Italian who is sated with fine beaches and eternal sunshine.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
Do Electronics Have a Place In the Concert Hall? Maybe

BYLINE: By TOM MANOFF; Tom Manoff is a music critic for "All Things Considered" on National Public Radio.

DATELINE: EUGENE, Ore.

 BODY:
Architectural history may one day honor Silva Hall in the Hult Center for the Performing Arts in Eugene. Visually striking, it also affords first-class sound on most evenings. Not incidentally, the hall, completed in 1982, brings home perhaps the most controversial issue for the future of concert-hall design: "electronic architecture," combining traditional construction techniques and electronic "enhancement."
Because Eugene could afford only one hall to accommodate a variety of musical styles, the architectural firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates of New York proposed a multipurpose acoustic design by Jaffe Acoustics of Norwalk, Conn. After a long debate as to whether there is any place in the concert hall for electronics, the original plan was approved. Silva Hall thus became the world's first electronically enhanced concert space conceived as such from the ground up. 
 Since opening night, the acoustics of Silva Hall have evoked both excitement and controversy. Rock, pop and Broadway musicals sound wonderful there. Opera also sounds fine. But for most symphonic concerts, the acoustics have proved unsuccessful.
When the talented young conductor Marin Alsop took over the Eugene Symphony in 1989, she requested a full demonstration of the Jaffe system and found it wanting. "I think it's a major problem," she said recently. She added that she found the enhanced sound lacking in "bottom," and worse, the orchestra sounded amplified. As a result, she turned the system off and began to experiment with the configuration of the orchestral shell.
By now, of course, the Eugene system is almost 10 years old, and its technology has grown antiquated. In the meantime, a second-generation Jaffe system used in the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts in Anchorage and a third-generation system in the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville have met with far greater success.
Vital to the rapidly developing technology in Anchorage and Nashville is an internationally known sound technician named Gary Hardesty. As it happens, Mr. Hardesty lives in Eugene. When he saw the orchestra experimenting with Jaffe's shell, Mr. Hardesty offered his expertise. The orchestra, he said, politely ignored him. The management of the Eugene Symphony declined to discuss this and other issues connected with the hall.
With Silva Hall's electronics turned off, problems of another sort arose, since without enhancement the hall is, by design, relatively short of the reverberation that gives "warmth" to sound. Rock, pop and much theater, which use amplification, sound best in a very "dry," unreverberant, even "dead" hall. For these events, the Jaffe system is not used. Opera needs some reverberation, lasting 1.3 seconds, perhaps -- enough for warmth but not so much that vocal clarity is lost. The Jaffe system in Silva has variable settings; the one for opera is quite subtle and successful. But a symphony hall requires a reverberation time of from 1.8 to 2.2 seconds. Without it, orchestras sound dry, and symphonic music, which depends on a beautiful wash of sound, cannot succeed.
Ms. Alsop said she is willing to try anything. But she leans toward a purist approach. "To rely on a sound technician for your balance," she said, "is completely antithetical to the role of a conductor."
Her attitude is apparently not shared by the German conductor Helmuth Rilling, who comes to Eugene each summer to direct the Oregon Bach Festival. Mr. Rilling works closely with Mr. Hardesty, and together they occasionally coax a decent sound from the hall.
The Jaffe system, called ERES (Electronic Reflected Energy System), is the brainchild of Christopher Jaffe, who, as the president of Jaffe Acoustics, has been the main proponent of electronic architecture in the United States.
His work is well exemplified at Ravinia, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony, in Highland Park, Ill., where he designed Bennett Hall along traditional lines as well as the electronically enhanced Ravinia Festival Pavilion. Mr. Jaffe also included electronic enhancement in the restoration of the Circle Theater in Indianapolis, whose acoustics Harold Schonberg of The Times described as admirable.
"I don't come to a hall with a preconceived notion," Mr. Jaffe said recently. "I offer the options of either traditional or electronic design."
The Evangeline Atwood Concert Hall in the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts was completed in 1988 by the same team that built Eugene's hall, and designed along similar lines. One look at the ceiling's reflective plaster panels (a distinct contrast with Silva's sound absorptive "basket" design) on a recent visit indicated that the sound, even without electronic enhancement, would be far livelier than Silva's. The first chords of Mozart's Overture to "The Magic Flute" from the Anchorage Symphony sounded round, rich and true. Although a longer reverberation time might be preferable, the natural sound, blended with the newer Jaffe technology, made for a beautiful orchestral acoustic.
Unlike Eugene's system, Anchorage's has no variable settings. It is either on or off. The involvement of a sound technician in orchestral balance is not an issue. Stephen Stein, the orchestra's conductor, said he was delighted with the Jaffe sound: "For a community our size, we feel no less than blessed."
Later in the week, the Anchorage Concert Association presented the pianist Garrick Ohlsson. Ira Perman, the association's executive director, said he considered the hall's natural acoustic fine, and didn't generally use ERES. But with the consent of the pianist, Mr. Perman agreed to an experiment. Mr. Ohlsson played the first half of his all-Chopin program with the system off, the second half with it on. In this test, heard from a "worst-case" seat, far left, under the first balcony and directly beneath one of the hidden speakers, the system was not entirely successful, seeming to vindicate Mr. Perman's decision to leave it off for solo performances.
Mr. Ohlsson began with the B-minor Scherzo. From the first notes, one knew the evening would be memorable. But by the time the pianist played the C-sharp-minor Nocturne (Op. 27, No. 1), acoustical problems were apparent. The lower register, from middle C down, was warm, reverberant and perfectly responsive to the pianist's touch. The high octaves were brittle but acceptable. Least audible were the two octaves above middle C, no small problem in Chopin.
The second half of the program consisted of Chopin's 24 Preludes. With the system on, the troublesome octaves became more audible. But unexpectedly, the beauty of the lower registers disappeared into what could only be called an artificial sound.
Atwood Hall is a splendid auditorium for symphonic music, but an upgrade to the latest technology might some day be advisable, if the new sound of Andrew Jackson Hall at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center is any indication of the possibilities. Soon after the hall was built in 1981, the Nashville Symphony and its conductor, Kenneth Schermerhorn, became unhappy with its dry and unresponsive sound. In 1990, Mr. Jaffe was called in to renovate it. The Nashville system, designed by Paul Scarbrough, a young architect on Mr. Jaffe's staff, was installed in less than three months for under $300,000.
When it was first demonstrated, the players reportedly broke into applause. "Just imagine if we were stuck with what we had," said Mary Vanosdale, the concertmaster, in a recent interview. "You can't imagine what it's like to be giving your all on stage -- and for what?"
To purists who criticize Mr. Jaffe's use of electronic enhancement, Mr. Schermerhorn said, "Well, more power to you if you have the unlimited funds to tear down this hall and build a new one."
In a concert performance of Mozart's "Abduction From the Seraglio," the orchestral sound from midparquet was excellent, rich, clear, not in the least artificial. The system dealt honestly with the soloists. Kenneth Cox, a world-class Osmin, sounded rich and powerful, although the acoustics were less kind to the tenor who sang Pedrillo. In the parquet, where the Jaffe system was most active, the acoustics revealed his inadequacies of style and manner and poor vocal quality. From the highest balcony, he could scarcely be heard.
Despite minor problems that will be corrected when adjustments are complete, the Nashville system seemed to represent not merely a local success but a significant new technology for the world. One reason for the improved quality was a higher digital sampling rate.
The sophistication of the Nashville system can best be explained in comparison to a CD player. Put simply, CD technology measures sound 44,100 times per second. This number is called the sampling rate. In digital technology, the higher the sampling rate, the better the sound. Those critical of CD sound have suggested that this sampling rate is too low. Higher rates are now being discussed --100,000 times per second, perhaps.
The first-generation system in Eugene doesn't even use digital sampling. The second-generation system in Anchorage samples the sound 68,000 times a second. And the up-to-date technology in Nashville includes a device that samples 3 million times a second. That device was invented and built by Mr. Hardesty.
The future of the Jaffe system seems clear. In a world of scarce resources, this technology offers an economical alternative to traditional modes of construction. But what about Eugene? Are its citizens, having paid for the prototype of a successful technology, stuck with a magnificent but flawed monument to the science of acoustics?
Some people question whether the Eugene hall should be fixed at all. Except for its symphonic sound, it is a success. Eugenians have a strong populist bent, and a city government hard pressed to maintain basic services has little extra money for the arts. Any expenditure that didn't come from private contributions might be criticized as elitist. And even if money were available, the question would remain how to fix the hall. Structural renovation would be expensive, but a third-generation Jaffe system could be installed for under $200,000.
Yet a far greater opportunity is available to Eugene, in the person of Mr. Hardesty. Although he has invented some of the world's most advanced electronics, he has never held an official position at the Eugene hall. His status is "stagehand." He has spent hundreds of hours, often unpaid, working to improve the hall. Asked recently why he bothers, he said simply, "It's my home. I care about the hall."
Edwin R. Smith, the city official who was in charge of building and for a time operating the Hult Center, has only praise for Mr. Hardesty. When asked why Mr. Hardesty has never been recognized officially, Mr. Smith replied, "That's a good question."

 
 
THE JAFFE SYSTEM
 The Jaffe Electronic Reflected Energy System (ERES) bears virtually no relation to traditional amplification, in which an audio signal (a voice or instrument, for example) is projected into a hall at a volume louder than the original source. In ERES, the primary and loudest sound the listener hears is the direct, natural sound from the stage, which mingles with very low levels of electronically manipulated sounds from hidden speakers. The result re-creates the acoustic characteristics of a traditional concert hall.
The sophistication of the latest ERES technology, which samples and reproduces sound three million times a second, brings to mind certain philosophical quandaries: How many dots, for example, must be drawn and connected by lines to achieve a perfect circle? In a comparable way, the quality of this sampling system tends to break down the esthetic oppositions between "natural" and "electronic," "acoustic" and "artificial" and "real" and "reproduced."
A similar and related quandary: how many speakers would have to be mounted to re-create an infinite number of sound-reflecting points on the wood and plaster surfaces of a traditional hall? Christopher Jaffe has invented a means of processing the signals so a speaker that would normally be heard as a single source of sound flattens out into what the ear perceives as a section of wall. Theoretically, a complete Jaffe installation, with its multitude of speakers and interrelated systems, can be adjusted to re-create the acoustic response of any architectural design.

HEADLINE: Plus Ca Change, More She Is the Same

BYLINE: By DAVID FINKLE; DAVID FINKLE, who writes about the arts, travels frequently in the United States and abroad.

 BODY:
WORD has been coming back for -- I don't know -- a decade or more that Parisians have stopped curling their lips at Americans who try to speak to them in French with anything less than flawless grammar and pronunciation. I'm back from Paris, and all I can say is plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose, or, as some French person might have remarked to me at any point during my vacation, "More this changes, more this is the same thing."
That's right. I discovered that, much as in the past, almost any conversation I tried to hold in French was bound -- sooner rather than later -- to become a conversation carried on in English. That's assuming the conversation even got started in French. Sometimes I didn't get that far. 
 In fact, one of the most memorable aspects of this visit, which began for me on the train-hovercraft-train from London, was that there was just about nothing, once we'd reached Boulogne-sur-Mer, to indicate we'd crossed a body of water and passed a border. The man selling sandwiches and drinks on the train during the Boulogne-Paris leg of the trip addressed everyone in smiling and accommodating English and was happy to take money in dollars, pounds or francs.
While he was doing this, what I was thinking about was my prep school French professor, Monsieur Banta, who only allowed us to speak French in class -- the last environment I was ever in, now that I think of it, where French was spoken exclusively.
There was for me, however, a long time -- despite M. Banta and the facility he tried to drill into me -- when I was so sheepish about pushing vowels through my nasal passages to overcome a recalcitrant New Jersey accent that I was glad to capitulate to any French citizen the minute he rolled his eyes skyward and addressed me in my native tongue. During that long time I was so impressed with the way French academicians kept tabs on their language -- battling encroachments like le weekend and le drugstore and, more recently, la McDonald's -- that I was ready to bend over backward not to be branded a polluter.
I'm pleased to say that time is ended, and now I try to barrel along in fractured -- or, in my case, sprained -- French no matter what. You see, I've learned something about the French that until this trip I had always been too cowed by them to see or hear. I learned it the time I checked into my hotel, announced myself in French, asked if my room was ready and was informed that it was and "I give you here the key."
So now I'd like to pass along the tourist tip that's been revealed to me after so many years and half a dozen trips to the City of Light -- if not absolute enlightenment. This is it: MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THEIR ENGLISH IS NO BETTER THAN YOUR FRENCH.
The hotel clerk, otherwise an agreeable guy, wasn't the only citizen I encountered who maximized the number of occasions on which he could transfer out of his language into mine. Clerks in stores also denied me the right to speak their tongue if they thought for a second that I was lost for their words.
For instance, I went to Fauchon's to have lunch in the new cafeteria built in the basement of one of the buildings the fancy-schmancy food store occupies facing the side and rear of the Madeleine.
I was at the pastry counter, trying to decide which of at least a dozen exquisite-looking desserts was most worth my forking over 25 francs (about $5 at the current jaw-dropping rate of exchange). The architectural victory I was leaning toward had a chocolate exterior shaped like a brown bag gathered at the top.
I asked the saleswoman what was inside and she said, "mousse aux pralines." I began to think that over, and, in contemplating just how delectable mousse aux pralines was likely to be as an ingredient, I must have made some inscrutable moue. She jumped feet first into the dramatic pause, fixed me with a severe expression and said flatly, "Praline mousse."
Irritating, at least to me. But, actually, this was small potatoes. The occasion that really got my multilingual goat took place in the Orangerie. If you don't know about the Orangerie, it's a compact and elegant museum at the southwest end of the Tuileries in which are housed some mighty fine Renoirs, Cezannes, Vlamincks, a truly magnificent Picasso bather and, most especially, a series of eight Monet renditions of that mysterious lily pond of his at Giverny.
I was standing in one of the two lower-level oval rooms Monet himself approved as the eternal home for these superlative works, thinking about how I could stay there forever and be content when I became aware of a group of people nearby. They were being guided by one of those thin Frenchmen with an angular nose, high cheekbones and sunken cheeks who looks like the end-product of everything Gallic.
He was gabbing in suave tones about the musical attributes of each of the paintings, saying they were comparable to compositions by Debussy or Falla. Not surprisingly, he ventured, since Monet was aware of these contemporaries. Suddenly a light whitened the room and faded; someone had taken a photograph. The lecturer's expression hardened, and without turning his head or a hair, he raised his voice theatrically and said -- in English -- "No flash please."
I don't know about the rest of the people in the room, but I felt as if I'd been slapped for misconduct. I also made a mental note that, while his was acceptable English, it wasn't so impeccable as the French in which he'd been doing his cultural commentary. I went up to the culprit with the camera and, guess what, it wasn't English in which he was chattering to his friend but fluent French.
O.K., perhaps I'm being too sensitive about this. After all, there were times when I did have entire conversations in French. At the Carnavalet Museum a woman looking over one of the rooms used to illustrate centuries of French interior design came up to me and, for some reason, asked whether I had been brought up in the Marais -- the area where the museum is located. Shocked that she could mistake me for that much of a local, I said no, that I'd been born in the United States and was just a visitor.
The possibility remains, as a few Francophile buddies have pointed out, that the battalions of English-speaking French people I encountered were either trying to be helpful or were seizing the opportunity to improve their mastery over a foreign tongue.
But I was there and my friends weren't. They didn't see that what was happening around the mouth and eyes of my partners in dialogue was the massing of muscles charged with expressing impatience and not the teamwork of muscles associated with concern, sympathy or cultural pursuit.
I love France. I love the French. I don't know why they continue to do this. Is it part of a need to hang on to national identity now that 1992 and the European Economic Community are that much closer? I don't know. I don't care. I only wish we spoke a common language -- theirs.

HEADLINE: Postings: Rising in Williamsburg;
59 Subsidized Rentals

 BODY:
The Williamsburg section of Brooklyn will see a new six- story subsidized apartment house rise on Union Avenue at Maujer Street this summer under the Turnkey Program of the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
Groundbreaking for the 59-unit rental building, designed by Steven B. Jacobs Associates of Manhattan, took place March 21, and the building is scheduled to be ready for occupancy next spring. 
 Angelo J. Aponte, the State Housing Commissioner, said the $7.4 million project, to be called Williamsburg Court, will be an "economic shot in the arm" for the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods. The money came from the State Housing Trust Fund Corporation, which gave the 99-year mortgage to the St. Nicholas Neighborhood Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit community group that will operate the housing project. Rents will be about $350 for a one-bedroom and $650 for a two-bedroom, with local residents getting rental priority.
"Williamsburg Court enables St. Nick's to continue to fulfill the corporation's commitment to providing affordable housing for our community residents," said Salvatore Abramo, chairman of the corporation, "and further our objectives of removing blight and stimulating neighborhood preservation."

HEADLINE: Talking: Refinancing;
Lowering The Costs On a Loan

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH this may be a good time to refinance a mortgage loan -- interest rates are lower than at any time in the last four years -- the upfront costs may come as a shock to many home owners.
A refinancing normally costs about 4 percent of the loan amount and usually requires an updated appraisal of the property, points charges (one point is 1 percent of the loan), a new survey, new title insurance, legal fees and credit checks. 
 Because the costs are high, the conventional wisdom is that a refinancing is economic only if the difference between the old and new rate is 2 percentage points and if the owner plans to stay in the house long enough to recoup the costs. But that 2-point rule of thumb can be bent a bit because a diligent borrower can lower the costs. The key is to deal with each item separately. Thus even if the saving on one is relatively small, a substantial amount can eventually be shaved off the total cost.
 To achieve this, the right kinds of questions must be put to the lender and the other professionals involved. William Selsberg, a real estate lawyer in Stamford, Conn., suggested shopping around and asking each lender for a detailed list of its requirements. For instance, he noted that it is not uncommon for some lenders to require a new survey upon refinancing, which can cost about $500; others do not require this.
 Before making any move a borrower should carefully read the original mortgage document. About two years ago lenders were busy offering "convertible" loans -- adjustable-rate mortgages that could be exchanged for fixed-rate loans at a specified time in the future. Many of these are now eligible for conversion at today's low fixed rates for under $500 in upfront fees, noted Barry Havemann, president of HSH Associates of Butler, N.J., a mortgage rate monitoring service. Thus a complete refinancing in the conventional sense might not even be needed.
 For everyone else the most important fee to address initially is the anticipated points charge, since it has the potential to consume 75 percent of the upfront costs. Lenders now are charging up to three points. Each point represents $1,000 for each $100,000 borrowed.
 The most likely lender to refinance without charging points is the original lender or, alternatively, the one to whom monthly payments are currently being sent. These companies will be the most willing to eliminate other charges, too.
In January, Arbor National Mortgage of Westbury, L.I., decided to begin offering a special deal to existing customers. "We knew most people were being tempted to refinance," said Nancy Boles, Arbor's vice president of marketing, "and we didn't want to lose any of them."
 It started its "portfolio refinance program" for any borrower who initiated a mortgage loan either with Arbor or American Mortgage Banking (a company with which it recently merged) provided monthly payments are still being made to either Arbor or American. Also eligible is anyone whose loan was originated through another lender but whose monthly payments are now being made to Arbor or American.
 Under this program there are no points or legal fees. "You don't even have to come into the office," said Ms. Boles. The only charges, she said, are for an updated credit check, a new property appraisal, title insurance and a processing charge called a "modification fee." Fees total around $950.
 About 100 borrowers have so far taken advantage of the deal, said Ms. Boles. The only ones ineligible are those who originally borrowed as much 80 percent of market value -- the maximum permitted -- and whose outstanding balance now exceeds the diminished value of the property.
 Upfront costs also can be lowered if a lender is willing to fold the points into the loan amount being refinanced, as is currently being done by Globe Mortgage, a lender based in Hackensack, N.J., that finances properties in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
NANCY GORDON, Globe's vice president of mortgage origination, concedes that Globe is charging borrowers 3 points. Even so, she insisted, many borrowers gain an edge by turning an old 10.5 percent fixed-rate, 30-year loan into a 15-year loan at 8 7/8 percent at very little upfront cost. Monthly payments do not decrease, but the refinancing helps pay the loan off faster. However, the change will increase the loan balance initially by the sum needed to cover the points -- for example, a $100,000 balance will become a $103,000 balance.
 Consider, in addition, the cost of reissuing a title insurance policy. Substantial savings can be achieved by asking the professional handling the new policy for a "substitution" or "reissue" rate. This should be available, say title insurance officials, if the property was bought no more than five years ago. Otherwise a new policy may be required.
 The reissue rate is around 60 percent of the new-policy rate with slight variations depending upon area. For example, Lawyers Title Insurance normally charges $563 to cover a $100,000 loan in lower New York State but only $297 for a "reissue" upon refinancing, said Ted Dacey, Lawyers Title's regional vice president.
 However, a reissue rate is normally available only from the company that issued the original policy. And it must be requested; otherwise a totally new policy may automatically be prepared. Even if another title company is being used, the borrower can still ask that company if it will honor a reissue rate, say industry officials. Many will do so.
 Not everyone automatically needs a lawyer. Whether to use one will depend on the way loans normally are handled in the area, whether the borrower feels comfortable going it alone and the policy of the lender.
 The fee charged by the borrower's lawyer is also flexible, "because refinancing is not nearly as complex as the original transaction," said Ian Hirsch, a real estate lawyer in Hackensack, N.J. He suggested calling a few lawyers to get the regional average. In the New York metropolitan area expect to pay about $500.
Mr. Selsberg, the Stamford lawyer, said another way to estimate a reasonable fee is to halve the original transaction fee. For instance, if the lawyer charged $1,000 when the home was bought, a refinancing should cost no more than $500. But even this amount may be negotiated and normally adjustments are made.
 Probably the best concession can be obtained by returning to the lawyer who handled the original closing. "He already has your details on file," said Mr. Selsberg. Further, the borrower may feel more comfortable doing so. And the lawyer is usually eager to encourage a client to return, added Mr. Selsberg.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Rent Decontrol;
Unlocking the Tax Gold in Apartments

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
MENTION the word "decontrol" and New York City legislators head for the woods. But the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog of city finance, has mentioned it in a Feburary report called "Reforming Residential Rent Regulation."
The report informs a government engrossed in budget-slashing that it is forgoing hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue by obliging landlords to charge better-to-do tenants less than their apartments are worth and less than the tenants can afford to pay. 
 The commission proposes two reforms. One is vacancy decontrol, in which an apartment is deregulated after a regulated tenant moves out and a new tenant moves in. At present, rent-controlled apartments become stabilized upon a tenancy turnover and most stabilized apartments become restabilized.
The other reform is income-targeted deregulation for tenants in place: If the household has an income that enables it to afford a "higher" standard of living, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the apartment is deregulated and a market rent is phased in.
Vacancy decontrol plus targeted decontrol would produce $100 million a year in new tax revenue by the second year, the commission estimates. Higher rents would lead to higher assessments, which in turn would produce more tax revenue.
"We wanted to focus on the revenue issue, not just the landlord-tenant issue," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Budget Commission. "We thought there ought to be new ways of raising money without doing grievous harm."
To all this Albany is likely to turn a deaf ear. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has shown no appetite for rent reform. It is from him that the impetus would have to come. He would face a nasty problem in the Legislature. The politics there are that any "pro-landlord" action must provoke an equal and opposite "pro-tenant" action, and vice versa.
In the Assembly, the chairman of the housing committee, Alexander B. Grannis, an Upper East Side Democrat, has already reacted negatively to the plan, the commission's staff said, on the ground that it would be too difficult to implement.
The city's fiscal situation should nevertheless lead responsible New Yorkers to question the two major hidden subsidies that current law confers on voters. One goes to homeowners through low taxes based on assessment restrictions. Their share of the tax burden over the last 10 years has dropped although values of homes have risen faster than values of any other type of property.
If homeowners paid only $200 a year more in taxes for each housing unit in one- to three-family buildings, the city would pick up $117.5 million in one year, the Finance Department says. But the Legislature has restricted increases and the City Council has shifted more of the load to offices.
The other hidden subsidy goes to renters, especially wealthier ones. It is essentially paid by landlords when they are obliged to charge tenants less than the product -- the apartment -- is worth.
"If there is going to be a subsidy it ought not to be to those at the higher-income level," said W. Gordon Binns Jr., a corporate pension-fund director who is chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission's economics and community development committee, which commissioned the study. It was done by Elizabeth A. Roistacher, professor of economics at Queens College.
The proposal for deregulation based on income is novel. Vacancy decontrol has been tried (from 1971 to 1974) and so has "luxury" decontrol, directed at high-rent apartments. Even used together, they would not generate enough revenue, the commission says.
HIGHER-INCOME tenants as defined by the commission live in 20 percent of the city's regulated units, or 216,000 of the million rent-controlled or -stabilized apartments. The method used was to update the figures of a 1967 Bureau of Labor Statistics study of urban living standards. It established three levels, based on expenditures for food, clothing, entertainment, household goods, education and more. The commission used the highest standard.
It turned out that the threshold income needed currently by a family of four to live by the highest of these standards was $75,500. For three it is $59,800. For two it is $38,000, and the commission decided to lift the figure for one person to $38,000 as well.
With one exception these figures are roughly double what Federal economists believe are the current median incomes in New York City by family size. The seeming anomaly is the $38,000 for a household of two; the current estimated median is $27,650.
The commission's approach in any event produces a finding that higher-income tenants were paying an average of $616 a month in rent in 1987. Their apartments would rent for an average of $745 a month currently if they were decontrolled. The commission suggests that phase-in increases be limited to 15 percent a year.
About 90 percent of the higher-income households have either one or two members. And more than half the higher-income renters -- 57 percent -- live in Manhattan.
It is not hard to grasp why many higher-income tenants would be aghast at this. Long-occupied apartments frequently provide housing bargains because of a favorable location, but not first-rate housing quality. The higher-income tenant is more conscious of the latter than the former.
A tenant earning $100,000 a year may be paying $1,000 a month to live in an East Side apartment that is worth $1,600, yet feeling nothing but wrath toward a landlord who cuts corners on services and amenities. The tenant might well be incensed to see the rent advancing to market levels without housing quality advancing immediately.
On the other hand, because the proposal affects so many units, it can be expected that landlords in the current rental market would have to be willing to provide better maintenance and services to keep their tenants. "Increased competition in the housing market would translate into better housing," Dr. Roistacher said.
Under the commission's plan, tenants with incomes below the higher-income threshold would have to provide income data to the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal to keep their apartments regulated. Whether this would withstand a legal challenge is not clear.
Bureaucratically there would be difficulties as well, although they are probably surmountable. The state would face a new barrage of filings from tenants and would have to determine systematically who is eligible and who ineligible for a regulated apartment.
Difficulties notwithstanding, it is hard to justify a regulation system that keeps rents low for wealthy people. "We think that starting deregulation on an income basis will eliminate the tax subsidy for those who need it least," Mr. Binns said.
The benefit to the housing market would be far-reaching: fitting household size to apartment size as small families moved from expensive large apartments; lowering over-all rent levels through a more competitive market and ultimately encouraging owners and lenders to stay in the rental business.
For the city, income-targeted decontrol using the commission's suggested threshold incomes has the potential to produce $68 million more in property taxes annually, Dr. Roistacher calculates. The Finance Department says each added dollar of taxes from rentals would generate a dollar from co-ops or condominiums. There are 416,200 co-ops and 73,300 condominiums in the Class 2 property category with rentals.
Other approaches to raising rents for higher-income tenants can be imagined. For example, deregulation could be applied to households earning more than 200 percent of the city's median household income. In that case only 180,000 tenants would be affected instead of 216,000, Dr. Roistacher said.
If nothing else, the Budget Commission's plan should succeed in stimulating thinking about a situation that is a national embarrassment. New Yorkers sometimes seem too willing to sweep it under the rug.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Columbus Avenue;
Turnover Stabilizes as a Street Finds Its Own Niche

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
KNOWN since the mid-1980's for high turnover, the tenancy of Columbus Avenue may have stabilized somewhat, to judge from a year-to-year survey that shows a net increase of only three vacancies out of 241 storefronts from 66th to 86th Street.
Along this one-mile stretch, 33 storefronts, or 13.7 percent, are currently empty. 
 The citywide vacancy rate for retail space is about 10 percent, said Charles Aug, president of Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing, making an educated guess.
"You probably have the same phenomenon of availabilities on Madison Avenue, with wholly different market conditions," said C. Bradley Mendelson, a managing director of the Edward S. Gordon Company.
Of 211 spaces on Columbus Avenue that were occupied at this time last year, 179 have the same tenants today, 12 have different tenants and 20 are vacant.
Of 30 spaces vacant last year, 17 are now occupied and 13 remain vacant.
"If the numbers are correct, I'd have to say that's a definition of health," said Benjamin Fox, executive vice president of New Spectrum Realty Services, a retail brokerage that is quite active on Columbus Avenue.
"I don't see anybody fleeing," said Robert C. Quinlan, who owns the Walker Malloy management and brokerage concern and also six large buildings on the avenue. "Columbus is still packed on weekends. The volume was probably much higher two years ago, but it's still high."
"The fact that 60 percent of what was vacant last year has been rented is a good sign," Mr. Mendelson. "Fifteen percent turnover in a year is not something that would be questionable. There's normally 15 to 20 percent turnover in any neighborhood."
"The street has lost some of its glitter but it hasn't lost its location," Mr. Aug said. "I think Columbus Avenue is trying to seek its own level. Stores selling $1,000 suits couldn't do business. The Gap and the Limited are reporting pretty good sales."
"Inherently, Columbus Avenue is healthy," Mr. Fox said, "and the fact that it's rebounded as quickly as it did, despite the fact that it's a sluggish economy, is testament to that fact."
For the purpose of the survey, a storefront was counted as vacant if there is no current tenant, even if the space has been rented. By the same token, a storefront is counted was occupied even if the current tenant is about to go out of business.
The true vacancy rate may be lower than the numbers suggest. Five vacant spaces are on a block between 66th and 67th Streets that is being sold by Capital Cities/ABC and would not be available for rent in any case, and three storefronts counted as empty in this survey, at 76th Street, will reopen soon as a Gap clothing store.
Since last year, the avenue gained six restaurants but lost another six (no net change), gained 10 clothing and shoe stores but lost 14 (a net decline of four) and lost three gift stores. It gained a private mail service, two photo shops and a Chase Manhattan Bank, near 74th Street, where Miss Grimble once sold cheese cake.
It is also getting a new 10-story office building for Capital Cities/ABC, which is now under construction at 66th Street and is expected to be completed in 1992. The building will be used primarily to house ABC news shows. It will be connected to the network headquarters immediately to the east and the WABC building to the north. The architects are Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates.
"No decision has been made regarding whether there will be any stores" on the ground floor, said Julie Hoover, the network's vice president for corporate projects.
Among all the arrivals, there were several notable departures recently. One was the Last Wound-Up, near 74th Street, which opened in 1981 and seemed to embody the avenue's fanciful phase. Visitors to the tiny store could find hundreds of wind-up toys to play with or buy.
"There's 320 square feet and they wanted over $5,000 a month rent and the street isn't doing that kind of money," said Nathan Cohen, the founder of the store, which continues to operate at Broadway and 19th Street. "I asked them to come down in rent and they refused. We would have loved to stay. The landlord put us out of business."
MR. COHEN said his rent 10 years ago was $1,500 and business was robust. Through the term of his seven-year lease, the rent rose gradually to $2,000. But at the expiration of that lease the owners raised the rent to $5,000, Mr. Cohen said, just as trade was starting to decline.
Since last year, three local businesses -- the Cherry Restaurant, Grossinger's Home Bakery and the Putumayo clothing store -- were displaced from a building on the southeast corner of 76th Street.
Those spaces are being combined into a 5,000-square-foot Gap store that is to open in May, said Mr. Fox, who brokered the deal.
The seemingly ubiquitous chain, based in San Francisco, already has four stores within a 10-block radius. "With all these units around," Mr. Fox said, "their sales figures still showed them that Columbus was strong enough to warrant another."
"I think you're going to see on Columbus more of the national tenants like the Sharper Image," Mr. Mendelson said.
Mr. Quinlan said he also discerns a greater willingness on the landlords' part to accept food-related tenants, who normally are shunned in favor of dry-goods dealers.
At the same time, Columbus seems to be losing avant-garde clothiers such as Parachute, between 74th and 75th Street, which has been replaced by the Vari Zioni boutique.
"When Parachute went out, the rent was $96 a square foot," Mr. Fox said. "I just rented that store to Vari Zioni at $74. There was a landlord that understood realities."
"IN 1986," he said, "I rented $100-a-square-foot stores and it would take me, if I had a sign in the window, a week to rent. Today, rents are down to $65, $70 a square foot. You're talking about a 30 percent drop. I think it's helped re-establish the avenue."
"It took a number of years for Columbus Avenue to find its niche," he said. "Its niche really is not to compete with Madison Avenue but really to fill the void in the Upper West Side for moderately priced clothing."
"The whole trend went too far upscale," Mr. Fox said. "A lot of retailers saw that the hard way and retrenched."
"It was such a laboratory," Mr. Quinlan said. "Manufacturers who wanted to test new lines on the public tried Columbus first." As an example of an experiment that failed, he cited the short-lived Fizzazz boutique, at 73d Street, which sold only sportswear emblazoned with the Coca-Cola logotype.
"Columbus was an evening and weekend street, a wonderful walking street, because singles went from bar to bar to bar," Mr. Mendelson said. "I think the nature of the Upper West Side resident has changed over to married-with-children."

HEADLINE: Shopping for Co-op or Condo Managers

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
RELATIONS between co-op and condominium boards and their managing agents are a little like modern affairs of the heart: The boards want to be sure they are appreciated for their special qualities, management firms seek to prove they are hard and attentive workers, and neither side is afraid of divorce if things don't work out.
Such marriages and break-ups seem to be more and more common these days, as the relations between the two shift with the city's changing economic and social climate. The boards, which once looked pretty much alike to the city's management and brokerage firms, are now more likely to demand custom-tailored services. The management firms, on the other hand, are looking hard at the costs of their services, and trying to make boards realize that champagne services don't come at beer prices. 
 "The big difference today is that the management market for co-ops and condos cuts across a much broader swath of the economic scale, and the buildings therefore have different economic priorities," said Irwin Gumley, a real estate operator for 35 years and a management executive for 15 who recently started his own management and brokerage firm, Gumley-Haft, in Manhattan. "In the 1950's co-ops were only at the top of the economy, there was no inflation, and things just went along from day to day."
Today, Mr. Gumley went on, co-op and condominium ownership has spread from Fifth Avenue to Flatbush, from Park Avenue to Pelham, and the duties of co-op and condominium boards have multiplied just as the economics of apartment ownership have changed.
The city's apartment houses are aging, most having been built before or just after World War II. Numerous city Building Code rules, from those dealing with smoke detectors to those involved with exterior inspections, multiply the paperwork. The economic slump has produced a painful phenomenon almost unheard of a decade ago -- the tenant shareholder who cannot pay maintenance fees and the bankrupt builder who saddles the board with unsold apartments for which he can not, or will not, pay maintenance fees.
Perhaps most important, say managing agents, is that apartment owners themselves have changed the way they view their apartments. Where an apartment was once simply home sweet home, many of today's owners regard their co-op or condominium as an investment portfolio; they express their worries about care and the reputation of their investment with a hawk-like attention to the way it is managed, particularly now that real estate values have been battered by the recession.
Owners argue over board policies, badger the management and demand to be heard.
"Before, we managed housing," said Roger Tuckerman, president of Brown Harris Stevens, one of the city's biggest and oldest brokerage and management firms. "Now we manage investments."
Donald Goodwin, Brown Harris Stevens' director of management, noted how the work of simply attending board meetings had multiplied.
"TWENTY years ago, if a board met more than twice a year, you would say it was a troubled building," he said. "These days, boards in buildings where everything is fine will still meet every other month."
Mr. Goodwin's colleague, Julie Willkie, noted how such a routine trend as the one toward interior renovations has burdened managing agents.
"People used to buy what they liked," she said, "now they renovate, so you have six months of painters and plasterers and carpenters going up and down the elevators and getting on the other shareholders' nerves. And guess who has to handle the complaints."
In this atmosphere, buildings are shopping around as never before, to hear board members tell it, for the managing agent that fits their needs. To meet the challenge, the management agency business is fragmenting and specializing, with a dozen or more new companies formed in the last decade to compete with the big established firms.
Leslie Kaminoff, head of Akam Associates, focuses on management only and eschews the sale of apartments, which traditionally accounted for most of a management firm's income. Stuart Bardin of Quadrangle Realty Services has made a reputation as a manager of small buildings that large companies disdain, and for dealing with co-ops whose sponsor has defaulted on unsold shares.
Perhaps the biggest recent splash in the management and brokerage business was made by the Milstein family of bankers and developers, when they bought Douglas Elliman & Company, an old-line firm, in late 1989.
Howard P. Milstein, the firm's new chairman, noted in an interview that the company built 3,000 New York City apartments in the 1980's. But with construction now all but stalled, he said, integrating management and brokers with his family's banking and development expertise is a logical step.
"Real estate money in the 1990's is going to be made in services," he said. His management firm is seeking contracts with the Resolution Trust Corporation -- the Federal agency that disposes of properties held by failed savings and loan institutions -- to manage the liquidation of properties taken over from failed real estate lenders. Mr. Milstein suggested that ownership of a management and brokerage agency will strengthen his ability to win R.T.C. contracts.
At the same time, by spanning services from banking to building, Mr. Milstein said, his company can offer its co-op and condominium management clients, for a fee, a broad list of customized services, from savings in insurance costs to expertise in conducting capital improvements and repairs.
While Douglas Elliman pursues the managing agent's traditional role of handling everything from supervising roof replacements to putting flowers in the lobby, some agencies are helping cost-conscious co-op boards move in the opposite direction, offering limited services and a degree of self-management as a way to save money. Under this system, boards may order services from a menu of tasks at set prices from management companies, and do other tasks, such as dealing with outside contractors, themselves.
If there is an overall theme to the quest for the right balance of savings and services, it is the search for a way to satisfy the desire for specialized, individualized treatment. What board members seem to want, managing agents and board members themselves agree, are managers who care as much about the apartments under their wing as the owners of the apartments do.
"Anybody can order heating oil and anybody can pay the payroll," said Grace Griffenberg, president of the board of 40 Sutton Place, a condominium of 76 apartments. "It's the other intricate parts of managing a building that make the difference -- is the superintendent efficient or is he wasting everybody's time? Is the staff managed properly, and can you get them to return your phone calls?"
Unreturned telephone messages were apparently one of the gripes she and her fellow board members had about Douglas Elliman shortly after it was acquired by the Milstein family three years ago.
"They were terribly impersonal, and we couldn't get them to return our calls, and there was really no sense of planning ahead for our maintenance, she said. "It was just, 'Wait for it to break and we'll fix it.' " Her condominium is now managed by Akam Associates.
EXECUTIVES at Douglas Elliman insist that the firm has strengthened its responsiveness by drastically reducing the number of buildings each account executive manages from about 15 to 7 or 8, a process Mr. Milstein believes will eliminate the feeling boards get that they must compete for attention.
The rivalry between managing agents is intense, and few of them have a good word to say about the others. But in one area Douglas Elliman is being quietly but fervently cheered on by its competition -- its almost single-handed drive to force management fees upward. After a decade of driving each other's fees downwards, in which management agencies raided the competition's roster by driving fees downward, other agencies hope they will be able to demand larger fees as well.
MR. MILSTEIN said that he has won management fee increases averaging 70 percent while losing only 10 percent of his client list, leaving about 160 buildings. A typical Douglas Elliman client is accordingly being charged $35,000 to $45,000, instead of the $24,000 that is the norm elsewhere, for a year's services in paying the bills, keeping the books, dealing with the city, managing the staff and attending board meetings.
"The previous philosophy at Douglas Elliman was basically a philosophy of depreciating the product," Mr. Milstein said. "We are going to provide a first-class service and make it pay for itself."
This is a departure from past practices at management and brokerage firms that depended on the commissions from the sale of apartments in buildings they managed to cover any shortfall in management costs not covered by the fee.
That formula worked a decade and more ago, when the firms could count on brokering 75 percent of the sales in their buildings. But then, in the early 80's, came the trend toward co-brokering, or sharing, commissions with outside brokers. This was followed by a blossoming of small, independent real estate brokers who cruised the co-op and condominium cocktail circuit for listings.
The share of management-firm sales has now dropped to about 15 percent of the total, while in the last few years the number of sales themselves declined with the slump, leaving many firms with heavy losses.
Both Douglas Elliman and Brown Harris Stevens underwent management changes and personnel cutbacks in this period, and both companies are still looking for solid footing in the market, which is why even Douglas Elliman's competitors hope it can get boards used to paying more.
Part of the problem in squeezing more money out of the board, Mr. Goodwin pointed out, is that more than 85 percent of a co-op or condominium board's budget is devoted to fixed costs like taxes, salaries, insurance, utilities and so on. That leaves 15 percent for the board to exercise some control over, he said, including management fees.
"When I came into this business you almost never asked for fee increases," he said. "And when you did, you went to them with hat in hand and almost begged for it. So over the years, we have sort of trained the boards not to expect an increase, and to regard them as negotiable when we do go to them for one."
The search for higher fees comes at an awkward time this spring, with the contract between most of the city's apartments and the Service Employees International Union, which represents building staff, set to expire on April 20. Most large buildings have their labor contracts negotiated by the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, where contract talks on wage increases and other benefits are under way.
Managing agents are notoriously cagey about the exact number of apartments on their rosters, and prefer to give approximate numbers. An even more tender subject is the loss of buildings to others, and the talk among managing agents today is about how many accounts the firm really lost when it began forcing prices up. Competition is naturally keenest for the trophy buildings, co-ops of such refined reputation and location as to serve as subtle advertisements for a managing agent's abilities to please.
Mr. Kaminoff won such a prize when he took over management of the Beresford, on Central Park West between 81st and 82d Streets, from Douglas Elliman in 1989. Mr. Kaminoff, who started out with one building on Vermilyea Street in Upper Manhattan nine years ago, said he won the Beresford and "about 50" other buildings from bigger and better-known firms by tailoring his services to each building.
"The key thing with boards are finances and reporting flexibility," Mr. Kaminoff said. "Ninety-nine percent of the management companies have a boilerplate financial report which they send to every building they manage on a monthly basis. That was fine when every building was a co-op, but now we have co-ops and condos and cond-ops, and every board has its own financial strategy and needs to see different kinds of reports. We advise them on those issues."
The other approach Mr. Kaminoff favors is the monthly building walk-through, where the managing agent makes a white-glove inspection with the resident staff and then suggests maintenance initiatives. The sooner a manager can warn the board of an impending problem, Mr. Kaminoff said, the easier it will be to solve the problem.
And, Mr. Kaminoff said, echoing other managers, management has to pay for itself. No more, he said, should managing agents entertain the fiction that real estate sales will help cover management costs.
ALTHOUGH rates vary widely, it appears that they typically run between $300 and $400 an apartment annually for a normal elevator co-op of under 100 apartments. Some managing agents use a formula that begins with a standard, flat fee of $20,000 to $30,000, and add $300 to $400 for each apartment over a certain number. Exact fees for a building are a closely held secret, however, since no manager wants to have to explain to Client A why it is paying more than Client B across the street.
"What happened is that boards are now more willing to pay for services," Mr. Kaminoff said. "They got burnt by the old promises the brokerage companies made that sales would cover management costs. Today, if you can show a building that you can help them, they are willing to pay for it."
The itemized menu of limited services works a little differently. Many co-op boards have been receiving contract proposals from management firms that spell out exactly what a building will get for a limited fee -- perhaps $16,000 instead of the standard $25,000 or $30,000, for handling routine tasks such as collecting maintenance fees, paying staff, notifying owners of pending board meetings, calculating income tax deductions for building mortgage interests costs for shareholders each January and attending two board meetings a year.
Any additional services -- handling flip taxes on sold co-ops, for example, or gathering paperwork to appeal a tax increase and attending more than one or two board meetings -- are billed on an hourly rate, just as law firms are able to bill down to the minute for all services rendered.
Fine-tuning management services like this is requiring firms to invest heavily in computerization, Mr. Tuckerman of Brown Harris Stevens said, but once done, it would give co-op boards far more flexibility in buying services than they now have.
"If your lawyer can bill you according to each phone call he makes or letter he writes," Mr. Tuckerman said, "there is no reason we shouldn't be able to do the same thing, if that's what the customer prefers."

Teaching at Home
 
Question: I am a full-time school teacher and want to offer computer tutoring in my rent-stabilized apartment nights and weekends. Do rent guidelines permit that? . . . Houda Chawki, Corona, Queens
 
Answer: Yes. Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said that no rent regulation bars you. There are, however, two other potential obstacles.
First, zoning laws. Vahe Tiryakian, spokesman for the city's Buildings Department, says the occupational use must be secondary to the residential use and limited to 500 square feet or a fourth of the space, whichever is more. The person offering the product or service, who must live there, is permitted only one nonresident employee. The following enterprises are banned: commercial stable or kennel, public relations or ad agency, beauty parlor, barbering, depilatory office, interior decorating office, ophthalmic dispensing, pharmacy, real estate or insurance office, stock brokerage and veterinary medicine. Classes are limited to four students.
On the off-chance that your tutoring involves computer music, be aware the rules limit music classes to one student at a time.
A second barrier may be your lease. The state's Court of Appeals has ruled that a psychologist who partitioned an apartment office and saw up to 22 clients weekly significantly violated a standard clause in rent-stabilized leases specifying residential use. No precedent exists on a case exactly like yours, according to Michael R. Finder, a Manhattan housing lawyer. If you have such a lease, said Mr. Finder, theoretically the landlord could challenge it. You would better withstand a challenge by limiting your classes, students and hours and by keeping the tutoring incidental to your residential use and secondary to your main job outside.
 
Razor-Wire Usage
 
Question: An apartment building next door has a 10-foot-high fence topped with coils of razor wire along my property line. Our community board office told me that razor wire, which seems dangerous and unsightly, is against the law. But the building's management told me there are no restrictions on the wire or height. Are they right? If not, what can I do to make them take it down? . . .Susan Lowes, Brooklyn.
 
Answer: The management is right about the wire but wrong about the height restriction. Mr. Tiryakian said fences are limited to a height of 6 feet in areas zoned residential and 10 feet elsewhere, not including the height of the wire. Call the New York City Buildings Department's borough complaint office at (718) 802-3681 for inspection and enforcement.
 
Co-op Rental Liability
 
Question: If a co-op owner loses his apartment through legal action because of a proprietary lease violation, what happens to his equity? Who becomes the owner? How is the property disposed of? Who receives the proceeds? . . . Fay Cea, Manhattan
 
Answer: The co-op board would take control of and sell the shares of stock for the apartment. Any money left over after satisfying liens would revert to the evicted former owner, according to Marc J. Luxemburg, president of the Council of New York Cooperatives. Co-op evictions and forced sales are unusual, but not unheard of.
The most common cause is unpaid maintenance and assessments. The sales proceeds would be used to cover those delinquencies, as well as selling costs like legal fees, advertising and commissions. Other possible liens could include unpaid bank loans, tax bills or court judgments.

HEADLINE: ART;
A Look at the Last Century Through American Indian Eyes

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: RYE

 BODY:
AT the Rye Arts Center is "Visions of the Past Century: Paintings by Native Americans (1897-1987)." This is a group of some 30 works culled by Evelyn Bernstein from the collection of the Smithsonian Intitution's National Museum of the American Indian.
Soon after its opening, the show received a boost from Mrs. Bernstein's husband, William, executive vice president of Orion Pictures, who gave a lecture on the making of the Oscar-winning Orion movie "Dances With Wolves." 
 But after the fanfare all that remains is the exhibited art, a sound track of Indian music and, to this observer, an atmosphere of great sadness.
This is established at the beginning by "An Omaha Indian Kills a Horse Under Long Cat." The horse is off the ground, its back arched, blood pours from the bullet wound in its side and arrows hurtle through the air. But Long Cat, an Oglala Sioux, survived to tell the tale himself in this sepia ink and red crayon drawing of circa 1880.
Except for the rifle, the horse and the medium, the image could have been done on a cave wall in pre-Conquest or even prehistoric times. After all, the technique -- figures that are almost ideograms, the absence of perspective -- exists in the past of all cultures and it appears childlike. Yet, as with the paleolithic art at Lascaux and Altamira, no child could have done this, for everything in it is knowledgeably defined, down to the bump of the pelvis in the horse's back.
Although it is one of the smallest works in the show, Long Cat's self-portrait is the most memorable, for notwithstanding the symptoms of progress, it represents all too clearly the moment when man stopped being part of nature and became its boss.
The Europeans' introduction of new material like beads and, some say, the color blue, changed the character of Indian art and in some ways for the better. But it took the 20th-century notion of art as an end in itself to change the quality (for the worse) and, perversely, the same notion makes viewers generally prefer what they deem "unspoiled" Indian art.
Still, if visitors put on their 20th-century lenses, the show has quite a bit to offer. Near Long Cat is an undated ink line drawing on hide of Eskimos chivying elk, by George Aden Ahgupuk. Most of the parka-ed figures are waving their arms at the herd, but one has wrestled an animal to the ground. The scene is European in style, and something -- smudges modeling the mountains in the distance, the presence of a lone elk running and bellowing in the foreground -- hints that it was based on a photograph.
Also noteworthy are the pencil and crayon drawings of totem pole images that are attributed to the Nootka of Vancouver Island. Until the eye identifies the elements -- birds, killer whales, faces and the like -- these compact designs have the look of a William Blake drawing.
Earnest Louis Spybuck, an "absentee" Shawnee working in the second decade of the century, is more a folk artist diligently recording folk customs in "Woman's Dance at Night -- Pigeon Dance." Done in crayon and water color, this is the equivalent of a village hop, with the women, dressed in blouses, skirts, scarves, flowered hats and high-heeled boots standing in the center. At the right two of the men are dancing together, but most are minding their own business sitting around the clearing, which is surrounded by tents and shelters made of poles and straw roofs.
"Sauk and Fox Buffalo Dance," by the same artist, is a similar picture except that it includes a man eviscerating a dog in the foreground, presumably toward a banquet of stew.
Much more sophisticated is the encounter between two braves, one on a bucking white horse, the other on the ground with a leg trapped by his fallen skewbald mount. A gouache on paper board, it was painted by Velino Shije, who in the 1920's designed the sun symbol for New Mexico's state flag. A statement accompanying the show explains that for this act he was considered "outrageously individualistic" and was expelled from his Zia tribe.
By the 1930's, schools for Indian artists were emerging -- notably in New Mexico and Oklahoma -- and although there is no matching artists to teachers, the effect is obvious. An example is "Gan Dancer," a 1962 work by the Mescalero Apache artist Ignatius Palmer, one of several small figures flatly painted in gouache that evoke both Oriental art and the late Kandinsky.
Again, there is a non-Western strangeness about the Navajo Jimmy Toddy's watercolors of the 1940's. One, untitled, is of a mockingbird perched on a wire in the foreground while more birds fly over a hogan in the background. The other is a gouache of a deformed tree.
The trouble starts in the 1960's with the prints of the enormously successful Navajo artist Rudolph Carl Gorman, particularly with the 1964 lithograph of a woman posed, Vogue model-style, with a tulip pot, titled "Navajo Mother." After that comes a 1982 work by the Cherokee artist Connie Seabourn: "Mother Shades," a dappled watercolor of a similarly glamorous woman in front of an adobe structure. This virtuoso performance has the same depressing effect as Veloy Vigil's "Owl's Hoot," an acrylic of two Indian-like figures executed in slashes of furious red, blue and green -- a commerical kind of Expressionism.
It is hard not to rejoice that economically, Native American artists are drawing abreast of the imported kind, but it is just as hard not to be dismayed at the way the artists are doing it. Apropos, one of the most telling pictures in the display is the Hopi painter Arlo Nuvayouma's 1965 gouache of an Indian family picking out a television with the aid of a white salesman.
The show remains through April 14 at the center, 51 Milton Road, in Rye.
The distance between the Indians at Rye and Carl Rattner at the Edward Hopper House, in Nyack, cannot be measured in miles alone. Mr. Rattner's show, like that of David Weinrib last year, fills the house with an erotic atmosphere.
Visceral forms, usually cast in a pink or tan ceramic, undulate horizontally or else twist in and out of each other with no end. Endlessness, in fact, is one of the principal themes here. The drawings resemble the configuration of an ear, except that it is often impossible to distinguish the forms from the spaces between them.
But there is no formal ambiguity in the sculpture. "Spiral," for instance, looks like a serpent extruding smaller serpents, one at each end. Then there are the more bone-like forms that cluster together, invoking barnacles, bean pods and other natural curiosities. It is an organic world that Mr. Rattner inhabits, and things are often splitting, as if in the act of giving birth. Another motif is the half-egg form that reposes on its curved back and is modeled into curved ridges on the top.
Finally, there are the rippling shapes confined in vertical wooden boxes, lest they wriggle free. The boxes, however, do a good job, and their zigzagging outlines add a stimulating touch of discipline to the proceedings. Geometry appears in a few modeled works, too, such as "Angle," a spiral that is a triangle before it softens into a ribbon.
Mr. Rattner is a sculptor in craftsman's clothing, and he achieves his shapes in a way that suits his purpose but seems convoluted to this observer. Each element is modeled in longitudinal sections, and cast so that the seams and slits are integrel to the design. A more grandiose sensibility would do them in bronze and, perhaps, would lose the fleshy impact that comes with the pink and beige ceramic. The work stays at 82 North Broadway through April 7.

From This Class, Many Signs Point To the Windy City

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Once the social-science laboratory for the University of Chicago, the city of Chicago has become the site of an urban studies experiment for an interdisciplinary humanities course taught about a thousand miles away.
Some 40 students from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Tex., visited the city last week to see firsthand what they had been studying since January in University Studies Class 216, popularly called the Chicago course. 
 "Texans, in general, don't automatically see Chicago as a preferred destination," said Martha Allen, a history professor who teaches the course with Daniel Hilliard, a sociology professor, and Farley Snell, a religion professor.
But Professor Allen said a reading of literature from different academic disciplines pointed to a distinct trend: Chicago as a center of modern American thought. "Every area we looked at -- architecture, higher education, economics, art, literature, urban planning, social work -- they all pointed toward Chicago," she said.
Last week, her students were pointing at Chicago, specifically at the Art Institute; Clarke House, the oldest house in Chicago; the Pullman community, the company town that became a site of the infamous 1894 Pullman strike; the city's historical society to view the exhibit "Chicago in the 1890's," the very subject of their classroom work, and both the Frank Lloyd Wright home and studio and the Wright-designed Unity Temple in the suburb of Oak Park.
"I wanted to learn more about the history of the city," said June Chen, a senior biology major from Austin, Tex., who had visited Chicago on her own last summer. "Like the Frank Lloyd Wright tour -- His work is more interesting in person because we learned about it in class."
Developed under a National Endowment for the Humanities grant, the Chicago studies course was structured to teach students the interrelationships between humanities disciplines. Of the 18 credit hours that students receive, six are based on the study of Chicago.
With an enrollment of 42 students, Chicago studies is one of the most popular courses on campus. Indeed, Chicago itself seems to have captured Southwestern University's fancy. The college library has built a collection of more than 400 books about the city, while students, faculty and staff members have all worked to finance the class's Windy City trip.
Fund raising included helping to take inventory at the Austin Montgomery Ward; auctioning off student labor to do odd jobs for faculty and staff members, and holding a garage sale.
Then there was "the Jug," an empty bottled-water container for any spare change that students wanted to cast its way. "Even students who weren't signed up to go on the trip contributed," said Professor Allen. The jug total: $90.
"We studied it to be such a big city," said Harland DeWitt, a senior in American-studies from Houston. "But now that I'm here, it has a kind of weird, small-town feeling to it."

What Sort of Price for A.T.&T.'s Reluctant NCR Prize?
 

It has not exactly been a perfume and flowers courtship. From the moment the American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced its intention to buy the NCR Corporation it has been waltzing on its presumed partner's toes. There were threats: A.T.& T. said it could muster enough shareholder votes to remove NCR's board of directors and replace it with a pro-A.T.& T slate at last Thursday's annual meeting in Dayton, Ohio. The tallies will not be known for 10 days, but it is believed that A.T.& T. fell short. It could only get enough votes to replace four directors -- not enough to soften NCR's stance. There was haggling: Just prior to the annual meeting, Charles E. Exely Jr., NCR's chairman, authorized a price of $110 a share, or $7.45 billion for the company, a figure A.T.& T rejected. But A.T.& T. is said to be willing to pay $105, if the terms are friendly. On the strength of last week's proceedings, NCR's stock closed at $99.625, up $2.
 
Sony Eyes Orion's Oscars
 
If Orion Pictures was the big winner Oscar night with "Dances with Wolves," capturing best picture and six other awards, Japan was a loser. Neither MCA, which Matsushita Electric Industrial Company bought in November for $6.1 bilion, nor Sony, which spent $3.4 billion to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment in 1988, won a single Oscar. But Sony may try to buy its way into this year's pack yet. Sony's affiliate, Castle Rock Entertainment, is talking about buying Orion. At the moment, Orion needs money more than Oscars. It lost $15.6 million in last year's third quarter on revenue of $134.9 million, and it has $509 million in long-term debt. Orion's biggest investor, billionaire John W. Kluge, who owns 68 percent, has hired Salomon Brothers to sell his stock. Just the invitation Sony needs.
 
One More Airline Down
 
Will Midway Airlines be able to ride out the turbulence of Chapter 11? The Chicago-based carrier became the third major airline to file for bankruptcy protection since December. It filed to get a $40 million line of credit from Continental Illinois that it needs to keep flying. Midway vows to stay in the air and its chairman, David R. Hinson, has promised to maintain its schedules. But analysts are not optimistic about Midway's re-emergence. Last year it borrowed heavily to buy landing slots, planes and routes for $200 million from bankrupt Eastern Airlines. Higher fuel prices, a traffic downturn during the gulf war and intense competition have since stretched the company thin. "Unless there is a traffic recovery by June, the likelihood of a successful reorganization is dim," said Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers.
 
Maxwell in Perpetual Motion
 
Robert Maxwell's passion is the deal. Two weeks ago, the hyperactive Mr. Maxwell bought The New York Daily News. The Tribune Company paid him $60 million to take over its liabilities which could easily amount to twice that much. Last week, while in Israel attempting to start a Russian language weekly newspaper, Mr. Maxwell agreed to sell Pergamon Press, a publisher of scientific books and journals, to the big Dutch publisher Elsevier for about $770 million. One deal pays for the other. The proceeds from Pergamon's sale will be used to pay off some of the $1.7 billion in debt the Maxwell Communication Corporation ran up from its frenzied acquistion of Macmillan Inc., and the Official Airline Guide. Pergamon, one of Mr. Maxwell's original holdings, was purchased in 1951. In 1971, he temporarily lost control of the company. When he regained it later that year, he moved its headquarters onto the grounds of his lavish Oxford estate -- he possesses one of the best wine cellars in Europe -- as a dramatic symbol that Pergamon would always be his.
 
I.B.M. Trims Its Ranks
 
What sounded like a distress call may end up being a victory shout. The International Business Machines Corporation announced it was paring its ranks. Big Blue said 14,000 employees would go -- 10,000 through attrition and various incentives, another 4,000 with the sale of the company's typewriter, printer and office products division. A sign of trouble? The giant says no, just a new, trim fit. It was "not just the conservative, but the prudent thing to do," said Daniel Mandresh, who follows I.B.M. for Merrill Lynch. The cuts could mean a saving of $400 million this year in pretax expenses. The analysts were overjoyed.
 
Abboud Dismissal Redux
 
In his stormy career, A. Robert Abboud has been fired from some pretty fancy jobs. Last week it happened again. Mr. Abboud was asked to leave as chairman of First City Bankcorporation of Texas, which he and others took over in 1988. The bank lost $268.2 million in the last half of 1990. In 1980 it was the First Chicago Corporation from which Mr. Abboud was dismissed. In 1984, Armand Hammer ousted him from Occidental Petroleum.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
South Korea Chooses a Plane
 
The fighting may be over but the casualties continue. After negotiating for two years with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation to jointly develop a front-line fighter based on the twin-engine F-18A, South Korea suddenly turned frugal. It canceled the project in favor of a cheaper plane. The General Dynamics Corporation will join with Korea's Samsung Group to develop a plane based on the single-engine F-16. The F-16, used widely in combat in the gulf war, costs just $18.4 million versus $30.8 million for an F-18A. The F-16 flew 30,000 sorties, easily defeating the best Iraqi arms -- the same ones the North Koreans use.
 
The German Export Giant
 
Since the gulf war ended, the dollar has been rising. But not enough to offset Germany's new lead: it is now the No. 1 exporting nation, leaving the United States in an unfamiliar No. 2 position. Germany exported $421 billion worth of goods in 1990 versus $394.5 billion for the United States. The reason for Germany's ascendency is its currency. The mark is still at historic highs. "The mark may be wiggling around the trend line these last two weeks, but that doesn't offset the last six years," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York. "The dollar is still depreciated." The strength of the mark raised the value of Germany's exports and broadened its financial position. But in one area, at least, the United States is still No. 1. "The U.S. imported $494.9 billion worth of goods in 1990, about $100 billion more than it exports," No other country comes even close.
 
In Brief
 
The Commerce Department is borrowing a strategy from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. It has selected 20 American companies to promote in Japan. Timkin, Square D and Dana are among the few. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher will take the heads of these companies to Japan and personally escort them around.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Congress Versus Brady
 
United States Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was upbeat last week. He very nearly promised that no taxpayer-funded bailout of the banks would be needed, unless the nation's economy performed much worse than expected. There was one catch: Congress had to approve his proposed overhaul of the banking system for the nation's banking woes to really wither. The proposals would allow banks to open branches nationwide and let them merge with investment banks and brokerage houses. The intended changes would also give industrial companies the right to buy banks -- the most controversial issue. Mr. Brady said he did not think his proposals would sail through Congress unchanged, but he felt all of them would be approved. Not so, argue many in Congress, who are rolling up their sleeves for a fight.
 
Broke Consumers Want to Spend
 
February was a better month for the mechanic than it was for the manufacturer, but just barely so. Personal income was up by a slim 0.3 percent, but sales of durable, big-ticket items like washing machines were down by 0.3 percent, following an even bigger drop of 1.5 percent in January, according to the Commerce Department. "The fall was really 0.4 percent, if you exclude defense spending," said Robert Ortner, former chief economist at the Commerce Department. "Consumers would love to spend. All the indicators say that." They just don't have the money.
 
Job Security, the Big Worry
 
The economy may still be in a recession, but no one seems too gloomy about it. The Conference Board's overall index of consumer confidence for March registered its biggest jump ever. The index, derived from a survey of 5,000 heads of American households about their views of the present and the future, has been a reliable indicator of recessions and recoveries. But the silver lining in the index's findings comes with a cloud. The one area of negative sentiment revealed in the survey is job prospects. "People still have enormous concern about job security," said Fabian Linden, the survey's director. The index may be picking up end-of-the-war euphoria, rather than actual consumer confidence.
 
Is Recovery a Sure Thing?
 
Was it the beginning of an upward trend, or a dead cat's bounce? That's what economists wondered when the leading indicators index registered a 1.1 percent increase for February, the first increase since June. The index includes stock prices, consumer confidence, building permits, and money supply. "It was a sizable increase. It suggests a recovery in 1991," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company. With sharp increases in new and existing homes sales, some ask whether the recession is ending. "It will probably happen sometime between the end of spring and Labor Day. The index leads the economy by three to seven months." Mr. Sinai said. What still eludes economists is how strong the recovery will be. "That, the numbers do not show."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
A Better Way to Track Your Assets

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
A leading Japanese insurance company and one of America's foremost pension consulting firms last week unveiled a new computerized asset-allocation model that is many times more powerful and responsive than the ones currently in use on Wall Street. The development could reshape the way in which trillions of dollars of financial assets are managed.
The new financial software system was designed for the Yasuda Fire and Marine Company, the second-largest property and casualty insurer in Japan, by the Frank Russell Company in Tacoma, Wash. 
 Instead of the opaque jargon that usually attends such feats, this occasion was marked by unabashed superlatives. The Yasuda-Russell model "is the largest known asset-allocation model in existence for a major corporation," said William T. Ziemba, a finance professor at the University of British Columbia and a consultant to the project. "It uses the latest academic theory and fully considers the constraints and uncertainties of the company to achieve their long-run goals."
The reason that asset allocation is so important can be found in the oldest, and still the soundest, rule on Wall Street: "Don't put all your eggs in one basket." Simple as that sounds, figuring out the optimal number of eggs to put in each of the available baskets -- stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, commodities, baseball cards -- is extremely difficult.
The first breakthrough came with the pioneering work done three decades ago by Harry M. Markowitz, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his efforts last fall. His theories laid the groundwork for the subsequent development of various computer models that money-managers use today to calculate the best mixture of assets for the unfolding economic environment.
Anything that could dramatically alter the way giant investors make their egg-sorting decisions is big news for money managers, for investors and for the markets. And that news broke quietly in Japan as Yasuda introduced the remarkable results of its ambitious three-year campaign to find a better way to manage its assets.
Current allocation models can test for about a dozen different economic variables, at most. The new Yasuda-Russell model can test for thousands of business, economic and regulatory variables, so that each user can create a computer microcosm that closely reflects its own unique environment and goals. Yasuda is betting this will make its investment decisions more accurate and, thus, more profitable.
Andrew Turner, senior vice president and director of research at Russell, sees the new model as a vast improvement over today's tools. "The standard framework, while simple to use, allows for only a crude approximation of the real economic problems," Mr. Turner said. The Yasuda-Russell version, by contrast, creates a world within the computer that is much more finely textured.
In addition, while current models can test the performance of a particular mix of assets through a single period of time -- one quarter or one year into the future, for example -- the new one is a "multiperiod" model. That means it can calculate performance over the next year and over the next five years, seeking a blend that is ideal for both time spans. And all this is accomplished in a few hours on the RS-6000 work station made by International Business Machines.
Yasuro Ohtani, the deputy manager of financial planning for Yasuda Kasai in Tokyo, said in a telephone interview that his company commissioned the new model nearly three years ago because it was dissatisfied with the limitations of what he called "Harry Markowitz-type models." Those models, for example, cannot allow for complicated regulatory constraints imposed by the Ministry of Finance. Nor can they cope with illiquid assets, like loans and real estate, in the company's $24 billion portfolio.
"Our investment activities are very complicated," Mr. Ohtani said, "so we felt we should make a more advanced model."
Mr. Turner, who headed the design team, stopped short of declaring current asset-allocation models obsolete. "Harry Markowitz is a tremendously brilliant man, and his work was a wonderful insight at the time," he said. "But we've reached a point, both in optimization theory and in our ability to compute solutions, where we no longer need to restrict ourselves to those simple and elegant solutions. We can say, 'I'm going to make this really messy,' and throw in all the real-world dirt that really exists and then slog through it to a solution."
The advent of this new tool comes as asset allocation strategies in general are in poor repute on Wall Street. The "tactical asset allocators," those money-managers who rely exclusively on computer modeling to guide their investments, have not performed well in the past year and a half. Some allocators have become frustrated and ignored their model's advice in favor of more intuitive decisions; others have stood firm and lost clients.
Mr. Turner suggested that the blame may lie more with the tools than with the theory. While many money-managers may not need a model as richly detailed as the Yasuda-Russell version, he predicted that some features of the new model could probably be applied to make less sophisticated models more accurate and effective.
George F. Russell Jr., chairman of the Frank Russell Company, has observed the investment scene for decades. He believes widespread use of the new model, which can be tailored to reflect the goals of each institution that uses it, could have a sweeping effect on the way the market behaves.
"Now we're using yesterday's technology; this is tomorrow's technology," Mr. Russell said. "Organizations today have to use a very limited scale of choices; this allows them a very broad choice scale. So we'll have a lot more diversity than we have now -- and that means the market becomes more free, which ought to excite all of us."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Dollar's Gains Upset the Exchanges

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Oh, how the dollar has hurt Americans with investments abroad this year. And with so little warning.
The gains they realized in Europe, as markets rallied after the Persian Gulf victory, were cut in half or even more by the end of the first quarter, according to the Financial Times index of world markets. But until seven weeks ago they hadn't a worry about losing money when converting profits into dollars. 
 The dollar hit its post-World War II lows against the German mark and Swiss franc and its 1991 lows against other major currencies in mid-February. But it has since jumped 17.3 percent against the mark, 15.9 percent again the lira, 16.6 percent against the French franc and 14.6 percent against the British pound.
The gains of American investors are now being gobbled up by unfavorable exchange rates. The 28.5 percent gain in the Swedish market is cut to 17.2 percent when profits are converted into dollars. In Spain, the 26.5 percent rise is reduced to 14.2 percent. In Italy, the 12.6 percent rise is reduced to 0.66 percent. In Britain, the 15.4 percent jump is slashed to 4.6 percent, while in Germany, the 7.7 percent spurt falls to a 5.2 percent loss.
Despite the dollar's move, some investment managers are not making major changes in their portfolios. Some of them had already expected the dollar to rise moderately this year -- even to its current levels -- but just not this quickly.
And while there will be a loss on exchange when profits are brought back home, the higher dollar will be a benefit for many European companies that either export to the United states or have large operations here. The stronger dollar will make European exports more competitive here and the dollar earnings in the United States will grow when translated back into marks, pounds, francs, lire and guilders.
"What we have been doing is placing emphasis on companies that are more export- oriented," said Sander Cseh of Cseh International in Philadelphia. For example, he likes Hunter Douglas of the Netherlands, a manufacturer of blinds and other window coverings with major business in the United States. But he has not "bet the ranch" on these prospects because he is not sure of how high and how long the dollar will rally.
Some forecasters predict that it will rise to 1.80 against the mark by the end of the year, 6 percent above where it is now. Some say it will drift even higher.
Nicholas Sargen, a director of international bond trading at Salomon Brothers in New York, thinks the dollar might peak at 1.80 marks, but is likely to fall below that level before the end of the year. He is not expecting a higher rise in part because of the impact of capital flows. For the dollar to continue to rise this year, he says, a significant amount of foreign capital would have to flow into the United States. He does not anticipate that happening.
Traditionally, interest rates have been a key determinant of exchange rates. A country with higher interest rates than another usually has a stronger currency, other factors being equal, because the higher return attracts investors.
But the movement of capital from country to country has become a much bigger factor,and can often overwhelm the interest rate factor.
New data for the fourth quarter of 1990, Mr. Sargen said, showed that there was a net inflow of foreign capital into Germany of $18.7 billion. This surge, he said, helps explain the jump in the value of the mark near the end of the year, when it reached new highs against the dollar. The $18.7 billion inflow was even greater than the $16.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 1989, when money was flowing to Germany on the euphoric wave from the fall of the Berlin Wall and the opening of Eastern Europe.
Although he does not yet have the data, Mr. Sargen now suspects that the flow of capital, mostly into German bonds, continued in the first part of this year, which helped bring the mark to its post-World War II record high against the dollar in mid-February.
But he said those investors have been sent scurrying by the renewed focus on German political and economic problems since the end of the Persian Gulf war and the diminished fears that there would be a devaluation in the European Monetary System. That capital drain helped bring down the mark -- and push the dollar up -- quicky, adding to the momentum from the interest rate changes also now expected to favor the United States.
The impact of capital flows to the United States can also explain the fall of the dollar in 1990. The total flow of capital shifted to a net outflow of $27 billion, compared with a net inflow of $88 billion in 1989.
Mr. Sargen does expect there to be a reversal in 1991. But he does not think the United States bond market will be attractive enough to bring back the flows of capital that marked 1988 and 1989. "My story," he said, "is that the pendulum of captial flows that hurt the dollar last year will start to shift back. But there is no way we will get back to the good old days of the late 1980's."

HEADLINE: Advertising's Antic Upstarts

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
A lunchtime crowd of some 40 Italian silk ties and 40 short black skirts was munching on tortellini at the Art Directors Club in New York one recent afternoon when the least fashionable of their number, a lanky Texan in a blue blazer, gray slacks and white shirt, shuffled up to the microphone and held them rapt by condemning their chosen profession, advertising.
The problem with advertising, said Gary Goldsmith, is not the deep recession that is reducing ad spending and forcing copywriters into the street. The real problem, said the 36-year-old chairman and creative director of the Goldsmith/Jeffrey agency, is the 13,000 commercials forced on the average American television viewer each year -- most of them stultifyingly boring. 
 He played a videotape reel of his favorite spots. Perhaps predictably, several were from Goldsmith/Jeffrey, including an emotional advertisement for El Al Airlines that featured old newsreel footage of Israel's pioneer settlers and a commercial for Everlast sportswear that showed only a ticking stopwatch.
A group of young advertising students looked on adoringly. "Not to lose that spark -- these kinds of agencies will give you that opportunity," said Joanna L. Davanzo, a 20-year-old junior at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
Which agencies? she was asked. She and her friends thought a moment, and then spewed forth the names: Goldsmith/Jeffrey Inc.; Deutsch Inc.; Omon, New York; Kirshenbaum & Bond, and Buckley DeCerchio Cavalier Inc.
To the general public, their names are unknown. But to young copywriters and art directors, and to a small but growing list of marketers who believe only risky advertising will pierce consumers' torpor, these off-off Madison Avenue agencies are contemporary advertising's hottest shops.
 
Bred on Television
 Their leaders share many traits, notably an antic youthfulness. They are the first generation of agency founders bred entirely on television. But in their commitment to their craft and their fervent belief in themselves and their work, they represent the advertising industry's longstanding ability to renew itself even in the darkest times.
And gloom indeed pervades Madison Avenue. With the advertising slump in its third year, some believe the financial pressure on agencies and clients has led to a plethora of safe but lackluster ads. Last week, for the first time, Advertising Age magazine even declined to name an agency of the year, citing a lack of enthusiasm for any one shop.
But out on the street, the hot shops are generating enthusiasm, certainly among young "creatives" -- the industry's copywriters and art directors -- who consider them colorful intruders in the land of the bland. While their work has been criticized as over indulgent, even sophomoric, by advertising traditionalists, their insouciance and innate savviness about the media are already being echoed in the ads produced by some larger and older agencies. Wacky humor is in, say the upstarts, and boring product descriptions are out. Dare to be offensive, they declare, or risk losing your viewers and readers.
The five agencies, all in New York, repeatedly turn up as the hippest shops in informal surveys of client consultants, executive recruiters and industry creatives. They are to the early 1990's what agencies like Chiat/Day/ Mojo and Hal Riney & Partners were to the 80's -- ingenues on the verge of stardom.
For decades, upstart agencies have tried to establish themselves by their creative product, hoping against hope that one tiny client might turn into a national marketing behemoth and take the agency up the mountain with it. Leo Burnett, after all, was little more than a copywriter who favored big black pencils and owned a small Chicago agency until he created the Marlboro Man in 1954. Today, the Leo Burnett Company is the world's 14th-largest agency.
"If you look at advertising history, most of the shops that are the big guys today started up as small shops in the 40's and 50's, where the owners of the agency were also the business strategists and the copywriters," said David E. R. Dangoor, the head of marketing at Philip Morris U.S.A., makers of Marlboro. "That gave birth to new ideas and a lot of gutsy marketing moves."
There is no reason that history should not repeat itself, added Mr. Dangoor, who has retained Omon to do advertising for his company. "Everybody is so fed up with advertising," he said. "Is there a new way to advertise? These small agencies can be a source of stimulation for us to find out."
 
Some Distinctions
 In the style of their lives and work, today's hot shops differ in ways large and subtle.
The Deutsch agency, at 105 employees and $100 million in annual billings the largest of the group, is not a new shop at all, but a 22-year-old agency consciously reformulated by its second-generation management as an avatar of hip advertising. Its television commercials for the Ikea furniture stores, with their candid interviews with conventional salespeople, reek of David Letterman's sharp sarcasm. But the agency also has by far the largest media-buying and research departments of any shop on the hot list, and unlike the other agencies, most of whose work is in print advertising, some three-quarters of Deutsch's billings derive from television advertising.
Omon, by contrast, the New York branch of a small Australian agency, is the smallest and newest shop among the group. Its 14 employees toil in a Soho loft so tiny there's barely room for serifs on the type in its print ads. But Omon, which was established here in 1989, shook the ad industry quickly, first by bringing in as its president Joanne M. Davis, a respected rainmaker from the large Wells, Rich, Greene agency, and then by landing business from two enormous and prestigious clients: Philip Morris and Toyota, the latter of which spurned its giant agency of record, Saatchi & Saatchi, for the new kid.
Kirshenbaum & Bond, like the old Mad magazine, offers humor in a jugular vein, having exploited Dan Quayle and Imelda Marcos in its ads for Kenneth Cole shoes. At times, the advertising done by the three-and-a-half-year-old agency has seemed calculated to offend, as in its print campaign for Saint Laurie, a discount clothing store in New York, that featured a handsome male model staring off into space, over the headline, "Dress British. Think Yiddish."
Jonathan Bond, the boyish, 33-year-old co-founder, says such controversial advertising employs a "multiplier effect" on behalf of clients, generating talk and publicity that can be more valuable and vastly less expensive than conventional advertising. Serious clients have bought the premise; in the past few months, Schieffelin & Somerset has given Kirshenbaum responsibility for its Hennessy cognac and Moet & Chandon champagne advertising, the Savin Corporation has brought over its office copier account and Chase Manhattan Bank has turned to the agency to help it market credit cards to college students, bringing the agency's billings to $45 million.
Goldsmith/Jeffrey is capable of work so spare one is tempted to call it anti-advertising. Its television ads for the Nynex Business-to-Business Yellow Pages rarely show anything more than the telephone book against a stark white background. Such work has given the agency a reputation as the most stylish and marketing-savvy of the new shops, and has contributed to its growth to $30 million in billings after only four years.
 
Pizza and Bon Jovi
 Finally, there is Buckley DeCerchio Cavalier, which, in attitude as well as advertising, seems more freewheeling than its hot-list competitors. It goes for the blunt, comic headline. "Take a job where the only person you have to listen to is Bon Jovi," it says in a delivery-driver recruitment ad for the Godfather's Pizza chain.
Indeed, in virtually everything they do, the agency's leaders go for blunt comedy. "Look," said Thomas L. DeCerchio, the copy writing partner, as he dragged a visitor to the large windows of the Soho loft his agency shares with an architecture firm and pointed west. "We're just a Lee Harvey Oswald shot from Kirshenbaum & Bond."
But Buckley, which was founded in 1988, is no joke to the several prestigious clients it has dragged in, among them Yugo automobiles, Discover magazine and Snapple soft drinks. Winning Snapple, which has grown from a $1 million to a $5 million account in only one year, convinced the agency's principals to move into their current office space, said Jane Cavalier, the agency's president. Until then, they had worked out of Mr. DeCerchio's studio apartment.
Still, for all their differences, these agencies are fundamentally the same. First and foremost, they are bucking the worst advertising recession in 20 years.
Equally important, they are young, in spirit as well as in years. Asked why they went into advertising, both Ms. Cavalier, who is 30 years old, and Paul Bernasconi, Omon's 25-year-old co-creative director, gave the same immediate answer: "Bewitched," the 1960's television show whose co-protagonist, Darrin Stevens, was a befuddled ad executive married to a sorceress.
Perhaps most significantly, in an industry that is depressed both economically and emotionally, these are the agencies at which young people want to work. At most ad agencies today, job applications are as scarce as job openings, so fearful are people of leaving their nests in tough times. One mid-level executive at the large Ayer agency said that he used to receive 200 resumes and portfolios a year. In recent months, only three have crossed his desk.
But the new hot shops are awash with portfolios, sleek and black and filled with ads done for more established agencies, from young job seekers. Frank Todaro, a 27-year-old art director, left a secure position at Scali, McCabe, Sloves, where he was one of the youngest vice presidents in its history, to become creative director at Buckley DeCerchio Cavalier. "I saw what everybody else did -- that the places that had once been terrific were flattening out," he said. "And I also saw that places like this and Goldsmith were the new Scalis."
 
No Guarantees
 Of course, there are no guarantees that any one of the five will survive, let alone prosper. Advertising history is filled with cautionary tales. Just two years ago, Doyle Graf Raj, a highly regarded agency that did memorable print ads for Steuben glass and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, died, overburdened with expenses.
So too, veterans of advertising's "creative revolution" of the 60's find much of the work from contemporary agencies to be forced.
"Today, the fun seems to be manufactured somewhat," said Frank DiGiacomo, who worked as a copywriter at one of the more manic 60's agencies, Della Femina, Travisano & Partners, and who now produces commercials. "It's, 'Oh, look at us, aren't we wild and crazy,' or 'Our work is irreverent, bordering on distasteful.' It's shock advertising, and that's not how I was brought up in this business."
Donny Deutsch, the 33-year-old creative director and current guiding spirit of the Deutsch agency, was criticized for Pontiac car advertising that some deemed racist because it invoked fears about Japanese purchases of American companies. Mr. Deutsch, whose father, David, founded the agency, shrugged off the complaints: "Anytime you do work on the edge, that's going to happen."
The trade-off for the risk of criticism, he and others said, is the ability to keep creative staffs happy by allowing them the opportunity to do "great work," an industry euphemism for ads that get noticed.
"What drives any creative talent is someone recognizing the work they're doing," said Malcolm D. MacDougall, who wrote "Come to think of it, I'll have a Heineken" and other legendary slogans while at larger agencies, and who now runs a small creative consultancy. "Nobody is satisfied doing a talking head about aspirin. That's the way it has always been and that's the way it's always going to be."
Hank Perlman, a 24-year-old writer who left Deutsch for Buckley, underscored the point when he was asked why he became a copywriter. "It's a selfish thing," he said. "I wanted to say, 'I did this. Isn't it funny?' "
Recognizable advertising has other benefits, of course. It can brand an agency's identity into the minds of potential clients, peers in the business and advertising trade publications, generating a cycle of talk that often translates into new business. "So much American advertising is a wasteland," said Mr. Bernasconi of Omon. "But the ads are our product. As in any manufacturing business, if your product is substandard, you won't get the business."
 
Can They Grow?
 Even if they succeed at reeling in and satisfying larger marketers, one threatening question still hangs over advertising's hot shops: Can the small brands they advertise turn into multimillion-dollar advertisers that will stoke their prosperity, the way Marlboro did for Leo Burnett?
Mr. Dangoor of Philip Morris conceded the prospects are a bit dimmer than in the past, but maintained that in any industry, "you never know when the dynamics will change again" and lead to explosive growth in unexpected product categories.
Indeed, all five hot shops have had surprises that indicate that growth is still possible. Goldsmith/Jeffrey's Everlast campaign, for example, attracted the attention of Riddell, the nation's major manufacturer of football helmets. Riddell then did a deal with USA Classic, Everlast's licensor, to market branded active wear to the general public. Goldsmith, of course, got the account.
Like their professional forebears, the David Ogilvys and Bill Bernbachs who believed as fervently in their own destiny as they did in the power of advertising, the young executives running the new hot agencies refuse even to entertain the notion that they might not, someday, be giants.
"People say to me all the time, 'What a chance you guys are taking, it's so risky,' " said Gary Goldsmith. "I always say the alternative is riskier -- sitting in a big agency for 20 years, producing work you don't like, and turning around and finding out it didn't count for anything."
 
 
HAVENS FOR 'EDGY' CLIENTS
 To do good work -- Donnie Deutsch of the Deutsch agency calls it "edgy advertising" -- means finding clients who will take risks. For small agencies trying to build a reputation, this usually means retailers and other small companies that are not overburdened with bureaucracies, but run tightly by their founders or chief executives. Other types of clients are often not welcome.
"When you speak to the DeCerchios and Goldsmiths, people come to them and they will turn business away," said Sandy Berger, a top agency recruiter.
They will even fire clients. Gary Goldsmith of Goldsmith/Jeffrey, for example, proudly recalls that the Mettler Instrument Corporation, a Swiss manufacturer of weighing and balancing equipment, was "the first one we blew out the door." The problem began when Mettler hired a design consultant who decided to standardize the look of the company's communications, and demanded, among other things, that all type be in alternating blue and green letters.
"Gary and I felt there was no way we could keep the business and stay within our mission," said Bob Jeffrey, 37, the agency's president.
Last year, Hans Gut, Mettler's president, said in an interview that the company had to follow specific design guidelines. But he said of Goldsmith/ Jeffrey, "We admire them. They didn't want to compromise."
Because small, entrepreneurial clients are often equally quick to fire their agencies when business turns sour, all five of the hot shops have made conscious attempts to find larger, and more stable, national marketers willing to take a chance on "edgy" campaigns.
Even with right-thinking clients, agency life is not easy.
"There's a myth that when you have a small agency and small clients you go into work every day, put a great idea down on paper, show it to the client, they jump up and down and say, 'That's it!' and write a check," Mr. Goldsmith said recently in a talk at the Art Directors Club in New York. "Any time you present a great idea, there's initial resistance. You have to fight and back up your work with logic to sell it."

 
BAD TIMES? NOT FOR BABIES
 After decades of double-digit growth, much of it fueled by wild increases in the cost of advertising time and space, ad spending is expected to grow only 4.5 percent this year, less than the rate of inflation, according to Robert Coen, director of forecasting at McCann-Erickson.
Some of the largest national advertisers, like Eastern Airlines, have gone out of business; others, like Chrysler and General Motors, are reportedly slashing spending, and still others, like Pepsi-Cola, are expected only to maintain spending at 1990 levels.
As a result, America's largest ad agencies, among them Backer Spielvogel Bates, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Young & Rubicam, have let go dozens of employees each.
Advertising's new hot shops "are almost the only ones that are growing right now," says Leslie Winthrop, president of the Advertising Agency Register, a consulting firm that helps marketers find ad agencies.
"Omon got up to $19 million in billings in only a few months," Ms. Winthrop added. "Kirshenbaum & Bond added $15 million in billings in December and January. At Buckley DeCerchio Cavalier, they're babies, but they're still hovering at $20 million."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Unease About Rate Parity and the New Dollar

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
You can listen to what Wall Street says -- or you can watch what it does.
The talk on the Street these days is that investors are going to keep buying stocks because they are focusing on the prosperous post-recession paradise that will eventually arrive, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board's stimulative efforts. Thus, the Dow has continued its climb, closing the pre-holiday week on Thursday at 2,913.86, about 55 points higher than the prior week's close. 
 That's what Wall Street is saying. But how does the market behave when International Business Machines or Reynolds Metals or Halliburton reports disappointing earnings in the here and now? Panic stations, everyone.
Well, brace yourself. The surprises may have just begun.
As companies are reporting their profits for 1990, they also are closing the books on the first quarter of fiscal 1991 -- a period whose assorted plagues approached Biblical severity. War, swift and astonishingly destructive. Oily smoke polluting the desert skies. A stubborn drought in the Western United States. Upheaval in the Soviet Union. Business failures, here and abroad.
But the most recent affliction is easy to overlook because it is such a boon for tourists planning their summer getaway: the revivified dollar. When the dollar soars, companies that do a lot of business abroad feel the pinch. Widgets sold for marks, francs or yen translate into fewer dollars on the bottom line when the sales slips are sent home. Dollar-based investments look more dear to overseas investors. And exports are more expensive for foreign buyers.
Do earnings really matter? Consider the issue of interest rate parity, a classic measurement of the stock market's relative value.
It's an arcane little formula: You divide the price-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500 by the inverse of the yield on triple-A corporate bonds, an alternative investment.
In the past, when the resulting percentage has exceeded 15, the market has later taken a sharp tumble, according to Richard Pucci, of the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, published by Lynch, Jones & Ryan Inc., a New York-based brokerage firm. (It exceeded 40 percent in June 1987, before the October crash.)
These days? It's more than 20 percent, as of mid-March. "This is dangerous territory," said Mr. Pucci.
Of course, the equilibrium could be restored if bond yields fell further, which might happen if inflation stays low enough and the Fed is so inclined. Or earnings could climb, which is what Wall Street is predicting. But many analysts expect future gains to be led by certain sectors, including consumer durable goods and basic industries, where credit quality is sharply deteriorating, as measured by Lynch, Jones' bond-market monitoring service. If those sectors disappoint the Street in the months ahead, investors might remember that the third way equilibrium could be restored in the interest rate parity equation is for stock prices to decline.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Rebound in Financial Services

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The stock market has begun the year with a bang, with the average stock fund gaining 12.8 percent. Overall, the market has been driven by the small-company group, which had risen 21.2 percent through March 21, according to Lipper Analytical Services of Summit, N.J.
Among specialty funds, those in health and biotechnology (up 25.9 percent) and in science and technology (up 22 percent) have kept their place as leaders. But the quarter has held a real surprise: the financial services funds-- which invest mainly in banks, savings and loans, brokerages, money managers and insurance companies -- have gained 19.4 percent, trailing the leaders by only a small margin. 
 This contrasts sharply with last year's performance, when the nine funds in the financial services group dropped an average of 14.9 percent, trailing the average stock fund by more than seven percentage points. "It's a terrific turnaround," said Stephen A. Schoepke, a Lipper analyst.
The group is largely driven by the bank stocks, which were pounded unmercifully at the end of last year. Then the Federal Reserve began easing interest rates, and market analysts' views of the stocks shifted radically. "The bank stocks went from certain death to possible survival," causing share prices to surge, said David Ellison, manager of the $9.6 million Fidelity Select Savings and Loan, the quarter's leader, which rose 26 percent.
The managers say changes in the financial services industry are beginning to pay off. But they caution that the road to health will be long and bumpy. Much of the first-quarter jump came from a "shift in psychology," said Karen L. Finkel, who manages the $42 million Paine Webber Classic Regional Financial Fund. "But you can't improve asset quality and work out bad loans overnight."
 The group's current bad reputation obscures some good stocks, the managers say. And share prices have dropped so low that investors can pick up some bargains.
Mr. Ellison, who also manages the $30.6 million Fidelity Select Financial Services Fund, says the banking industry offers some "rare opportunities." He points to NS Bancorp of Chicago, a recent public offering at $8 that he expects to earn $2 a share this year. He says the bank has a solid loan portfolio and is well capitalized. Another of his picks is Standard Federal Bank in Troy, Mich.
On the other hand, Philip Dubuque, manager of the $6 million Financial Strategic Financial Services Fund in Denver, has taken profits from his bank stocks in the last few weeks and winnowed his bank holdings from more than half of the fund to roughly 20 percent.
In the process, he has built the brokerage portion from 2 percent in December to about 25 percent today. "Volume on the New York Stock Exchange is running 20 percent higher than last year, and when business expenses are down, heavy trading translates into nearly pure profit," he said. Mr. Dubuque notes that some brokerages have reduced their payrolls by as much as 30 percent since the precrash peak in 1987, and overhead has fallen dramatically. Among brokers with strong retail businesses, he likes Paine Webber, Merrill Lynch and A. G. Edwards, the St. Louis-based regional brokerage.
Mr. Dubuque has also bought shares of Countrywide Credit Industries, a mortgage broker based in Pasadena, Calif. The company is positioned to benefit as consumer confidence rises and the mortgage market begins to recover, he says.
Ms. Finkel at Paine Webber has about three-quarters of her fund in regional banks and thrift institutions. She says these concerns are helped by the consolidation among banks and regulatory measures that let banks expand geographically. Her favorite is Keycorp of Albany, which does business in New York, in Maine and in six states in the Northwest. She points out that the company works mainly with small borrowers and depositors, lessening the risk of a large default.
Scott Offen, who manages the $6.8 million Fidelity Select Brokerage Fund, says many brokerage firms have upgraded their internal financial controls and brought fixed expenses under control in recent years, positioning them perfectly for the current stock market rally. The firms' restructuring means the stocks "won't lose money in bad markets and can make tremendous amounts in good markets," he said. His largest holding is Merrill Lynch. He also likes Primerica, the New York City-based financial services company that owns Smith Barney; Commercial Credit, a consumer finance company, and A. L. Williams, a life insurance company.
James K. Schmidt, who manages the $47 million Freedom Regional Bank Fund in Boston, invests mainly in small to mid-size regional banks, mostly in the Midwest. He says that stock prices are cheap there and that the banks are largely untouched by problem real estate loans like those afflicting Northeast banks. Two of his favorites are the Mercantile Bancorporation in St. Louis and the First of America Bank Corporation, based in Kalamazoo, Mich.
Ten percent of the fund is invested in savings and loan associations. One favorite is Pioneer Federal Bancorp in Honolulu, whose problem loans Mr. Schmidt says represent less than 1 percent of its total.

HEADLINE: All About/Making Recycling Pay;
In Solid Waste, It's the Breakdown That Counts

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: KING OF PRUSSIA, Penn.

 BODY:
The first thing everyone needs to know about recycling, said Charles F. Oyler, is the difference between trash and recyclable materials. Mr. Oyler is the recyling manager at the big materials recovery center in suburban Philadelphia. The center is operated by Browning-Ferris Inc.
A material recovery facility is a key element in the recycling chain. Materials that have been discarded are brought in to be separated, decontaminated and compressed into bales for shipment to mills that can make them into new products. 
 The factory processes about 125 tons a day of paper and cardboard, steel and aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles. All have been separated from outgoing solid waste to preserve their value. "There is no practical way to process completely mixed materials," Mr. Oyler said. "Once something is mixed with trash, it becomes trash."
Homeowners are asked to place their newspapers and glass, aluminum, steel and plastic in a container separate from other trash. Similarly, offices participating in the state-mandated recycling program are asked to collect high-grade papers and other recyclables away from other wastes. On collection day, the trash goes to a landfill; the recyclables go to Browning-Ferris.
According to William D. Ruckelshaus, the chairman of Browning-Ferris, one of the largest trash haulers in the country, solid-waste recycling is now at a crucial point in terms of its long-term viability. The public enthusiastically supports the concept at the moment, and that support is reflected in laws intended to prod industries to use more recycled materials.
That increase in demand is prompting an increase in collections and the development of processing plants like the one in King of Prussia. "If the infrastructure gets put into place, with collection systems, processing centers and end-user markets, then it will not matter if the current 'feel good' attitude subsides," Mr. Ruckelshaus said. "Economics will take over and the system will be self-sustaining."

 
 
The Metal Sideshow
Efficient Aluminum, Tin-Tainted Steel
 One self-sustaining part of the recycling business is aluminum. Since remelting aluminum takes only 5 percent of the electric power to extract metal from bauxite ore, aluminum companies have been recycling for more than 20 years.
Aluminum is the most valuable material in the solid waste stream. A ton of crushed, baled cans commands $1,000 to $1,100 from mills. In contrast, similar loads of old cardboard boxes are worth $25 to $90, according to figures compiled by Recycling Times, a publication of the National Solid Waste Management Association. Glass, separated by color, is valued at from $40 to $60 a ton.
According to the Aluminum Association, a trade group, 54.9 billion aluminum cans totalling 9.65 million tons were recycled in this country last year. That represented a recycling rate of 63.6 percent, the group said, up from 60.8 percent in 1989.
Steel has been recycled for generations. Indeed, the entire steel mini-mill industry is based on scrap, largely recovered from old cars and appliances.
But steel cans used to package food products have a thin coating of tin on the inside to prevent the formation of rust, and the tin was viewed as a contaminant because it caused blemishes on the surface of sheet steel. The drive to reduce solid waste in landfills has increased steel-can recycling.
The amount of tin on cans has declined from about 20 pounds per ton of steel 20 years ago to 4 1/2 to 5 pounds today, said William Heenan of the Steel Can Recycling Institute, another trade group. As a result, it can be added directly to steel furnaces in limited amounts without causing problems. He said steel-can recycling has risen from 5 billion cans in 1988 to an estimated 9 billion last year. It is now priced at $40 to $70 a ton, depending on location.

 
 
The Main Attraction
Paper's Many Manifestations
 All of these materials are sideshows, though, to paper and paperboard products. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, paper-based products, which include cardboard boxes, newspapers, computer printouts and tissue products, constitute the largest single element of solid waste -- about 40 percent.
Clean paper products can be recycled, within limits. Cardboard boxes can become new boxes, while some mixed grades of paper, including brown shopping bags, can be reformed as the fluted middle layer inside cardboard. Old newspapers can be made into new newsprint and the paperboard used for boxes of dry cereal.
One of the problems with the early recycling programs of the late 1980's was a glut of old newspapers that depressed the price to the point where communities had to pay to have them hauled away. To an extent, the glut continues; old newspapers, magazines and brown bags can cost $25 a ton to dispose of on the East Coast.
But those economics can be changed by adding value. "We upgraded our news by pulling out the bags and the slick magazines," Mr. Oyler said. "We never had to pay to move it."
Nevertheless, Browning-Ferris officials say that, with the exception of aluminum, the prices now being paid for recycled materials would not pay the costs of collection and processing. But when the savings of $70 a ton in landfilling fees that do not have to be paid are added to the equation, it becomes a viable business. Mr. Ruckelshaus observed that recycling may not make economic sense in states like Texas, where disposal fees are as low as $4 a ton.

 
 
A Picky Process
The Importance of Quality Garbage
 Upgrading the quality of materials coming into the garbage recycling plant involves a combination of machine separation and handpicking. Most of the people doing the handpicking are paid slightly above the minimum wage. Incoming containers are dumped on a conveyor which passes under a rotating magnet that pulls out all the steel cans. The rest of the material drops onto a vibrating screen that has slots three-quarters of an inch wide, to remove small pieces of broken glass.
The material is then fed into an air blower that separates the lighter aluminum and plastic from the remaining glass. The aluminum cans are flattened and blown by air into a truck while the plastic bottles are collected for later baling.
The glass containers drop onto another conveyor where workers separate them by color. Clear glass is generally the most valuable while green, which is used mostly in beer bottles, varies the most widely in price. It is now worth as little as $10 a ton in the northeastern states but fetches as much as $60 on the West Coast.
The quality of incoming material is important, and Browning-Ferris officials say they try to conduct an education campaign before starting curbside or commercial collection programs. Things like telephone books, gummed labels and air freight envelopes have no place in containers intended to collect office papers.
"We take two pictures of loads as they come in and we give one to the driver," Mr. Oyler said. If a shipment is contaminated, it is accepted the first time, but someone from the company warns the shipper. "The second time we charge them for disposal."

 
 
AN INDUSTRY TRIES TO IMPROVE ITS RECORD ON PLASTIC
 Plastic can be recycled as easily as most materials. It can be collected, washed, chopped and reformed under heat and pressure into new products.
But unlike aluminum cans, plastic containers are made from a variety of different resins which often do not perform well when mixed together. And because they are light and take up a lot of space, they are expensive to collect and process for recycling.
A bale of steel cans, for example, weighs about 3,000 pounds. A similar bale of paper weights about 1,800 pounds, but a bale of plastic bottles, which take up the same amount of room on a truck, weighs just 800 pounds, according to officials at Browning-Ferris Inc.
Until recently, very little plastic was recycled. According to the Environmental Protection Agency only about one-tenth of 1 percent of all plastics produced -- mostly large soda bottles -- was recycled in 1986.
But as landfill space became scarce and expensive and legislation to ban or tax materials not being recycled appeared at the state and local level, the plastics industry tried to jump start a recycling system. The recycling rate improved to 1.1 percent in 1988, according to E.P.A. figures.
Last week in Washington, at a meeting of Council for Solid Waste Solutions, an industry group, leaders of the platic-producing and -using companies said they would attempt to force the pace of plastics recycling by providing $20 million a year in assistance to communities interested in recycling.
They said the action was in response to consumer attitudes toward plastic packaging. "Even though consumers like to use plastic packaging, they hate to throw it away," said John E. Pepper, the president of the Procter & Gamble Company. "They feel guilty because they know that plastics are a contributor to our solid waste problem."
The group said the program's goal was to have 25 percent of the plastic bottles and containers sold each year -- or about 18 billion -- in recycling programs by 1995. The plastics industry will invest in the 15 to 20 reprocessing plants needed to reach this level.
Currently, according to the industry group, about 1,500 communities, including about 10 percent of the nation's population, have recycling programs in which homeowners separate recyclable materials from ordinary trash. Only about 500 now include plastic.
The industry leaders said plastic collection programs would be needed in 4,000 communities to reach the 25 percent level. They said the number of recycling programs would have to double each year from now until 1995 to meet the goal.
Although there are hundreds of different types of plastic, two of them, high density polyethylene used in milk bottles) and polyethylene terephthalate (used in large soda bottles), account for more than 80 percent of the plastic used in consumer products. Most existing recycling programs have focused on these materials.

The Failures of A.T.&T. Strategies

BYLINE: By A. MICHAEL NOLL; A. Michael Noll, formerly a marketing executive at A.T.&T., is on sabbatical from the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Southern California, where he is a professor.

 BODY:
The stable and conservative American Telephone and Telegraph Company of old has become today's newest corporate raider. Its attempt to acquire the NCR Corporation raises questions about where it is going. The company believes that the NCR acquisition is consistent with its strategy in computer networking. Is it? Should we trust A.T.& T.'s management when it comes to computers, strategy and vision?
The biggest event in A.T.& T.'s history was the divestiture of the local Bell telephone companies. Its thinking in accepting divestiture, rather than deciding to continue legal battles against it, was that the company would then be free to enter information-age businesses, such as computers, and capitalize on the research and development strengths of Bell Labs. The local phone companies were viewed then as financial drains. 
 How has this strategy worked? Not well. A.T.& T.'s computer business has failed to achieve significant market penetrations, perhaps indicating that management does not understand the computer business. The promise of many new high-tech businesses being developed from the research of Bell Labs was an illusion. The research cupboard was mostly bare in terms of new businesses and ventures, and business-development knowledge was lacking.
Further, the divestiture was a financial mistake. Last year, the seven regional holding companies had a combined net income of $8.5 billion; A.T.& T's net income was $2.7 billion. A.T.& T. would be more profitable today if it had kept the Bell companies and instead divested its manufacturing unit, Western Electric, and its long-distance division, Long Lines.
The profits from A.T.& T.'s successful network business are being milked to keep the unprofitable business afloat. Based on information from A.T.& T. annual reports and data submitted by the company to the Federal Communications Commission, I estimate that current yearly pretax losses from the sale of products could be as little as $1.5 billion or as much as $5 billion, depending on how research and development and administrative costs are allocated. A.T.& T.'s total revenue from the sale of products is about $12 billion. The product business seems to suffer from huge costs and keen competition.
Shareholders must ask whether management's vision of A.T.& T. as a force in the computer business is realistic, and whether buying NCR makes any sense. Service -- not products -- is where most companies want to be now. Even the International Business Machines Corporation is searching for a service business to offset problems in computers.
When A.T.& T. should probably be unloading its losing product business, it wants to take on NCR. Will NCR simply add to its losses? Will A.T.& T. be able to afford the debt for the acquisition? It says it must be in the computer business to pursue its strategy in computer networking. But this is as logical as claiming that one must manufacture ovens to be in the restaurant business.
These problems make me wonder whether A.T.& T. has lost its way, whether it has any overall realistic strategy. Is the ship rudderless in the high seas of competition, while the captain searches for the New World of computers?
A proper strategy for A.T.& T. would involve developing and articulating a corporate vision to make the company the leading force in telecommunication services. New service-based businesses in telecommunications should be developed building on A.T.& T.'s premier network. Services could be a public data network that builds on the company's common-channel signaling network, a specialized network using satellite transmission for international facsimile, and customized billing services for residential and small-business customers. Given its apparent losses, the product business should be sold or divested. A.T.& T.'s entry into financial and other nontelecommunication service areas seems to make sense, but with care.
A.T.& T. could be a candidate for acquisition. If control of it were acquired, management could be changed and the product business divested. The remaining A.T.& T. would double in value.
A.T.& T. operates the premier long-distance network in the nation. Its telecommunications service is a quality service with a bargain price. Clearly, providing telecommunication service is its strength. Its future should build on that. Theodore N. Vail, the founder of the Bell System, had vision when he saw long-distance service as the key ingredient in A.T.& T's future. His vision is still, if not even more, valid in shaping A.T.& T.'s future. If there were ever a need for another Vail to show A.T.& T. the way, it is today.

HEADLINE: Until Working Father Joins Superwoman

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Sexism, and Hard Choices" (Op-Ed, March 15), Linda Ellerbee says we have to be realistic in understanding the hard choices made by both Meredith Vieira and Don Hewitt of CBS's "60 Minutes." But there's an important reality that Ms. Ellerbee overlooks: most women don't have the economic luxury (or the security of having the public eye focused on their employer's response) that Ms. Vieira has to decide to work part time and stick to that decision when the employer says, "No dice." 
 As a student at Barnard College in the early 1980's, I was told repeatedly that the women of the 80's could have it all -- career and family. Now those who urged us on are telling us that it's too exhausting, we can't be Superwomen. "Superwoman is a dirty lie," says Ms. Ellerbee. "You can't have it all -- not all at once, anyway."
So she suggests we alternate family and career over the years, and make "painful choices again and again." This not only puts the burden, once again, on women to find ways to juggle family and career; it also ignores the reality that most families need two steady incomes to survive.
It seems to me there is another possibility: demand that men share the pain of those difficult choices.
Ms. Ellerbee points out that the term "working father" isn't in our vocabulary. And I have yet to hear of a man on the corporate "daddy track." We need to make parenthood an equal priority for mothers and fathers. Until American employers see a man in his "childbearing years" as someone who may take parental leave or who will be out the door at 5 P.M. sharp to pick up his daughter from day care, women will continue to be discriminated against in the workplace.
Most families need two incomes, yet employers still act as if the man is the breadwinner, and the woman is just doing the career thing to boost her self-esteem or to do something until she has babies. Until "working father" is part of our vocabulary, Superwoman will remain. She may be haggard, but she'll still be struggling to do it all -- because somebody has to.

HEADLINE: Sludge Composting And Its Benefits

 BODY:
The recent article "Sludge: New Focus on Recycling" discussed Camden County's plans to construct a sewage sludge composting plant, but overlooked the existence of the first in-vessel sludge composting facility in New Jersey. It is in Middle Township and is operated by the Cape May County Municipal Utilities Authority.
As chairman of the authority, I am writing not because we feel slighted or seek further recognition, but because our experience with composting allows us to answer a few of the most important questions raised in the article. Our concern about the environment, of course, extends beyond the borders of our own county.
The mere fact that a successful sludge composting plant does exist in New Jersey is itself crucial to the central issue that prompted the article: whether authorities in the northern counties can expect to research composting technology, launch their projects and obtain state approvals within a reasonable time frame.
For authorities studying the timetable element, it is essential to know that the state regulatory agencies would not be starting from ground zero on composting projects. Permitting standards, performance standards and end-product quality standards were developed in the early to middle 1980's. Our own facility has been operating successfully for more than five years.
Indeed, operations have been so successful that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency last fall awarded our composting facility second place nationwide for "beneficial use of sewage sludge," a major category of the E.P.A.'s annual National Wastewater Management Excellence Awards.
Secondly, the author of the article, unaware of the track record, could only be speculative about the marketability of the compost product.
To say that marketing "should not be a problem" is an understatement. In Cape May County, the product is so marketable that the demand far exceeds the supply. The product, a soil supplement sold as "Capeorganic," is quite literally coveted by landscapers, contractors, golf-course greenskeepers, plant-nursery operators and local government public works departments.
Perhaps even Donald Trump could give the product an endorsement: it was a component of the planting soil mixtures used for landscaping at his Taj Mahal hotel casino.
In 1990, our facility processed 9,871 wet tons of sewage sludge and produced 19,780 cubic yards of nitrogen-rich, pathogen-free Capeorganic. Every bit of the product was sold, and our supplies are spoken for even during the winter.
Yet a third concern discussed in the article was whether feasible methods exist for preventing contamination of the sludge by heavy metals. Given that Cape May County has a tourist economy and very little industry, heavy metals are minimal in wastewater here, so this is perhaps the only aspect of sludge composting in which our experience is not instructive.
State law, however, already requires that pretreatment to remove heavy metals be accomplished by the industries themselves. The lag time for implementation of composting (or any sludge-management system) provides a ready-made grace period and eventual deadline for moving to full enforcement.
For all these reasons, we feel that all authorities should look more closely at composting as a technology for sludge management.
Direct land application is a viable and environmentally beneficial method of handling sludge, but there are numerous administrative problems involved. As for incineration and out-of-state landfills, both are expensive and otherwise problematic, and neither is positive from an environmental standpoint. The Cape May County Authority's experience has proven that sludge is a resource to be recovered rather than disposed of, that it can become an environmental asset rather than a nuisance.
To be thorough about the lessons to be learned from our experience, we must concede that our composting plant, within a quarter-mile of a residential area, did require post-construction modifications to control odors. Advanced air-cleaning technology has been highly effective in dealing with this problem, but other authorities could avoid the situation by choosing locations just slightly more remote than the site that was available to us in Middle Township.
The authority would be happy to conduct tours of the composting facility for visiting authority officials who are facing these decisions on sludge management.

HEADLINE: Black Britons Speak of a Motherland That Looks Upon Them as Outcasts

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
World War II was raging when Allan Wilmot set sail for England from his native Jamaica to serve, in his words, "the mother country."
Like blacks in Britain's other West Indian colonies, Mr. Wilmot was taught in school that his island had been colonized by the world's greatest civilization. He patriotically sang "Rule Britannia" and waved the Union Jack. When recruitment posters for the Royal Air Force flooded Mr. Wilmot's hometown, Kingston, there was no question that he would sign up. 
 But Mr. Wilmot said he and thousands of other West Indian volunteers arrived in England to find that Britons "weren't expecting us."
 
'They Knew Nothing About Us'
 "We had learned so much about the people, geography, the economy of England," said Mr. Wilmot, who was 18 years old when he came here. "But they knew nothing about us. They believed that colored people had tails but that we cut them off to come to Europe. When we danced with English girls at dance halls, we could feel their hands going down and down and down, feeling for the stumps of the tails."
After the war, Mr. Wilmot settled in Britain, married and raised a family. Now 65 years old and a retired telephone-company employee, he said he had "never felt 100 percent" in Britain.
"Sometimes it feels like they still aren't expecting us," said Mr. Wilmot, who is vice president of the West Indian Ex-Servicemen Association, based in London. "It feels like they keep black people waiting, waiting, waiting in the wings."
It has been more than 40 years since West Indians began the modern migration of ethnic minority groups to Britain. About 495,000 people of West Indian origin now live here and they represent the overwhelming majority of blacks in the nation. Yet they make up about 1 percent of Britain's 55 million people, a tiny minority by United States standards, and they seem to be a people visible and invisible.
 
Idea of a Black Briton
 Sixty percent of all West Indians in Britain live in London. Their concentration here has produced disproportionate visibility in several areas. Some neighborhoods, although predominantly white, are shot through with a distinctly West Indian rhythm. Melodic Caribbean accents waft through streets punctuated with grocers' displays of plantains, goat meat and other staples of Caribbean cuisine. West Indian social and business clubs and restaurants stand alongside the ethnic group's fast-growing Pentecostal churches.
Reggae is a major influence in Britain's cultural scene. The annual Notting Hill Carnival, inspired by Trinidadians who migrated to the Notting Hill area in western London after World War II, has grown from a small outdoor party into what is widely regarded as the largest street festival in Europe.
But along other avenues, West Indians, Africans and other blacks are rarely seen. Race relations experts, social scientists and others say that there are virtually no blacks in the top echelons of the British Government, judiciary, police, press or civil service. Three blacks and one Asian are in the 650-member House of Commons, all members of the opposition Labor Party.
Several studies show that West Indian and other blacks are more likely than whites to be unemployed, jailed, homeless and poorly educated. And although 53 percent of people of West Indian descent living in Britain were born here, many among them say that the society has yet to feel comfortable with the idea of the black Briton in the way that the United States accepts the concept of the black American.
 
Patterns of Prejudice
 Blacks and others say the situation is linked to deep patterns of prejudice. For more than 25 years, Britain has had laws aimed at combating racial discrimination, but it has never tackled "the fact that the culture regards black people as inferior and not deserving of equal treatment," said Colin Brown, a former senior research fellow at the Policy Studies Institute based in London.
Indeed, even as Britain was passing laws intended to tackle racial discrimination, it was enacting statutes to stem the flow of blacks and other racial minorities into the country. A law passed in 1962 limited entry of Commonwealth immigrants to people who had been given work permits and a law in 1968 restricted the entry of Kenyan Asians who held British passports. An act passed in 1971 restricted admission of blacks into Britain to those who were coming for particular employment for a limited time period.
Certainly, study after study shows that disadvantages experienced by West Indians and other blacks also cloud the lives of Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and other groups among Britain's 2.6 million ethnic minorities. But some people suggest that West Indians may have been among those least expecting to face discrimination when they arrived. According to that view, they came as almost ready-made British citizens. They spoke English, were educated in schools styled after those here, prayed in Christian churches and worshipped cricket as a second religion.
"Britishness was deeply instilled in them without their knowing what Britishness was really about," said Winsome Pinnock, a playwright whose parents immigrated to Britain from the West Indies in the late 1950's. "They believed they were coming to a great empire and that they could share in its riches because they were part of that empire."
 
 The History
The 'Color Bar' And Manual Labor
 Blacks have a long history in Britain. Africans were here in the Third Century as soldiers in the Roman Army. Centuries later, some of the Africans sold into slavery ended up here. Black seamen and their families started communities in British ports in the 1800's and West Indians came during World War II.
Nonetheless, Britain was virtually a homogeneous society until the 1950's. Its primary experience with nonwhites had been as their colonial master in the vast British empire. But in the 1950's, a postwar labor shortage, a damaged economy and a weakening grip on its territories forced Britain to encourage people from the Caribbean, the Indian subcontinent and Africa to come here to fill manual jobs. About 125,000 West Indians came between 1948 and 1958, many of them to man buses and subways and to work in hospitals, hotels and restaurants.
Under a 1948 law, people from the colonies were British citizens with the right to live here permanently. But historians and blacks who lived through the 1950's say that nonwhites were soon shunned as aliens. Amid an economic downturn, growing unemployment and strong winds of xenophobia, whites began to accuse nonwhites of stealing their jobs. The immigrants were also victims of Britain's class system, which labeled them second-class citizens and stifled their social progress. Underpinning all of this was a sentimental longing for Britain's imperial past, some Britons say.
 
No 'Legacy of Guilt'
 West Indians and other blacks found themselves faced with a so-called "color bar," a practice encouraged by white American soldiers who brought their policies of racial discrimination and segregation to England with them in World War II. Blacks were barred from jobs and housing and from hotels, pubs and other public services.
"White people in Britain don't have the legacy of guilt about the past as there is in America about the period of slavery, even though there is plenty to be guilty about," said Anthony Lester, a white lawyer who helped to draft Britain's equal-opportunity law. "Nor is the English dream like the American dream of equality. If you asked the average Briton what he was striving for, I don't think equality would be the first thing to come to mind."
 
 Anti-Bias Laws
Code of Protection 'Has No Gums'

In 1965, Britain introduced its first law aimed at fighting racial discrimination. Two other acts have followed but race relations experts, blacks and others say that discrimination against minority groups remains pervasive.
The current equal-opportunity law, the Race Relations Act of 1976, set up the Commission for Racial Equality to combat discrimination in employment, housing, education and other areas. But the act, like its predecessors, is widely viewed as having weak legal remedies. It has no provisions for class-action suits or contract compliance measures to motivate employers to hire minorities. The commission can help individuals pursue discrimination complaints through a so-called industrial tribunal, which can award compensation of up to about $17,000.
"The law not only has no teeth," said A. Sivanandan, director of the Institute of Race Relations, an independent research organization, "it has no gums. It makes racism respectable by default. Black people remain unprotected in every area of society."
Surveys support Mr. Sivanandan's assertion. One study by the Policy Studies Institute showed that one-third of all employers would hire whites over equally qualified blacks without even giving the black applicants an interview. Another study found that black workers were more than twice as likely as whites with similar qualifications to end up in manual jobs.
 
Lack of Political Will
 In the criminal justice area, a report by the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders said young blacks were likely to receive harsher treatment than whites in the criminal justice system. In housing, a study by the Commission for Racial Equality showed that one in five real-estate agencies discriminated against ethnic minorities.
Officials at the Commission for Racial Equality say they are not satisfied with progress made under the 1976 law but that the situation would be far worse without it. They say that they have been pressing the Government for years to introduce legislation on the British mainland that is similar to a tough law put into effect last year in Northern Ireland aimed at fighting religious discrimination against the Roman Catholic minority.
That law includes contract compliance and compulsory monitoring of a workforce's religious composition. Concerns that discriminate can be fined up to $60,000. A spokesman in Britain's Home Office said there were no plans to equip the Race Relations Act with similar provisions.
Many advocates of racial equality say the Government has never had the political will to fight discrimination. To assertions that it ignored race relations, the Government of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher responded that its economic policies had brought increased employment, higher incomes and a higher percentage of home ownerships to minorities. Prime Minister John Major has said he wants Britain to have "no artificial barrier of background, religion or race."
In a written policy statement, the Government says it is "wholly committed to a racially fair and just society." It says it vigorously enforces the Race Relations Act, monitors the civil service's employment practices and scrutinizes legislative and policy proposals to see that they contain the spirit of racial and sex equality. It also points to several Government programs aimed at benefiting minority groups, including one intended to regenerate inner cities, where many blacks and Asians live.
More radical measures to ease discrimination appear some way off, race relations experts say, because the cause of race relations remains widely unpopular in Britain.
 
 Blacks and the Police
Hostile Encounters, Accounts of Abuse
For a nation accustomed to viewing itself as tolerant and fair, the ongoing debate over the troubled relationship between the police and blacks is particularly unsettling.
An opinion poll in 1989 found that 68 percent of blacks agreed with the statement that "most police are prejudiced against colored people," compared with 22 percent of the total population.
Many blacks say that their belief is supported by many personal encounters in which the police are hostile or abusive. In one widely publicized incident, Linford Christie, a popular Olympic sprinter, was wrongfully arrested on a charge of stealing a car that he had in fact rented. Mr. Christie quoted the arresting police officer as saying, "What's a nigger like you doing in an England track suit?"
Carl Thompson-Ellis says that he, too, has been the target of police harassment. Mr. Thompson-Ellis is one of the Metropolitican Police's 475 nonwhite officers, who make up less than 1.7 percent of the 28,329-member force. He says that he has found "niggers out" and other racial epithets scrawled in his desk diary and on walls at work. White officers, he said, call blacks "nigger, coon and jungle bunny so often that they're not conscious of it because it's the norm."
Mr. Thompson-Ellis, a 48-year-old detective, said white officers target young black men for abuse. He said one practice involves beating up black suspects before taking them to the police station and, in order to explain the suspects' wounds, accusing them of assault or resisting arrest. A police department spokesman insisted that such incidents "do not happen." The spokesman said police officials recognized that what some white officers called "harmless banter" about nonwhites had elements of racism and that training programs had been started to try to stamp out such behavior.
The spokesman said the police force was working to improve relations with minorities and had an ongoing drive to recruit more nonwhite policemen. Under the force's grievance procedures, he said, policemen can lodge formal complaints against fellow officers who commit racially motivated offenses. Policemen found guilty of such offenses can be dismissed.
But Mr. Thompson-Ellis said many nonwhite policemen declined to complain about racist behavior within the force because "we don't know who we are complaining to."
"The moment you take a stand," Mr. Thompson-Ellis said, "you're put down as a troublemaker, someone who can't be trusted. We have to work with those guys. One of the things you don't want is to be in trouble on the street on some dark night, to radio for assistance and have no one answer you. What happens is they hear you and ignore you. So you keep quiet."
 
 The Future
Rage Among Fruit of the First Wave

Children and grandchildren of the first generation of West Indians in Britain speak of a simmering rage at what they view as this society's rejection of them. They say the anger could boil over as it did in riots -- some blacks call them uprisings -- in 1981 and 1985. In those years, blazing gasoline bombs illuminated the shortage of hope in desolate pockets of the nation's cities.
Some blacks hope that the rage will translate into greater political and economic independence in their community. The National Black Caucus, a national civil-rights body of sorts, was formed several years ago in an attempt to begin to make that happen.
The caucus and a network of black professionals -- including lawyers, probation officers and social workers -- have begun meeting informally to try to coordinate strategies to put the needs of blacks on the nation's agenda.
Blacks employed in London's subways -- where about one-third of the workforce is black -- have also come together to make demands and have won an agreement from management to try to insure equal opportunity in the workplace.
"We've given up on changing attitudes," said Peter Herbert, vice chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers. "Whites just don't realize that our disadvantage is their disadvantage. Unless there is a civil disturbance, they don't see how the underrepresentation of blacks in business, politics, education, housing and every other area impacts on them. What we can do is try to change behavior and outcome. If that doesn't happen, you only have to look at the ghettos in the United States to see what the future holds for Britain."

The annual Notting Hill Carnival, inspired by Trinidadians who migrated to the western London area, has grown from a small outdoor party into one of Europe's largest street festivals (Jonathan Player for The New York Times); "It feels like they keep black people waiting, waiting, waiting in the wings," said Allan Wilmot of the treatment of blacks in Britain. He came as a volunteer from Jamaica during World War II; Carl Thompson-Ellis, one of 475 nonwhite officers in the 28,329- member Metropolitican Police force, said he has found racial epithets scrawled on walls at work. He also said white officers target young black men for abuse.

HEADLINE: Hunt for Marcos's Billions Yields More Dead Ends Than Hard Cash

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
After a five-year hunt through the courts and banking systems of three continents, the Philippine Government has uncovered yachts and paintings and silver services and a few hundred million dollars, but not much more of the $5 billion or more Ferdinand E. Marcos is said to have stolen from his country.
As the six-year term of President Corazon C. Aquino nears its end next year, a touch of desperation has entered the search and her Government has begun talking of cutting its losses and making deals with Mr. Marcos's widow, Imelda. 
 Lawyers and Government officials involved in the search now say it will probably never be known just how much Mr. Marcos, who died in Hawaii in 1989, stole from the Philippines during his 20 years as President. Whatever the total, they say, it is now clear that only a small portion will be recovered.
 
Chocolate Tab Is $6,000
 Caesar Parlade, a former member of the agency seeking to recover the Marcos funds, the Presidential Commission on Good Government, put the possible total recovery at $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
"There is a large gap between what was stolen and what remains," he said in an interview. "If you look at the records you find that on one of her trips Imelda was able to spend $6,000 on the first day for chocolates. That is the kind of lifestyle that used up the money."
In the Philippines, peremptory confiscations of property, deals with some of Mr. Marcos's "cronies" and scores of civil suits have won the Government about $100 million in cash and another $100 million in assets that range from horses to hotels and from planes to sugar plantations.
In the United States, the Government has recovered banks, buildings and assorted baubles from the Marcos residences. It has succeeded, in a Los Angeles court, in freezing the Marcos assets worldwide. But it failed in New York in a case brought by American officials to convict Mrs. Marcos of racketeering in the purchase of properties with stolen Government funds.
The biggest single haul could come in Switzerland, where the Supreme Court ruled recently that the Philippine Government is entitled to recover $350 million in Marcos bank accounts in that country.
The pursuit of the Marcos wealth began with wads of cryptic documents that were left scattered through Malacanang Palace in Manila when Mr. Marcos and his entourage fled on the night of Feb. 26, 1986.
 
A Moral and Material Crusade
 With her first presidential decree after seizing office in a nearly bloodless "people power" uprising, Mrs. Aquino promised her people she would track down and recover the wealth and use it to help rebuild her country, one of the poorest in Asia.
The recovery was seen as a symbol of the moral crusade with which she came to power, and her first commissioner of the recovery effort, Jovito Salonga, now the Senate President, offered no quarter.
"A deal would amount to saying that it is all right for an official to steal, so long as he is ready to share his loot with the state later -- if prosecuted," Mr. Salonga said then.
It was he who first estimated the Marcos wealth at $5 billion or more, and Manila has stood by that estimate even as it scales back its goals and begins to talk of making deals.
 
Spending Goes Unchecked
 Within the Philippines, the Government moved to seize the assets of Mr. Marcos and his associates, but many of these became entangled in complicated court challenges as the wealthy men in the Marcos camp hired the nation's best lawyers.
For the assets the Government did recover, Mr. Parlade now urges quick disposal, worrying that they could pose "a great temptation" for Marcos-style corruption by the next President.
Abroad, the suit in a Federal court in Los Angeles froze the Marcos assets and resulted in an order under which Mrs. Marcos must submit an accounting of any expenditures over $10,000. Officials within the Philippine commission said Mrs. Marcos continues to spend freely, maintaining that her money comes from one of her daughters.
Most other efforts have proved unproductive, however, as the Philippine Government discovered that Mr. Marcos was a virtuoso in hiding his money in accounts everywhere from Lichtenstein to the Cayman Islands.
Some investigators who have been involved with the wealth-recovery effort say the inefficiency and political infighting that has characterized the Aquino Government may have cost the nation millions of dollars in potential recoveries.
 
Investigators Accused
 The presidential commission was itself accused of corruption almost from its first days, and has labored under controversy. Although few of the accusations have been proved, a number of the commission's fiscal agents have been charged with corruption and removed.
But Mr. Parlade, reflecting on the commission's difficulties, said, "From what I have seen, it is not corruption; it's ineptness."
Like much of the Government, he said, the commission has become bogged down in its own bureaucracy and hobbled by a constant turnover of its staff. Its approach and its politics have zigzagged as it has lurched through a succession of four commissioners.
And while the commission floundered, Mr. Parlade said, some Marcos assets have dropped dramatically in value. The Redwood Bank in San Francisco, for example, has depreciated because of bad investments from $40 million to about $6.5 million. The California Overseas Bank in Los Angeles, which was once worth $30 million, is now worth no more than $14 million, he said.
 
Assets Dwindle During Search
 Severina Rivera, who was legal director for the international recovery effort until December 1988, said property depreciation and Government mismanagement had cost millions of dollars in potential recoveries from four buildings in New York.
"With all the expenses of litigation, the Philippines got nothing out of the buildings when we could easily have made $100 million if we had sold in 1988," she said.
Political changes at the top tend to bring broad shifts in social and economic power in the Philippines. In this tradition, some of the recovered wealth seems to have changed hands from friends and relatives of Mr. Marcos to friends and relatives of Mrs. Aquino.
The President has said she does not plan to run for a second term, and whatever the outcome, the 1992 election is expected to mark an end to any vigorous pursuit of the Marcos wealth, as political power shifts.
 
'Aquino Corruption' on Agenda
 Looking ahead, some opponents are already preparing to supercede the search for Marcos wealth with an investigation of "Aquino corruption."
One of the new front-runners in the jockeying to succeed Mrs. Aquino is her estranged cousin, Eduardo Cojuangco, who was one of Mr. Marcos's closest associates and who returned to Manila under mysterious circumstances in 1989.
With some Filipinos suggesting that he only wants to become President to protect his own extensive assets, the possibility has arisen that Mr. Cojuangco could in the end be one of the big winners in the story of the Marcos wealth.
At the same time, after years of stubborn refusal, Mrs. Aquino said this month that Mrs. Marcos could return to the Philippines to face trial, a move that would meet a legal condition set by the Swiss Government for recovery of the funds held there.
Last fall the Government disclosed that it was negotiating with Mrs. Marcos for a settlement that some officials said might allow her to keep 60 percent of her assets, though their total extent remains unknown.
The deal under discussion apparently would have terminated attempts through the courts to recover all the Marcos wealth in return for funds held in Hong Kong, if these totaled $250 million or more.
Mrs. Marcos maintained that a formal agreement had been signed. But David Castro, the current commissioner of the presidential panel, insisted that the talks had only been exploratory.
 
Compromise Is Defended
 There was also an angry public reaction in Manila last November when the Government revealed that it had reached an agreement with one of Mr. Marcos's closest associates, Roberto Benedicto, to share with him in nearly equal portions $31 million in Swiss bank deposits in his name.
Defending the dealmaking, Mr. Castro said in an interview that in a legal process, "Compromise is required by the rules."
He added that overseas legal expenses in the search for the Marcos wealth had already reached $8 million, and that continued litigation could take many more years, with diminishing returns.
Without compromises, he said, the Philippines can only expect to recover the $350 million in Swiss banks and perhaps $250 million more from the Los Angeles suit, which seeks the return of all the Marcos assets.
One of Mr. Castro's precedessors as commissioner, Ramon Diaz, who is now Ambassador to Canada, disagreed strongly with this reasoning, saying: "This is not simply a legal case but an ethical case. You should never make deals with Marcos. You just open the door for others to follow."
He added: "Imelda is not supposed to retain anything. That is stolen money."
 
Still the Marcos Philippines
 The degeneration of the recovery effort from a moral crusade to a duel among sharp lawyers has brought a deep sense of disillusionment to many Filipinos. They say it is a signal that the country has remained in effect the Marcos Philippines, rather than some new Aquino Philippines, as it continues to labor under his legacy of corruption, economic decline and political violence.
Belinda Aquino, the author of "The Politics of Plunder," a book about Marcos corruption, said that along with most Filipinos, she had run out of hope that the Government would live up to its promise of fundamental change.
"We didn't really have a social revolution," said Ms. Aquino, who is no relation to the President. "We had a political upheaval in which we got rid of Marcos, but that's about it.
"Now with these deals, the message that is being sent to the Philippines is that it pays to steal, that crime pays. I think something should be done. But it's almost kind of too late, and what can you do?"

HEADLINE: Recession and Guilt Pare Dining Trade and Menus

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
In the last two years, the euphemistic Closed for Renovation sign has nearly eclipsed the Happy Hour signs in the windows of New York City restaurants. Crowds have thinned in the best dining rooms. Same-day reservations are rarely a problem.
New York City restaurateurs are worried about the paring of corporate expense accounts for restaurant meals in the last few years. They cite the erosive recession, which has cut into tourism and entertainment, and the growing number of young families eating at home.
 
Embarrasment of Riches
 But what worries restaurateurs more are customers like Eric Wyka. As he waited to check his camel's hair coat before dinner at the Rainbow Room recently, he glanced over his shoulder nervously. "I'd be real embarrassed if one of my friends who's been laid off saw me here," Mr. Wyka, a 40-year-old lawyer, murmured to his companion. "I mean, it's not like I go out so much any more, but I feel sort of guilty going out at all." 
 To restaurateurs, this mood change is scarier than dipping check averages and empty chairs. "We had the good times and now we're deep in guilty times," said David Liederman, who owns the Braodway Grill and closed his second restaurant, Chez Louis, last week to convert it into a less expensive dining room.
Peter Aschkenasy, owner of the venerable Gage & Tollner Restaurant in downtown Brooklyn, says a fundamental change is afoot. "Recessions come and go, that's the business: Good operators survive and adapt," he said. "The frightening thing isn't the drop in numbers or the change in spending, it's the attitude change."
The New York restaurant world has been especially vulnerable to even a slight shift in spending habits. In the fabulous free-spending '80's, new restaurants popped up faster than corn in a hot pan. In building restaurants, the '80's motto was "borrow and spend," and it left many places heavily in debt. Rents soared and operating costs climbed. By 1990, profit margins were so tight that to lose a dozen customers a day could mean not paying the vegetable bill.
"Restaurants throughout the country are taking it on the chin, but the situation is exacerbated in New York City by higher rental percentages and union difficulties," Charles Bernstein, editor of Nation's Restaurant News, a trade journal, wrote last month.
In other parts of the country, rent accounts for about 5 or 6 percent of monthly sales. In New York City, a restaurant's rent can eat up as much as 20 percent of sales when sales are good. In recent interviews, 25 New York restaurateurs cited declines in sales of 5 to 40 percent over the last year, pushing the rent share to as much as 50 percent of sales.
The number of sit-down restaurants, from McDonald's to Lutece, has dipped to 10,461 in 1991 from a high of 11,767 in 1988, said Steven Linden, acting director of the permits division of the city's Department of Health. Dining icons of the '80's like Batons, Jams and 150 Wooster were casualties. City labor statistics indicate that the New York restaurant world is still shrinking. In 1988, 135,600 people worked in eating and drinking establishments, said Michael Press, Deputy Commissioner of Business Development for New York City. Today, city restaurants employ 128,000 people.
Not all news calls for another roll of the doom-and-gloom drum. In tracking the use of American Express cards in New York City restaurants over the last year, Patricia Duffy, vice president of restaurant marketing for American Express, reported that while people spend the same money over all in restaurants, there is a change in how they spend it.
While her company will not divulge specific statistics, Ms. Duffy said, "In general, customers are shying away from lavish occasions and concentrating on value-oriented dining." In a nationwide study by Grey Advertising in New York City, a dramatic shift in spending was found but, according to Barbara Feigin, the study's author, "Restaurants are one quality of lifestyle thing that people would like to hold on to." Instead of excess, she said customers today are attracted to "a generous spirit and value in restaurants."
Still, many restaurateurs hear a death knell in every canceled reservation, as well as in every piece of proposed restrictive legislation and every health finding that might promote a fear of uninhibited dining. Economic factors can be dealt with pragmatically; the guilt factor, on the other hand, seems about as unstoppable as The Terminator to most restaurateurs. "Connoisseurship is being lumped together with 'nouveau riche' as some embarrassing '80's remnant," said Susan Liederman, co-owner of the Broadway Grill. "We are in real trouble."
Tom Margittai, co-owner of the Four Seasons, was more direct. "I've been in this business for 40 years and five recessions," he said. "This is the worst I've seen and it's not simply economics."
 
Held Up for Ridicule
 Along with symbols like designer bottled water and $2,000 business suits, New York City restaurants have been put in the stocks of the American conscience and held up for ridicule. When a pricey dining room closes, it is seen as just deserts for wanton indulgence; when a superstar chef shows up on the unemployment line, his bad fortune is often cast as a well-earned hair shirt. Just as restaurants mirror spending patterns, they are a blotter for the social conscience.
"A moral change is palpable," said Joseph Baum, whose restaurant consulting group, the Joseph Baum and Michael Whiteman Company, operates the Rainbow Room and recently closed Aurora, a midtown restaurant. "It isn't proper to show how much money you have anymore."
Restaurant patrons say their emotions can get the best of them on a night out. "I can't in good conscience order all the expensive food and wine," said Daniel Kaplan, president-elect of the 92d Street Y. "Knowing that colleagues are worried about their jobs takes all the joy out of the evening."
Mr. Wyka said, "I'm about as comfortable ordering foie gras or caviar as I would be driving a big flashy car through the Bronx."
 
Choosing the Homelier Fish
 Restaurateurs say the guilt factor is at work in what customers choose for dinner, and even modest restaurants notice a shift in appetite that is not always related to price. At Claire Restaurant, a Key-West-style seafood house, the owner, Marvin Paige, said that "customers want the homelier fish -- the grouper, the whitefish, hake and flounder. Just the sound of something extravagant like lobster makes them flinch these days."
Some restaurateurs have pursued the public with more modest concepts that mirror the mood shift. When Rakel opened in 1987, it was a pricey preserve of artful fare. Last year, prices were cut, the cooking took a homier bent and the restaurant was rechristened Cafe Rakel. Last month, after a coat of cozy paint and a few more grandmere touches to the menu, Raoul's Brasserie and Grill rose from the Rakel ashes.
No one's career parallels the recent history of New York restaurants more closely than Len Allison's. In 1975, just as the city was recuperating from the last restaurant recession, Mr. Allison spent "a few hundred bucks" on pots and pans and began serving dinner in his Brooklyn home. A year later, he borrowed $40,000 and opened a 50-seat restaurant in a former tavern in Boerum Hill. And in 1981, he invested $250,000 to build Hubert's, a 50-seat restaurant in Gramercy Park. In 1988, he mustered a group of investors and opened a $1.5 million Park Avenue dining room that seated 200 guests. In 1990 he closed it.
"I think we were a part of the late 80's, the fabulousness, the mania for more, more, more -- everybody wanted to be wowed," Mr. Allison said. "We lost our intimate connection with our customers. We got too pricey." This month, Mr. Allison opened Onda, a 50-seat restaurant in SoHo that he built for $75,000. Instead of chic fare, Mr. Allison is serving family-style platters of Chinese and Italian cooking; instead of $120 a person, dinner is about $30.
 
Better Food, Prices, Attention
 As New York City restaurateurs navigate the sea change by policing costs, slashing prices and expanding serving hours, customers are the obvious winners. "Dining has never been better in the City of New York," said Tim Zagat, publisher of the annual Zagat Restaurant Survey. "There's better-quality food, better prices, more personal attention and you don't have to wait months for reservations."
Mr. Baum agreed: "Restaurants are one of the first places to feel any change in the economic or social climate and certainly one of the first to react. We adjust, we realign, we get better." But he feels an ominous breeze. "When the profit margin tightens, every detail is magnified," he said. "Minding the details is the only way to keep the door open." Local restaurateurs are indeed minding details within their control. Careful buying is once again de rigueur.
Adam Tihany, a restaurant designer and the owner of Remi in Midtown, said that borrow-and-spend has been usurped by "rabid penny-pinching." He went on: "Everybody is looking for bargains. They want cut-rate groceries, wine, plates, glasses and paint jobs. Restaurateurs think bargain-hunting is the answer."
Cost-consciousness may solve a fraction of the New York restaurant equation, but frugal management cannot reverse the uneasiness. Mr. Baum talked of the 80's as the time when people became used to spending handsomely for a meal. Then, he said, the economy and national mood swing came along and changed the habit.
"You still can't eat better any place on earth," he said, surveying New York City from the Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of Rockefeller Center. Then he glanced Across his dining room, registered a handful of empty tables during a recent lunch hour and shook his head. "Do you have any idea how long it takes to change a changed habit?"

HEADLINE: Border Boom's Dirty Residue Imperils U.S.-Mexico Trade

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NOGALES, Ariz.

 BODY:
Little more than a muddy creek when it starts flowing down a hillside in Mexico, the Nogales Wash passes by factories, shantytowns and noisy commercial streets before it reaches an invisible line and then suddenly becomes a swirling, stinking foreign policy problem for the Bush Administration.
When it crosses the border into the United States, the Nogales Wash is laced with toxic industrial pollutants and laden with untreated sewage. A public health emergency has been in force on the Arizona side for six months because the incidence of hepatitis there has climbed to 20 times the national average.
 
Pollution Threatens Trade Pact
 The runaway pollution and accompanying health threats can be found in virtually any city along the United States-Mexico border, which has undergone an economic explosion in recent years with the construction of hundreds of highly profitable American-owned factories operating under special trade rules. The American owners pay very low wages to the nearly half a million Mexicans they employ and are not obliged to use expensive antipollution equipment. 
 The pollution problems have become so grave that they have emerged as a major issue and potential obstacle to the free trade agreement that President Bush wants to negotiate with Mexico as a way to compete economically with Europe and Japan. The Mexican Government's environmental effort is in its infancy, and it is struggling with standards and enforcement.
Influential environmental groups, like the National Wildlife Federation, and others who oppose the free trade agreement, like the A.F.L.-C.I.O., have contended that the contamination of the Nogales Wash and other pollution problems along the border are just previews of what will happen across Mexico if tariffs and other trade barriers are removed, igniting a rush to develop new industries and spawn new wastes.
Moreover, Democrats in Congress say they will resist efforts for a speedy approval of a free trade agreement unless the White House agrees to address environmental issues in the negotiations with Mexico. The White House has not said whether it will.
But in American border cities, even the most committed advocates of free trade insist that existing environmental problems should be addressed before free trade become a reality.
"We who breathe the air and drink the water along the border are the first to say we support free trade and that we also want a long-term plan for the environment," said William F. Joffroy Jr., chairman of the Border Trade Alliance, an organization that promotes economic development on behalf of local governments and businesses on both sides of the border.
The contamination along the border runs the gamut from raw sewage to wood smoke to highly toxic industrial chemicals.
 
Wide Environmental Damage
 Across the Rio Grande from El Paso, for instance, firewood is the chief cooking and heating fuel for most of the 1.2 million residents of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Rubber tires are burned in kilns that make decorative bricks and tiles. Along with pollution from motor vehicles and industry, the smoke from these fires produces an acrid cloud over both cities under certain weather.
Furniture-making plants and metal-plating shops that fled environmental restrictions in California now flourish in Tijuana, Mexico, producing toxic wastes from their use of solvents.
Recreational use of the Rio Grande below Laredo, Tex., has long been considered unsafe because its sister city in Mexico, Nuevo Laredo, dumps about 25 million gallons of untreated sewage into the river every day.
Much of the development and growth along the border came as a result of the 1965 agreement between the two countries that allowed American companies to set up operations on the Mexican side. The American factories and assembly plants, called maquiladoras, import almost all raw materials and export almost all products virtually exempt from tariffs and other trade restrictions.
Now Mr. Bush wants to go further with the trade agreement, which would cut out all tariffs and trade barriers between the counties. A negative vote by either house of Congress before June 1 would deny Mr. Bush the authority to present the legislators with a completed agreement to be accepted or rejected.
"Along the border we already know what happens when free trade brings rapid economic growth to Mexico," said Mayor Suzanne Azar of El Paso. "We've seen the benefits but we have also seen some very tough environmental problems that are directly caused by that kind of growth."
 
Growth Boomed in 1980's
 The American plants grew quickly after the rapid devaluation of the Mexican peso starting in 1982 brought the wage of a Mexican worker down to about 50 cents an hour. Since then the number of maquiladoras has jumped to nearly 1,900 from about 300. They produce almost anything that involves a lot of labor, from carburetors to designer sunglasses.
On the outskirts of Nogales, a cluster of the plants sits on a hilltop. Big, box-like buildings, they do not have any smokestacks or cooling towers because they are used for assembling components rather than manufacturing parts or processing raw materials.
Down the hill, the neat industrial architecture gives way to ramshackle dwellings fashioned from cardboard and scraps of wood taken from the plants' trash bins. These are the homes of maquiladora workers, most of them peasants who have migrated from Mexico's agricultural regions in search of steady pay.
In about a dozen shacks the most common building material is a tan cardboard that once contained polyvinyl chloride. Written on the cardboard walls are warnings that the former contents could release hazardous fumes.
"This is some of the best stuff because it is real thick and keeps the rain out," said Juan Ramos, standing outside a two-room structure that served as home for him and five relatives. All had worked in the plants. Their water supply was stored in a 55-gallon drum that was also refuse from the plants. A bright yellow and orange label identified its former contents as a fluorocarbon solvent whose vapors are fatal if inhaled.
 
$27 for 49 Hours of Work
 The starting wage for a maquiladora worker is about 82,000 pesos, or about $27, for a 49-hour week. More experienced workers receive as much as 140,000 pesos, or about $47, in addition to fringe benefits like a subsidized lunch.
Catalina Denman, a public health specialist at the Colegio de Sonora, a research institute, who has conducted numerous studies in Nogales, had this to say about the situation: "In the course of just a few years the maquiladoras brought the industrial revolution and all that goes with it to a region that was completely unprepared for it.
"In the short term this is a positive development because a job is better than no job and because living conditions where these people came from were also terrible. In the long term, though, what happened in Nogales could happen all over Mexico if a free trade agreement produces the same kind of fast development with no real attention to human needs."
Behind Mr. Ramos's home was one of the communal outhouses used by residents of the shantytown. A little ditch from the outhouse led to a bigger ditch that flowed to a creek in the bottom of a ravine that flowed into the Nogales Wash, stream that grows in size with the seasons. Like virtually every other Mexican border town, Nogales does not have any sewage treatment plants.
After crossing the border the wash is contained within concrete embankments as it flows through the center of Nogales, Ariz. High concentrations of human wastes in the wash are blamed for the hepatitis epidemic that produced 58 cases and many suspected cases last year, said Patrick Zurick, deputy director of the Santa Cruz County Health Department.
Some of the cases involved people who had direct contact with the water where it flows through a popular recreational area outside of town or by children who skateboard on the embankments. Others apparently involved eating establishments and supermarkets along the wash where flies carried the disease from the water to food.
More ominous, Mr. Zurick said, is the contamination of an aquifer that runs on both sides of the border. Numerous homes and commercial establishments draw water from private wells tapped into the aquifer, he said, including several large warehouses where fruits and vegetables imported from Mexico are iced down and prepared for shipment throughout the world. In October the wells in those warehouses were declared public water supplies, by the county, requiring that they be chlorinated and tested regularly.
Across the border, Ciudad Juarez dumps all of its raw sewage into a canal that parallels the Rio Grande. In towns on the American side of the Rio Grande, the incidence of hepatitis from contaminated well water is so acqute that a recent study in one town, San Elizario, Tex., showed that everyone had been exposed to hepatitis at least once by the time they were 20 years-old.
Human wastes are not the only troublesome substances that have seeped from the Nogales Wash into the aquifer, Mr. Zurick said.
Last year, government and private health experts on both sides of the border repeatedly tested numerous water supplies in the Nogales area and found widespread contamination by the kind of chemicals that are normally found in industrial solvents and that are suspected or known carcinogens.
Although only a few samples showed unsafe levels of contamination, the results showed that the pollution was spreading through the aquifer, said Dick Kamp, director of the Border Ecology Project, a research and policy studies organization that participated in the water study. It seemed to originate in the industrial zone of Nogales, Mexico, where there are many Mexican-owned workshops as well as the American plants
"This is the most extensive study of water pollution done anywhere along the border," Mr. Kamp said, "and what it shows is that we have a problem but that so far we don't know the source of it or its full scope."
More than 1,000 American-owned plants generate hazardous waste but only 30 percent of these have complied with Mexican rules requiring them to file information on how they handle those wastes, according to a report issued last November by the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology, the Mexican Government's equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency. Only 19 percent of the plants using toxic materials could show that they had disposed of wastes properly, the report concluded.
Mexico's rules governing the use of hazardous materials only went into effect in 1988. Most of the regulations are just as strict as they are in the United States, but standards for specific substances and the enforcement mechanisms are still being established.
"The U.S. isn't able to handle hazardous wastes efficiently and so you can't expect it of Mexico where this problem is just now being addressed," said Joe King, president of the Meribah Corporation, an El Paso-based concern that specializes in waste disposal on both sides of the border.
"Protecting the environment has become a political priority in Mexico," Mr. King said, "it has popular support. But the infrastructure is totally missing and building it will involve astronomical costs and a lot of time."

HEADLINE: Between Home and Heaven, a Ball Field

SERIES: Season of Dreams
A periodic visit with one New York City high school baseball team.

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

 BODY:
The approach of spring in Washington Heights, the Santo Domingo of New York: People fling open their windows, and into their tenement apartments comes the call of merengue, a dozen different variations blasting from speakers in bodegas and record stores and cars cruising Broadway. And they get ready for baseball.
Every morning at about 5, on their way to factory jobs in New Jersey, the neighborhood's Dominican immigrants see 18-year-old Manny Ramirez -- the star of their own George Washington High School baseball team, their own major-league prospect -- doing his roadwork on the steep incline of Fort George Hill. 
 In the afternoons, Wilfredo Resto comes home from his job as a maintenance man at Boricua College to find his 16-year-old son, Alex, waiting to hone his fastball.
And Dolores Ventura, a seamstress in a factory, tells her 15-year-old son, Santos Herrarte, that it is time to quit his job at the discount store on Broadway. Mrs. Ventura supports nine children, and Santos's contribution helped. But he has played ball since he was a 6-year-old in the Dominican Republic.
"I want you to prepare for the baseball season," she says.
Baseball, with all its fleeting promise, connects all kinds of people in Washington Heights -- the commander of the local police precinct, the old man on the corner in the Yankees cap, the coach from Brooklyn, the teen-age girls who call out to Manny Ramirez in the hallways at school.
In Washington Heights, rents are high, jobs are scarce, and some of the streets where drug dealers operate are among the city's most violent. Last year, the 34th Precinct logged 109 of the city's more than 2,200 homicides, more than any other precinct except the 75th in the East New York section of Brooklyn.
In his office, the deputy inspector, Nicholas Estavillo, points to a wall of snapshots of some of the 2,500 guns confiscated in the last five years. Then, smiling, he shows off a mahogany clock inscribed from the Dominican-run F. Alfonso Little League. This is a neighborhood, he says, with four separate Little Leagues.
For fans and players here in Washington Heights, baseball is an escape from the harshness of New York. And it is something else. Dominicans may complain incessantly about the country they left -- the disastrous economy, the devalued peso, the lights that are always going out. But they also talk incessantly of going home. Baseball takes them there. In the Dominican Republic, there are long hours working in the sugar-cane fields and factories -- and then there is baseball.
Javier Del Castillo, 22, is a shortstop from San Pedro de Macoris -- a breeding ground for major league shortstops, including Mr. Del Castillo's cousin, Tony Fernandez of the San Diego Padres. Mr. Del Castillo, a former Washington team captain, is home from college, working at the post office. In free moments at work, he swings a cardboard mailing tube at wadded-up pieces of paper tossed into the air.
"What is there to do on a beautiful, tropical day in the Dominican Republic but play baseball?" he said the other evening. "Playing baseball is going to a new world -- to paradise."
In spring, paradise in Washington Heights can be found on the diamond high on a hill at 192d Street and Audubon Avenue, next to George Washington High, which has 3,000 students. The school is 66 years old, but the ballfield is new artificial turf.
 
Major League Legacy
 You can sit in the stands in the afternoons, surrounded by teen-agers, teachers and parents all cheering -- and cursing -- in two languages, and watch Manny Ramirez, Alex Resto and Santos Herrarte play ball. They and their 17 teammates are the George Washington Trojans, among the best of the city's 94 high school teams. Under their coach, Steve Mandl, 35 and once a left-handed pitching phenom in Bensonhurst, they have won the Manhattan division the last seven years.
Washington was once predominantly Jewish and Irish -- the class of 1941 included a straight-A student named Henry Kissinger -- but now most of its students are Dominican. As at many of New York's academically troubled high schools, staying in school can be hard. About 40 percent of the students are learning English, many while working to help their families.
The team is all Dominican. Most of the players learned the game with milk cartons for gloves and sticks for bats on the same rocky, dirt fields of the Dominican Republic that produced such major leaguers as Tony Fernandez, Alfredo Griffin and George Bell. To spend time with them is to learn about their childhoods, and to discover their Washington Heights. Their odds are long, but it is hard not to get caught up in their baseball dreams.
Alex Resto was accompanied to a practice by his best friend, David Morales. David, who does not play, recounted the moment in February when he first saw the roster posted in the hall.
"To tell you the truth, I jumped for joy," he said. "I told my mother, 'Ma, ma, Alex made it!' "
"I was afraid to try out last year," said Alex, a junior. "But this year my father said, 'Go for it.' Everything has changed for me now. I feel taller."
The 5-foot-8-inch rookie pitcher is preparing for an accounting career. But at night, in the bedroom he shares with his 10-year-old brother, Wilson, on 162d Street, he has this dream: "I'm drafted by the Cardinals, straight from school."
Alex and his teammates can stand in center field at night, after a game, and see the lights of Yankee Stadium off to the southeast. The Stadium is where they want to be in June, when the two best public school teams in the city compete for the championship. Washington made it in 1988, but lost to Cardozo, from Queens, 5-4.
 
Pressures Outside
 A high fence encloses Washington's ballfield. On the other side is the city. Two seasons ago, in May, 17-year-old Nelson Pena, a model student who played in the band at George Washington, was eating at a McDonald's not far from school when a stranger killed him with a .38.
The Washington first baseman, Ralph Gonzalez, was in Nelson Pena's music class. "I missed a day of school and when I came back, he had been shot, and they were collecting money for his funeral," he said. "There's nothing here. Even if you get a good job, you have to worry about being safe."
After practice one day, the star shortstop, Victor Diaz, a senior, explained why he had failed all his classes and missed most of last season. His brother, Frank, had been shot and killed on 177th Street last March at the age of 22. Frank, a pitcher, had been signed by the Montreal Expos, but had broken his arm and come home to drive a United Parcel Service truck.
"I just want to get out of New York," said Victor, who is called Speedy Gonzalez. He hurls himself around the bases so fast he sometimes misses them. "I don't have time to touch the base," he tells Coach Mandl.
Victor and Ralph, like most of the players, say they know drug dealers; some say they have been invited into the trade. "You see a 15-year-old kid driving a Mercedes-Benz and you get tempted," Ralph said. "But that's not the way to go. I play basketball, football and baseball. I go bowling. In New York, you have to play sports. Otherwise, the streets get you."
 
Things to Count On
 On the ballfield inside the fence, some things seem certain.
Victor Diaz will steal bases. He stole five in Thursday's exhibition.
Manny Ramirez, who plays center field and third base, batted .633 last season and is rated the best high school player in the city and one of the best in the country (he made USA Today's top 25), will hit balls out of the park. He hit 16 homers last season.
His teammates say they admire Manny, the son of a cab driver, for not acting cocky. But he would like to be identified in the newspaper as the Hitman. The big-league scouts are following the Hitman; so is Washington Heights. Even the neighborhood's greatest baseball success story -- a Panamanian immigrant named Rod Carew who graduated from Washington in 1964 and was recently elected to the Hall of Fame -- says he has heard of Manny Ramirez's bat.
Former Washington players still chasing big-league dreams will return. Roberto Ceballos, 20, who pitched in that championship game at Yankee Stadium, was there for the first exhibition this season.
Roberto walked out on the team his senior year. "The streets got to me," he said. He ended up spending the season in the hospital after being hit by a Lincoln. He says he wants to go to college and try for a comeback.
In the stands, his eyes were glued to the player in red shoes -- Manny Ramirez. "I just came to see my boy Manuel get a hot shot over the fence," he said. "I want him to get drafted. He's the one who has the best shot of all of us."
 
The Coach's Role
 Coach Mandl, calm and encouraging, will be flashing signs from the sidelines. On hot days, he will be sipping an orange juice and milk concoction called a morir sonando ("to die dreaming"), brought to him by Prisca Alvarez. Mrs. Alvarez is the mother of Javier Del Castillo. Her son -- who went to college on a baseball scholarship and hopes to be signed after graduation -- will be there to help the coach.
Washington will make mistakes. "Everyone thinks because they're Dominican they're born superstars," Coach Mandl said. "People don't know how hard they have to work."
Some public high school teams, like Cardozo and Canarsie in Brooklyn, left last week for spring training in Florida. Even with all the candy they sold, the Washington players can't think of Florida. With a $1,500 budget, they're already running out of balls. The coach is understandably ambivalent about all the balls Manny hits out in practice.
Washington's spring training was calisthenics on a wet and windy ballfield in New York City, hours of fielding grounders and batting practice.
Coach Mandl, who also teaches gym, gets paid about $3,000 for the season. He is not paid for his winter baseball club, open to the entire school and the neighborhood.
He is there for the baseball. Nineteen seasons ago, he was going to be Bensonhurst's next Sandy Koufax. But his future in baseball disappeared before he turned 17, when he ripped apart his knee playing basketball. Seven years ago, after working as a bank messenger and a substitute gym teacher, he became the Washington coach. "For a few years there, I didn't want to have anything to do with baseball," he said. "It hurt too much. When I came here, I got baseball back in my life."
The first exhibition was on the first day of spring. At his post inside the school entrance, Jose Estevez, a 26-year-old security guard, looked to seasons long gone. "I used to be a pitcher, back in Santo Domingo," he said.
At 3 P.M., in the clubhouse, Santos Herrarte put on his black-and-orange uniform for the first time. A year ago, he was in Santiago. Now, he anxiously approached the freshly painted blue wall where Coach Mandl had posted the lineup.
It said: "No. 7 -- Santos Herrarte -- second base." The rookie, who had been shy during practice, shouted joyfully -- "Herrarte!"
The rookie and his teammates grabbed their gloves and ran onto the field. Washington beat Cardozo, 5-1. In six exhibition games so far, their record is 4-1, with one tie.
Opening day is April 11.

HEADLINE: More Cubans Try to Leave as Hard Times Deepen

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 26

 BODY:
Faced with ever-tighter austerity measures, Cubans are seeking a way off their island in numbers not seen since the Mariel boatlift of 1980.
Cuba has been hard hit by decreases in trade and aid from its former East-bloc partners. Since October, the State Department says, 70,000 Cubans have applied for visas at the United States Interests Section in Havana, twice as many as in the entire previous year. 
 In one reflection of the increased desperation of Cubans seeking to leave, the United States Coast Guard said that in the waters off Florida this year it has already assisted 162 Cubans who were seeking to flee the island on vessels ranging from rubber inner tubes and makeshift rafts to small boats.
Before last year, the Coast Guard said, only 40 to 50 Cubans sought to reach the United States by sea each year. Officials said empty vessels from Cuba, presumably those of asylum-seekers who died in the passage, are now often found as well.
In addition to the increased illicit flow of ordinary Cubans out of the country by means like these, the island has in recent weeks seen growing numbers of high-profile defectors. Last week, a major in the Cuban Air Force piloted his MIG-23 fighter to Key West, where he was granted asylum.
A few days later, the prominent program director of Radio Progreso in Cuba, Romel Iglesias, announced his defection in a radio interview during a visit to Miami. Mr. Iglesias, one of two humorists on Cuban radio, said he had found it impossible to perform in the climate of deepening hardship.
"Clearly, what we are seeing is a reaction to the deteriorating economic situation in Cuba," said William M. LeoGrande, a professor of political science at American University in Washington who studies Cuban affairs.
 "The last time we saw increases like this was in 1979, and that was the prelude to Mariel," Mr. LeoGrande said, referring to the six-month boatlift of 125,000 Cubans to the United States. He said that now the Cuban economy is worst it has been in the 32 years of the revolution.
In the last year, Cubans have faced growing power cuts, shortages of food and clothing and increased rationing. Last winter, city workers began rotating shifts in farm jobs to boost sagging food production. And in one of the starkest illustrations of the austerity, the country has recently resorted to mass substitution of bicycles for automobiles because of a scarcity of oil.
While President Fidel Castro has promised in many informal pep talks and speeches that those hardships would ultimately prove beneficial by "testing our ability to overcome," the sharp decline in living standards seems mostly to have spurred interest in flight from the island.
Analysts say the Government has pursued a two-track approach to the phenomenon: employing increasingly virulent language against high-profile defectors, while lowering age barriers and other restrictions on emigration by ordinary citizens to reduce social tensions resulting from shortages and other economic problems.
Denouncing Mr. Iglesias for his defection, a Cuban radio commentary said, "Because of fear of danger, rats abandon ship."
To emigrate or travel abroad legally, Cubans must obtain an exit visa from their Government, a process that human rights experts say has long been fraught with political considerations. While gradually changing its emigration policies, the Cuba Government has complained of over-selectiveness by the United States in according visas.
The State Department rejects these accusations. Of the approximately 38,000 Cubans who applied for non-immigrant visas to the United States in 1990, a spokesman said, about 34,000 received them. By act of Congress in 1966, Cubans who came here on tourist visas, unlike people from other countries, are automatically allowed to apply for residence after one year in the United States.
"Cubans are treated very leniently when it comes to immigration to the United States," a State Department official said. "Other countries cannot be expected to set aside their laws just to please the Cuban Government."

HEADLINE: Kennett Square Journal;
A Corner Of Mexico Takes Root Far Away

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNETT SQUARE, Pa.

 BODY:
Jesus Pizano was 14 years old and had the equivalent of $5 and a pack of gum in his pocket when he left the arid highland plains of central Mexico for southeastern Pennsylvania. Here, in long cinder block buildings, amid the gentle slopes and less gentle scents of Chester County farmland, he and the other men of Moroleon pick mushrooms.
"My uncle worked in mushrooms for 15 years," said Mr. Pizano, who is now 24. "I always thought I would come here and pick mushrooms." 
 His journey to this rural area brings to life a main finding of the 1990 census. Mexican immigrants who come to the United States to pick crops are more and more establishing permanent settlements: here in Kennett Square, in tobacco country in Virginia and North Carolina, and among the truck farms of Minnesota.
"There is a dispersion going on," said David Simcox, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based research organization. "You find Hispanics where you didn't expect to find them in the past, in rural areas where they didn't exist before."
In the process, the ethnic makeup of these communities is undergoing a steady, sometimes swift transformation. Schools scramble to find Spanish-speaking teachers for programs teaching English as a second language. Tortillas appear in grocery stores next to apple butter. Kennett Square's police force now has a Spanish speaker; neighboring New Garden Township (population 5,403) has two new Mexican restaurants and a grocery that caters to Mexican-Americans.
While most of the nation's 32 million Hispanic residents are in Texas and California, or urban areas like New York City and Chicago, Kennett Square offers a classic example of the spread of the country's expanding Hispanic minorities to new areas.
The century-old mushroom industry here, which provides virtually year-round employment, has helped created a unique racial and ethnic mosaic. In the early part of the century, Italians worked for Quakers until they began to buy their own farms. The Italians first employed blacks, then white Tennesseans escaping the poverty of Appalachia and then Puerto Ricans fleeing the unemployment on their own island.
But over the past 15 years most of the Puerto Ricans have been supplanted by the young men of central Mexico. The turnover has been such that more than 75 percent of the industry's 3,500 workers, and virtually all the pickers, are now Mexican, said Jamie Ciarocchi, chairman of the American Mushroom Institute and an owner of the Modern Farms mushroom operation.
Pickers earn $1.10 a basket, and a good picker can fill seven or eight baskets an hour. Many work up to 60 hours a week.
Census figures for New Garden Township show one resident in five is Hispanic, up from 15.2 percent in 1980. The vast majority of these are from Moroleon and other towns in the spare landscape of mesas and cactus 100 miles north of Mexico City. Like Mr. Pizano, most crossed the Rio Grande illegally and most left their wives and children behind.
After passage of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which made it possible for some illegal aliens to obtain legal status, more than 2,000 agricultural workers were legalized in Chester County, almost all of them in the mushroom business, an immigration service report said.
"When I came, I never dreamed legalization was a reality," said Raymondo Ayllon, 28, a mushroom worker who left Guanajuato in 1980. "I didn't have long-range plans. I planned to stay till I got deported. Now I feel I can make plans for the future. As soon as I can bring my family, I will."
No one here claims to know the name of the first Mexican mushroom picker to find out about Chester County, or how the bridge between Moroleon and Kennett Square was built. Asked how they heard of Pennsylvania and mushrooming, worker after worker said "my uncle," or "my brother" or "a friend."
After workers become legal residents, they may petition the Government to have their families join them, and day after day Sister Jane Houtman, a Roman Catholic nun, sits in a small trailer on a back road as Mexicans knock on her door seeking help in filling out Government forms.
Many of the workers, like Mr. Pizano, speak little or no English. They hover around the edges of local life, eating in their new restaurants, listening to Spanish-language cable television, more a colony of Moroleon than a part of Kennett Square.
Sheila Druley, director of La Comunidad Hispana, a local service organization, hopes to change that by having her group help the Mexicans do everything from getting a driver's license to getting their children into schools.
Some of the Puerto Ricans who remain are also helping the Mexicans make the transition. Palmira Matos, a picker's daughter, works as a bilingual instructor in the migrant education program at Kennett High School, but she says she has been unable to break down the invisible wall between immigrants and natives.
"I don't have a lot of friends" among the non-Hispanic students, said one of her students, 15-year-old Maria Jacinto. "But I haven't heard anyone talk about conflict either."
Another student, Roberto Alvarez, 13, said, with neither regret nor pleasure, "I never had an American friend."

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times; Albanians Vote Today, and Opposition Presses On

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, March 30

 BODY:
The people of Albania, blinking in the first political daylight they have been exposed to in almost five decades, will vote on Sunday in multiparty elections organized by the governing Communist Party.
The outcome is unclear. No polls have been taken. But the Communists, led by President Ramiz Alia, are under pressure from a popular democratic movement launched by Tirana University students in December. 
 While the Communists hold their final election rallies for relatively small numbers of the party faithful behind the doors of meeting halls, the newly formed Democratic Party headed by a charismatic cardiologist, Dr. Sali Berisha, has convened its supporters in the open, drawing about 90,000 to its last rally in the capital on Friday. Tirana has a population of 300,000.
These are the first contested elections here since 1923, but in that year Albania still had a semifeudal society and the candidates were chosen mainly by clans.
 
Push for Freedoms
 Albania is Europe's poorest country and it has been governed since 1944 by a Stalinist regime formed by Enver Hoxha. He died in 1985 after naming Mr. Alia to succeed him. Last May, plainly concerned by the fall of Communist governments across Eastern Europe in 1989, President Alia opened what he called a process of "democratization."
But a huge number of Albanians, disgusted with the Communists' disastrous economic policies and abuse of basic human rights, soon made it clear that they wanted their freedom far faster than the Government was were prepared to allow.
They stormed foreign embassies by the thousands to gain asylum. They commandeered boats to cross the Adriatic to Italy. They demanded and obtained the opening of churches and mosques closed in 1967 as part of an official campaign against all religious worship.
Dozens of demonstrators were killed in clashes with the police, but the protests compelled the release of 329 political prisoners, some of whom had been jailed for as long as 30 years. They also forced Mr. Alia to sack a dozen Cabinet ministers and form a new Government last month.
In the same period, Mr. Alia sought to improve his image here by opening diplomatic relations with the United States, inviting American and other foreign observers to monitor the elections and declaring Albania's willingness to adhere to human-rights conventions under the 1975 Helsinki agreement.
But those and other concessions by the Communist Government may have come too grudgingly and too slowly to give the 65-year-old President a strong edge in the balloting, especially among the young, who make up perhaps one million of the 1.8 million electorate.
Mr. Alia's stump speeches indicate a sense of doubt about his party's chances. Repeatedly he said, "We made mistakes." On Friday at his first news conference, he said, "I am not a dictator," adding that the Communists would accept defeat "if that is the will of the people."
In contrast to the polite applause accorded to Mr. Alia and other Communist candidates for the 250-seat Parliament, huge crowds of Albanians cheered wildly for the candidates of the Democratic Party in the cities and even in remote mountain villages.
Near the port of Durres, four young Albanian soldiers walking on the highway this afternoon were carrying Democratic Party placards, flashing "V" signs to passing motorists.
The Communists still appear to have some strength in the countryside, which the opposition parties have had difficulty penetrating. Sixty percent of the Albanians live in rural communities.
The Democratic Party was founded in December by Dr. Berisha with Gramoz Pashko, an economics professor, together with a few student leaders and a worker. Other parties have also sprung up but have not gained widespread support.
The Alia Government has provided the opposition parties with space for campaign headquarters, some telephones and some automobiles in this country where private car ownership was banned until this month.
The Democrats have pledged to bring Albania "into Europe" and to create genuine "freedom and liberty." They have also hinted broadly that American economic assistance for Albania would be generous if they win.

THE ECONOMY
 
Albania does not release economic figures, but by Western estimates it is the poorest country in Europe. In 1981, the World Bank said Albania's per capita gross national product was $820. But the country is self-sufficient in grain and possesses considerable mineral resources, including chromium ore, the country's leading mineral export. Albania's hydroelectric potential is being expanded for increased export of electricity to neighboring countries.
 
THE PEOPLE
 
Ethnic Albanians make up about 97 percent of the country's 3.5 million people (based on the 1981 census). Before the Communist takeover in 1944, Albania was 70 percent Orthodox and 10 percent Catholic. In 1967, the Government outlawed religion, closed all houses of worship and declared Albania by law "the first atheist state in the world." The average monthly income is $60.
 
GEOGRAPHY
 
The country is 11,000 square miles, slightly larger than Maryland. Aside from coastal lowland along the Adriatic, the country is mountainous and rugged. It convers 210 miles from north to south and 90 miles at its widest point.
 
HISTORY
 
Albania, then called Illyria, was part of the Roman Empire from 176 B.C. until A.D. 395. For the next thousand years it was ruled by the Byzantines, Huns, Bulgarians and Slavs before coming under the control of the Ottoman Turks, Albania gained independence in 1912 but was occupied by Italy from 1914 until 1920. It became a republic in 1925, but was taken over by Italy again in 1939 and occupied in 1943 by the German Army. A group led by Communist was the strongest of the wartime resistance groups, taking power in 1944. The Communists began relaxing their control in 1989.

HEADLINE: The World;
'Clean Win' in the War With Iraq Drifts Into a Bloody Aftermath

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the nightmare continued for the 18 million people of Iraq last week, President Bush sought to put a period at the end of the Persian Gulf war, but it would not end. Indeed, the United States' "clean win," as Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had termed it, was being soiled by the bloodbath it had unleashed inside Iraq.
A victorious George Bush, who had exhorted the Iraqi masses to overthrow Saddam Hussein in the wake of his defeat on the battlefield, decided after a long meeting with his senior advisers on Tuesday that there had to be a limit to United States intervention in Iraq's internal affairs. 
 After having pointedly warned Baghdad not to use poison gas or combat aircraft anywhere in Iraq, warnings that had encouraged the rebellion, Mr. Bush pulled up short when Iraq continued to fly combat helicopters against the insurgents. The rebels said they could not stand up to that kind of attack, and asked to use captured Iraqi jets to fight back. Mr. Bush again said no.
The end of Mr. Bush's ambiguity toward the fate of the rebels spawned criticism that he was consigning the Iraqi people to murderous retribution, something the West was not willing to tolerate in Eastern Europe.
The situation was only complicated when the allied commander, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, wondered aloud in a television interview whether history would second-guess Mr. Bush's decision to stop the war just as he, General Schwarzkopf, was hours away from annihilating the Iraqi units that are now engaged in bringing dissident towns and cities to heel.
Thousands upon thousands of Iraqi refugees streamed into the American-held territory in southern Iraq and they reported that more refugee convoys were on the way. They included Iraqi Army deserters who said they had refused orders to gun down women and children, and civilians who told of unspeakable atrocities against members of their families.
The Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said Iraqi soldiers were still surrendering faster than the allies could send home the soldiers taken prisoner during the fighting. In addition to more than 60,000 Iraqis in prisoner of war camps, there were 25,000 civilian and military refugees in the American occupation zone, with the prospect that more violence and social breakdown inside the country could flush many times that number toward the borders.
In the north, a ragtag army of Kurdish rebels that effectively controlled Iraqi Kurdistan prepared for a battle for survival against the Republican Guard, which reclaimed Kirkuk after it fell to the rebels earlier in the week, albeit tenuously.
Some analysts wondered whether a harsh Iraqi crackdown in Kurdistan would trigger the same kind of exodus that occurred in September 1988, when Baghdad sought to crush Kurdish forces that had collaborated with Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. During that campaign of repression 100,000 Kurds, fearing death and chemical weapons, fled into neighboring Turkey and Iran.
Now, a month after the shooting stopped, as the United Nations prepares to vote on a formal cease-fire resolution, a number of Iraq watchers wonder if this is the beginning of the end for the rebellion and for the return of stability to Iraq.
More likely, it is just the end of the beginning of a long and vexing Persian Gulf crisis.
"What we have now is worse than what we had when Iraq was in Kuwait," said Christine Moss Helms, an Iraq scholar who has advised both the White House and the Pentagon during the crisis. "We have a situation where we entered the region to put down the Iraqi threat, and we spent $80 to $100 billion to do it, we ejected the Iraqis from Kuwait, but what did we get for it? We still don't have Saddam Hussein out of power and now we have this deteriorating situation on the frontier between the Persians, the Arabs and the Turks."
The core issue for Ms. Helms and for a number of other Mideast analysts was whether the United States and its allies went too far in devastating Iraq's armed forces and key elements of the country's economy, encouraging a premature uprising that may be doomed.
Referring to the Bush Administration, Ms. Helms said, "I think they'll lose either way: the longer they stay, anti-Americanism will increase throughout the Arab and Muslim world and if they leave, all these forces, rolling on their own momentum," will encourage an extended low-intensity war within Iraq where none of the contenders for power will be strong enough to prevail and where interested outsiders in Iran, Turkey and Syria will play behind the scenes to protect their own interests.
"If Iraq continues to disintegrate," Ms. Helms said, "it may be unstoppable, it may have a momentum of its own and the implications of the fragmentation of Iraq will go far beyond its borders" and affect the stability of Iran, Turkey and Syria.
Whatever the implications, it seemed certain that Mr. Bush, despite last week's White House pronouncement on neutrality, could not escape involvement in Iraq's internal affairs. To the contrary, Mr. Bush is set upon a course both to pressure Iraq's internal political structure and hobble its oil-exporting capabilities and to control the flow of basic technology into the country.
 Military power by its nature creates demands to use it, and as long as Mr. Hussein is in Baghdad, under pressure economically as instability reigns in much of his nation, the prospects for future crises in the region will remain.
 
A Continued Presence
 The White House and Pentagon have made clear that the moment a cease fire is signed, about 100,000 United States Army troops from the VII Corps will pull out as soon as possible and relinquish their occupation responsibilities to a United Nations observer force and Red Cross officials.
But even if American forces leave Iraq in coming weeks, the United States will continue to be the dominant military power in the Persian Gulf through the military alliance that Mr. Bush is erecting with his Arab allies. The United States Central Command is rushing to complete its blueprint for a new Arab-American security force, heavily dependent on American air and naval power. And the State Department and Pentagon are working on a long-term strategy to squeeze Iraq economically -- at a cost of more suffering for its people -- until Mr. Hussein is forced from power.
This strategy is not without its contradictions.
Mr. Bush says he has nothing against the people of Iraq, yet even after a United Nations team reported that allied bombers had returned the country to a "pre-industrial age," Mr. Bush is in effect asking the Iraqi people, who had little to say about Mr. Hussein's rise to power to begin with, to either challenge his rule at great personal risk or suffer the consequences of pre-industrial deprivation extended indefinitely.
The prevailing view among the United States intelligence community and some Arab allies in the Mideast is that Mr. Hussein probably cannot survive for more than 12 months. This assessment may have been one factor encouraging Mr. Bush to stay at arms' length from what may be a transitory uprising and instead make a play to influence the succession in Baghdad, if there is one. He will try to persuade the leadership class in the army and in the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party to make the necessary change.
But it is always dangerous to bet that you can change a regime in the Arab world, where tribe, family and the modern technologies of control conspire to perpetuate rule. The Reagan Administration became obsessed with driving Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi from power in Libya, only to be repeatedly frustrated.
As Mr. Bush prepares to cement his anti-Hussein policy in place, he will have to differentiate between the pursuit of that objective and its impact on the people of Iraq, who will have to live with the consequences.

HEADLINE: PRO HOCKEY;
Penguins' First Title Is Cause to Celebrate

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
Most of the time, winning a division title in the National Hockey League's regular season is a little like qualifying to buy life insurance. It's good to have it, but there isn't much cause for celebration. Even local sportscasters sometimes announce such a hometown achievement after the Final Four basketball preview and the baseball scores from spring training.
For the Pittsburgh Penguins, their winning of the Patrick Division title last week was treated somewhat differently. When the team clinched by defeating Detroit on Wednesday night, players donned colorful T-shirts that announced their success. 
 A thousand fans greeted the team plane the next day at the airport. Flowers, balloons and telegrams arrived in the Civic Arena locker room. A long line formed at the box office window to buy the remaining playoff tickets.
The Penguins haven't yet attained the stature of the Steel Curtain Pittsburgh Steelers team, which once dominated the National Football League, or even of the Family of Pirates, which was one of baseball's best. And the division title means only that the Penguins get a playoff spot -- along with 15 other teams -- and the home ice in the first two rounds.
But after 24 seasons of mismanagement, financial crisis and early spring vacations, the hockey team's first pennant has given the citizens who follow hockey something to shout about.
"Not one banner or pennant in the building," said Bob Johnson, the coach. "This is a start."
On the blackboard inside the locker room, somebody had written: "Even the mighty oak tree begins with a tiny acorn. (We have the seed)."
After they play the Rangers tonight at Madison Square Garden in the regular-season finale, the Penguins will open the Stanley Cup playoffs Wednesday night at home against the New Jersey Devils. It will be only the second time in the last nine seasons that they have been part of the tournament.
A major reason for the turnaround is Johnson, who is part of an intriguing collection of Penguin people who were not with the team a year ago. A 60-year-old American, Johnson is finishing his first season as Pittsburgh coach after spending the previous three as executive director of USA Hockey, which supervised the sport at the amateur level up to the Olympic team. He is the oldest coach in the N.H.L.
"He has such enthusiasm for the game," said Tom Barrasso, the first-string goalie. "He comes to the rink and enjoys himself. There is never a stale day for him. That makes it entertaining for all of us."
 One of his players, Jaromir Jagr, is a talented and emotional 19-year-old rookie from Czechoslovakia and is the youngest player in the league. His point total of 56 is among the best for first-year players.
"He's a challenge," Johnson said, "because he is a young player. He's getting better all the time."
In between these extremes are Ulf Samuelsson, Grant Jennings and Ron Francis, obtained earlier this month from Hartford, and Bryan Trottier, a 16-year veteran who stopped here this season on his way from the Islanders to the Hall of Fame.
Among the holdovers from last season are Mark Recchi, a right wing who has emerged as the team's top scorer with 113 points; Paul Coffey, a defenseman with 93 points who remains one of the league's best skaters and attackers at his position, and Kevin Stevens, a left wing who is having his best season with 85 points.
And then, of course, there is Mario Lemieux, the best player on the team, one of the greatest players of this era, and one who has often been overlooked while laboring through a star-crossed career.
 At midseason, the Penguins were holding on to fourth place. Their surge to the top coincided with both the demise of the Rangers and the return of Lemieux, who missed almost an entire calendar year with back pain, back surgery and a post-operative back infection.
Back in the lineup for only 25 games this season, Lemieux had 19 goals and 26 assists after yesterday's 4-4 tie with Philadelphia. He scored three goals in a 3-1 victory over the Flyers on Tuesday night but missed Wednesday's title clinching because his left eye was stitched and swollen shut where a puck hit it the night before. Had it hit an inch lower, it might have resulted in another career-threatening injury.
Despite scoring titles, a most-valuable-player award and All-Star status, Lemieux has played for seven years in the long shadow of Wayne Gretzky and, recently, alongside the glare of Brett Hull. With the Penguins so often missing the playoffs, Lemieux has not received the recognition that comes from the post-season spotlight.
Physically, Lemieux still feels occasional pain in the back and says he is still on medication. As recently as last autumn, he wondered if he would ever play again.
"It was certainly a tough period in my life," he said. "I certainly had some doubts about playing hockey again.
"I couldn't walk for a couple months. It was pretty tough. I didn't expect the infection. It was worse than the surgery. It was very painful. I had a lot of support from a lot of different people: my family, my friends, my doctor, my teammates. That's what you need when you are down."
 During the post-game celebration Wednesday, Jagr approached Lemieux with a photographer in tow and asked him to pose for a picture with arms around each other's shoulders.
Jagr is of similar size and plays with many of the same skills. His hair is long and curly like Lemieux's and he wears the number 68 while Lemieux wears 66. "He is my favorite," Jagr said.
Jagr was the first draft choice of Craig Patrick, the general manager who replaced Tony Esposito last season. Patrick, the former general manager of the Rangers, was the assistant coach and assistant general manager of the 1980 United States Olympic team, which won the gold medal. One of his first hires at the executive level was Scotty Bowman as director of player development and recruitment.
Like Johnson, who has had success at the high school, college and professional levels, Bowman came with an impressive track record. He coached the Montreal Canadiens to four consecutive Stanley Cup titles in the 1970's.
The division title, Patrick said, "is one, small step." But sustaining their regular-season success through the playoffs may be difficult for the Penguins. Their division is the weakest in the league and their record would rank no better than third in the Norris or Smythe, second in the Adams. Although their goal total of 335 is best in the league, they have given up 295, more than all but Quebec, Vancouver and Toronto.
"People are going to realize we've got a shot," Stevens said, speaking of the Stanley Cup. "It's not going to be one of those teams that is a fluke. We worked our way to the playoffs and we're going to work our way right through them. Wednesday night, we're going to be raring to go."

Albany, Squeezed, Puts Pressure on Local Governments

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
WITH its vast office complexes and almost 200,000 employees, New York State government often seems like an empire unto itself. But despite its imposing size, the government is, for the most part, just a way station for tax money. The state collects it from all corners of the state, then redistributes it to counties and villages and school districts according to elaborate -- and often manipulated -- formulas.
This year, as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders wrangle over how to close a $6 billion budget gap, it is the state's function as middleman for its municipalities that is most sorely being challenged. By the time New York finally resolves its budget problems, a process that is expected to extend for several years, many experts predict that the state's role as broker will have changed substantially, as local governments are forced to rely on their own resources. 
 But already, as this exercise haltingly gets under way -- the state budget, due tomorrow, will be late again for the seventh year in a row -- many groups are questioning whether the cure will prove worse than the disease.
"State aid is a leveling device," said Cynthia Green, an analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses. "For those communities that can't adequately finance needed services, the state has the capacity to help. It has a broader tax base, and a wider range of residents with different incomes to tax. So to the degree that the state cuts aid to local governments, equity will probably be lost."
 
Angry Local Officials

 
 To close the state's budget gap, Governor Cuomo has proposed spending cuts totaling $4.5 billion. About three quarters of these cuts, or $3.3 billion, come out of money that would have gone to local governments, which last year received in aid roughly two thirds of the $29 billion the state collected in taxes. The proposed cuts include a $428 million reduction in unrestricted aid to localities and an $875 million cut in aid to school districts.
To close the remainder of the gap, the Governor has proposed a 10-cent-a-gallon increase in the state's gasoline tax and a diverse assortment of other "revenue enhancements." But he has staunchly resisted calls from many quarters to raise the income tax to offset some of the cuts, saying that this would hurt the state's competitive position.
Confronted by hordes of angry local officials, Cuomo administration officials have adamantly maintained that municipal governments can cut their budgets just as the officials plan to cut the state's.
"There is going to be a shock of realization at the local level," the Governor's budget director, Dall W. Forsythe, said. "But I don't think the answer will be higher taxes at the local level."
Local officials, however, say there is a limit to how much they can cut spending and still pick up trash, provide police protection and educate children. By refusing to raise state taxes, they say, the Governor is simply forcing them to raise local taxes to make up the difference.
"The men and women in the State Capitol have as big a role in raising local taxes as the men and women who run local governments," said Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties.
At this point, it is too early to tell how much of the proposed cuts in state aid will translate into the reduced spending the Governor has suggested, and how much into the higher taxes local officials say they fear. But at least some increase in local taxes seems unavoidable. New York City, for example, has already announced plans to increase income and property taxes to make up for some of the loss in state aid. And with New York City's taxes so high already, many experts are questioning whether a city tax increase won't prove more damaging than a state tax increase.
"It makes more sense to raise the state income tax than the New York City income tax," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York in Albany. While Governor Cuomo has resisted an increase in the state's income tax on the grounds that it would harm the state's economy, Mr. Gold and other experts say that an increase in the city's income tax is likely to drive out even more businesses than an increase at the state level.
"New York State's income tax is the fourth or fifth highest in the country, depending on what income level you're at," Mr. Gold said. "But New York City's income tax is just in the stratosphere." To the state's top tax rate of 7.87 percent, New York City adds another 3.9 percent, and it plans to increase this to 4.3 percent.
The question of what will happen to local taxes as a result of the state budget is particularly significant in New York because the state already relies so heavily on local taxes. While most states raise roughly half of their revenues -- excluding Federal funds -- from state taxes, in 1989, the last year for which data are available, New York raised only 39 percent of its revenues through state taxes. Over the years, this proportion has been falling; in 1988, New York raised 40 percent of its revenues through state taxes.
When one looks closely at the figures, one sees that it is local taxes, not state taxes that are responsible for New York's reputation as a high tax state.
For each $100 a person earned in New York last year, roughly $7.55 was paid in state taxes, less than would have been paid in 20 other states. But the New York State resident also paid $8.01 in local taxes for every $100 earned. That was more than a resident of any other state would have paid. Taken together, New York's state and local taxes are second only to Alaska, which raises most of its revenues from oil companies.
Cuomo administration officials say that New York's high local tax rates raise questions about the efficiency of local governments. But local officials say that much of the responsibility for the tax rates lies with the state, which sets requirements for local-government spending in such areas as education, criminal justice and medical care. New York, they point out, is one of only a handful of states that requires its municipalities to pick up a share of Medicaid and welfare costs.
"Sixty percent of our budgets are mandated," Mr. Crawford of the Association of Counties said.
In the clamor of name-calling and fault-finding that passes for state budget negotiations in Albany, policy questions about the appropriate relationship between state and local government are often lost in the tumult. But these questions are emerging as the central issue facing the Governor and the Legislature over the coming decade, and resolving them may take almost that long.
"There may well be some real changes that are made in the structure of state and local taxes," Mr. Forsythe, the Governor's budget director, said. "But I think this is a debate that's going to go on for some years."

People on the Move Tax Nerves and Resources

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
ITALY showed some of Western Europe's new toughness toward migrants from the East when it yanked the welcome mat from under 20,000 Albanians who had sailed across the Adriatic in rickety ships early this month.
They had come in search of work and refuge along the heel of the Italian boot. Instead, they found squalor and fear of epidemic. In the overwhelmed port of Brindisi, it took the Government days to mobilize the forces to provide food, shelter and showers. The official Italian line was clear, and it was intended to be heard by tens of thousands of other Albanians looking to escape Eastern Europe's last Communist bastion: You are not political refugees, and if you come here you risk indifferent treatment and possible repatriation. 
 Similar barriers are being raised, along with expressions of concern, across Western Europe and elsewhere as the world faces enormous waves of migration that have had no parallel since at least World War II.
Over the last two or three years, millions have been displaced -- lured by hoped-for jobs in richer lands or evicted by hostile regimes, impelled to flee because of the devastation of war or oppressive rule, or suddenly free to roam thanks to liberating events like Communism's collapse in Eastern Europe.
 
A Flow of Humanity
 Their movements have been as diverse as humanity itself:
About 310,000 ethnic Turks abandoned Bulgaria in 1989 in the face of forced assimilation imposed by the then-Communist regime. A year earlier, 60,000 Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey saying they had been attacked with chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein's troops.
Some 150,000 Soviet Jews moved in 1990 to Israel, a near record number that will continue to grow and that has already triggered alarm in neighboring Arab countries. Soviet Jews aside, more than a million Poles, Yugoslavs, Albanians, ethnic Hungarians and Germans and other Eastern Europeans are estimated to have sought asylum and opportunity in the West last year.
From Honduras, about 50,000 Nicaraguans have moved back home now that the Sandinistas are out of power. Perhaps 2 million Mexicans cross illegally into the United States every year looking for work. Countless tens of thousands of North Africans sailed into southern Europe last year for similar reasons, and more than 70,000 Vietnamese migrants are known to have gone in 1990 to the United States, Canada and Australia. Tens of thousands of Pakistanis and Filipinos entered Japan both legally and otherwise.
 None of this includes the 850,000 or more Egyptians, Bangladeshis, Indians, Sri Lankans and others who found themselves uprooted with virtually no warning by the Persian Gulf crisis. These were workers in Kuwait and Iraq, whose departure last summer and fall created sudden hardships both for themselves and their native countries.
For example, some 450,000 Egyptian workers are believed to have returned home, creating an emergency for more than 1.5 million people, according to officials in Cairo. Estimates of the overall costs -- in terms of lost remittances, forfeited tax revenues, property abandoned in Iraq and Kuwait and spending for those coming home -- run into the billions of dollars. That for a country where the per capita gross national product comes to $550 a year.
These new migrations come on top of earlier movements, some going back decades, that have made more or less permanent residents of people like the 1.6 million Turks in Germany, or the Palestinians who make up at least half of Jordan's 3 million people, or the many thousands of Cambodians who have spent more than a decade in refugee camps along the Thai-Cambodian border.
It is often tempting to describe these displaced souls as refugees. In fact, few qualify for that designation and the exemptions it often brings from routine demands for entry visas, work permits, invitations and proof of hard currency. Under the 1951 Geneva Convention, a refugee is someone with "a well-founded fear of being persecuted in his country of origin for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion." Simply running away from hard times back home is not good enough. Nor is escaping from a war or an environmental catastrophe like the burning oilfields of Kuwait. The United Nations counts 16 million as refugees, but millions more are in similar circumstances.
 
No Welcome Mat
 As a result, many emigres, especially those from the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, find themselves trapped by a form of Catch-22. When they could easily claim they were political refugees from Communism, they could not get out. Now that they can move with relative ease, few can claim to be refugees. As the Albanians discovered in Brindisi, they have fewer recourses when one industrialized country after another says that there is neither room nor jobs for them.
Soviet Jews insist they still qualify as refugees because of pervasive anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union. But the United States, for one, is not so convinced, and it has set a ceiling of 50,000 Soviet migrants this year. Those limitations partly explain why so many Soviet Jews are turning to Israel, increasing political pressures in the explosive region.
With economic imperatives lying behind so much of the worldwide migration, affluent nations have been feeling they must stem the flow to protect their own interests.
United States immigration officials say that each year they apprehend up to a million Mexicans trying to enter the country illegally; they also acknowledge, however, that perhaps twice as many slip through the net. In Japan, never known for taking kindly to strangers, there are periodic sweeps against illegal migrants, usually from southern Asia, and sometimes also against companies that hire them.
But the most explosive changes have occurred in the last two years in Europe, where the prosperous West, after having encouraged change in the East for so long, is now scrambling to keep its poor Eastern cousins from flocking its way. Western Europeans are conspicuously worried about the Soviet Union, where a new migration law is being prepared that would codify people's rights to walk out the front door.
According to some estimates, as many as 30 million Soviet citizens are prepared to move. The Soviet delegate to a conference on European migration held in Vienna in January insisted that a more probable figure was 1.5 million to 2 million. In any event, "the Soviet Union's emigration potential is in theory immense," a French social demographer, Jean-Claude Chesnais, warned at a similar conference in Rome this month. "Political, economic, religious and cultural factors all combine to make an increasing number of people want to leave the country."
The West's hope is to keep them where they are. One solution is to provide emergency assistance and long-term investment so that staying home will seem more attractive. Another idea is to discourage Eastern Europeans from believing that the West is a land of milk and honey. The International Organization for Migration, a Geneva-based group, advises the West to tell would-be immigrants about true job prospects, especially in countries like Greece, Spain and Italy, where unemployment rates are already high.
Even before the new influx from the East, the 12 members of the European Community were showing increasing impatience and hostility toward immigrants, especially from the third world. There has been a general tightening of immigration laws, rooted in a concern that any migrant managing to enter any one community country will be free to circulate throughout the other 11.
Racial incidents occur these days with depressing regularity even in countries like Italy, which has long prided itself on tolerance. Across Europe, North Africans and Turks who account for much of the migration are often regarded as threats to ethnic and cultural unity. Sometimes they are accused of taking jobs from natives, even though in many cases they fill low-paid jobs that the locals no longer will accept.
 Demographers now worry that the new east-to-west migration may eclipse the more traditional movement from south to north by shrinking job opportunities for third-world immigrants. And unemployment pressures in so-called lesser developed countries are not about to disappear as populations soar. One migration expert at the Rome conference, Prof. Reginald T. Appleyard of the University of Western Australia, reported that in 20 years those poor countries alone will have to generate more new jobs than now exist in the entire developed world.
Inevitably, many of those people will be forced to look elsewhere for work. In the face of such needs, specialists caution that simply shutting the West's front door will not be a useful solution.

American-Soviet Dealings Switch to the Slow Lane

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was in Moscow two weeks ago he drove to his meeting with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, in the embassy's Cadillac limousine. As the sleek black car approached the entrance of the Foreign Ministry conference center it broke down. Mr. Baker had to get out and walk, while his security guards pushed the car the rest of the way.
The scene symbolized United States-Soviet relations these days. Just as the two nations seemed on the verge of arriving somewhere really new, the understandings that were carrying them there broke down and nobody quite knows when, or if, the mechanics will have them repaired. 
 It is not that the two sides are returning to the cold war. But the great leaps forward in arms control, integration of a united Germany into Europe, easing the Soviets out of Eastern Europe and economic cooperation that took place during the first 18 months of the Bush Administration are clearly over. Administration officials say they are not thinking up new ways to "engage" the Soviets, as they were a year ago. Rather, they are thinking of new ways to lock in the limited progress of the first 18 months before events in the Soviet Union become so chaotic that even that slips away.
"We are in a consolidation phase," one Administration specialist on Soviet affairs said. "We are just trying to close out the progress we've made and to prevent backsliding."
Why the backsliding? In short, economic chaos has combined with political confrontations like the one last week between advocates of faster change and independence-minded republics on one side and hard-line central authorities lined up behind President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the other. This in turn has forced the Soviet leader to rely on the traditional institutions of the army and the K.G.B. to hold his union together. Considering that the Soviet Union owns more than 30,000 nuclear warheads and 46 rather shaky nuclear reactors, the fate of this union is critical for world stability.
In the Faustian bargain, Mr. Gorbachev had to sign away some of his freedom of action in foreign policy. This in turn prompted the architect and implementer of many of his foreign policy successes, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, to resign as Foreign Minister in despair. The Soviet military and the industrial complex that supports it resented many of the concessions Mr. Shevardnadze made during the withdrawal from Eastern Europe and they have tried to compensate by trying to force Mr. Gorbachev to get better terms from the Americans in arms control, American officials say.
This first manifested itself last November with the signing in Paris of the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe, which requires the Soviets to withdraw thousands of tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces from Eastern Europe to bring their numbers down to NATO's levels. After the treaty was signed the Soviet side announced that it was reclassifying three motorized rifle divisions, based near the Baltic and Black seas, and their 2,500 pieces of equipment, as naval "shore defenses." Since the treaty covers only ground forces and equipment, the Soviets argued that these units would not be subject to limits.
The Soviet military, having given up its considerable advantage in European land forces, had been militating for limits on naval forces, where the West has superiority. The Americans rejected this demand and the Soviet political leadership was not willing to insist on it. So the Soviet military's post-treaty reclassification of its three divisions was a sure way to signal its displeasure. Washington immediately cried foul, and announced that it would not even consider sending the treaty to the Senate for ratification unless the Soviets backed down. Mr. Bush wrote to Mr. Gorbachev last week asking him to overrule the reclassification, and Administration officials say they sense the Soviets are now making a real effort to find a compromise.
 
Delay by Minutiae
 In addition, the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty, which would slash the Soviet and American nuclear arsenals by about 30 percent, is being held up by a variety of arcane technical issues involving mechanisms for verifying the treaty. Although these disputes could be easily resolved by reciprocal concessions, "the Soviet military feel that they have been ridden over roughshod in recent talks, that the Soviet side has made most of the concessions, and they do not feel that they should have to make the last few," Raymond L. Garthoff, a Soviet expert at the Brookings Institution, recently wrote in the journal Arms Control Today.
But the Soviet officials are not the only ones digging in their heels. American negotiators admit that they became spoiled in the days when the very forward-leaning Mr. Shevardnadze was Foreign Minister and every dispute seemed to be resolved with the Soviets giving 80 percent and the Americans 20 percent.
"We have this notion that we will get whatever we want," said Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., president of the Arms Control Association. "In the end it may be true, but there is a danger that the Soviet military may simply say 'these treaties are all weighted toward the NATO side and we can live without them. We are going to reduce anyway, but let's do it in our way and at our own pace.' "
On the economic front, last December President Bush offered the Soviets $1 billion in federally guaranteed loans so that they could buy American food. He also offered to lift all the various longstanding restrictions on trade with Moscow, and to begin a new trade agreement, as soon as the Soviets passed a law codifying their new freer emigration policies. But the emigration bill is still languishing in the Supreme Soviet and as a result the new trade treaty, which has been completed, is not being sent to Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, Mr. Gorbachev's decision to eschew the radical free-market economic reform plan has killed what little appetite existed in the Administration for aggressively assisting the Soviet transition to a free market. The same is true for many private American businesses. As the United States Trade Representative, Carla Hills, recently observed, a lot of American companies that did business with the Soviet Union in the last year "didn't get paid and that has taken a certain bloom off the rose."
And so it is with the whole relationship. The Soviet Union is simply a superpower in decline and American-Soviet relations today are focusing on managing that bumpy decline in the most stable manner possible. It requires some real diplomatic juggling, said one senior Administration official. With one hand, American diplomats have to engage whatever Soviet central authority exists to try to make deals in those areas where the United States has vital interests -- arms control, for instance -- while, with another hand, they broaden contacts with leaders of the individual Soviet republics just in case the place does fall apart. But two hands are not enough. With still another hand, they have to try to encourage democracy and free markets, without allowing the inevitable disappointments to choke off all other contacts. And a fourth hand, American officials say, is kept symbolically tied behind their backs in recognition that ultimately their ability to influence the outcome of events in the Soviet Union is limited indeed.

HEADLINE: There's More Than One Way to Save Gas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Save Gasoline a Better Way" (editorial, March 7) assumes there is only one way to save gasoline, when there are many. We don't have to choose between fuel efficiency standards and gas taxes. Efficiency standards and energy taxes will work best together and with other methods to reduce our dependence on foreign and domestic oil. The auto industry is a slow-moving beast; to get it moving, we need not only the carrot and the stick, but maybe also a firecracker and a whip. 
 Efficiency standards reduce per-vehicle fuel consumption and deserve much credit for bringing our car and light-truck fleet above the 20 miles a gallon mark. But safe and practical cars could be built with more than double the fuel efficiency average of about 28 miles a gallon.
One tasty carrot to get these cars to market is the "feebate," a combination of fees and rebates to penalize new car buyers for falling below the efficiency minimums and reward them for going beyond. The fees pay for the rebates, and the mechanism allows both consumers and manufacturers to make market choices.
The notion that improved fuel economy costs money and lives is curious, given the money and lives spent defending Kuwait. Reducing weight need not reduce safety. It is also only one way to get better mileage, along with improved combustion engineering, transmission design, aerodynamics and other advances that usually save more money than they cost.
We need to attack our oil dependency on all fronts: fuel efficiency, feebates, gas taxes and an alternative to the private automobile through developing mass transportation on the European model, which will help solve many of our problems at once. If fuel efficiency standards don't work, why are the automakers so afraid of them?

HEADLINE: Hunt for Marcos's Billions Yields More Dead Ends Than Hard Cash

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
After a five-year hunt through the courts and banking systems of three continents, the Philippine Government has uncovered yachts and paintings and silver services and a few hundred million dollars, but not much more of the $5 billion or more Ferdinand E. Marcos is said to have stolen from his country.
As the six-year term of President Corazon C. Aquino nears its end next year, a touch of desperation has entered the search and her Government has begun talking of cutting its losses and making deals with Mr. Marcos's widow, Imelda. 
 Lawyers and Government officials involved in the search now say it will probably never be known just how much Mr. Marcos, who died in Hawaii in 1989, stole from the Philippines during his 20 years as President. Whatever the total, they say, it is now clear that only a small portion will be recovered.
 
Chocolate Tab Is $6,000
 Caesar Parlade, a former member of the agency seeking to recover the Marcos funds, the Presidential Commission on Good Government, put the possible total recovery at $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
"There is a large gap between what was stolen and what remains," he said in an interview. "If you look at the records you find that on one of her trips Imelda was able to spend $6,000 on the first day for chocolates. That is the kind of lifestyle that used up the money."
In the Philippines, peremptory confiscations of property, deals with some of Mr. Marcos's "cronies" and scores of civil suits have won the Government about $100 million in cash and another $100 million in assets that range from horses to hotels and from planes to sugar plantations.
In the United States, the Government has recovered banks, buildings and assorted baubles from the Marcos residences. It has succeeded, in a Los Angeles court, in freezing the Marcos assets worldwide. But it failed in New York in a case brought by American officials to convict Mrs. Marcos of racketeering in the purchase of properties with stolen Government funds.
The biggest single haul could come in Switzerland, where the Supreme Court ruled recently that the Philippine Government is entitled to recover $350 million in Marcos bank accounts in that country.
The pursuit of the Marcos wealth began with wads of cryptic documents that were left scattered through Malacanang Palace in Manila when Mr. Marcos and his entourage fled on the night of Feb. 26, 1986.
 
A Moral and Material Crusade
 With her first presidential decree after seizing office in a nearly bloodless "people power" uprising, Mrs. Aquino promised her people she would track down and recover the wealth and use it to help rebuild her country, one of the poorest in Asia.
The recovery was seen as a symbol of the moral crusade with which she came to power, and her first commissioner of the recovery effort, Jovito Salonga, now the Senate President, offered no quarter.
"A deal would amount to saying that it is all right for an official to steal, so long as he is ready to share his loot with the state later -- if prosecuted," Mr. Salonga said then.
It was he who first estimated the Marcos wealth at $5 billion or more, and Manila has stood by that estimate even as it scales back its goals and begins to talk of making deals.
 
Spending Goes Unchecked
 Within the Philippines, the Government moved to seize the assets of Mr. Marcos and his associates, but many of these became entangled in complicated court challenges as the wealthy men in the Marcos camp hired the nation's best lawyers.
For the assets the Government did recover, Mr. Parlade now urges quick disposal, worrying that they could pose "a great temptation" for Marcos-style corruption by the next President.
Abroad, the suit in a Federal court in Los Angeles froze the Marcos assets and resulted in an order under which Mrs. Marcos must submit an accounting of any expenditures over $10,000. Officials within the Philippine commission said Mrs. Marcos continues to spend freely, maintaining that her money comes from one of her daughters.
Most other efforts have proved unproductive, however, as the Philippine Government discovered that Mr. Marcos was a virtuoso in hiding his money in accounts everywhere from Lichtenstein to the Cayman Islands.
Some investigators who have been involved with the wealth-recovery effort say the inefficiency and political infighting that has characterized the Aquino Government may have cost the nation millions of dollars in potential recoveries.
 
Investigators Accused
 The presidential commission was itself accused of corruption almost from its first days, and has labored under controversy. Although few of the accusations have been proved, a number of the commission's fiscal agents have been charged with corruption and removed.
But Mr. Parlade, reflecting on the commission's difficulties, said, "From what I have seen, it is not corruption; it's ineptness."
Like much of the Government, he said, the commission has become bogged down in its own bureaucracy and hobbled by a constant turnover of its staff. Its approach and its politics have zigzagged as it has lurched through a succession of four commissioners.
And while the commission floundered, Mr. Parlade said, some Marcos assets have dropped dramatically in value. The Redwood Bank in San Francisco, for example, has depreciated because of bad investments from $40 million to about $6.5 million. The California Overseas Bank in Los Angeles, which was once worth $30 million, is now worth no more than $14 million, he said.
 
Assets Dwindle During Search
 Severina Rivera, who was legal director for the international recovery effort until December 1988, said property depreciation and Government mismanagement had cost millions of dollars in potential recoveries from four buildings in New York.
"With all the expenses of litigation, the Philippines got nothing out of the buildings when we could easily have made $100 million if we had sold in 1988," she said.
Political changes at the top tend to bring broad shifts in social and economic power in the Philippines. In this tradition, some of the recovered wealth seems to have changed hands from friends and relatives of Mr. Marcos to friends and relatives of Mrs. Aquino.
The President has said she does not plan to run for a second term, and whatever the outcome, the 1992 election is expected to mark an end to any vigorous pursuit of the Marcos wealth, as political power shifts.
 
'Aquino Corruption' on Agenda
 Looking ahead, some opponents are already preparing to supercede the search for Marcos wealth with an investigation of "Aquino corruption."
One of the new front-runners in the jockeying to succeed Mrs. Aquino is her estranged cousin, Eduardo Cojuangco, who was one of Mr. Marcos's closest associates and who returned to Manila under mysterious circumstances in 1989.
With some Filipinos suggesting that he only wants to become President to protect his own extensive assets, the possibility has arisen that Mr. Cojuangco could in the end be one of the big winners in the story of the Marcos wealth.
At the same time, after years of stubborn refusal, Mrs. Aquino said this month that Mrs. Marcos could return to the Philippines to face trial, a move that would meet a legal condition set by the Swiss Government for recovery of the funds held there.
Last fall the Government disclosed that it was negotiating with Mrs. Marcos for a settlement that some officials said might allow her to keep 60 percent of her assets, though their total extent remains unknown.
The deal under discussion apparently would have terminated attempts through the courts to recover all the Marcos wealth in return for funds held in Hong Kong, if these totaled $250 million or more.
Mrs. Marcos maintained that a formal agreement had been signed. But David Castro, the current commissioner of the presidential panel, insisted that the talks had only been exploratory.
 
Compromise Is Defended
 There was also an angry public reaction in Manila last November when the Government revealed that it had reached an agreement with one of Mr. Marcos's closest associates, Roberto Benedicto, to share with him in nearly equal portions $31 million in Swiss bank deposits in his name.
Defending the dealmaking, Mr. Castro said in an interview that in a legal process, "Compromise is required by the rules."
He added that overseas legal expenses in the search for the Marcos wealth had already reached $8 million, and that continued litigation could take many more years, with diminishing returns.
Without compromises, he said, the Philippines can only expect to recover the $350 million in Swiss banks and perhaps $250 million more from the Los Angeles suit, which seeks the return of all the Marcos assets.
One of Mr. Castro's precedessors as commissioner, Ramon Diaz, who is now Ambassador to Canada, disagreed strongly with this reasoning, saying: "This is not simply a legal case but an ethical case. You should never make deals with Marcos. You just open the door for others to follow."
He added: "Imelda is not supposed to retain anything. That is stolen money."
 
Still the Marcos Philippines
 The degeneration of the recovery effort from a moral crusade to a duel among sharp lawyers has brought a deep sense of disillusionment to many Filipinos. They say it is a signal that the country has remained in effect the Marcos Philippines, rather than some new Aquino Philippines, as it continues to labor under his legacy of corruption, economic decline and political violence.
Belinda Aquino, the author of "The Politics of Plunder," a book about Marcos corruption, said that along with most Filipinos, she had run out of hope that the Government would live up to its promise of fundamental change.
"We didn't really have a social revolution," said Ms. Aquino, who is no relation to the President. "We had a political upheaval in which we got rid of Marcos, but that's about it.
"Now with these deals, the message that is being sent to the Philippines is that it pays to steal, that crime pays. I think something should be done. But it's almost kind of too late, and what can you do?"

HEADLINE: Dr. Anderson's Gene Machine

BYLINE: BY ROBIN MARANTZ HENIG; Robin Marantz Henig is a Washington-based medical writer at work on a book about new virus diseases.

 BODY:
"HOW ARE YOU DOING, KID?" THE DOCTOR ASKS HIS young patient, hugging and tickling her and trying to make her giggle. The girl looks up at him with huge dark eyes, but since a stranger is in the room today she is too shy to smile. She is a quiet 4-year-old whose solemn gaze can be a bit unnerving. As she drinks chocolate milk and zaps the hospital television with the remote-control device, she seems oblivious to the fact that she is making medical history.
It's a bright blue day, and the child is back at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., for another monthly infusion of genetically engineered blood cells. She has adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, a rare inherited condition that makes her unable to manufacture ADA, an enzyme crucial to the immune system. Without ADA, she is as vulnerable to infection as a person with AIDS. 
 The Band-Aid on her left hand is the only sign that the child, whose family has requested anonymity, is going through any medical procedure at all, much less a trailblazing one. But the doctor hugging her is acutely aware of the significance of every small gesture. Infusing this little girl with the genes she is missing has made the physician, Dr. W. French Anderson, 54, one of the world's first genetic surgeons.
This Thursday, if all goes as planned, the child will be back in Bethesda for her sixth transfusion of genetically engineered cells. The following day, Anderson will give an update of her status before the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee at the National Institutes of Health, the official Government body that oversees his research. After months of guarded optimism, the physicians caring for her are finally ready to claim the child has been helped. Anderson, chief of molecular hematology at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, will announce that "gene therapy has worked."
 THE ERA OF GENE THERAPY OFFICIALLY BEGAN ON Sept. 14, 1990. Droopy-eyed from a night of worried wakefulness, Anderson joined two colleagues from the National Cancer Institute, Drs. R. Michael Blaese and Kenneth W. Culver, in a medical procedure that on the surface looked no more complicated than an ordinary blood transfusion. Over the course of about 30 minutes, the 4-year-old received one billion of her own white blood cells, which had been treated to contain the ADA gene that she was missing -- the absence of which led to her rare condition. An hour later she was wandering around the hospital playroom and eating M&M's.
An important second step occurred on Jan. 29, when two dying patients -- a 29-year-old woman and a 42-year-old man -- became the first to try gene therapy as a way to fight cancer. (Another ADA deficiency patient, a 9-year-old girl, began treatment two days later.) If genes prove useful for cancer treatment, the potential applications for this technique will go far beyond those rare disorders caused by a single defective gene -- disorders such as hemophilia, sickle-cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy -- to include conditions that are not strictly genetic at all, such as heart disease and AIDS.
How genes have been manipulated to help these first four patients is largely a story of scientific ingenuity. After years of peering into cells and figuring out how they work, scientists are now able to arrange and rearrange the basic building blocks of life, to maneuver them into more functional configurations. But it's also a story about politics and people. The technology of genetic engineering has been subject to an unprecedented level of public scrutiny because it involves tinkering with the chemicals that define us as human beings. At each stage of a research plan, the molecular geneticist is called before committees of ethicists, physicians and other scientists and forced to defend his work. The scientist who masters this process is the one whose work will be approved.
That is why French Anderson has excelled -- not only because he knows the science, but because he knows all the political players and all the regulatory hoops. He spends all his time thinking about his next move; to Anderson, the whole thing is like a gigantic game of chess. "This is what I do," he says. "I eat and sleep and breathe gene therapy 24 hours a day."
As the nation's leading genetic surgeon, Anderson has been called upon to address many of the fears and uncertainties that surround this brave new technology. Did he rush ahead too early with an experiment before it was fit for humans, just so he could say he did it first? Did he start with the wrong patient, since a less extreme drug therapy for the child's condition already exists? Is he leading us down a slippery slope toward a new era of eugenics, when scientists try to manipulate genes to create a disease-free Master Race?
Anderson answers questions like these with a strained patience. "Of equal importance to having the scientific community accept gene therapy," he says, "is having the public accept it." Like any visionary with a radical new idea, Anderson has applied mule-headed determination to force a sluggish society into its rendezvous with the future. But in a field as technical as genetics, a self-professed zealot like Anderson is not simply a catalyst for change. He is also called upon to summarize for the rest of us its potential benefits and risks.
It's not an easy role. Try as he might to explain gene therapy dispassionately to the people who must judge him now -- his peers reviewing his proposals, the politicians considering laws to restrict genetic tinkering, the patients on whom he wants to experiment -- Anderson's bias is obvious; he can barely conceal his enthusiasm. When he talks about human gene therapy, the trim, silver-haired scientist in the white lab coat starts bubbling over like a little boy.
The theory behind gene therapy is simple: treat a patient whose cells lack a particular gene by giving the missing gene to the cells. But it's harder than it sounds.
The first problem is, how do you get the gene into the cell? The cell has an elaborate defense mechanism, encased as it is in a cell membrane that is all but impenetrable. Fifteen years ago, scientists tried altering the cell membrane with chemicals, electricity, even brute force. Some reasoned that one way to get genes into a cell nucleus would be by mimicking the methods used by nature's own best invader, the virus. In the early 1980's, a young researcher named Richard C. Mulligan, now at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed an efficient way to render a virus noninfectious -- by removing most of its own genes -- and to splice into it the genes he wanted to transport into human cells. The virus, although now harmless, still retained its ability to get inside the cell and to integrate its genetic cargo into the cell's genes.
Mulligan started work on a class of viruses called retroviruses, which are now the most popular tools in gene manipulation. All retroviruses -- the most notorious of which is the AIDS virus -- have in common the ability to penetrate the cell nucleus and insert retroviral DNA into the cell's own chromosomes. They are smaller than most other viruses and, unlike most other viruses, they usually do not kill the cells they infect.
After years of lab manipulations -- in which the virus's inner workings were stripped away bit by bit -- the retroviruses now used in gene therapy have been reduced to shells for carrying foreign genes and getting them into the cell's nucleus. They are called retroviral vectors, from the Latin "to carry." They are little more than stripped-down conveyor belts for genes.
The retroviral vector has the desired gene spliced directly into its nucleus. Then begins the process known as transduction -- Anderson rejects the more common term, infection, as "too emotive" -- in which the cells designated to receive the gene are mixed with the gene-boosted vector in a laboratory culture dish. For most of the cells that are the targets of the retroviral vector, such as the white blood cells called lymphocytes, it takes no more than a few hours for the viruses to get inside.
The choice of target cell is an important one in gene therapy. For the patients treated so far, only lymphocytes have been used. But for a long time, scientists expected that the first target cells would be the stem cells, cells of the bone marrow that mature into lymphocytes.
Unlike lymphocytes, which have a life span of a few months, stem cells last forever. They give rise not only to lymphocytes but to all the other cells of the circulatory system: red blood cells, plasma cells, macrophages. It was thought that insertion of a needed gene into a stem cell would guarantee that all cells derived from that stem cell for the rest of the patient's life would have the new gene, too.
But stem cells turned out to be wily targets. During the mid-1980's, stem cells proved to be all but impossible to find, much less to transduce. Less than one bone marrow cell in 10,000 is a stem cell, and there was no good way to separate stem cells from the others. In addition, transduction occurs only in cells that are dividing, which stem cells rarely do. The odds against a retroviral vector actually getting through to a stem cell seemed to be enormous.
With the science at an impasse, Anderson decided to concentrate on politics. Even though he had no precise plan for inserting a gene into a human being, he wanted practice dealing with the regulatory machinery already in place to oversee gene therapy once it became feasible. This is where the politics of regulation comes in -- where French Anderson removes his lab coat and dons the three-piece suit of the Government bureaucrat.
On the wall of Anderson's cramped office at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute are six long rows of framed black-and-white glossy photographs, signed the way celebrities' are, of the people who have worked in his laboratory since 1968. (One framed photo is of a rhesus monkey; a student put it there years ago as a joke.) The young men and women in the photographs came through the lab as technicians, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and have risen over the years to senior positions in industry and academia.
Other scientists decorate their offices with photos of themselves shaking hands with famous people. Anderson could have done that, too. He has become a familiar figure on Capitol Hill, on a first-name basis with the lawmakers who will help determine the future of gene therapy. His Congressional appearances are featured regularly on television news shows, and he's so hounded by reporters that he recently asked his agency's press officer to stop granting interviews for a while. Last October, after declining two previous invitations, he and his wife finally went to their first state dinner at the White House.
It is of symbolic importance that Anderson chooses to display photographs of his lab workers rather than of himself rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous. To him, science is a collective enterprise, and any of the success he's had must be shared with those people in his photo gallery. But behind the scenes, rubbing shoulders with powerful nonscientists is exactly what he has learned to do. In fact, his ability to rub shoulders effectively might be why gene therapy was ever able to get off the ground.
"If there hadn't been someone as conscientious and cooperative as French moving this along," says Dr. Henry Miller, director of the office of biotechnology for the Food and Drug Administration, "this line of research might not have taken place at all." Miller, whose agency must join the National Institutes of Health in approving all federally funded human gene therapy procedures, uses words like "saintly" and "fanatical" in describing Anderson. Alexander Capron, a member of the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee -- the first of several national review bodies that now must approve every gene-transfer experiment involving human beings -- agrees that Anderson almost single-handedly moved gene therapy through the regulatory labyrinth to the point of acceptability. "For a serious scientist to have mastered the bureaucratic review process is extremely unusual," says Capron, co-director of the Pacific Center for Health Policy and Ethics at the University of Southern California.
To Anderson, though, there is nothing remarkable about this skill; it is all part of the elaborate chess match. Since he was 16 years old, long before he or anyone else really understood what genes do, Anderson was determined to become a genetic surgeon. In high-school in Tulsa, Okla., he was such a brilliant student that his teachers took his test scores off the grading curve so his classmates wouldn't hate him. When he applied to Harvard in 1953 -- the same year that James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA -- he already knew what his life's work would be. "I want to understand disease at the molecular level," he wrote on his application.
Along the way, Anderson worked beside some leading lights in molecular biology: with Francis Crick himself, and with Marshall Nirenberg, who helped decipher the genetic code. Now Anderson sees his scientific role in part to serve as a mentor for the next generation of molecular geneticists. The only time he travels these days is to visit labs where scientists are preparing research proposals that are headed for Federal review, trying to guide them through the regulatory hurdles that he has already faced.
At home, Anderson and his wife, Kathryn -- vice chairman of surgery at Children's National Medical Center in Washington -- lead a quiet life. The last play they saw together was in 1967; the last movie they saw was "Amadeus." They have no children, having decided early on to devote themselves to their careers. The only nonscience activity Anderson takes any pleasure in is tae kwon do, a Korean martial art in which he holds a black belt. In 1976, he was the official physician for the United States team at the Olympics in Seoul, and he still teaches a weekly class on the N.I.H. campus.
Dealing with people is a crucial part of Anderson's job, but it's not a skill that comes naturally to him. He describes himself as a "weird" child, who at the age of 8 or 9 preferred reading college textbooks to playing with other kids. "I didn't see the point," he says. "Everyone else was stupid."
When Anderson was in fifth grade, his parents and teachers insisted that he try harder at making friends. So he did. He went into the project wholeheartedly, even switching from his first name, William, to his middle, French, as a way of reinventing himself. By the seventh grade, he was the most popular boy in school and was elected the president of his class.
The ability he cultivated to relate to people has had a political impact. Some of his colleagues say it was his personal shepherding of his proposals through the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee of the National Institutes of Health that allowed the nation's first experiments in this new field to proceed. Anderson has been directly involved in all three of the experiments approved to date: a gene-transfer experiment involving cancer patients, the gene therapy experiment for ADA deficiency and the gene therapy experiment for malignant melanoma.
The political maneuvering began in March 1988, when Anderson and Michael Blaese approached Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute with an idea they thought would help them all -- and ultimately further the cause of gene therapy. They wanted to piggyback gene-transfer technology onto Rosenberg's successful anticancer techniques. They wanted, as Anderson puts it, "to start with a target cell we knew we could hit" -- the cells that Rosenberg was working with.
Rosenberg's name was already a household word because of his widely publicized success with "adoptive immunotherapy," a cancer treatment that involves culturing huge quantities of a patient's own natural cancer-fighting cells -- tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TIL cells. Anderson and Blaese's idea was to add a genetically engineered virus to the TIL cells before giving them back to patients. The project would begin by simply tacking on a gene that would tag the TIL cells, to help trace their progress through the body. This would be followed by insertion of a therapeutic anticancer gene.
In the three years since then, just about everything has gone according to plan, though sometimes at a slower pace than Anderson had anticipated. In May 1989, the three scientists treated the first of 10 cancer patients with gene-engineered TIL cells -- the gene-tracing experiment. Then, in September 1990, Anderson, Blaese and Culver began the ADA deficiency experiment -- the first time genes were transferred into a human being for a therapeutic, rather than purely informational, purpose. And in January 1991, gene therapy was used for the first time to treat cancer, when two melanoma patients received immune-system cells that had been beefed up with the gene for a potent anticancer substance called tumor necrosis factor. The same month, the 9-year-old girl with ADA deficiency also started treatment. On April 15, she is scheduled to receive her third infusion, but it will be months before anyone knows if it's worked.
The treatment of human beings is, as Anderson is quick to acknowledge, the ultimate test. "If we goof up now," he says, "all our critics will have a field day."
 THOSE CRITICS HAVE been waiting in the wings for over a decade, ever since early efforts at treatment -- conducted without official sanction -- erupted into an international scandal.
Dr. Martin Cline, at the time a leading molecular geneticist at the University of California at Los Angeles, applied for permission to insert new genes into patients with beta-thalassemia, a blood disorder whose exact genetic origin was unknown at the time. U.C.L.A. denied permission, saying the animal data were insufficient to justify trying it on human beings. Without informing anyone, Cline went abroad to do the human experiments in Italy and Israel. When his action came to light, Cline was sternly disciplined by the National Institutes of Health and by U.C.L.A.
After the Cline debacle, "people were gun-shy," Anderson recalls. That is why elaborate Federal review procedures, concluding with review by the directors of the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, were put into place: to assure the public that it couldn't happen again.
"The public concern over gene therapy has always been over the issue of playing God," says Alexander Capron. "The fear was that you start by treating a few genetic diseases, but once you have the technology you move on to altering human capabilities and producing inheritable changes."
As a result, almost everyone involved in gene therapy wants to limit its use to the correction of genetic flaws -- and to prohibit experiments involving insertion of new and supposedly better genetic traits. Anderson recoils at the suggestion that this technology could be used for what is called "enhancement engineering," making an individual taller or smarter or blonder. He thinks the procedures now in place to limit which experiments can be done -- at least those using Federal funds -- are sufficient to keep enhancement engineering at bay.
Many critics, including some researchers, want to limit gene therapy even more strictly, to the treatment only of the somatic (body) cells of individuals currently suffering from genetic disease. They want to prohibit manipulations of an individual's germ cells (eggs or sperm), including experiments designed to prevent genetic disease in succeeding generations.
Though germ-cell gene therapy might seem like the ultimate in preventive medicine, critics focus on its darker side. It would permanently change the gene pool of the species -- no doubt with some totally unpredictable results. "Are we wise enough to ignore millions of years of evolution, which has brought us to the point of having these recessive traits?" asks Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington and the most visible critic of gene therapy.
By eliminating all problem genes, Rifkin says, scientists may unwittingly eliminate some traits that are actually beneficial. The recessive gene for sickle-cell anemia, for instance, is known to cause problems only for people who inherit it from both parents. A single sickle-cell gene has a surprise benefit: it conveys a resistance to malaria. Similar benefits may account for the existence of other recessive genes as well, which to the untutored eye seem only detrimental.
A few critics think it's too early to begin gene therapy. Richard Mulligan of the Whitehead Institute is the most prominent among them. Mulligan also sits on the Human Gene Therapy Subcommittee, and is the only member to have voted against Anderson's ADA deficiency experiment. He calls it "technically and scientifically a bad idea."
According to Mulligan, Anderson decided to transduce the patient's lymphocytes instead of stem cells for primarily "tactical" reasons, because the subcommittee had already approved a gene-transfer experiment using lymphocytes. But, he says, the only real way to cure ADA deficiency is by transducing bone marrow stem cells. By switching to lymphocytes, Mulligan says, Anderson compromised his patient's chance of a cure. "There's no way they'll ever get the results they say they'll get," he says.
Anderson's supporters accuse Mulligan of professional jealousy. He works in the same small field of research that Anderson does; maybe he wishes he had been first. Mulligan laughs at the suggestion. "I don't feel as though I'm a scientific competitor," he says. "The joke going around my laboratory is that French isn't even the first to do gene therapy; Martin Cline was the first. To be the second and to fail is no big deal. I'd rather be the fifth or sixth or seventh, and be the first to succeed."
 CONTEMPORARY scientists not only have to deal with the gritty realities of public debate and bureaucratic regulation, many of them are also getting involved in a world that is even more alien to them than politics: the world of business.
Anderson is now negotiating that hazardous terrain. Two years ago, he entered into a formal affiliation with a new biotechnology company, Genetic Therapy Inc. -- familiarly known as G.T.I. -- that had been started by Wallace Steinberg, a venture capitalist from Edison, N.J. This type of public-private partnership between Government scientists and private corporations had been encouraged as far back as 1986, when Congress passed the Technology Transfer Act to facilitate the marketing of Government inventions. At the time, the feeling in Congress was that many potentially useful discoveries were languishing in Government labs because no one could make a profit from a Government-held patent. Without a profit motive, what company would be willing to invest the millions usually required to bring a new invention to the marketplace?
The solution was the CRADA (an acronym for Cooperative Research and Development Agreement), which allows companies to hold licensing rights to patents held by Government agencies. Anderson was the first scientist at the National Institutes of Health to have a major CRADA with a private company; now, more than 150 others do as well.
Genetic Therapy has its headquarters 15 minutes from Bethesda, in a newly remodeled building with spacious laboratories housing 35 scientists. Anderson spends every Wednesday there, meeting with G.T.I. scientists, executives and board members. Someday this affiliation could make him, if not a rich man, at least a more financially secure one. Government regulations prohibit him from owning stock in the company, or from serving as a paid consultant or a corporate officer. But under the CRADA, Anderson can receive 15 percent of the royalties on patents he co-owns with Genetic Therapy, up to $100,000 a year.
Such financial payoffs are all far in the future, though. To date, the company has provided Anderson with little more than chocolate doughnuts and tea for his Wednesday meetings. (Recently Anderson decided even that looked bad, and started paying, retroactively, for his own doughnuts.) In November, the company wrote its first check to the Government under the CRADA agreement, in the amount of $10,000 for exclusive licensing rights on three patents the company will co-own with the National Institutes of Health. Anderson's share on that payment came to about $400.
The company's value will no doubt increase enormously if it can meet the next challenge to gene therapy: building a better vector. G.T.I. scientists are now working to develop an injectable viral vector, a sort of "smart bomb" for gene delivery that heads straight to the spot on the chromosome where the new gene belongs.
"When you have to remove cells and treat them in the lab and return them to the patient," Anderson says, "you can only do gene therapy at a handful of medical centers. The ideal will be when a nurse can grab a syringe down from the shelf and inject genes into whoever needs them."
Once an injectable vector is perfected, says Anderson, the possibilities for gene therapy expand. He and other molecular geneticists are conducting experiments that would broaden its use beyond the treatment of genetic diseases to the treatment of some of the nation's leading killers. Among them:
 Cancer -- Anderson envisions a time when scientists will use a "suicide gene" to make cancer cells more responsive to treatment. If a gene for drug sensitivity can be inserted into tumor cells, then exposure to that drug may cause the gene-engineered cells selectively to self-destruct.
 Cardiovascular disease -- Current surgical treatment of blocked blood vessels may involve insertion of a tiny stent, a piece of metal that physically holds the vessel open. An alternative treatment is bypass surgery, in which a new vessel, known as a vascular graft, is inserted to replace a clogged one. But in a significant number of both these implants, blood clots eventually develop. Scientists in Anderson's lab are trying to coat both types of implants with cells containing the gene for TPA, a natural clot dissolver, to avoid this complication of surgery.
 High cholesterol -- Anderson's colleagues are also trying to develop neo-organs, structures made of artificial material that can receive gene-engineered cells. Among the most promising are neo-organs placed near the liver, into which are inserted liver cells containing a gene that attracts cholesterol. Connected to the liver by a network of new blood vessels, this neo-organ could pull excess cholesterol from the bloodstream -- where it does its cardiovascular damage -- into the liver for excretion.
 AIDS -- Anderson is collaborating with Dr. Robert C. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute to treat AIDS patients with the gene for soluble CD4, a protein that lies on the surface of the lymphocytes. The AIDS virus ordinarily attaches to the CD4 protein as a first step in its destruction of the immune system cells. If enough mock CD4 can be kept circulating in the bloodstream, these decoys may snare the AIDS virus and keep it from getting to the lymphocytes at all.
It is too early to tell whether the first gene therapy patient is "cured." Indeed, "cure" isn't even the goal of gene therapy for this child, or for the other ADA deficiency patient. At best, Anderson expects to put them on the schedule of gene-boosted infusions every few months. Since the experiments began, both children have continued to receive standard care for ADA deficiency: weekly injections of ADA itself, which generally keeps the immune system functioning at about half its normal level. Ultimately, if all goes well, the girls will be able to rely on gene therapy alone and eliminate the weekly shots.
The first patient's father says she's smiling more. This winter, her whole family came down with the flu -- and she was the first to recover. Immune function test results are so encouraging that Anderson believes all these improvements can be traced to the gene therapy. "She has developed antibodies she never had before," Anderson says. "She now has normal, functioning immune cells -- and they are producing human ADA." The number of such cells in the child's bloodstream is far greater than the number of gene-corrected cells she has been given in the last six months. In other words, the ADA-boosted lymphocytes are producing more lymphocytes, and they are functioning normally.
In the spring, Anderson's team will test the child's immune function by giving her some ordinary vaccinations. She has received vaccines before, but her immune system has failed to respond. As for the two cancer patients, they are receiving only very low doses of TNF-producing cells, which are increased incrementally in their twice-weekly infusions. Anderson had not expected to see any improvement yet, and he has not.
 ON THE WALL IN FRENCH ANDERSON's all-purpose meeting room, crammed with a photocopier, fax, computer, coffee maker, journal collection and conference table, is a framed quotation of some lines from "Hamlet":
 
Diseases desperate grown
 By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
 Or not at all.
The definition of "desperate" is a matter of opinion. One thing is sure: Anderson has proved himself willing to devote every waking hour to figuring out how to reverse genetic disease, no matter how "desperate" it seems.
"Should we have waited?" he asks rhetorically about his ADA deficiency experiment. He says it will be years before people can say, in hindsight, whether this was the right time or the wrong time to begin. "If Sept. 14 marks the beginning of successful gene therapy treatments, then we were right not to delay. If patients are harmed and a public backlash occurs, then we were wrong. I believe that we were right."

THE SHADOWS OF CREATION
Dark Matter and the Structure of the Universe.
By Michael Riordan and David N. Schramm.
Illustrated. 277 pp. New York:
W. H. Freeman & Company. $18.95. 
 In 1974 David N. Schramm was part of a team of young up-and-coming astrophysicists who carefully inventoried the contents of the universe and concluded that it would continue to expand into infinity for all eternity. Astronomers have since noticed that spiral galaxies spin so rapidly that a reservoir of dark, unseen matter -- up to 10 times more stuff than the luminous objects we see -- must surround each galaxy to serve as a gravitational glue that keeps the spiraling disks from flying apart.
This dark matter could be composed of just ordinary matter, but in a form that is difficult to detect: possibly a host of failed stars, black holes or nuggets of quark matter. But the story gets more complicated. The most fashionable cosmological theories suggest that our universe may have begun not only with a bang but with a sort of cosmic burp, known as inflation -- a brief instant when space-time did more than expand; it tore outward like a science fiction spaceship on warp drive. In the process, the universe allegedly generated 100 times more dark matter than luminous material. That would provide enough gravitational muscle to bring our expanding universe to a screeching halt many eons from now.
Increasing the universe's mass 100-fold sounds like a lot, but it really isn't -- only "about one hydrogen atom in every 10 cubic meters," note Michael Riordan, a particle physicist and assistant to the president of the Universities Research Association in Washington, and Mr. Schramm, a professor of physics at the University of Chicago. Yet cosmologists know that the Big Bang couldn't have cooked up even that much ordinary stuff. "If inflation is true," the authors write in "The Shadows of Creation," "the bulk of the dark matter is completely unlike normal, garden-variety matter made from quarks."
As the title of the book suggests, these more exotic particles would be "the shadows of creation," born in the fiery Big Bang but not yet seen. Theories of galaxy formation and the distribution of galaxies throughout the universe (which is coming to resemble a sink full of soapsuds) hinge on finding out whether all that extra matter truly surrounds us and, if so, what it is made of. Cosmologists will not rest until they solve this tantalizing puzzle.
Fans of Mr. Riordan's previous book, the splendid "Hunting of the Quark," might expect something similar -- a gripping tale of the search for dark matter told through the experiences of the participants. But he and Mr. Schramm have chosen a far different approach. With its casual references to "cluster-cluster correlations," "adiabatic fluctuations" and "gauge bosons," this work is short on inside stories and long on technical details.
Actually, that is not meant to be a negative comment. Several good books on the dark-matter mystery -- such as "The Dark Side of the Universe" by James Trefil and "The Dark Matter" by Wallace Tucker and Karen Tucker -- have already been published for the lay audience. "The Shadows of Creation" is plainly intended for readers who are scientifically sophisticated, are intrigued by cosmology (the Hollywood of science) and want to forgo the journalistic appetizers and dig right into the scientific meat. The authors serve these readers reasonably well by providing a concise, encyclopedic review of the field and touching on all the topics currently grabbing the science news headlines.
The book is at its best when it talks about ideas in which Mr. Schramm was directly involved. For example, in the late 1970's he and two colleagues closely studied all the nuclear reactions possible in the early universe. Looking over the astrophysical evidence, they could only conclude that there were a limited number of particle types, building blocks of ordinary matter, with which to construct the visible cosmos. More than a decade passed before particle physicists could confirm that discovery on earth with their particle accelerators. It is fascinating to read how the physics of the macrocosm, the universe at large, can serve as such a powerful probe of the physics of the very small.
These limits on what makes up ordinary matter, however, do not rule out the existence of extraordinary matter. The National Science Foundation has taken this idea seriously enough to set up a Center for Particle Astrophysics at the University of California, Berkeley, in hopes of capturing an exotic dark-matter particle. If there is such a creature, finding it could be as momentous as the discoveries of the electron, proton and neutron, maybe more so. This dark matter, unlike the stuff that makes up people and planets, would be the predominant substance of the universe. "So strange is this dark matter," the authors write, "that it may be presumptuous to call it 'matter' at all. It is the aether of today."
The hottest candidates around, hypothetical particles such as photinos and gravitinos, arise in theories that are grounded in a strong belief that the laws of physics display certain symmetries. Will these grand unified theories turn out to be accurate? For medieval thinkers, holding on to the dogma that planetary orbits were perfect circles crippled the advancement of science. The sheer elegance of general relativity's equations, on the other hand, led Einstein to important insights into the nature of gravity. A love of beauty in physics presents both benefits and perils.
Observations and experiments, Mr. Riordan and Mr. Schramm rightly stress, will be the final arbiters. A solution to the dark-matter mystery may add just a few details to the model of the Big Bang and the story of the universe's evolution. But "The Shadows of Creation" helps us understand that an answer also has the potential to alter the entire tale.

HEADLINE: Realtors Say First-Time Buyers Are Back in the Market

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
ON Feb. 28, a ranch house in White Plains went on the market for $315,000.
"Two and a half weeks later we sold it to a couple in their 30's for $296,000," said Nicholas R. Wolff, head of Century 21-Wolff & Son in White Plains. "They were living in an apartment in Manhattan, and they had been looking for a house in Westchester for more than a year. The older couple that sold the house is now interested in buying a larger one in northern Westchester. Everyone came away happy." 
 Although sales of more expensive houses remain slow in the county, brokers say that first-time buyers are being lured into the lower end of the market by the convergence of reduced interest rates and a large inventory of unsold homes priced more realistically than in the past. Residential realtors in Westchester consider the trend a good sign.
 
'A Beneficial Ripple Effect'
 "First-time buyers have a beneficial ripple effect on the market, freeing sellers who want to trade up," said Ralph R. Ragette, president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, a trade group, and president of Ragette Realtors, which has offices in East Chester, Bronxville, Bedford and Yorktown.
The median sales price of existing houses in the Northeast is now $141,200, down from $148,800 in 1989, according to the National Association of Realtors. In Westchester, however, prices already seem to be rising. After declining 12.5 percent last year to $259,000, preliminary figures from the County Board of Realtors indicate that the median sales price for a single-family home in this year's first quarter is $270,000 -- up about 4 percent from the previous quarter.
"Interest rates are lower than they have been in years," said Merritt Mitchell, president of the Westchester County Multiple Listing Service and president of Merritt Associates, with offices in Larchmont, Rye and Greenwich.
Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages, which hovered around 10.5 percent for most of 1990, have dropped since January to 9.3 to 9.75.
 
Brokers See an Upsurge
 "Brokers in all parts of the county have begun to see a significant upsurge in first-time buyers," said P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Board of Realtors.
"What we're seeing is affordable housing in Westchester," said Mr. Mercurio, who also noted that prices for condominiums and co-ops have fallen sharply since 1989. "I'd be surprised if first-time buyers didn't start taking note of the co-op and condo market as well," he said.
Despite the activity among first-timers, however, realtors are still awaiting a revival in sales of higher-priced single-family houses.
"We started giving seminars in all four regions of Westchester early this year," Mr. Mercurio said, "with at least one person from every single realty firm in the county attending. And the general consensus was that houses priced at $300,000 or less are doing quite well, while those in the mid- to high range -- $400,000 to $1 million -- are languishing."
The exception: houses priced at more than $1 million, for which sales remain steady.
"Year in and year out, 20 or so $1 million-plus houses sell every quarter, regardless of what is happening in the rest of the market," Mr. Mercurio said. "If people have money, it doesn't seem to matter what is happening in the rest of the economy."
Mr. Mitchell agreed that houses priced at $1 million and higher sell more readily than those in the next-lower bracket. But, he noted, "it's a small inventory, not much traffic."
And sellers of the most expensive homes must often give ground on their asking prices, Mr. Mitchell said. "A $2.5 million waterfront property, for example, that was on the market for a long time, recently sold for $1.8 million."
Meantime, houses priced from $500,000 to $1 million are not moving, he said, "because a whole group of potential buyers for those houses are gone -- people like those in the financial industry, who got big year-end bonuses."
 
Slow Times for Realtors
 Making matters worse for realtors, Mr. Mitchell said, is that it costs brokers more to market a house when sales are slow.
"The longer a house is on the market, the more expensive it becomes to show it and advertise it," he said. "In good years, it takes about 60 to 90 days to sell a house; now 180 days is the average."
The Westchester real estate market is also being hurt by escalating property taxes, Mr. Mitchell said. "When a house can go up $500 in one year, as is happening all over, then the future of real estate in Westchester is in trouble." Already, the median tax on a $300,000 property in Westchester is $9,000 (although that figure is based on both residential and commercial real estate). In Greenwich, where real estate taxes are lower than in Westchester, Mr. Mitchell said, sales of houses in the upper end of the market are stronger. "Our Greenwich office reports sales in that category are much better than compared to Westchester."
The spurt in real estate activity that began in mid-January, Mr. Ragette said, was the first sign of a turnaround since 1989.
 
The Effect of the Gulf War
 "It's hard to say when you hit bottom but, before January, I have never seen the market so slow since I have been in business," said Mr. Ragette, 39, who has been selling real estate for 21 years.
Economic and political uncertainty helped kill business last year, Mr. Ragette said. "Oddly enough, the minute the war in the gulf started, we found that people started looking at houses. It was as though once the shoe dropped, they returned to normal.
"And three months ago," he said, "people were nervous about their jobs. They were waiting for employers to make a move before they'd even look at a house. But now those who still have their jobs are buying." For some realtors, the long sales slump has already taken its toll. In 1988, there were 400 real estate firms in Westchester; there are now only 350. Some real estate offices consolidated, others dipped into savings to keep their offices afloat, and a number of brokers and salespeople retired or found jobs in other industries.
"The last six months of 1990 were the worst. We could have closed our offices and gone to Florida for all the business we did," Mr. Wolff said. "But we managed to keep all of our 30 salespeople. Many of them have spouses who work in other industries, and that helped. We let one secretary go, but that was about the size of our retrenchment."
 
A Return to Competing Bids
 Mr. Wolff said his business began to pick up in February. And Mr. Ragette said that for the first time in a long time, some buyers are having to compete for houses.
"The manager of our Bedford office reported that over the weekend he had four buyers ready, with checks in hand, to jump in if a deal for a house in Bedford Village fell through," Mr. Ragette said. The house was priced at slightly more than $400,000. "It's an updated three-bedroom 50's ranch with a pool, and it sold in the first hour it came on the market," he said. "We haven't seen multiple offers in a long time."
Some sellers of higher-priced houses, meantime, are trying inventive ways to stimulate buyer interest.
"We have a house listed on North Street in White Plains," Mr. Wolff said. "The seller had it on the market for $1.3 million, and after a year of inactivity, he reduced it to $875,000.
"But the hook here is that he's so interested in selling it that he is advertising that anyone who buys his house, he will buy their house."

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: WILLIAM J. CIBES JR.;
The Budget's Got (Gasp!) an Income Tax

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THE first budget from Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. is a $7.48 billion spending plan that would reduce the sales tax from 8 to 4.25 percent and eliminate the corporate surcharge and taxes on capital gains, interest and dividends. That plan however, would impose an income tax on wages, a tax long resisted by many state legislators, at a flat rate of 6 percent.
Mr. Weicker, a lifelong Republican who ran as an independent last year, caused a stir in the political community when he picked William J. Cibes Jr., a Democrat, as his budget chief. 
 Mr. Cibes, whose formal title is Secretary of Policy and Management, had mounted his own campaign for governor last year, with tax reform, including an income tax on wages, as the main plank in his platform. A professor of political science on leave from Connecticut College, he is a 10-year veteran of the legislature who was co-chairman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
In an interview at his office in Hartford, Mr. Cibes answered questions about tax revision. Here are some excerpts from the conversation.
Q. Has your job of building support for the budget been made any more difficult by the press hounding Governor Weicker for his statement that adding an income tax in a recession was like throwing gasoline on a fire?
A. I think of the three candidates, Weicker was the one who most clearly said everything was on the table. He most clearly said he didn't know the full dimensions of the problem. I think what he was saying was, I am not for an income tax. And I can tell you he was not for, and probably still is not for, an income tax.
It's just that his conclusion, after looking at the numbers, was that the other alternatives would not work. If you just looked at an income tax, it would certainly not be good for the economy. It's got to be part of an overall, balanced program, and the Governor's program certainly is that.
 Q. Is an income tax the only answer this year?
 A. It's never been a panacea, and it isn't this year. It's part of a whole package the Governor has developed. The reduction of the sales tax, elimination of the capital gains, dividends and interest and the deficit financing are all important parts of it. It all fits together. An income tax is what makes possible all of the reductions in taxes which provide for economic development.
 Q. In your own gubernatorial campaign, you advocated a progressive income tax rate. How do you feel about a flat rate?
 A. A lot of people overlook that with the large exemption, $25,000 for a couple, even a flat rate has a fairly progressive effective rate. A family making $30,000, for example, pays taxes at 6 percent on $5,000, or $300, for an effective tax rate of 1 percent. A family making $50,000, making the same computation, the effective tax rate is 3 percent. At $100,000, the effective tax rate is 4.5 percent.
There is a fairly steep progression built into the tax rate because of the large exemption. I should also point out that you have to produce a certain amount of money, and if you move to the progressive rate I was proposing last summer, from 4 to 8 percent, the numbers don't work out.
Q. Things have changed that quickly?
 A. Oh, yes. When I was campaigning last summer, I talked about a maximum $600 million deficit. Now we're talking about $2.4 billion. Things have changed substantially. And a flat tax also makes the state competitive in terms of attracting those people likely to make the decision to move a company to Connecticut. A top rate of 6 percent is where you can go and remain competitive with New York and Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
 Q. Will there have to be more tinkering with the tax structure over the next few years?
 A. One of the nice things about a democracy is those who have been elected can make adjustments in response to the demands of their constituents. I expect any tax structure is going to be adjusted at the margins, just as the first one has been for 40 or 50 years or however long we've had a sales tax. I see continued tinkering to adjust it to what people feel is important, but if you adjust it in a major way, you're going to be losing revenue. You don't wave a magic wand and come up with revenue.
I've been using the "Calvin and Hobbes" cartoon in which Calvin said math was like a religion, it takes a leap of faith to believe you can take two numbers and add them and get one new number. Well, I think math atheism has afflicted a lot of people in Connecticut. You have to look at the numbers, and the numbers don't add up. But the Governor's package makes the numbers add up.
 Q. Was it grating to be the only candidate last year saying tax reform was necessary, and now it appears that will happen?
 A. No. There have been a lot of people who have looked at the revenue structure in this state over the years, and they have argued, and argued aggressively, that things need to be changed. They feel, probably, that they have been prophets as well. From my perspective, I have always been able to look at myself in the mirror each morning, in the campaign and now.
 Q. How likely is an income tax to pass the legislature this year?
 A. I think the chances are improving daily, because it is becoming more and more obvious to those looking at the numbers that no other alternative fits, which was the Governor's conclusion.
 Q. How much does it help, in terms of selling that plan, to have alternative tax packages out there that call for things like taxing utilities?
 A. I think it's helpful in letting people know there aren't very many pleasant alternatives this year, and that other options, other than the Governor's, are worse. I was talking yesterday with another legislator who was telling me about a couple of other packages that might come out. One package would tax financial services, commercial leases, increase the tax on capital gains to 10 percent and increase the tax on dividends and interest to 16 percent. That hardly seems to me a way to stimulate the economy.
Another legislator is working on a package that would expand the base of the corporate tax, by eliminating the dividends exclusion, end the double weighting of the sales tax. All of those things were designed to provide some benefit to business here. That hardly strikes me as a way to make Connecticut attractive and competitive.
 Q. Businesses have been complaining for years that if any more is put on the corporate tax structure, they will begin moving out of state. Is that going to happen?
 A. The short answer is yes. The long answer is, We seem to have already demonstrated that by what we did in 1989, when we expanded the sales tax base, which turned out not to be very productive in terms of revenue. Obviously, there are some other factors -- we're in a recession, or at least a downturn in the economy, and that caused a diminution in tax receipts, so it's hard to sort out all the factors.
 Q. How are you going to sell the income tax to a state where a majority of people still don't believe it's necessary?
 A. The Governor and the Lieutenant Governor are going around the state speaking to people about the dimensions of the problem. Because people are so concerned about their taxes is one reason the Governor did so much cutting on the expenditure side first. We essentially went through the expenditure side for eight weeks before we ever looked at revenues. We went over the prioritization of programs within each agency, looking at 7, 13 and 20 percent cuts and going over each option with the commissioners. There was a really exhaustive consideration of those options.
And the result has been a lot of very upset people because of the cutbacks in expenditures. The Governor has said those are not nice cuts, but the Governor sensed, we all sensed, we had to look at expenditures first. Also, this program provides for a number of tax reductions.
For low- and moderate-income people, the sales-tax rate reduction is a significant benefit; it reverses the pattern of state taxation, which in this state has hit the lower income group hardest, and the highest income groups least.
 Q. Is the three-year plan to finance the deficit too short a period, as some people have alleged?
 A. The Governor is strongly against long-term bonding to deal with this problem, and the rating agencies have also made that clear, that if you don't give any indication of dealing with the problem now, it is going to affect the rating on Connecticut bonds, which has a cost to the taxpayer, too, in terms of interest rates. So you lose money that can otherwise be diverted to programs.
And a lot of people wanted us to deal with it in a shorter period of time. But if you try to deal with it this year, it takes a $750 million bite out of the economy this year when we're struggling to recover from a downturn, which also doesn't make a lot of economic sense. So doing it over three years is a moderate response.
 Q. There has been more of an attempt to rein in the capital budget this year than in a long time, but are there things being put off that perhaps should not be put off?
 A. I think we have to be more careful about what we do bond for. Last year, the legislature -- me -- produced a $1.7 billion bond package. The Thomas Commission pointed out that if we continued to do that, in about eight years we would be beyond any prudent level of debt service, and the things we would have to bond for, we couldn't.
The Governor is recommending about $500 million, and obviously you can't do that without postponing things some people feel are important.
But you have to make some choice, and the Governor did.

HEADLINE: Two Counties Gird to Trim Services

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
BOTH Nassau and Suffolk Counties, reeling from a sluggish economy that has provided less-than-expected tax revenue, are expecting severe cuts in social-service programs under the new state budget.
Even if the state does not meet its April 1 deadline tomorrow, the budget, whenever it is passed, is likely to force the counties to make up differences from the shortfall. Social services are one of the largest areas in the budget, and they are expected to be among the hardest-hit categories. 
 The mood in Albany is one of deep concern, said Mitchell H. Pally, director of legislative and economic affairs for the Long Island Association. Mr. Pally, the business group's chief lobbyist and liaison aide in Albany, noted last week that no decisions had been made on reducing the state budget and expenses.
 "Most people realize that difficult decisions have to be made," he said, "and they don't yet know how to make them. For everyone up there, there is a different opinion, and the interpretation of figures depends on the particular interest group looking at them. The state will have to cut back on expenses, and how this will be spread out is hard to say."
Estimates on the timing for passing the budget are as uncertain as how the cuts will be made, Mr. Pally said. The passage will be between this week and July, but probably between May 1 and May 15, he said.
Facing a gloomy forecast, county officials expect severe financial shortages. Whereas those in Nassau express more of a wait-and-see attitude, the outlook in Suffolk seems more pessimistic.
The cuts will be the same in both counties, but the difference is in how they will be perceived, Suffolk Social Services Commissioner Ruth Brandwein said.
According to Ms. Brandwein, the three main areas of concern are abolishing state financing for Title 20, which provides most of the money for local social services; a cap on long-term medical care and a "lag payment" for reimbursement for the long-term disabled.
Title 20 programs that would be affected by the loss in financing include day care for low-income families, shelters for battered women, foster care, homemaker services, services to prevent domestic violence, child and elderly abuse and counseling.
Services for women and children would be most severely affected, Ms. Brandwein said.
 
Expenses to Rise by $3 Million
 The cap on long-term health care would not affect services, but would greatly affect Suffolk, she said, adding that the county's expenses would increase about $3 million over one year.
The combined factors of hospitals' releasing patients prematurely and a growing elderly population have contributed to an increase in home health care.
Home health-care costs increased 20 percent last year, but now the state wants to control the costs, she said, adding:
"If increases for home health care this year exceed 4.5 percent, the county will have to pay the difference. But Suffolk County doesn't have the money to make up that difference.
" This will mean that there will be pressure to reduce the number of hours of home care, and it will have to be administered more stringently."
In terms of "lag money" for the long-term disabled, there will be a delay in the state reimbursement to the counties, Ms. Brandwein said. The last payment for 1991 will not be made until next year. For Suffolk, that means it will lose $2.3 million until 1992, with each payment subsequently delayed. And that, Ms. Brandwein said, is money that the county will never be able to make up.
"Many people ask why it is happening," she said. "For social services, Federal money for programs has been reduced by more than 70 percent over the past decade.
"At this point, nobody knows what's going to happen, but I'm not optimistic because there's no money at any level of government. It will mean the county's having to cut other services or raise taxes."
The Nassau Social Services Commissioner, Joseph A. D'Elia, said that Nassau had more of a wait-and-see attitude and that the Gulotta administration was collecting contingency plans.
"There are an awful lot of trial balloons going up in Albany, and we don't know yet which groups will be most affected," Mr. D'Elia said. "The impact on the county falls into the unknown."
Deputy Budget Director Pam Grella said it appeared that Nassaumight be looking at a loss of $6 million to $10 million that was not figured in its 1991 budget.
"We could be talking about an additional cost of $4.4 million for Aid to Dependent Children, and up to $5 million in Medicaid," she said. "We don't know where we're going to end up, because things keep changing. The mood in the county is not pessimistic, but realistic. We've been looking at countywide ways to cut back."
 
Thousands of State Mandates
 A major concern is the state mandates, which number in the thousands and whose reimbursements are dictated by the state, Ms. Grella said. The mandates started as partnership agreements, she said, but the state is cutting its reimbursements and leaving the counties to pick up the differences.
"In the Handicapped Children's Program, for example, the state was paying 50 percent and had agreed to increase their share by 5 percent a year," Ms. Grella said. "For 1991, the budgeted percentage from the state was 65 percent, and now they've dropped back to 50. I don't know where they think we're going to get the money."
The only hope for counties is the Legislature, Ms. Grella said. A committee made up of members of the State Association of Counties and representatives from the Governor's Budget Office was recently formed to look at the mandates and try to eliminate some restrictions.
"But a state mandate is a state mandate," Ms. Grella said. "And realistically, we don't expect to see any alleviation in the near future."
Another factor hurting the counties is the slow reimbursement, she said. It often takes nine months to be reimbursed after claims are made, she declared.
"It's a big problem," Ms. Grella said. "And the counties have nobody else to pass their shortfalls on to. The current economy does not help, with more people unemployed and candidates for public assistance. Unfortunately, we're in a very difficult time."
 
Proposed Cuts Called Devastating
 For all local governments, the proposed social-service reductions will be devastating, said the Deputy Suffolk County Executive for Finance, Robert Kurtter.
The cap on long-term medical care mostly affects home care and nursing-home care, he said.
In an effort to help local governments in the late 70's, the state began a phase-in program to pay increasing Medicaid costs. To obtain 50 percent of the financing from the Federal Government, the state and county have to combine to match the other half. The state's plan was to increase its percentage from 25 to 40, leaving the counties to assume 10 percent.
"But the state has now said that long-term care is growing too fast, and it can't pay," Mr. Kurtter said. "They have repealed this phase-in takeover, saying they will only pay up to 4.5 percent growth, and that whatever falls above that is the county's share.
"We don't have the money, and we have no control. These are state-mandated programs, and they are strangling the counties."
In December, the state also rescinded a decision made in 1989 to raise from 50 to 75 percent its share of the costs of the mandated Preschool Handicapped Children's Program.
"In one fell swoop, Suffolk County lost $11 million in that repeal action," Mr. Kurtter said. "We're supposed to be partners with the state, but they are setting mandates, controlling programs and eligibility and then handing us the tab."
The worst-hit sectors are in social services, mental health and probation, Mr. Kurtter said. Some program cuts, he said, are counterproductive, adding that the state, in its attempt to balance a budget, had devastated local governments.
